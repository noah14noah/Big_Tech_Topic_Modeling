And this week, President Trump goes to New York to join other  world leaders there for the first time.  With plenty of hot spots to  discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?  </p><p> Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security  advisor, General H.R. McMaster.  </p><p> General, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p> MCMASTER:  Thanks, Chris, great to be here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  As we say, President Trump speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on  Tuesday, his first time on that stage.  How important does he think the  speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his  doctrine of America First?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously  to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really  three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to  promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote  accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him  to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what  his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but  also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the  sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.   And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this  morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p> The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night,  asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas  lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p> Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from  the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but  it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him  as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.   Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they  do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p> MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global  problem.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.   And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of  a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want  to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat  continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.   We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of  North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long,  drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an  agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p> And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous  oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo  as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the  United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move  with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing,  if necessary, a military option.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached  the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you  get sanctions?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we  can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are  coming to.  </p><p> But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing  militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies  and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not  really much time.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part  of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's  trading partners.  </p><p> Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to  bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p> BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p> MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China.  They're our  single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for  export of goods.  </p><p> General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our  economy.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this  problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work  together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they  can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over  North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in  their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off  all trade with China.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade  in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that  allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their  missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own  people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it  possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key  to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about  having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done  diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him  from pursuing that effort.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that  continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more  vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to  talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations.  But this week,  he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of  the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p> So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to  recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this  talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with  it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right?  Live with  can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so,  a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that  agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated  parts of the agreement by -- </p><p> WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these  breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about  Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the  agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p> So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have  to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president  said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian  regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this  humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p> This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist  organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of  the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad  regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p> And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian  destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their  missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian  network with more and more destructive capability that places all their  neighbors at risk.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is  terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to  continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the  previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London  subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just  this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in  pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only  getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S. </p><p> MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental  things very effectively.  </p><p> The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and  support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks  against us and against our allies.  </p><p> The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they  resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p> And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot  to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to  constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.  </p><p> And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law  enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability  to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and  defeat them.  </p><p> WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that  President Trump has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate  accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions  but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a  reduced commitment.</p><p> Is that true, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided  to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American  people and because it was a bad deal for the environment.  It gave the  worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon  without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p> The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air  on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also  provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and  globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively  within this flawed agreement.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is  open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing  from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if  there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point  they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the  president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you  and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world.  One of the  first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a  regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p> He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as  globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to  double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p> Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the  White House?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the  president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and  agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with  multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president  implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the  interests of the American people.  </p><p> And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to  manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You  know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies  and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying  that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and  advance his own agenda?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the  president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try  to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that  didn't serve the president well.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p> MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean,  these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had  our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council,  and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that  door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p> WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time.  You're a  busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of  course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p> MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the  president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the  Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and  Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a  deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters  worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now  here in Washington?  </p><p> Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.   And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.  </p><p> Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The  most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker --  former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to  DACA or not?  </p><p> And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be  built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very  positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without  insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p> TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I  don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points.  Is there  a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall?  And is there  a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic  understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President  Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details,  without the obvious negotiations that have to follow.  And then, Chuck and  Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a  press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did  exactly that.  </p><p> There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters  of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But  we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we  can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes  DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM  Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.   Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the  president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p> OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the  citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at  that.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about  amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part  of the transaction.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's  genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal  on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could  support?  </p><p> SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a  conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border  security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked  out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p> Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate  questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border?  Two is, what  are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do  with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were  brought to the country illegally?  </p><p> I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve  the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If  you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably  solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and  deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p> But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way  unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point  in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows  everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be  as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border,  does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for  the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for  DREAMers?  </p><p> BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it  doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think.  There are a  lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms  of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that  everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM  Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or  not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats  at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about  that on Air Force One.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to  do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have  to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass  Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to  Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.   But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work  with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief  deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10  years that didn't have Democrats vote for them.  That's part of the work --  that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else  to move forward.  </p><p> So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it  impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not  part of that either.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a  real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and  congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the  left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will  be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator Roy  Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and  applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in  the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray  joined us.  </p><p> Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other  leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey  assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't  shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it  on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President.  That's what American wants.  And the  president said, I'll take it.  </p><p> We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another,  respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a  goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last  two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to  make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we  achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.   It can be done.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance  about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p> And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax  reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate  tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts  based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.  </p><p> Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences,  fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is  all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the  Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment  process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to  some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where  you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p> Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to  achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve  what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with  insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018  midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable  Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in  2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p> When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his  basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a  decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home  pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates  better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where  we should be headed.  </p><p> We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that.  But, you  know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad  to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think  are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there  was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the  acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the  death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the  violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the  shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p> So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a  lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p> BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in  what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders  and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to  figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who  has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p> But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the  community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders  have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson.  This happened before  that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p> The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a  good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top  of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out  in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p> Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's new  search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential  deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p> Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your  question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax  reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty  much where they are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax  reform.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p> I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step  right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction  you're boxed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on  a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to  deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt  Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace,  Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of  townhall.com. </p><p> Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he  wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from  both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump  is doing here, and will it work? </p><p> NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better  dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the  job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston,  terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual  partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p> And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe  we'll do a little more.</p><p> Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their  base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may  be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I  -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because  it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when  they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have  a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p> WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what  are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with  Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare  repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said,  on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what  they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such  big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with  the Democrats? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in  context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan.  With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship  there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the  president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line,  there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there  was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on  the Capitol. </p><p> And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but  Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a  president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with  someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they  are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an  agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people  like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is  actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like  Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to  the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p> WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well,  maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p> PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the  president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the  wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm  going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his  base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly  shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the  president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of  confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of  it up.</p><p> Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get  funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he  rally his base? </p><p> And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these  illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the  contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall  and all? </p><p> Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p> GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure  out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just  interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure  out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the  contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to  be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the  future. Unclear. </p><p> But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the  gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats  agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration  enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for  something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a  victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40  billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of  fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in  the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might  be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or  framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p> WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the  base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction  of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on  DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been  commonly thought to exist? </p><p> BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio  for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened  the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some  trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But,  overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think  that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got  their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board  for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case,  unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p> WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think  is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the  prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p> RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell  you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with  Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership.  You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and  they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is  best for us.</p><p> There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I  heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What  is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses  of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing  for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you  that. </p><p> For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership  who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the  table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in  terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with  Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push  him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that  is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p> WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two  senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy,  on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put  in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is  a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p> BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in  trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift  we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to  now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill,  Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn,  they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p> Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing  taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and  goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a  tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of  reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to  undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what  he wants to do. </p><p> WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p> GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this  big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are  going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in  December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the  majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions  Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p> WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can  keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p> GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the  majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And  Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So  we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think  the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than  they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd  drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice  the dreamers. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p> All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p> When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley,  powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll  bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of  the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the  time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those  accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted  it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to  Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and  Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel.</p><p> Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see  the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these  huge Internet companies? </p><p> GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the  curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they  can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that  having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying  nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are  the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age,  they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you  can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of  billionaires.</p><p> WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy  himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west  there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are  you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p> GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are  small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that  there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have  global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in  effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company  and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal,  they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision,  just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p> WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd  agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet  companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on  Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a  partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet  behemoths? </p><p> BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the  sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now.  Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech  industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is  oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's  private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And  so those are all concerns.</p><p> So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington  and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort  of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p> WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber  hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but  with some guardrails? </p><p> BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with  right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow,  that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's  going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings  coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech  companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet.  Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the  Internet. </p><p> So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is  putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this  is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're  not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason  to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p> WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the  big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The  Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies  has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p> Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk  about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating  FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p> PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So,  look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when  it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which  really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and  presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are  growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p> Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the  leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his  administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you  can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that.  But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning  \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p> I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's  populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and  some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the  same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he  looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration  of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant  like Amazon. </p><p> WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy,  about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't  have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street  does have to pay taxes. </p><p> PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for.  He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be  interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax  reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p> WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p> PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p> WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because,  Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and  that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope  will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion  discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and  lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild  west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p> BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think,  focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in  Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded  to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla  a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having  traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of  Google. </p><p> Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against  conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having  information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about  that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying,  uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this  country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on  both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p> WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich,  because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge  economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington --  obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington  getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p> BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker  raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith  in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is  very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of  innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does  today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one.  And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from  D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p> WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p> GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department  of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American  history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged  by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p> WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p> This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p> Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p> Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the  Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in  pro sports. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream  of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of  derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine,  people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p> WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the  time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's  the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington  Nationals. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head  doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p> WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my  mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose  tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She  examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a  season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p> West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p> WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of  shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of  traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage  quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out  of the game. But in football -- </p><p> WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to  play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p> WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p> WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the  player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I  want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best  interests. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to  doing your job? </p><p> WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and  their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high  regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they  are very trusting, I think. </p><p> WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries,  but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the  field. </p><p> WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a  mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and  saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and  they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p> WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body.

And this week, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>goes to New York to join other world leaders there for the first time. With plenty of hot spots to discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?</p><p>Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security advisor, <person><nameText>General H.R. McMaster.</nameText></person></p><p>General, welcome back to <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>SUNDAY.</p><p>MCMASTER: Thanks, Chris, great to be here.</p><p>WALLACE: As we say, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, his first time on that stage. How important does he think the speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his doctrine of America First?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really three things. First is to protect the American people, the second is to promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote accountability and sovereignty. And in those three things will allow him to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one. And that, of course, is North Korea. The president tweeted about that this morning. Let's put it up on the screen.</p><p>The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night, asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad.</p><p>Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from the president before or is that a new one?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him as Rocket Man. But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from. Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. But let me --</p><p>MCMASTER: As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global problem.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCMASTER: We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road. And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of a military option, there is a military option.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: General, what does that mean, out of road? The fact is you want to get sanctions more time. You're not about to go to war.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have. We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long, drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.</p><p>And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo as the new normal. And this regime is so close now to threatening the United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing, if necessary, a military option.</p><p>WALLACE: So, how do you draw that line? How do you decide we've reached the point that we have to move to a military option now? How long do you get sanctions?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this. So, we can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are coming to.</p><p>But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies and partners to be as effective as we can. And what we recognize is not really much time.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. The administration -- I want to pick up on one part of that. The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's trading partners.</p><p>Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We will use economic sanctions to bring North Korea to the table.</p><p>BRET BAIER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: You're saying stopping trade with China?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Stopping trade with anybody. Nobody would be off the table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China. They're our single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for export of goods.</p><p>General, we're not about to cut off trade with China. It would crater our economy.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work together to resolve it. So, of course, we China to help as much as they can. You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over North Korea. And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.</p><p>WALLACE: But, I mean, let's be serious here. We're not going to cut off all trade with China.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own people.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key to his survival is to have a nuclear capability? He talked this week about having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him from pursuing that effort.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another subject. The president is also going to talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations. But this week, he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal. He didn't do that.</p><p>So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement. I know he has to recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, we have to see what live with it means, right? Live with can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability. And so, a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that agreement. It is under-enforced now. We know Iran has already violated parts of the agreement by --</p><p>WALLACE: But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these breaches that Iran has then corrected. But what does that tell you about Iranian behavior? They're not just walking up to the line on the agreement. They're crossing the line at times.</p><p>So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal. It is -- as the president said -- it is the worst deal. It gave all these benefits to the Iranian regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.</p><p>This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.</p><p>And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that. Their missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian network with more and more destructive capability that places all their neighbors at risk.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is terror. The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to continue its war on terror. Here's what he had to say this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London subway this week. That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just this year. And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental things very effectively.</p><p>The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks against us and against our allies.</p><p>The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they resource these kinds of operations.</p><p>And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology. And this has a lot to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.</p><p>And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and defeat them.</p><p>WALLACE: There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a reduced commitment.</p><p>Is that true, sir?</p><p>MCMASTER: No, it's false. That's a false report. The president decided to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American people and because it was a bad deal for the environment. It gave the worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon without significantly reducing those levels.</p><p>The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and globally. And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively within this flawed agreement.</p><p>WALLACE: So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?</p><p>MCMASTER: He's out of the Paris Climate Accord. What he said, the door is open. If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.</p><p>WALLACE: OK. One final area. It's widely known in Washington that you and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world. One of the first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a regular official member of the NSC.</p><p>He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as globalists. He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to double down in Afghanistan.</p><p>Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the White House?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with multiple options. And then, based on his decisions, to help the president implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the interests of the American people.</p><p>And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda. You know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies and strategies that are for the American people.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker. Are you saying that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and advance his own agenda?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the president well in bringing him multiple options. There were some who try to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that didn't serve the president well.</p><p>WALLACE: That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?</p><p>MCMASTER: I think this has been too hyped on one individual. I mean, these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen. I mean, we had our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council, and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.</p><p>WALLACE: General McMaster, thank you. Thanks for your time. You're a busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.</p><p>MCMASTER: It's always a pleasure, Chris. Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you. And we'll be watching the president's speech, of course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.</p><p>MCMASTER: Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the president's move to cut deals with Democrats. How long will it affect the Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p>WALLACE: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters worried. So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now here in Washington?</p><p>Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat. And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.</p><p>Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington. The most immediate question, does <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>have a deal with speaker -- former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to DACA or not?</p><p>And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The wall is going to be built, and it will be funded a little bit later.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: It was a very, very positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.</p><p>TRUMP: They cannot obstruct the wall. The wall, to me, is vital. If I don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points. Is there a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall? And is there a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP: Well, there's a basic understanding. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President Thursday night. They came to a basic understanding, without the details, without the obvious negotiations that have to follow. And then, Chuck and Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to. They did exactly that.</p><p>There was great pushback from the right. They didn't like the parameters of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since. But we are going forward. We are going forward with the understanding that we can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection. Those are the two pillars of this understanding.</p><p>WALLACE: And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?</p><p>DURBIN: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: That's pretty brief.</p><p>OK. Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday. Let's take a look at that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're not talking about amnesty at all. We have not talked about amnesty. There will be no amnesty. We're not talking about that as part of the transaction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's genuine confusion here in Washington. Do you believe that there is a deal on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could support?</p><p>SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI: Well, I think there's a desire to come to a conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked out, another thing that he mentioned.</p><p>Well, the details here matter. You know, it's always been three separate questions in my view. One is, how do you secure the border? Two is, what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country? And three, what you do with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were brought to the country illegally?</p><p>I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here. If you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.</p><p>But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point in the future say the border is now operationally secure. That allows everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border, does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for DREAMers?</p><p>BLUNT: It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think. There are a lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that everybody else takes? How long would you have to be here under the DREAM Act (ph)? There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or not <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats at the expense of Republicans. Here is what the president had to say about that on Air Force One.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to do more work. If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to Democrats and look for some votes?</p><p>BLUNT: Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate. But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work with you to get most things done. The tenures -- I was either the chief deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10 years that didn't have Democrats vote for them. That's part of the work -- that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else to move forward.</p><p>So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not part of that either.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a real -- not permanent, but working alliance between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and congressional Democrats? And what you say to those members -- folks on the left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP: Well, of course, there will be people on the right and left who will be critical. But Senator Roy Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work. I have joined him and applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in the United States on a bipartisan basis. Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray joined us.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President. That's what American wants. And the president said, I'll take it.</p><p>We did it. And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another, respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a goal. Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate. It can be done.</p><p>WALLACE: But there are some differences. I mean, you talked for instance about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.</p><p>And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax reform. The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate tax, Democrats opposed both. The president talks about paying for tax cuts based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.</p><p>Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences, fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?</p><p>DURBIN: Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to some degree. That's where you get the best legislation and that's where you get something the American people can trust.</p><p>Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to achieve it. We proved that with repeal and replace. That did not achieve what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018 midterm elections? You have the president out on the stump recently with North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp. This is somebody who was a vulnerable Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in 2018. The president is saying nice things about her.</p><p>When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?</p><p>BLUNT: Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home pay. A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where we should be headed.</p><p>We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that. But, you know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think are important parts of the tax package. That's not a good way to start.</p><p>WALLACE: Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight. People angry about the acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the death of a drug -- black drug suspect. I know everyone opposes the violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the shooting and appalled by the verdict.</p><p>So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a lot of people in the African-American community?</p><p>BLUNT: Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in what the chiefs are doing. I also talked to a number of community leaders and African-American pastors. I do think this is a place where we have to figure out how to come together. You do have to accept what the judge who has the obligation to look at this case determined.</p><p>But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson. This happened before that happened. And we just need to continue to watch this.</p><p>The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both. We'll stay on top of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out in Congress. Thank you all, gentlemen.</p><p>Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>new search for votes on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?</p><p>Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>reaching across the aisle on tax reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty much where they are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway.</p><p>I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction you're boxed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of townhall.com.</p><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is doing here, and will it work?</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston, terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal.</p><p>And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe we'll do a little more.</p><p>Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p>WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said, on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with the Democrats?</p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan. With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line, there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on the Capitol.</p><p>And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to the conservative movement or Republican ideology.</p><p>WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well, maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p>PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit.</p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of it up.</p><p>Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he rally his base?</p><p>And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall and all?</p><p>Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p>GUY BENSON, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the future. Unclear.</p><p>But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40 billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or framed as a wall or a physical barrier.</p><p>WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been commonly thought to exist?</p><p>BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But, overall, there was a sense that they trust <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>that they think that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case, unless it is egregiously bad.</p><p>WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the prospects for a deal on tax reform?</p><p>RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership. You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is best for us.</p><p>There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you that.</p><p>For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p>WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is a guess whether or not it's going to happen.</p><p>BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill, Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it.</p><p>Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what he wants to do.</p><p>WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker?</p><p>GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p>WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can keep the debt ceiling going till March.</p><p>GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice the dreamers.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington.</p><p>All right, panel, we have to take a break here.</p><p>When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley, powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these huge Internet companies?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age, they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of billionaires.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are you saying put government clamps on it?</p><p>GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal, they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision, just to surface (ph) the information.</p><p>WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet behemoths?</p><p>BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now. Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And so those are all concerns.</p><p>So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else.</p><p>WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but with some guardrails?</p><p>BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow, that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet. Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the Internet.</p><p>So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power.</p><p>WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies has just skyrocketed in the last few years.</p><p>Julie, where are <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and his administration on this? You talk about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation.</p><p>PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So, look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are growing strong and are dominating on the global stage.</p><p>Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that. But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account.</p><p>I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant like Amazon.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy, about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street does have to pay taxes.</p><p>PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for. He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package.</p><p>WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p>PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p>WALLACE: That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because, Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley.</p><p>You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley.</p><p>BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think, focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of Google.</p><p>Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying, uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on both sides, rather, start to dig in.</p><p>WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich, because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington -- obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington getting more involved in regulation of the Internet?</p><p>BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one. And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well.</p><p>WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker.</p><p>GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate.</p><p>This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it.</p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in pro sports.</p><p>WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine, people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better.</p><p>WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington Nationals.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL?</p><p>WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my mind. I -- I never think of myself as different.</p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle.</p><p>West told us how different injuries are in the two sports.</p><p>WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage quickly.</p><p>WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out of the game. But in football --</p><p>WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly.</p><p>WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p>WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best interests.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to doing your job?</p><p>WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they are very trusting, I think.</p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries, but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the field.</p><p>WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed. I'm not around my team. I -- and they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side.</p><p>WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom noticed.</p><p>WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p>WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p>WALLACE: Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has developed a much stricter policy on concussions.</p><p>WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been.</p><p>WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win championships in both football and baseball.</p><p>WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It's a pentacle, and you can't get any better than that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets hurt and relaying that information to her.</p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week.

And this week, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>goes to New York to join other world leaders there for the first time. With plenty of hot spots to discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?</p><p>Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security advisor, <person><nameText>General H.R. McMaster.</nameText></person></p><p>General, welcome back to <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>SUNDAY.</p><p>MCMASTER: Thanks, Chris, great to be here.</p><p>WALLACE: As we say, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, his first time on that stage. How important does he think the speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his doctrine of America First?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really three things. First is to protect the American people, the second is to promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote accountability and sovereignty. And in those three things will allow him to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one. And that, of course, is North Korea. The president tweeted about that this morning. Let's put it up on the screen.</p><p>The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night, asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad.</p><p>Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from the president before or is that a new one?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him as Rocket Man. But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from. Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. But let me --</p><p>MCMASTER: As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global problem.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCMASTER: We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road. And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of a military option, there is a military option.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: General, what does that mean, out of road? The fact is you want to get sanctions more time. You're not about to go to war.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have. We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long, drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.</p><p>And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo as the new normal. And this regime is so close now to threatening the United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing, if necessary, a military option.</p><p>WALLACE: So, how do you draw that line? How do you decide we've reached the point that we have to move to a military option now? How long do you get sanctions?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this. So, we can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are coming to.</p><p>But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies and partners to be as effective as we can. And what we recognize is not really much time.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. The administration -- I want to pick up on one part of that. The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's trading partners.</p><p>Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We will use economic sanctions to bring North Korea to the table.</p><p>BRET BAIER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: You're saying stopping trade with China?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Stopping trade with anybody. Nobody would be off the table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China. They're our single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for export of goods.</p><p>General, we're not about to cut off trade with China. It would crater our economy.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work together to resolve it. So, of course, we China to help as much as they can. You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over North Korea. And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.</p><p>WALLACE: But, I mean, let's be serious here. We're not going to cut off all trade with China.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own people.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key to his survival is to have a nuclear capability? He talked this week about having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him from pursuing that effort.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another subject. The president is also going to talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations. But this week, he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal. He didn't do that.</p><p>So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement. I know he has to recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, we have to see what live with it means, right? Live with can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability. And so, a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that agreement. It is under-enforced now. We know Iran has already violated parts of the agreement by --</p><p>WALLACE: But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these breaches that Iran has then corrected. But what does that tell you about Iranian behavior? They're not just walking up to the line on the agreement. They're crossing the line at times.</p><p>So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal. It is -- as the president said -- it is the worst deal. It gave all these benefits to the Iranian regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.</p><p>This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.</p><p>And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that. Their missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian network with more and more destructive capability that places all their neighbors at risk.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is terror. The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to continue its war on terror. Here's what he had to say this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London subway this week. That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just this year. And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental things very effectively.</p><p>The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks against us and against our allies.</p><p>The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they resource these kinds of operations.</p><p>And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology. And this has a lot to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.</p><p>And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and defeat them.</p><p>WALLACE: There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a reduced commitment.</p><p>Is that true, sir?</p><p>MCMASTER: No, it's false. That's a false report. The president decided to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American people and because it was a bad deal for the environment. It gave the worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon without significantly reducing those levels.</p><p>The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and globally. And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively within this flawed agreement.</p><p>WALLACE: So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?</p><p>MCMASTER: He's out of the Paris Climate Accord. What he said, the door is open. If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.</p><p>WALLACE: OK. One final area. It's widely known in Washington that you and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world. One of the first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a regular official member of the NSC.</p><p>He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as globalists. He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to double down in Afghanistan.</p><p>Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the White House?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with multiple options. And then, based on his decisions, to help the president implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the interests of the American people.</p><p>And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda. You know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies and strategies that are for the American people.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker. Are you saying that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and advance his own agenda?</p><p>MCMASTER: Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the president well in bringing him multiple options. There were some who try to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that didn't serve the president well.</p><p>WALLACE: That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?</p><p>MCMASTER: I think this has been too hyped on one individual. I mean, these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen. I mean, we had our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council, and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.</p><p>WALLACE: General McMaster, thank you. Thanks for your time. You're a busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.</p><p>MCMASTER: It's always a pleasure, Chris. Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you. And we'll be watching the president's speech, of course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.</p><p>MCMASTER: Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the president's move to cut deals with Democrats. How long will it affect the Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p>WALLACE: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters worried. So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now here in Washington?</p><p>Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat. And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.</p><p>Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington. The most immediate question, does <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>have a deal with speaker -- former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to DACA or not?</p><p>And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The wall is going to be built, and it will be funded a little bit later.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: It was a very, very positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.</p><p>TRUMP: They cannot obstruct the wall. The wall, to me, is vital. If I don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points. Is there a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall? And is there a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP: Well, there's a basic understanding. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President Thursday night. They came to a basic understanding, without the details, without the obvious negotiations that have to follow. And then, Chuck and Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to. They did exactly that.</p><p>There was great pushback from the right. They didn't like the parameters of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since. But we are going forward. We are going forward with the understanding that we can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection. Those are the two pillars of this understanding.</p><p>WALLACE: And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?</p><p>DURBIN: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: That's pretty brief.</p><p>OK. Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday. Let's take a look at that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're not talking about amnesty at all. We have not talked about amnesty. There will be no amnesty. We're not talking about that as part of the transaction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's genuine confusion here in Washington. Do you believe that there is a deal on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could support?</p><p>SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI: Well, I think there's a desire to come to a conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked out, another thing that he mentioned.</p><p>Well, the details here matter. You know, it's always been three separate questions in my view. One is, how do you secure the border? Two is, what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country? And three, what you do with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were brought to the country illegally?</p><p>I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here. If you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.</p><p>But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point in the future say the border is now operationally secure. That allows everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border, does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for DREAMers?</p><p>BLUNT: It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think. There are a lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that everybody else takes? How long would you have to be here under the DREAM Act (ph)? There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or not <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats at the expense of Republicans. Here is what the president had to say about that on Air Force One.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to do more work. If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to Democrats and look for some votes?</p><p>BLUNT: Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate. But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work with you to get most things done. The tenures -- I was either the chief deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10 years that didn't have Democrats vote for them. That's part of the work -- that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else to move forward.</p><p>So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not part of that either.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a real -- not permanent, but working alliance between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and congressional Democrats? And what you say to those members -- folks on the left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP: Well, of course, there will be people on the right and left who will be critical. But Senator Roy Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work. I have joined him and applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in the United States on a bipartisan basis. Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray joined us.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President. That's what American wants. And the president said, I'll take it.</p><p>We did it. And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another, respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a goal. Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate. It can be done.</p><p>WALLACE: But there are some differences. I mean, you talked for instance about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.</p><p>And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax reform. The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate tax, Democrats opposed both. The president talks about paying for tax cuts based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.</p><p>Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences, fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?</p><p>DURBIN: Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to some degree. That's where you get the best legislation and that's where you get something the American people can trust.</p><p>Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to achieve it. We proved that with repeal and replace. That did not achieve what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018 midterm elections? You have the president out on the stump recently with North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp. This is somebody who was a vulnerable Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in 2018. The president is saying nice things about her.</p><p>When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?</p><p>BLUNT: Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done - - increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home pay. A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where we should be headed.</p><p>We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that. But, you know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think are important parts of the tax package. That's not a good way to start.</p><p>WALLACE: Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight. People angry about the acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the death of a drug -- black drug suspect. I know everyone opposes the violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the shooting and appalled by the verdict.</p><p>So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a lot of people in the African-American community?</p><p>BLUNT: Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in what the chiefs are doing. I also talked to a number of community leaders and African-American pastors. I do think this is a place where we have to figure out how to come together. You do have to accept what the judge who has the obligation to look at this case determined.</p><p>But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson. This happened before that happened. And we just need to continue to watch this.</p><p>The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both. We'll stay on top of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out in Congress. Thank you all, gentlemen.</p><p>Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>new search for votes on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?</p><p>Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>reaching across the aisle on tax reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty much where they are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway.</p><p>I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction you're boxed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of townhall.com.</p><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is doing here, and will it work?</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston, terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal.</p><p>And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe we'll do a little more.</p><p>Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p>WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said, on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with the Democrats?</p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan. With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line, there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on the Capitol.</p><p>And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to the conservative movement or Republican ideology.</p><p>WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well, maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p>PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit.</p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of it up.</p><p>Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he rally his base?</p><p>And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall and all?</p><p>Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p>GUY BENSON, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the future. Unclear.</p><p>But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40 billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or framed as a wall or a physical barrier.</p><p>WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been commonly thought to exist?</p><p>BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But, overall, there was a sense that they trust <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>that they think that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case, unless it is egregiously bad.</p><p>WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the prospects for a deal on tax reform?</p><p>RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership. You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is best for us.</p><p>There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you that.</p><p>For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p>WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is a guess whether or not it's going to happen.</p><p>BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill, Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it.</p><p>Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what he wants to do.</p><p>WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker?</p><p>GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p>WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can keep the debt ceiling going till March.</p><p>GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice the dreamers.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington.</p><p>All right, panel, we have to take a break here.</p><p>When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley, powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these huge Internet companies?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age, they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of billionaires.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are you saying put government clamps on it?</p><p>GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal, they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision, just to surface (ph) the information.</p><p>WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet behemoths?</p><p>BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now. Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia- linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And so those are all concerns.</p><p>So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else.</p><p>WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but with some guardrails?</p><p>BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow, that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet. Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the Internet.</p><p>So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power.</p><p>WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies has just skyrocketed in the last few years.</p><p>Julie, where are <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and his administration on this? You talk about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation.</p><p>PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So, look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are growing strong and are dominating on the global stage.</p><p>Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that. But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account.</p><p>I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant like Amazon.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy, about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street does have to pay taxes.</p><p>PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for. He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package.</p><p>WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p>PACE: Yes (ph).</p><p>WALLACE: That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because, Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley.</p><p>You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley.</p><p>BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think, focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of Google.</p><p>Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying, uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on both sides, rather, start to dig in.</p><p>WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich, because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington -- obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington getting more involved in regulation of the Internet?</p><p>BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one. And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well.</p><p>WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker.</p><p>GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate.</p><p>This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it.</p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in pro sports.</p><p>WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine, people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better.</p><p>WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington Nationals.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL?</p><p>WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my mind. I -- I never think of myself as different.</p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle.</p><p>West told us how different injuries are in the two sports.</p><p>WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage quickly.</p><p>WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out of the game. But in football --</p><p>WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly.</p><p>WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p>WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best interests.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to doing your job?</p><p>WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they are very trusting, I think.</p><p>WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries, but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the field.</p><p>WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed. I'm not around my team. I -- and they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side.</p><p>WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom noticed.</p><p>WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p>WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p>WALLACE: Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has developed a much stricter policy on concussions.</p><p>WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been.</p><p>WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win championships in both football and baseball.</p><p>WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It's a pentacle, and you can't get any better than that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets hurt and relaying that information to her.</p><p>And that's it for today.

Dressed in his trademark hoodie and grey T-shirt, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had come to see how real Texas cowboys wrangle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sixth-richest man in the world took a tour of the Will Rogers Coliseum, petted a calf and even talked livestock. Valais blacknose sheep, he told the mayor, \"are definitely the cutest\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is doing a lot of this \"man of the people\" routine these days. On the same swing through Texas he met religious leaders in Waco, planted a community garden in Oak Cliff, and broke bread with civic activists in Waxahachie, outside Dallas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The whistlestop tour was the first since the founder of the $380bn social network pledged last month that he would visit the more than 30 American states he has not already been to so that by the end of the year he will have seen all 50 in the union.</p><p>It seemed an odd side-project to choose for a man running a company used by nearly 1.9bn people - a quarter of humanity. Facebook is a garden that needs constant tending. Yet \"Mark's Year of Travel\", as it has been dubbed (and chronicled on a highly curated Facebook page), is just the latest clue to what may be <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>next goal: to be president of the United States.</p><p>Fake news, you say? It is not as far-fetched as it sounds. Last year, Facebook quietly changed its share rules so that he would not lose control even if he resigned \"in connection with his serving in a government position or office\". <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>also recently hired David Plouffe, the campaign whiz who helped Barack Obama get elected, as policy director of the Chan <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>Initiative, the foundation he established with his wife, Priscilla, that has set out to, among other things, \"cure all disease\".</p><p>A <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>2020 (or 2024?) run would be a defining moment for Silicon Valley's modern-day robber barons. Big Tech has become to this generation what Big Oil or Detroit were to previous ones in its cultural and political influence. Excluding China, five of the six biggest companies in the world are based on the West coast - Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is the only non-techie member hovering around the top six.</p><p>Last year the big five spent $49m on Washington lobbyists - twice the outlay by Wall Street. Should it be any surprise, then, that one of their own has his eyes on the presidency? Especially when the world is on the cusp of dramatic technological advancements - and America is being led by a man who doesn't use a computer.</p><p>There are a number of other signs that \"Zuck\" may be plotting a run, perhaps the most important of which is that he has found religion. No candidate has a chance of sniffing the White House unless he embraces God.</p><p>Now 32, in his younger years he pointedly listed himself as \"atheist\" in his Facebook profile. Yet this Christmas he changed his tune when asked if he was still a non-believer. \"No,\" he wrote. \"I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.\"</p><p>Timing is also on his side. He turns 35 - the minimum age required for the presidency - in May 2019, which will be 18 months before election day.</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>recently attempted to pour cold water on the speculation. When he was asked directly whether he had his eye on the White House, he said: \"No. I'm focused on building our community at Facebook and working on the Chan <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>Initiative.\"</p><p>The denial has fallen on deaf ears. Perhaps because his cross-country tour - commemorated by photos of him in small-town cafes rubbing shoulders with the regular folk - looks and feels so much like a campaign. \"You know he's running,\" said Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia's Centre for Politics. \"No one in his position would have any other reason for spending his free time in North Dakota.\"</p><p>FACEBOOK became a teenager yesterday. It was February 4, 2004, when <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>as a 19-year-old Harvard student, launched thefacebook.com. Things took off quickly. Peter Thiel, the controversial venture capitalist and prominent Trump supporter, was his first backer. He invested $500,000 that June - enough to convince <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to drop out and move to California.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>19 <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>age when he launched the social networking site</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>1m The number of users by December 2004, 10 months after launch</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>1.9bn The number of users today</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>25 The percentage of the world's population that uses Facebook</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>$54bn <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>net worth, making him the .\u200a.\u200a.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>6th . . . richest person on the planet</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>600m The number of people who use Facebook's Instagram photo app</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>50 The number of minutes the average user spends on Facebook per day</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>By that December thefacebook.com hit its first 1m users. The extent of the empire that has grown up since then was on full display last week when Facebook unveiled its annual results.</p><p>What began in halls of residence is now headquartered in the world's largest open-plan office, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry. At the heart of the elegantly utilitarian rectangle, several football fields long - topped by a nine-acre rooftop park with views of the bay - is a giant glass cube: Zuck's office, the nucleus of an empire that in the next few months will pass 2bn users. His net worth has climbed to $54bn - most of which he has pledged to give away.</p><p>Facebook's turnover grew in 2016 by more than 50% for the fifth straight year. More messages are now sent on its WhatsApp messaging app - 50bn each day - than all of the normal text messages sent globally.</p><p>After scooping $27bn in advertising revenues last year, Facebook took in about 5% of the $500bn global advertising market. Yet <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has a bigger target in sight. He wants to make it easier for users to watch videos on his network, allowing Facebook to tap into the $190bn that companies spend on TV ads every year.</p><p>No one person has the reach that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>does, which is perhaps why he is the only person for whom the White House could be a considered a step down.</p><p>What would a <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>presidency look like? He claims he is neither Republican nor Democrat. \"I'm pro-knowledge economy,\" he said recently. He has personally donated to politicians on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>But judging by his response to Trump's Muslim ban - \"The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that\" - and other public pronouncements, he would appear to lean left.</p><p>Given Facebook's chequered history on privacy, one imagines that his approach on that front would be rather laissez-faire, and his approach to trade, immigration, civil and gay rights broadly liberal.</p><p>The irony is that, at least for now, the election of Donald Trump has eased the pressure on him and the other tech barons. Jeff Hauser of the Centre for Economic Policy Research said that, while most in the industry had personally supported Hillary Clinton, they had also been bracing themselves for a regulatory backlash on issues ranging from competition to privacy had she been elected. He said: \"There is a conflict between economically progressive Democrats and the tech industry, but that reckoning has been pushed back now.\"</p><p>Google and Facebook together, for example, control 59% of the American digital ad market, according to research firm eMarketer. Hauser said: \"Back in the day that would have been called a duopoly.\" The next biggest competitor - Microsoft - has just 4% of the market. In Trump's America this domination by two companies is expected to pose little problem, which means <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>will have more time to kiss babies.</p><p>Sources in the tech industry are, not surprisingly, enthused by his potential candidacy, particularly because of where the economy appears to be heading. America lost 5m factory jobs in the decade to 2010. This was not, as Trump so effectively argued, because American jobs had been \"shipped overseas\". According to a study by Ball State University's Centre for Business and Economic Research, 85% were lost due to the rise of robots and technological advances. There is a growing consensus that the next phase of automation, driven by artificial intelligence, computer vision, robotics and other rapidly developing technologies, will be far more disruptive.</p><p>Who better than the king of the nerds to help navigate those waters? And, of course, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has quite the platform. He has more than 85m \"friends\" on Facebook - far more than Trump's 23m Twitter followers. And he keeps them updated with a drip-feed of measured statements and platitudes that, if one didn't know better, seem deliberately crafted to leave the impression that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is a middle-of the-road, decent bloke. The kind that many would find easy to vote for. </p><p>NONE of this, however, gets to the most important question: why would he bother? <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is the master of all he surveys. At its height Britain painted the world in imperial pink. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has bathed it in Facebook blue.</p><p>Nearly 1.9bn people allow him to mine their personal data in exchange for being able to watch cat videos posted by \"friends\" they have not seen since primary school. That unspoken pact, struck every time someone opens an account, has allowed him to fashion the world's largest media company in just over a decade.</p><p>Yet it has become the received wisdom that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>aspires to more than being the chief executive of a really big company. He is certainly imbued with the un-ironic belief - common in Silicon Valley- that he can change the world. A recent Vanity Fair story quoted several people who know him who said: \"He wants to be emperor.\"</p><p>Last week he re-posted a founder's letter that he first published five years ago. In it he describes the company's social mission of connecting people and building a more open society. He rounds off by saying: \"I look forward to building something great together.\" It sounds almost like a campaign slogan.</p><p>If he does decide to run, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>biggest obstacle may be how to connect with blue-collar voters. He comes off a bit awkward. He's a billionaire, and he's a nerd. But he has a secret weapon: his wife. A paediatrician and daughter of Chinese refugees who is comfortable in her own skin, Priscilla could bridge a lot of gaps. \"She is intelligent and articulate,\" Sabato said. \"She's the next Michelle Obama.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-48686926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MT6-SV31-JCJY-G45S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1725\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 5, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>BRK.B (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>BRK.A (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

I'd like to deal firstly with the matters regarding the New Zealand volcano tragedy, as well as the national disaster, the fires that are occurring across the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If I could first start with the issue of the terrible events that have been unfolding in New Zealand this week. I've been in contact with Prime Minister Ardern over the last few days, including again this morning. I want to start by just extending our deepest sympathies and concern and love to all of the families and all of those who have been affected by this. And it's obviously added to by the uncertainty and the frustration in being able to gain access, obviously, to the volcano and the Prime Minister has confirmed to me again that it is still a very dangerous place and that is obviously hampering the recovery effort but, of course, we have to be mindful of the safety of those who would be undertaking that recovery effort. But we know, with quite a number of persons still on the island understood to be deceased, that we will just have to be patient, while circumstances are continually reviewed, that will enable getting access to the island.</p><p>But just to confirm for you a number of processes that are in place at the moment and where people are. I can confirm, and as you know it is our practice only confirmed the names of those who are deceased once we have gone through two processes. One is an identification process, and also one involves engagement of the families and I can confirm that Jason Griffiths passed away yesterday in New Zealand. He had been evacuated and he passed away with family members present yesterday. And we send our deep sympathies to all the family and friends of Jason.</p><p>We will have within the next 24 hours, only 1 Australian who will remain hospitalised in New Zealand. We have already completed 5 medical evacuations to hospitals in Australia, there will be another 7 evacuations of Australians back to Australian hospitals over the course of the next 24 hours. Sadly there are 10 further Australians who are missing and presumed deceased. That is the total of the 24 Australians that I noted recently, the other day, who were caught up in visiting the island on that day. There are also 4 permanent residents who we have been able to identify have been caught up in this, these events. There is one who continues to be hospitalised, there are two who have passed away in hospital, and a further one permanent resident who is missing and presumed deceased.</p><p>In the days ahead, there will be worse news. Based on what I've just relayed to you. I want to thank all of those who have been involved in supporting the families and the friends of those who are missing and presumed deceased, I want to thank all of those who have been working in the New Zealand hospitals and those burns units providing the amazing care and support and I want to thank our Defence Forces for the role that they have been playing in evacuating those Australians in hospital back to Australia where they can be closer to family and where they can get the ongoing attention and care they will need. They will have difficult rehabilitations as a result of their injuries in many cases. I want to thank again Prime Minister Ardern and New Zealand Police for the cooperation there has been between New Zealand authorities and Australian authorities, and commend Minister Payne for the work that she's done together with High Commissioner Forsythe and our Consul-General in Auckland for the great work they've been doing in assisting with the effort which is quite a considerable one in ensuring people are kept informed. We know there are frustrations with information, in these circumstances you can never have enough information when you are concerned about the safety and the wellbeing of one of your loved ones. DFAT and our officers there are doing everything within their power to provide as much information as they can.</p><p>In the days ahead there may be the opportunity for that recovery operation to be in place, and when that occurs there will be the very grim task of identification and the further news that will follow from that.</p><p>So I thank people for their patience, I would continue to urge caution and sensitivity in the way that these matters are reported and, of course, we will continue to confirm information when we're in a position to do so. But our thoughts and our love go to all of those family members and friends who are dealing with this terrible news and the anxiety for those who are not yet to be able to get a formal confirmation of what has occurred to their loved ones.</p><p>More broadly, as this is a difficult week, as fires burn around the country. We have severe fire danger ratings today in New South Wales, in the Northern Territory, in Queensland, and in Western Australia. Of course, the worst situation is in New South Wales, where there are 130 fires that continue to burn across the state. Total fire bans have been issued for three fire areas today and more than 2.7 million hectares have been burnt since the start of this year, and during the 2019-2020 bushfire season, with a fire perimeter totalling some 19,235 kilometres. Five evacuation centres are currently activated. There are 36 local government areas in Queensland today, where there have been local fire bans issued. There are emergency warnings in Western Australia and there is one fire that is on a watch and act basis. The Government has been working closely, as part of the national coordinated effort, to address the national disaster of these fires.</p><p>Now, I'm often asked about the issue of declaring a national disaster. As many Australians would know - and the disaster categorisation is actioned by state governments. That's what occurs under state legislation. Of course, this is a national disaster. We all understand that. And in the states, there have been various declarations that have been made which activate particular actions and powers and authorities to respond to those and that includes the actions and coordination of federal authorities.</p><p>We all know this is a national disaster and we knew this was going to be a very tough fire season when we went into this season. We also know that there are many contributing factors that relate to these fires. The drought is obviously - and the dryness of the bush is the biggest factor and we all know, as I acknowledged earlier this year in February, that climate change, along with many other factors, contribute to what is occurring today. But let me be clear about this - climate change is a global challenge. Australia is playing our role as part of this global challenge. In fact, today, I can tell you that emissions from Australia are lower today than at any other time than before we came to government. In fact, they're around almost on average 50 million tonnes lower per year now than they were under the term of the previous government. And we'll continue to meet our commitments when it comes to Kyoto. We will over exceed on Kyoto by 411 million tonnes. We have our Paris targets, which we are absolutely committed too as well. And Minister Taylor has been in Madrid in recent days working through those commitments as part of those global undertakings that we're involved in. We're also working closely with our Pacific family, both to join in the actions that we're undertaking, as well as significant investments we're making in terms of climate change resilience within our region.</p><p>So we are taking action. But what I've noticed on the ground in terms of these fires is that the way that it has brought Australians as a community together. Certainly these broader global issues are relevant. But at times like this, Australians must come together. I know as a Sydneysider - I'm here in Melbourne today - I've lived all my life, pretty much, in Sydney, and the haze that has come from those fires, I know has been deeply troubling to Sydneysiders. It's been deeply troubling to families and kids, who've never seen this before. And I can understand that is deeply unsettling to a lot of Australians, particularly those who are living in Sydney. But I want to reassure, I want to reassure Australians, that the country is working together, the country is coming together to deal with the firefighting challenge that we have.</p><p>Today, we have announced a further $11 million that we're putting into the aerial firefighting fleet. That is on top of the $15 million that we already put in on annual basis. This has been done as a result of the engagement we've had with the states and territories through that nationally coordinated process. Recently, we had a meeting of the state and territory ministers with Minister Littleproud, to deal with what the additional needs were. There are increasing cost pressures on some of these aviation assets and there is also the need to have the ability to concurrently deal with multiple fire threats around the country. So we have responded to that advice that has come up from the fire chiefs. The decision was not taken recently. It was taken over the course of preparing for the midyear update and in response to the requests that had been made.</p><p>The Commonwealth, the Federal Government, is responding to all of the needs that have been presented to us by our state and territory authorities. We have over 200,000 registered firefighters in this country. That is an enormous, an enormous national resource, which we value greatly. They are supported for their equipment and needs by our state and territory governments. And that is where that support is provided. And they deal with the Commonwealth for broader nationally coordinated efforts.</p><p>I also want to stress that our Defence Forces have been actively engaged in supporting that firefighting effort for months, for months. I was in Canungra a few months ago, where there were fires up in Queensland, and we were there in the operation centre, in the Canungra base. That's where the Blackhawks - I think it was Blackhawks at the time - were operating. I'm happy to stand corrected on the precise nature of where those helicopters were operating from, conducting night flights at other times during other fires, providing assistance and developing fire breaks, providing the catering and logistics and airlift support, working in closely as part of the operation centres that are fighting these fires. So I want to assure Australians I know that it is troubling and it is concerning, but what we must do is focus on the coordination of the effort, getting the resources where it needs to get to, while the loss of homes and certainly the loss of life has been very distressing, I can assure you that if it were not for these nationally coordinated efforts, particularly since the Black Saturday fires down here in Victoria, and what has been learned from that, thousands of more homes would have been lost in these fires and I fear many more lives would have been lost as well.</p><p>So I know it's concerning, but I would encourage Australians to come together, to provide that support that we're all providing, governments at all levels, local governments, state government, Federal Government, communities, all working together to support that firefighting effort, and we all have a role to play and I'll finish on this. I want to thank again the employers who are enabling those firefighting efforts to be put in place by our volunteers. And they are making their commitment through enabling those firefighters to be out there in their community and I thank them very much for their sacrifice in this great national effort. Happy to take questions on those matters and then we'll move to the other matter which I'll ask the Treasurer and the Minister for Communications and the Arts to join me.</p><p>JOURNALIST: We've seen firefighters have to crowd fund to get breath masks to fight fires. Do you think Australians really care whether the Federal Government or state government really fund that? Shouldn't a government step up and fund those, that equipment?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, I've been seeking to get some validation of those reports and they're matters that I've raised directly through my office with the New South Wales Government. Of course, that type of equipment is provided by the state government and I would expect that these sorts of needs would be met out of those resources and they should be. I have noticed that over the course of these fires, and on social media, there have been lots of things - I'm not necessarily talking specifically about this - but there are lots of things that are said and one of the issues that I've engaged with when I've gone into these incident response and control centres is what they often have to do is counter a lot of the misinformation and a lot of the commentary that has been provided on social media which can cause unnecessary anxiety in communities. They actually have crack teams which are actually just dealing with countering misinformation on social media on fires. That's why I encourage people, when you're dealing with issues of fires, best to go to the confirmed sources, which are through the various state government agencies and that brilliant Fires Near Me app which has been operating in New South Wales and keeping many people safe. So every single resource that has been sought from the states for fighting these fires, we have been meeting and we will continue to do that through the nationally coordinated approach.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Jason Falinski is backing Matt Kean's call for practical and ambitious action on climate change. Isn't this is a sign members of your Government are dissatisfied with the current response?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: No. I know that all of my Government is focused on taking action on climate change. Because we should be. And we are. What is a pleasing thing is that, as Minister Taylor has been there at the recent meetings in Madrid, that we have being able to talk about exceeding our Kyoto targets by 411 million tonnes of carbon emissions abatement. And we have targets and we're meeting them. We have new targets for 2030 in Paris, which we've kept to and we're committed to and that we will meet and we are committed to taking action on climate change. What I would say, though, is that, as I think scientists have observed, and we should recognise, is that climate change is a global issue. Australia is 1.3% of global emissions and in New South Wales I think it's less than 0.5% of emissions, and so any suggestion that the actions of any state or any nation with a contribution to global emissions of that order is directly linked to any weather event, whether here in Australia or anywhere else in the world, is just simply not true. We take action as part of a broader global effort, which Australia is doing. As I said, our emissions reductions, our emissions that are generated in Australia, are around 50 million tonnes lower on average under our government than what we inherited. So we are taking action and we should take action and we will continue to take action and that's what our government is committed to.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Which hospitals are taking burns victims from New Zealand, and how many victims per hospital?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, there are hospitals across, they're in New South Wales. They're also in South Australia. I don't want to go into the details of those hospitals, because I want to protect the privacy of those persons who are receiving that treatment and the families that are providing support and visiting them. There have been cases where, frankly, there has been media interest in hospitals, seeking to gain access to hospitals. That's already occurred in New Zealand and I wouldn't want to see a repeat of that here in Australia.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Just back to climate change, the New South Wales Government will reportedly increase its greenhouse reduction targets. Are you open to doing that at a federal level?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: We have our commitments. We've always been very clear about our commitments. We have a positive program on reducing emissions and we have a positive program on growing our economy and we are achieving both of those.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the American Ambassador says that Chinese agents are operating on Australian soil. How prolific are the activities of Chinese spies and agents in Australia?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, as I was only announcing with the Minister for Home Affairs, Australia is leading the world in terms of ensuring that we have the right safeguards for countering foreign interference from wherever it might come. And indeed, jurisdictions, including the United States, have been incredibly impressed and this was the subject to some of the discussions I had when I was in the United States at the regime we've been able to put in place, both in terms of our laws, our agencies, our intelligence, our resources. No country is better equipped or better resourced or better and able to deal with any of these types of threats that Australia has. And we're staying with... we're ensuring we're staying ahead of the curve on these issues. We understand the threats and they come from any number of sources and it's important that we have the regime in place in order to deal with that and we do.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the question of bushfires and climate change, going back to Matt Kean's comments. He has said this is not normal and doing nothing is not a solution. Why do people...</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Sorry, I couldn't hear the rest of the question.</p><p>JOURNALIST: The point is, this is not normal.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Yeah, I heard that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: The rest of the question is why do people in your own party think the Coalition is doing nothing?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: They don't think that. I don't think that's what the Minister in New South Wales has said. And I think it would be wrong to mischaracterise his comments in that way. The New South Wales Government is pursuing their policies. The Commonwealth government is pursuing ours. We took those policies to the last election. I remind you, that is a 26 per cent reduction. And that's the global commitment we've made for Paris. We made. In fact, it was the Labor government that made the commitments for Kyoto. And when we took over back in 2013, we were seven hundred million tonnes behind in our projections when it came to meeting those Kyoto 20 targets. And now we will exceed them by four hundred and eleven million tonnes. Now, I would say that is actually getting a lot done. And we will continue to get a lot done through our climate solutions fund. We will continue to work to reduce our emissions, as we should. But what we cannot say, what no one can say is those programs of themselves are in any way directly linked to any fire event. I know because I'm a Sydneysider and I know how unusual it is to see that haze across my city. And I know how distressing that has been, particularly for young people who wouldn't have seen that before. And so that is why I think it is important to have a sense of calm about these matters and calm on the basis of information which says Australia is reducing our emissions, Australia is taking action. Australia is getting results. And it's important that at a time like this of natural disasters that Australians focus on coming together and not seeking to drive issues of conflict and issues that can separate Australians at a time when we all need each other.</p><p>JOURNALIST: On the emissions targets, there's a chance that Australia use of carryover credits will be ruled out at the next COP meeting. What's your back-up plan to bring emissions down if we don't get to use those carryover credits?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, again, I think the way you've presented the issue is incorrect. Because the issue of carryover credits that's been discussed in Madrid has actually been about trading credits with other nations, old credits. And that is the issue that concern has been expressed about in Madrid and that does not apply to what Australia's practice is. Australia is in the enviable position, unlike most countries, where we actually have exceeded on our targets. It's a bit like saying that if you get ahead of your mortgage, it doesn't count. Australia has got ahead of its mortgage on emissions reduction and our commitments that we made for Kyoto 2020 and we're ahead of that and I think that's a good thing and what we inherited was, we were well behind on the mortgage when we came to government when it came to Australia's carbon emissions. We've got ahead of it now and I think that's great and it's my ambition to ensure we continue that trend.</p><p>JOURNALIST: In light of all the bushfires you're talking about, how can you say it's great that we've achieved this, when it's clearly not great.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: You'd have to be clearer. I don't understand your point.</p><p>JOURNALIST: OK. Do you acknowledge that the bushfires are linked in some way to climate change?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Of course I have, I have all year.</p><p>JOURNALIST: OK, well how can you declare as great our achievements so far in view of what's happening around the country?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: What I'm saying is that Australia is meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets and our emissions are around 50 million tonnes lower on average over the term of our government than what we inherited. We need to reduce emissions and that's what is being achieved. What I've also said, John, is even that achievement, even that achievement, cannot be directly linked to a reduction or an increase in the risk of bushfire in Australia, because climate change is a global phenomenon. And to actually link those two things - which I don't think its right to do - as the question sort of implies - I think is to misconstrue it. Of course we should be taking action on climate change as part of a global effort, and we are. But that global effort has, and those global results more broadly, are contributing to greater risks of events like this. That's why we'll continue to take action and particularly do it in concert with our Pacific family, and build their resilience as well, as we are doing in this country. The fires are of great concern. We have seen many fires in Australia before and there have been plenty of reports about the history of these things in the past and I don't need to remind Victorians about that, because what's been more than a decade, but the wounds are still very real here in Victoria for those catastrophic events. But as always, Australians must band together and we must focus on the effort that needs to be put in on the ground now and that has my absolute focus and the focus of all the Premiers, leading states, that lead the response. I'll be seeing the New South Wales Premier tomorrow. I'm seeing the Victorian Premier this afternoon about a number of issues and my reason, amongst many, for being in Victoria today. And we'll work closely together. That's the assurance I'm seeking to provide Australians. I know it is upsetting. I know it is concerning and particularly when you're living in a city which has a haze that some may never have seen before. But I want them to be assured the country is working together. Australia's amazing volunteer resource is being drawn on and heavily, but it is always overcome. Australians are overcomers and we're unifiers.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what are you hoping to get out of your meeting with Daniel Andrews this afternoon? His Government's just presented their mid-year economic update and they're calling on more stimulus from the Commonwealth, to do more to boost economic growth here in Victoria?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, I look forward to discussing further projects that we can carry forward. I mean I announced just recently over half a billion of projects that we're bringing forward. We'll have further discussions about everything from Melbourne Port Rail and a range of those projects. Indeed, there are some that we would still like them to bring forward. And the Minister for Urban Infrastructure, Alan Tudge, my Melbourne eyes on this Melbourne problem, has only this week- in recent days I should say, met with Jacinta [Allan] and they're progressing issues of projects there. We're enjoying, I think, a very productive partnership on infrastructure with the Victorian Government and I look forward to continuing that in my discussions with the Premier this afternoon. We've brought forward $3.8 billion worth of infrastructure projects into the forward estimates. $1.8 billion this year and next year. So that's effectively over the next 18 months and we've got $9 billion of additional investment going into the National Disability Insurance Scheme this year and next year. We've got $6 billion extra going into hospitals and schools, this year, next year. $2 billion extra going into aged care, this year, next year. The Commonwealth is putting a significant investment - and that's not to mention the big investments we're making in defence procurement all around the country which has been incredibly important in regional areas as well where those projects are being managed. We'll continue to do that and I look forward to his suggestions because each time we've sought to bring projects forward, he's been very cooperative and I hope he will continue to be and as I'm sure he will be when we meet later today!</p><p>JOURNALIST: Will you bring up the East West link? And the money you've still got</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Our commitment to the East West link remains but the Victorian Government don't wish to pursue that project. So I think we're at a bit of a stale mate on that, but our commitment remains.</p><p>JOURNALIST: If they won't pursue it, will you unlock that money for other projects?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: People know the accounting treatment of those funds. It would be new funds if that project was to commence.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister just on climate change, you said there's a global effort, but Australia ranks last in the world on climate policy in a new global index. Isn't that an indictment of your Government's response?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: No, I completely reject that report. We don't accept that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: You don't accept the report?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: No.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Why not?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Because I don't think it's credible.</p><p>JOURNALIST: It's not credible?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: No. OK, I might move because I've had my Minister's</p><p>JOURNALIST: I want to ask one more question.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Sure.</p><p>JOURNALIST: You sort of said that young people in Sydney hadn't seen a haze like that over the city before. Do you remember that in your history?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I do remember hazes from the past. I do remember Sydney being ringed by fire in my lifetime. I remember as a young fellow being down at the beach and seeing smoke all around as I looked back out from the surf across the sand and I've seen it before. Maybe not quite the haze that I saw on Sydney Harbour. But, you know, we've seen terrible fires. I remember, when I was a kid I remember the Blue Mountains, the big fire back in the late seventies. And I remember the convent just out of Lawson, which was lost I remember on that occasion. And those fires were horrific. Absolutely horrific. We've seen what is, I think, concerning about these fires and we've seen fires come early in the season, too. When I was out at Wilberforce on the weekend getting an update on the mega fire just north-west of Sydney and speaking to the Commissioner when I was out there and speaking to other locals and I asked them about that and they said, yeah, we've seen early fires before. The challenge is that these fires have been now going for some time and that is causing a lot of fatigue. And I know that has the keen attention of the commissioners on how the firefighters are getting their rest periods. And that's why we appreciate the supplementary resources of people coming out of New Zealand and Canada and the United States and in those states that aren't facing the extreme conditions that the New South Wales, in particular, and Queensland. We're getting that wonderful support. I mean, this time last year, it was New South Wales firefighters going to Tasmania and that's the wonderful nature of this coordinated effort and that's what I'd stress. There is an extraordinarily coordinated effort between all of our fire chiefs, between all of our state and territory resources. There are established protocols for making requests, acting on those requests, whether they're fiscal or whether they're resources or people or airlifts or defence force engagement. All of this is happening. All of the things that you would expect indeed to be happening is happening. And and we thank all of those for their amazing effort in addressing the great risk, which is a natural disaster. Of course it is. And we will continue to respond to it on the basis of it being exactly that.</p><p>So I'm going to ask now if I could be joined by the Treasurer and the Minister for Communications and the Arts. We would like to make a statement on our response to the ACCC report in relation to digital platforms and I want to thank the Treasurer and the Minister for their significant work. And I also want to thank the ACCC and Rod Sims for the great work the ACCC has done.</p><p>The global economy, the world is changing because of the revolution that is taking place with the digital economy and digital technology. At a recent speech I gave to the Business Council, I talked about the digital economy and how I want Australia to be in the leadership pack, if not even at the front of that pack, when it comes to our success in the digital economy. And that means we need to modernise our regulatory environment. That means we need to understand the digital economy and the operation of digital platforms in our economy and in our society in a way better than any other jurisdiction. I want us to be the model jurisdiction in the world for how we are dealing with digital platforms, social media platforms, and I have a simple rule and that the rules that exist in the real world need to exist in the digital world. If it's a wrong thing to do in the real world, then it's a wrong thing to do in the digital world. And you would have seen that over the course of the last year, the Government and I have been taking a lot of action in this space, whether it's to deal with e-safety in the protection of children when it comes to what occurs on the Internet, whether it's the response that we led following the terrorist attack in Christchurch, which we took to the G20 and got the world's biggest economies to agree on the need to send the digital platforms a clear message that we cannot allow the Internet and the digital world to be weaponised by terrorists.</p><p>What occurs in consumer law, what occurs in competition law, what occurs in taxation law should occur in the digital world as much as occurs in the real world. And so that's what guides us and for Australia to be successful as an economy in the next decade we need to be leaders in this space. And that means our regulatory environment needs to be agile. It needs to be targeted. It needs to be effective in a way that at once it protects the very important things that we must protect from privacy to the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these digital technologies. So we want our cake and we want to eat it when it comes to digital in Australia. We want the benefits and the public and our economy and our companies have every right to expect the protections that they would otherwise have in the real world.</p><p>So it was as Treasurer, I commissioned the ACCC to to undertake this work. This work done by the ACCC is world's best. The number of people from around the world who have raised with me the excellence of this report and the insights that it contains into digital platforms done by the ACCC I think is a testament to Rod Sims and his team and I'm very proud of the work they've done. So it's now for us to then take their work and bring it forward. And key to that is building further the capability of the ACCC to be a world leader in this space in terms of how regulations should be structured to get the twin outcomes of protections and economic supercharging from this technology, as well as the commercial arrangements that need to be fostered between our traditional and new media that exists to enable the benefits to be realised. The regulatory environment and the deregulation that potentially needs to occur to get a level playing field and the protections that need to be in place for people's privacy in this new world. We have regulation and systems that were written for an analog economy, and I want Australia to be one of the most, if not the most, successful digital economy in the world.</p><p>So our response is all about that. That means jobs. That means incomes. That means an income for Australia, which supports the essential services Australians rely on. We must be successful in this digital world. We can't be afraid of it. We can't pull the doona over our head and pretend it's not there. We have to deal with the challenges it presents and the opportunities that are there for us to take. So I'll hand over the Treasurer and the Minister for Communications and the Arts to run through our response. Thank you, Josh. Thank you very much.</p><p>THE HON. JOSH FRYDENBERG MP, TREASURER: Thank you, Prime Minister. It's a pleasure to join you and the Minister here today. The digital world is the new frontier and what happens in the digital world affects everything we do from our personal interactions to our commercial relationships and the companies that have come to dominate the digital world are among the most powerful and valuable in the world. More than 17 million Australians use Facebook every month. More than 90 per cent of the searches online are using Google. And we know that in the Australian online advertising market, excluding classifieds, for every $100 that is spent, $47 is spent with Google, $24 with Facebook and $29 with the other parties. And it was in this context that the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister commissioned the ACCC to conduct this groundbreaking review, a review that made a series of recommendations, 23 in total, across better consumer outcomes, competition law, privacy and media regulation.</p><p>Now, that report, as the Prime Minister said, is world-leading and we want to stay ahead of the game and ahead of the pack. So I just want to touch on two particular recommendations that we are accepting that are within my portfolio. The first is that we will be setting up a dedicated unit to focus on the digital platforms, within the ACCC. Now, we are allocating $27 million to this task and this unit will monitor the sector. It will enforce the rules and it will conduct further inquiries as directed by the Treasurer. And the first inquiry is into the adtech market, the advertising online market, which is the technology that determines the advertisements you see online and this was a particular recommendation of the ACCC. The second recommendation that we will be accepting in my portfolio is that we will be requiring the digital platforms to enter into a voluntary code with the media companies. Now, this code will cover such things as how revenue is shared, how content is accessed and presented, as well as getting forewarning about changes to algorithms that go to how the content is ranked online. The Government will be seeking an update from the ACCC on the development of these voluntary codes by May and we are expecting that a voluntary code will be entered into by November. If no voluntary code is satisfactorily entered into, the Government will move forward with a mandated regulatory outcome.</p><p>So the companies are on notice. The Government is not messing around. We will not hesitate to act. And what we are seeking to do here with the acceptance of a number of the recommendations in Rod Sims excellent report is not only to minimize the harm but to maximize the opportunities for all Australians and for the economy as a whole.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Thanks, Paul Fletcher. Thank you, Paul.</p><p>THE HON. PAUL FLETCHER MP, MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS, CYBER SAFETY AND THE ARTS: Thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you, Treasurer. Of the ACCC's 23 recommendations, one that's of great importance within my portfolio is that we move to harmonise media regulation. Now, as the ACCC noted, this is a big job that needs to be done in stages. But fundamentally, the point they're making is that we've got a set of businesses that are using technology that's been around for a long time. And we've got a new set of businesses that are using much newer technology, competing for the same audiences, but facing very different regulatory environment. So we've committed that we're going to commence a staged process towards an end state of platform mutual regulatory frameworks covering both online and offline delivery of media content to Australian consumers.</p><p>Now, the ACCC, as I mentioned, noted that this is a big job and it needs to be done in stages. So we've committed that our first stage is going to focus on two issues and work on these two issues will commence in 2020. The first is developing a uniform classification framework that would operate across all media platforms. The second comes to the question of Australian content. We're going to examine the extent of Australian content obligations on free to air TV broadcasters, and that includes drama and children's content, and whether there should be Australian content obligations on the new subscription video on demand or [inaudible] services. And we're also going to look at other aspects of the policy framework to support Australian film and TV content. We'll be asking the Australian Communications and Media Authority and Screen Australia to prepare an options paper for issue early next year and we'll use that then as a basis for consulting with the industry. I've mentioned these first two key issues that we'll kick off with. In the next stage we seek to look at other issues, such as the regulation of advertising but we'll say more about the timing of that next year. But I'd envisage that that work would be getting underway as well before the end of next year.</p><p>So very significant recommendations by the ACCC in terms of our media regulation and we're announcing a staged programme in response to that with two areas that we're focussing on initially on classification, Australian content.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Questions on this matter?</p><p>JOURNALIST: The ACCC is right now suing Google... taking them to court. Google and Facebook have repeatedly shown that they're not prepared to follow laws in our country or other countries. Is a voluntary code really going to cut it?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Let me make two responses to that. First of all, as a country, we have already acted and demanded their attention when it comes to terrorist content and we have led the world in that and I can assure you that that has got their attention. When it comes to getting them to pay tax, and in particular abolishing the low-value threshold for large platforms, for Amazon, and you'll recall Amazon said they were going to leave the country, never to return. They are back within months. And we held firm when it came to standing up to those companies, as we have on keeping our children safe, dealing with the threats of terrorism on the Internet and indeed, as it will be in this case, ensuring that our companies get a fair go in the digital economy. And as the Treasurer said, our preference is for them to sit down and work out these new commercial rules between them, which would be binding upon them once the code has been established. But I want to report back in May and I want to see how it's going and I want this thing done by November. But I can assure you the backstop is there. If I don't think this thing is tracking and the Treasurer doesn't think it's tracking and the Communications Minister, a mandatory code will happen.</p><p>JOURNALIST: It's over two years since you first commissioned the ACCC report. Your Government has been looking at it for six months. A lot of the decisions are to take for more reviews over the next 12 months. When is his country going to see action on this issue?</p><p>THE HON. JOSH FRYDENBERG MP, TREASURER: Thanks, John. As you would know from your own company, they had an opportunity to put in a submission. So we actually held a public consultation process. So I don't know if you're speaking for your own company's experience, but I know that they said... they wanted to have the opportunity to comment on this final report. It was an 18 month report and as you know, we are leading the world and by now moving to this voluntary code and, indeed, as the Prime Minister has indicated, possibly a mandatory code. We do need to go through that process because we are driving evidence-based policy. This is properly considered. These aren't knee jerk reactions, these are getting the best and the brightest minds that the ACCC has brought together to produce a world-leading report. And when you are talking about putting in place state of the art regulatory frameworks, you need to get it right.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Who will lead the ACCC unit?</p><p>THE HON. JOSH FRYDENBERG MP, TREASURER: Ultimately, it is accountable to Rod Sims as the head of the ACCC. Now, he already has put together a pretty strong team who worked on this report and he'll continue to work to build it. But it ultimately is under his leadership.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Treasurer, can I just confirm, are you accepting all 23 recommendations and does this mean the digital platforms can be subject to the same laws of defamation contempt that the mainstream media is?</p><p>THE HON. JOSH FRYDENBERG MP, TREASURER: We're not accepting all the recommendations and we've set out in our response which ones we're acting on immediately, which ones we're engaging in further consultation on, which ones we know want. There's a couple in Paul's area where we're not moving forward, so I'll let him explain it as well as this issue in relation to defamation.</p><p>THE HON. PAUL FLETCHER MP, MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS, CYBER SAFETY AND THE ARTS: Let me pick up the question about defamation. Work in that space is being led by the Attorney-General and he's working with his state and territory counterparts, recognising where primary responsibility for defamation law sits. So that's the work stream that our Government has underway on that front, working with state and territory governments and attorneys general. And in relation to one of the areas that we've chosen not to take up the agency's recommendation, well, that was a recommendation for effectively a code governing takedowns in relation to infringement of copyright. I think we consulted widely with industry on views about that particular recommendation, I think it is fair to say there was certainly strong agreement as to the nature of the issue and our Government is certainly concerned about whether the digital platforms are facilitating content being displayed which infringes the copyright of owners, be they Australian media business and Australian creators or others. But the view we got quite strongly from many across the sector was that they didn't feel that particular regulatory tool that was recommended, was fit for purpose.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: But that was for traditional media operators.</p><p>THE HON. PAUL FLETCHER MP, MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS, CYBER SAFETY AND THE ARTS: Indeed. And so we certainly recognise that remains an issue.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: The principle is what I outlined at the start and this is what all of this is working to. It's not about trying to regulate a sector, because, as you know, my Government is about deregulating the economy where we can and getting rid of unnecessary regulation. As I said, as part of our economic plan at the BCA speech I gave earlier this year. This is about ensuring and a whole new area of our economy operates on the same rules as the physical economy. So whether it's defamation, whether it's copyright, whether it's these sorts of issues, we have to work to establish the same norms and the same expectations and the same requirements in the digital space that applies in real space.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, President Trump responded angrily when France introduced higher taxes on Facebook and Google. Do you expect any blowback from the White House to your response to the ACCC inquiry?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: No.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you've said that this information had caused you some issues in getting the right information out on bushfires. Obviously, that was part of this inquiry. Has this gone far enough to tackle fake news?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, the problem with fake news is that when it's put out there in the first place and that's the problem of digital platforms and things like this, that people can gravitate on that. And it's important that that is extinguished by getting the right information out there. So in the case of the fires, that's required a very proactive effort from our agencies. And this is why it's important that you have, you know, the rules that govern the real world also governing the digital world. It's not an easy thing to do because it's an evolving technology. In my engagements around the G20 table, but more importantly, with the digital platforms that have sought to engage with that process that we commenced, and it commenced many years ago when we started championing the role of ensuring multinationals pay their tax and digital platforms, digital companies have been offenders in this area, quite significantly. And so I've been dealing with this issue back as a Treasurer through to now and what's important is that you've got to work with these companies because they're basically inventing this economy every single day. And they can't operate like they're out in the Wild West and the rules don't apply to them. They can't operate on a business model which is the absence of any sort of regulatory world that applies to them. That is not a reasonable expectation on their part and my invitation to them has been to work with us because one way or another, we're going to put this in place. I'd rather do it with you so we can make sure we get the advantages of the digital economy while also getting the protections in place. And look, I've met with a lot of them recently when some of their most senior executives have been out in Australia, I've also met with them when I've been in the United States and I think that's changing. But to go to an early questioner's point, it changes because governments say we're not going to put up with this and you're going to have to come to the table and increasingly, I'm finding that they are doing that, but they've got a bit more distance to travel.</p><p>JOURNALIST: One of the recommendations in the ACCC report was around sort of changes to the acquisition laws. But one thing, in particular, they pointed out was advance notice on any acquisitions from the big tech companies of local players. What is your take on that? Is that one of the ones that you're not proceeding or will that fall under the new sort of ACCC unit?</p><p>THE HON. JOSH FRYDENBERG MP, TREASURER: No, that is actually one that we focused on implementing and and getting more information to the ACCC. There is also some more broader merger law changes that we're going to consult further. But as the Prime Minister has indicated we want to work with the industry, both some of the traditional media companies, as well as these new digital platform companies with the ACCC as being the cop on the beat has been the effective regulator to ensure that our regulatory framework is fit for purpose. This is all about staying ahead of the game. This report has put us in the position, Prime Minister, to be world-leading in this regard. And as the Prime Minister has indicated in a number of speeches and indeed our policies are also capitalising on the digital economy. We want Australians to get the best out of the digital economy.</p><p>JOURNALIST: You talk about innovation in this sector. Could you list the amount of innovation we've had from Google in the last two years?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: What do you mean?</p><p>JOURNALIST: Well, innovation. I'm not sure that we've seen any innovation from Google apart from working out better ways of getting our information and how to make money from it.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'd say that the advance in digital technology, the ability to access information and the ability to turn that information to things of real value is the defining element of the digital economy. And obviously, they've played a huge role in that globally.</p><p>JOURNALIST: But I said in the last two years, what?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, that has continued, John, as you'd know, and if it wasn't continuing, then the share price would look very different to what it is today if they weren't able to continue to build their models and their products and their services. That obviously has an impact on the global economy. But what I want to ensure, and this is my whole point about technology and you were there at that speech, so you'll know what I said. Australia's advantage in this area is we're good adopters of this technology. We don't have to invent it, although we're capable of it and I'd like to see that. But where Australia will be successful in the digital economy is that we will adopt it and apply it and immerse it into our business models better than any other country in the world. This is why we're close now to completing the first e-commerce agreement with Singapore. This is why that's what we're pursuing in our engagements with other countries around the world. It's the sort of thing that I'll have the opportunity to talk with Prime Minister Modi about and Prime Minister Abe. I'm with them in January. The changing of the world's rules and Australia's rules to position our companies to be immersed in the digital economy is huge. And for small businesses in particular and for regional parts of the country and even for small countries in our region. It's a massive change and so we've got to understand it. We've got to put in place the right protections for consumers and for companies to be able to access it and to deal with imbalances in market power. And, you know, we've seen this through other major iterations of technological revolution in the past, whether it's been from electricity or steam trains, for goodness sake. And this is another iteration of that in the global economy. And on each occasion, countries have had to do their own work, but also work with others to modernise their regulatory regimes. As I said, we've got to regulate and enable a digital economy and at the moment, too much of our settings are on analog and we'll make that switch and we're leading that switch.</p><p>Just on one other issue before I go, to a matter that you raised earlier in relation to equipment for firefighters. Commissioner Fitzsimmons has responded to that issue, I understand, and said he's not sure why they are doing that. \"We supply breathing masks,\" he says, \"to firefighters like they do with all other basic equipment\". That the RFS, I'm advised, provides disposal masks that are certified and fit for purpose. And the P3 masks by design in most cases interfere with the correct fitment of goggles, helmet and flash hood, as it's known, as well as the retaining the metabolic heat by the volume of the firefighters face being covered and this contributes to heat exhaustion. So there's a lot of technical specifications about the equipment that's provided to firefighters. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service, the ones that actually define what that equipment should be, and they're the ones that provide it. And so if you need any further details from the Rural Fire Service in New South Wales, I'm sure Commissioner Fitzsimmons will only be too happy to facilitate an answer on anything further you need.</p><p>And the other thing I should have mentioned, too, in response to an earlier question, I talked about what we're doing with emissions reduction and the discussion that Minister Taylor was able to have in Madrid. The other thing he's been able to stress, I think, very importantly, is Australia is in the leading pack when it comes to renewables investment in the world today. So whether it's on renewables or reducing emissions, Australia is meeting our goals and beating our goals and I think that is something that can be of real encouragement for Australians today as they do look out on that haze, as they do look out on the terrible fires they're seeing and know that Australia has a plan. We're meeting that plan and in a lot of cases, we're beating that plan. Thank you all very much.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123372795</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR2-T141-DYTH-G08W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>N622000CC</classCode><className>HOSPITALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

EARNEST: At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders. This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II. That will be the focal point of the President's activities. When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on. I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there. Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p>That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on. And that's about it.</p><p>Q Is he actively going to avoid Putin? I mean, would he even see him? And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Again, this is still a month away here. I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much. And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin. </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves. And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy. It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p>Q Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events. But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.</p><p>Q Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria. Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role. So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation. But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p>The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide. There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.</p><p>So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts. We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community. The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria. But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.</p><p>Q There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation. We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p>Q Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall. The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there. So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that? And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think so. I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country. There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians. We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p><p>So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram. And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.</p><p>Q In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this? And do you have a response to it?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning. If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p>Q A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital. Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary. Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki. I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran. Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans. And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things. The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there. I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.</p><p>I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously. But there's a lot more work to be done. We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened. But we have turned that tide. It's moving in the right direction. And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p>Q Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi. Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p>Q Quick question on sequestration. There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies. Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off. Any White House input on that? I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.</p><p>So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \"terrible toll\" might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester. And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester. And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.</p><p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</p><p>Q I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that's according to one report. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service. The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p>So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.</p><p>Q I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night. He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House. Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year? I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that. Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. He believes that --</p><p>Q What gives him that belief? Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Let me answer that question two ways. The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats. The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections. We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot. And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p>So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p>Q Just one more question about them. He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process. I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington. And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country. The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country. And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p>So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do. I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p>Q He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that. How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \"sexy,\" I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections. And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified. And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.</p><p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take. I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else. The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out. This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012. That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p>Q In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did. And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.</p><p>Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \"None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action. And that's not always easy. And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\"</p><p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world. And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.</p><p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p>Q But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental. I mean, the part you didn't read was, \"I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\"</p><p>So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do. Is that right?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make. I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world. And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p>Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down. This is an autonomous government. But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down. And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up. It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p>Q Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there. This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies. I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming. They've been active on the immigration front. With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p>Q Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion. We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country. So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p>I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.</p><p>So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p>Q Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy? It seems like it's a bit of a mix. I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, he can. And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved. There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can. But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now. The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.</p><p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody. There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy. Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies. So there's a wide range of reasons.</p><p>And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress. And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.</p><p>Q Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it. How does the White House feel? Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill? Is it enough that has been done? Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Not really. Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>TNS 30FurigayJane-140509-4732025 30FurigayJane</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR4732025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C5J-N861-DYG2-R2WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4307\"/><timeReceived>3:58 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 9, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DHPL</classCode><className>GERMAN CHANCELLORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00098AA</classCode><className>INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE0009U46</classCode><className>VLADIMIR PUTIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009UHD</classCode><className>ANGELA MERKEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>PE0009TJP</classCode><className>BARACK OBAMA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

EARNEST: I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>going to Normandy. Any chances that the President would meet with him there? Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MR. EARNEST: At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders. This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II. That will be the focal point of the President's activities. When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on. I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there. Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p>That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on. And that's about it.</p><p>Q Is he actively going to avoid Putin? I mean, would he even see him? And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Again, this is still a month away here. I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much. And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin. </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves. And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy. It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p>Q Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events. But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.</p><p>Q Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria. Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role. So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation. But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p>The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources The United States can provide. There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.</p><p>So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts. We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community. The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria. But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.</p><p>Q There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation. We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p>Q Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall. The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there. So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that? And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think so. I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country. There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians. We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p><p>So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between The United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram. And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.</p><p>Q In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this? And do you have a response to it?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning. If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p>Q A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital. Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary. Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki. I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran. Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans. And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things. The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there. I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.</p><p>I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously. But there's a lot more work to be done. We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened. But we have turned that tide. It's moving in the right direction. And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p>Q Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi. Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p>Q Quick question on sequestration. There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies. Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off. Any White House input on that? I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.</p><p>So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a terrible toll might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester. And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester. And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.</p><p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</p><p>Q I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that's according to one report. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service. The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p>So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.</p><p>Q I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night. He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House. Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year? I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that. Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. He believes that --</p><p>Q What gives him that belief? Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Let me answer that question two ways. The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats. The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections. We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot. And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p>So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p>Q Just one more question about them. He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process. I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington. And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country. The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country. And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p>So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do. I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p>Q He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that. How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more sexy, I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections. And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified. And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.</p><p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take. I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else. The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out. This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012. That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p>Q In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did. And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.</p><p>Near the end of his remarks, the President said, None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action. And that's not always easy. And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.</p><p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of The United States as a force for good in the world. And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of The United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.</p><p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that The United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p>Q But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental. I mean, the part you didn't read was, I have this remarkable title right now -- President of The United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.</p><p>So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do. Is that right?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make. I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world. And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that The United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p>Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down. This is an autonomous government. But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down. And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up. It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p>Q Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there. This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies. I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming. They've been active on the immigration front. With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p>Q Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion. We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country. So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p>I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.</p><p>So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p>Q Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy? It seems like it's a bit of a mix. I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, he can. And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved. There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can. But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now. The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.</p><p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody. There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy. Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies. So there's a wide range of reasons.</p><p>And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress. And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.</p><p>Q Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it. How does the White House feel? Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill? Is it enough that has been done? Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Not really. Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p><p>Source: The White House, The United States</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CMJ-MYK1-DXMS-8510-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 9, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921110MM</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ</classCode><className>The Presidency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DHPL</classCode><className>GERMAN CHANCELLORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00098AA</classCode><className>INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE0009U46</classCode><className>VLADIMIR PUTIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009UHD</classCode><className>ANGELA MERKEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>PE0009TJP</classCode><className>BARACK OBAMA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX543</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC334</classCode><className>NIGERIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

PDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MR. EARNEST: I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>going to Normandy. Any chances that the President would meet with him there? Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MR. EARNEST: At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders. This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II. That will be the focal point of the President's activities. When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on. I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there. Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p>That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on. And that's about it.</p><p>Q Is he actively going to avoid Putin? I mean, would he even see him? And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Again, this is still a month away here. I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much. And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin. </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves. And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy. It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p>Q Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events. But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.</p><p>Q Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria. Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role. So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation. But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p>The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide. There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.</p><p>So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts. We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community. The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria. But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.</p><p>Q There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation. We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p>Q Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall. The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there. So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that? And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think so. I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country. There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians. We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p><p>So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram. And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.</p><p>Q In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this? And do you have a response to it?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning. If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p>Q A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital. Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary. Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki. I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran. Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans. And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things. The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there. I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.</p><p>I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously. But there's a lot more work to be done. We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened. But we have turned that tide. It's moving in the right direction. And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p>Q Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi. Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p>Q Quick question on sequestration. There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies. Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off. Any White House input on that? I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.</p><p>So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \"terrible toll\" might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester. And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester. And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.</p><p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</p><p>Q I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that's according to one report. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service. The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p>So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.</p><p>Q I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night. He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House. Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year? I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that. Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. He believes that --</p><p>Q What gives him that belief? Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Let me answer that question two ways. The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats. The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections. We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot. And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p>So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p>Q Just one more question about them. He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process. I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington. And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country. The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country. And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p>So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do. I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p>Q He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that. How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \"sexy,\" I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections. And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified. And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.</p><p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take. I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else. The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out. This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012. That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p>Q In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did. And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.</p><p>Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \"None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action. And that's not always easy. And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\"</p><p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world. And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.</p><p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p>Q But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental. I mean, the part you didn't read was, \"I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\"</p><p>So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do. Is that right?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make. I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world. And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p>Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down. This is an autonomous government. But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down. And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up. It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p>Q Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there. This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies. I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming. They've been active on the immigration front. With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p>Q Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion. We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country. So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p>I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.</p><p>So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p>Q Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy? It seems like it's a bit of a mix. I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, he can. And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved. There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can. But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now. The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.</p><p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody. There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy. Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies. So there's a wide range of reasons.</p><p>And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress. And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.</p><p>Q Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it. How does the White House feel? Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill? Is it enough that has been done? Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Not really. Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p><p>END</p><p>10:21 A.M.

PDT<br/> MR. EARNEST: I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away.<br/> Q <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>going to Normandy. Any chances that the President would meet with him there? Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p><br/> MR. EARNEST: At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders. This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II. That will be the focal point of the President's activities. When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on. I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.<br/> Q <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there. Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.<br/> That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on. And that's about it.<br/> Q Is he actively going to avoid Putin? I mean, would he even see him? And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Again, this is still a month away here. I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much. And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin. </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves. And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy. It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.<br/> Q Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?<br/> MR. EARNEST: I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events. But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.<br/> Q Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria. Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role. So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation. But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.<br/> The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide. There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.\u00a0<br/> So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts. We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community. The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria. But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.<br/> Q There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation. We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.<br/> Q Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall. The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there. So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that? And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?<br/> MR. EARNEST: I don't think so. I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country. There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians. We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.<br/> So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram. And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.\u00a0<br/> Q In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this? And do you have a response to it?<br/> MR. EARNEST: I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning. If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.<br/> Q A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital. Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary. Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?<br/> MR. EARNEST: The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki. I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran. Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans. And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.<br/> I would say -- point out a couple of other things. The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there. I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.\u00a0<br/> I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously. But there's a lot more work to be done. We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened. But we have turned that tide. It's moving in the right direction. And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.<br/> Q Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi. Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?<br/> MR. EARNEST: I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.<br/> Q Quick question on sequestration. There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies. Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off. Any White House input on that? I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.<br/> MR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.<br/> So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a 'terrible toll' might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester. And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.<br/> I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester. And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.\u00a0<br/> So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.\u00a0<br/> Q I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that's according to one report. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service. The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.<br/> So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.<br/> Q I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night. He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House. Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year? I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that. Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. He believes that --<br/> Q What gives him that belief? Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.<br/> MR. EARNEST: Let me answer that question two ways. The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats. The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.<br/> The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections. We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot. And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.<br/> So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.<br/> Q Just one more question about them. He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.<br/> MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process. I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington. And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.<br/> The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country. The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country. And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.<br/> So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do. I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.<br/> Q He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that. How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more 'sexy,' I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections. And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.<br/> As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified. And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.<br/> And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.\u00a0<br/> There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take. I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else. The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out. This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012. That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.<br/> Q In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?<br/> MR. EARNEST: A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did. And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.\u00a0<br/> Near the end of his remarks, the President said, 'None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action. And that's not always easy. And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.'<br/> And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world. And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.\u00a0<br/> And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.<br/> Q But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental. I mean, the part you didn't read was, 'I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.'<br/> So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do. Is that right?<br/> MR. EARNEST: I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make. I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world. And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.<br/> Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down. This is an autonomous government. But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down. And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up. It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.<br/> Q Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there. This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies. I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming. They've been active on the immigration front. With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?<br/> MR. EARNEST: I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?<br/> Q Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.<br/> MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion. We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country. So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.<br/> I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.\u00a0<br/> So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.<br/> Q Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy? It seems like it's a bit of a mix. I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Yes, he can. And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved. There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can. But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now. The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.\u00a0<br/> Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody. There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy. Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies. So there's a wide range of reasons.\u00a0<br/> And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress. And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.\u00a0<br/> Q Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it. How does the White House feel? Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill? Is it enough that has been done? Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?<br/> MR. EARNEST: Not really.

EARNEST: I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>going to Normandy. Any chances that the President would meet with him there? Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MR. EARNEST: At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders. This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II. That will be the focal point of the President's activities. When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on. I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there. Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p>That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on. And that's about it.</p><p>Q Is he actively going to avoid Putin? I mean, would he even see him? And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Again, this is still a month away here. I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much. And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin. </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves. And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy. It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p>Q Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events. But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.</p><p>Q Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria. Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role. So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation. But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p>The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources The United States can provide. There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.</p><p>So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts. We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community. The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria. But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.</p><p>Q There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation. We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p>Q Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall. The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there. So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that? And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think so. I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country. There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians. We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p><p>So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between The United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram. And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.</p><p>Q In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this? And do you have a response to it?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning. If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p>Q A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital. Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary. Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki. I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran. Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans. And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things. The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there. I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.</p><p>I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously. But there's a lot more work to be done. We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened. But we have turned that tide. It's moving in the right direction. And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p>Q Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi. Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p>Q Quick question on sequestration. There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies. Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off. Any White House input on that? I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.</p><p>So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a terrible toll might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester. And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester. And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.</p><p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</p><p>Q I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that's according to one report. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service. The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p>So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.</p><p>Q I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night. He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House. Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year? I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that. Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. He believes that --</p><p>Q What gives him that belief? Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Let me answer that question two ways. The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats. The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections. We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot. And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p>So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p>Q Just one more question about them. He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process. I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington. And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country. The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country. And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p>So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do. I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p>Q He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that. How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more sexy, I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections. And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified. And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.</p><p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take. I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else. The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out. This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012. That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p>Q In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did. And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.</p><p>Near the end of his remarks, the President said, None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action. And that's not always easy. And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.</p><p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of The United States as a force for good in the world. And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of The United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.</p><p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that The United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p>Q But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental. I mean, the part you didn't read was, I have this remarkable title right now -- President of The United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.</p><p>So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do. Is that right?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make. I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world. And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that The United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p>Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down. This is an autonomous government. But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down. And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up. It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p>Q Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there. This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies. I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming. They've been active on the immigration front. With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p>Q Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion. We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country. So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p>I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.</p><p>So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p>Q Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy? It seems like it's a bit of a mix. I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, he can. And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved. There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can. But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now. The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.</p><p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody. There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy. Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies. So there's a wide range of reasons.</p><p>And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress. And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.</p><p>Q Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it. How does the White House feel? Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill? Is it enough that has been done? Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p><p>MR. EARNEST: Not really. Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p><p>Source: The White House, The United States</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CMT-SWG1-JB5P-J36V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 9, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921110MM</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ</classCode><className>The Presidency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DHPL</classCode><className>GERMAN CHANCELLORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00098AA</classCode><className>INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE0009U46</classCode><className>VLADIMIR PUTIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009UHD</classCode><className>ANGELA MERKEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>PE0009TJP</classCode><className>BARACK OBAMA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX543</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC334</classCode><className>NIGERIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Well it's a wonderful time when we put a bow on the daily package of campaign gifts. Our press gallery today is Stephanie Levitz from the Canadian Press, Bill Curry from the Globe and Mail. I'll start with Preston Manning. We haven't heard a whole lot out of Alberta, but he's got this, he went and gave a speech yesterday kind of on the lookout after this election, alienation still on the rise out of the west, the Bloc looks like it's surging in Quebec, the winner of this election is going to face a national unity crisis. Does he speak the truth, in your view?</p><p>STEPHANIE LEVITZ (Canadian Press): He certainly speaks from an historical perspective, and he knows from what he speaks, the Reform party that he championed for so many years that became a force in national politics came out of a sense of western alienation, a sense that the government wasn't working for the folks in Alberta. It's fair to assume, based on what we know of the government today in Alberta, that they feel exactly the same way as they did back in the early '90s. Whether that translates itself post election to other places, to this national unity crisis, that perhaps depends a lot on who's in office and what they intend to do with their time there.</p><p>MARTIN: There's new cleavages though, you know, like energy cleavages that might not have been there, I want a pipeline, you can't have a pipeline. And the Bloc leader is doing pretty well in the polls I've seen. They seem to like him.</p><p>BILL CURRY (Globe and Mail): Yeah, that's a bit of a mystery. Well we're going to have two French debates this election and only one, so there's an opportunity for movement in Quebec, so that will be very interesting to watch what happens there because there's a lot of loose fish I think in the polling there. Obviously for Alberta and Saskatchewan, it's pipeline capacity, the economies have been struggling, and the message from those provinces to the rest of Canada saying we need this capacity has not just had any sympathy, and it's been a huge point of debate.</p><p>MARTIN: Some people are noticing, pretty hard to miss, that a lot of the promises being put out by the Conservatives have a familiar feel to them. They look a little bit like Harper promises. And then Trudeau comes out with a promise today that my friend John Ivison called it the stupidest promise thus far, so I'll ask you your view. Trudeau saying he's going to give a $2,000 travel bursary to send 75,000 underprivileged families camping. Is that the stupidest promise thus far, Stephanie?</p><p>LEVITZ: I'm going to over think it and over analyze it. Allow me. Just give me some canoeing space here.</p><p>MARTIN: Paddle away.</p><p>LEVITZ: I'm going to paddle away, exactly.</p><p>MARTIN: You're up the creek and you've got a paddle.</p><p>LEVITZ: Here I go. So if you think about Justin Trudeau's question in this election, which is what kind of Canada do you want to live in, and then you look at Justin Trudeau on a canoe into the great Canadian wilderness, and he's talking about bringing everybody in, and making this an inclusive society. Well to him, and to many people the quintessential Canadian experience is exactly that, being on a canoe in a lake in the middle of nowhere, and it is an experience that is beyond the financial means of some families. So to make that pitch is to say come and experience what Canada. Come and be part of the national story, which is this great lake, it feeds into his climate thing. I'm over thinking it. I mean you could take that it way, right. You could take it that way, or you could take it at we're at a point in time where the parties have perhaps run out of new ideas, and there's only so far they're willing to go to present new policy to Canadians to take things in a different direction than they've been taken before. And they're presenting tweaks on things that have worked previously because, hey, they worked previously.</p><p>MARTIN: But, Bill, I mean signature, we all thought, I think you, or someone was telling me that the signature platform for the Liberal party for reelection is going to be pharmacare, a national pharmacare plan. They roll out an aspirational maybe consultation to follow idea, and this sort of seems like a fill in the blanks to say we do have ideas, look, look over here, we're going to send people camping.</p><p>CURRY: Yeah. All the policy analysts and economists that you talk to are just pulling out their hair this campaign, because all the parties are not doing any grand vision. It's all micro targetting, every person, so the Conservatives have a tax credit for children's fitness programs. Well going camping is a similar thing to that. So every party is doing these things. This one today about camping, though, is not a tax credit it's an actual program, so I pity the poor parents. You're going to need a week off work I'm sure to go through all the forms and the paperwork to get your $2,000.</p><p>MARTIN: Logistically, though, you're underprivileged, it means you don't have a lot of money. How are you going to pick up roots here in Ottawa and go out to Banff?</p><p>CURRY: Well the good news is though, at first when you saw the news conference, he was talking a lot about national parks, so the good news is at least provincial parks qualify, so most big centres there's a provincial park nearby, so that's something you could do on the weekend. That always makes a little bit more sense and is at least doable.</p><p>MARTIN: All right. I'll move on. You had a good story on privacy. You're going to have to explain it to me because you're probably, I'm under thinking it, but go ahead and tell us what this issue is. It sounds pretty important.</p><p>CURRY: Right. Well Canadians are finding all, you know, people are showing up at their doorstep, the local candidate, people running for office, and they might already know what your name is, they know your address, they might even have your cell number, and they're wondering what on earth is going on here, and that's because these parties are all developing these massive databases based on what you click on their websites, or who knows where they're getting this information, but they have a detailed picture on everybody, and the privacy commissioner, in his view, says he has no jurisdiction to look at any of that. So Jim Balsillie, a man people will know from Blackberry and RIM, he has set up this group, Centre for Digital Rights, and he spent an entire, behind the scenes it's kind of interesting. So what they've done is they've launched five legal cases all at once to a bunch of watchdogs, Competition Bureau, CRTC, Elections Canada, Privacy Commissioner, BC Privacy Commissioner all saying you got to look at this, you know, enforce the rules, take a look at what they're doing. And he's been meeting with these regulators trying to get them to take on this case. So it's all about building pressure where if the government isn't going to act on this, maybe these watchdogs can put some pressure on these parties to do some basic things like what the parties have been asking for. Like if you want to know what's in your, these files, you should be able to ask for it. If they're going take your information and send it off to Facebook to do microtargetting you should know about that. So that's the kind of things that they're looking at.</p><p>MARTIN: What's the next step? Is he getting any feedback on this or he running into a wall?</p><p>CURRY: The watchdogs aren't commenting publicly. Balsillie's lawyer says that from his talks he's cautiously optimistic that some are going to look at it. Some seem more interested than others. At the Competition Bureau, there's a new commissioner there who's been giving some speeches about wanting to go after Facebook in this area, so who knows, but it will be fun to watch.</p><p>MARTIN: I mean, Steph, political parties are ahead of every other gatherer of data, aren't they?</p><p>LEVITZ: Yeah, it's interesting, because just to go back to our previous topic about new policy ideas, right, here is an area in Canadian social discourse, national discourse, that is crying out for some new policy about how the government chooses to regulate social media, these big tech companies, how they operate with our data, with our privacy, and one wonders if one of the reasons they don't go down that road is because these things are essential to them. They need this information. It's how they win elections now, these micro targeted ads. You know the three of us are sitting here, we can all go log on to Facebook tonight and we'll see a completely different ad, right. The parties depend on that. That's how they're winning. They're shopping around for votes. And so there's no incentive to them to try and self-regulate because, or try and regulate regulate because it would hurt them in the end, hurt their election chances and their campaign.</p><p>MARTIN: Should this be a discussion on the election?</p><p>CURRY: Yeah, and it's amazing that this last parliament never acted because there was examples. Cambridge Analytica in the UK, which they also worked on the US election, all about micro targetting people who are in specific segments to either discourage them to vote too, which is real nasty stuff, or encourage them.</p><p>MARTIN: All right. Well, we're out of time. That's interesting and kind of scary at the same time. All right, thank you both. We'll see you again next week. That is \"Power Play\" day 16 on the campaign trail. Only 16. All right, thanks for watching. Hope you can join us again tomorrow. Have a great evening.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5V-DM61-DYX2-90MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CTV Televisions, Inc.

But a contagious, fast-spreading virus that knows no borders.</p><p>Revenue also announced the suspension of the application of interest on late payments of VAT for the January-February return and late payments of employers\u2019 PAYE liabilities for February and March.</p><p>It also said no debt enforcement activity would take place until further notice and revealed other measures to reduce the regulatory burden.</p><p>Commercial rates have also been deferred for three months for those who can\u2019t pay them and all annual returns due to be filed with the Registrar of Companies between now and 30 June 2020 will be deemed to have been filed on time if all elements of the return have been completed and filed by that date.</p><p>The Central Bank weighed in too, cutting the capital buffer banks must hold to zero from 1% in order to enable them to release more credit into the economy.</p><p>The Government also worked with banks and large landlords to agreed to three-month mortgage and loan repayment deferrals for those who need them as well as a string of other services to help those in difficulty.</p><p>It represents a start, many measures which even a fortnight ago might have seemed unthinkable.</p><p>But realistically it will have to be only the beginning.</p><p>Government will have to do much, much more to support businesses and the wider economy through this period of uncertainty.</p><p>Employers group Ibec says \u20ac4bn of further income supports will be required if we are to avert a demand-side as well as supply-side shock to the economy.</p><p>It points to other European states such as Denmark for example where governments are paying up to 75% of staff wages, capped at \u20ac40,000, so money continues to flow into households.</p><p>Even our nearest neighbours in the UK are offering to pay up to 80% of wages capped at \u00a32,500 a month in situations where companies can\u2019t.</p><p>That way, when the pandemic does eventually subside, people will have money in their pockets and be ready to spend it in order to fuel the recovery.</p><p>There is also a chorus of business groups here, including the Irish Hotels Federation, calling for the rates deferral decision to be extended, with some even seeking a full waiver until after the crisis is over.</p><p> Dublin's main street on St Patrick's Day as the economic impact of Covid-19 becomes apparent </p><p>After all, they argue, what good is it putting off such payments for twelve weeks when during that period there is little or no cash coming into businesses.</p><p>Liquidity also remains a big concern, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, that will have to be addressed.</p><p>ISME wants the Government to rebate employers an amount up to 100% of their corporation, payroll and sales taxes collected last year.</p><p>It also wants a suspension of payroll taxes until employers can pay them, for a maximum of one year if required.</p><p>Working capital funds through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland at low or zero rates are also being sought.</p><p>\"While some of these measures appear drastic, they will cost less than the alternative of permitting six-figure job losses and widespread business closure,\" it said.</p><p>The multinational sector cannot be forgotten either and may require support.</p><p>Big pharma and medtech firms here may be able to manage on their own, provided they can keep production going, source raw materials and demand remains strong, which is likely.</p><p>Big tech too should be ok also, as they draw on robust balance sheets and leverage their head start in remote working.</p><p>But its the older style manufacturing multinationals here who will need to be watched.</p><p>Many supply components into the European market and the difficulties in maintaining production there could translate to problems here.</p><p>There will also be a need for a massive investment stimulus to get the country moving again once the health emergency has passed, according to Ibec.</p><p>This will ensure the recovery is V-shaped, it says, and will require upscaling public investment programmes for housing and other infrastructure as well targeted sector stimulus measures for firms most severely impacted.</p><p>The Irish Exporters Association wants \"a national plan\" to restart the economy.</p><p>This, of course, will all cost a huge amount of money. But so far Ireland is well behind its peers in what it has pledged.</p><p>The Government\u2019s Covid-19 fiscal measures announced to date, including state-backed loans, amount to 0.9% of GDP.</p><p>That compares to 16.3% of GDP in Germany, 16.1% in Spain and 15.3% in France.</p><p>A big gap which the Government has little choice but to try to make up businesses say.</p><p>Money which may have to borrowed just a year after we recorded a surplus for the first time since 2007.</p><p>It\u2019s all a far cry from the buoyant 2020 we thought we were entering into at the start of January.</p><p>A week may be a long time in politics.</p><p>But now can now safely say the same goes for the economy too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RTENEW-1124477</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTENEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YGC-1B61-JDRT-23P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352662</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1004\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RTE Commercial Enterprises Ltd / Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RTE News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62422\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 20, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>General News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000512</classCode><className>DISMISSALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC315</classCode><className>DENMARK</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Keith Ellison, a progressive in the upper ranks of the Democratic National Committee. In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission dated May 31, Ellison urged the watchdog agency to take a closer look at Google and its parent company, Alphabet, given that European regulators recently found that the search giant harmed its rivals and fined it $2.7 billion.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The FTC should determine whether Alphabet has engaged in similar conduct in the United States and whether such conduct violates the FTC Act,\" he wrote.</p><p>Ellison's letter arrived about a month after the FTC gained a fresh roster, including new Chairman Joseph Simons, who previously has spoken about the need for the agency to \"devote substantial resources to determining whether its merger enforcement has been too lax.\" Many experts took the statement as a sign that Simons could be tough on corporate consolidation and antitrust.</p><p>Simons has not spoken publicly about Google, and the FTC declined to comment. A Google spokeswoman did not immediately comment on Ellison's letter.</p><p>Going forward, though, Ellison's criticism could presage even tougher scrutiny for Silicon Valley if Democrats emerge victorious in the 2018 midterm elections.</p><p>\"We're seeing breaks in the ranks,\" said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, which has advocated for antitrust scrutiny of major tech companies. \"The Democratic Party is going to end up within the next two-to-three years doing something about big tech, because the rank and file is going to force them.\"</p><p>The probe Ellison seeks would mark Google's second antitrust investigation by the FTC. During its last inquiry, under President Barack Obama, the agency chose not to force Google to make major changes to its business practices or separate into smaller companies.</p><p>That decision didn't satisfy consumer advocates and corporate rivals, including Yelp, who still allege that Google continues to give preference in search results to its services over competitors --\u00a0one of the arguments that prompted Europe to levy its\u00a0fine. Citing those charges, Ellison on Thursday urged the FTC to release more information about its earlier probe. He also asked the FTC to detail whether Google had run afoul of a settlement it brokered with the agency in 2011 on another matter -- misusing its customers' private information.</p><p>Among Democrats, Ellison is not alone in encouraging the FTC to apply more pressure to Google or its peers. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) has previously recommended that the FTC to reopen its competition case. He and fellow Democrat Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.) also wrote the FTC in May to investigate the way Google tracks smartphone users' location data.</p><p>National party leaders, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), more generally have accused tech companies of trying to \"snuff out competition.\" And Senate Democrats rallied behind a political agenda in July 2017 that called for the creation of a new \"competition advocate\" in government that would be tasked with exploring areas \"like the role that online platforms play in keeping our markets fair and open.\" Democrats' \"A Better Deal\" blueprint also stressed that merger reviews should \"consider the ways in which control of consumer data can be used to stifle competition or jeopardize consumer privacy.\"</p><p>If Democrats capture the House or Senate in the midterm elections this November, the spoils of their victories would include control of the gavels on key committees with the power to hold hearings on the tech industry, dig deep into its business practices and grill executives about the extent to which they aid or inhibit competition.</p><p>\"There's no question that a series of acquisitions by just a few powerful technology companies has contributed to the centralization of information online - including the pathways for working Americans to access trustworthy news, commerce, and content,\" Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.), the top Democrat serving on the House's antitrust-focused subcommittee, said in a statement. \"Democrats are committed to restoring competition and aggressively cracking down on market power and economic concentration.\"</p><p>Politically, though, lawmakers' new push could also dent some Democrats' efforts to continue raising money from major Silicon Valley sources. Workers, companies and other entities in the computers and electronics industry so far have contributed more than $42 million to Democrats ahead of the 2018 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That's nearly double the amount that GOP candidates have received, the group's data show.</p><p>\"I don't care if they don't give me another penny,\" responded Ellison in an interview Thursday. \"It's not my job to look out for their profit margin.\"</p><p>Some Republicans similarly have trained their fire on the tech industry. That includes Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who opened his own probe to determine if Google is stifling competitors. Hawley is also running for a seat in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>Asked\u00a0whether Democrats would be tougher on tech if they controlled Congress, Ellison stressed: \"I hope so, but I'm not limiting my advocacy to just Democrats.\"</p><p>\"These folks are doing good things. I use them. I bought stuff off Amazon, and I get on Google several times a day,\" the congressman continued. \"There probably needs to be greater oversight. ... I don't want them so big they can control the markets.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-c9047227769e4990958b20591d60de59</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGF-TVX1-JB4M-V3V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 4, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

They said that while they worked hard to combat sex trafficking, changing the law ''jeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet'' that have been crucial to innovation for decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country's biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google and Amazonare a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.</p><p>  The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like <person><nameText>Stephen K. Bannon, </nameText></person><person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>former chief strategist, as well as <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.</p><p>  Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.</p><p>  ''There is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,'' said <person><nameText>Senator Richard Blumenthal, </nameText></person>a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.</p><p>  The companies, recognizing the new environment in Washington, have started to fortify their lobbying forces and recalibrate their positions. In the last year, Amazon has added antitrust to its roster of issues, hiring a former senior Senate staff member who helped shape antitrust policies. Googlehas paid several outside lobbying firms to argue against the sex trafficking bill, according to recent federal filings.</p><p>  ''We are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,'' said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google, Amazon and other tech companies.</p><p>  Tech companies have faced political pressure in Europe for years. That is expected to continue, with regulators prepared to push a new set of proposals to get the tech companies to pay more in taxes.</p><p>  The politics for the companies in the United States began to change after the 2016 presidential election, when attention turned to the role social media sites play in shaping public opinion. The  scrutiny grew after companies struggled to eliminate fake content from their sites, raising fears that the platforms were too big to manage.</p><p>  After <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>revealed to Congress that it had accepted money for political ads from fake accounts linked to Russia, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, started calling for new disclosure laws for the companies. He plans to begin writing a bill this week that requires <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other social media companies to release funding sources for political ads, as is required for television broadcasters.</p><p>  ''This is uncharted territory,'' Mr. Warner said in an interview. ''The growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.''</p><p>  Perhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.</p><p>  The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.</p><p>  Companies like Googleand <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Googleand <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.</p><p>  Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Googlerealized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.</p><p>  As of Tuesday, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Googlewere still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Googlesaid the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.</p><p>  Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.</p><p>  ''We'll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,'' Susan Molinari, Google's vice president of public policy, said in a statement.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>discussions with the lawmakers were private.</p><p>  ''We strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,'' Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>said in a statement.</p><p>  Senators have not held back their continued frustration with the tech industry, even as the position of the companies has changed somewhat. On Tuesday, the Senate commerce committee held an emotional hearing on bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, that included the mother of a teenage victim of trafficking.</p><p>  The Senate invited <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Googleto testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.</p><p>  ''Silicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,'' Mr. Portman said in the hearing. ''But selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.''</p><p>  Other issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.</p><p>  The New America Foundation, a left-leaning research group in Washington that is financed by Googleand Eric Schmidt, the chairman of its parent company, recently fired a division of antitrust scholars who had been critical of the company. Googlehas denied playing a role in the split. In California, big tech companies joined internet service providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast -- their adversaries on many policy issues -- to fight a state broadband privacy law, fearing that it could embolden other states and federal regulators to write broader internet privacy rules.</p><p>  Even Amazon's recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>  But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon's deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.</p><p>  Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.</p><p>  ''We need to start adjusting to a world where we are right now,'' said Ms. Klobuchar. ''Antitrust laws haven't been updated since the 1950s. In the 1950s, they didn't envision a major search engine dominating the internet. They didn't even have the internet.''</p><p>  Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Senator Richard Blumenthal, </nameText></person>Democrat of Connecticut, in Washington this month.

There is a rapidly growing market for affirmative cyber coverage, which is explicitly designed to pay cyber claims. Lloyd's of London estimated in a January report that global affirmative cyber premium for 2019 is $6.4 billion.</p><p>Cyber sell-by date</p><p>But there is evidence that the bulk of any cyber claims would still fall on policies not specifically designed to cover cyber. For example, loss data firm Property Claim Services puts insurance claims from the 2017 NotPetya malware attack at more than $3 billion, of which about 90% is silent, Artemis reported in November 2018.</p><p>\"Non-affirmative cyber has a sell-by date, because as an insurance industry we cannot continue to take on exposure for no premium and not tally what that exposure is,\" said Patrick Bousfield, executive director and head of the New York cyber practice at reinsurance broker Capsicum Re. \"It is just bad risk management.\"</p><p>Failure to tackle silent cyber could also be bad for the insurance industry's reputation. The confusion about what is covered in some cases means that insurance buyers are turning to the courts for clarity, as in the example of U.S. food company Mondelez's lawsuit alleging that Zurich Insurance Group AG was wrong to dismiss a NotPetya claim filed under a property insurance policy. Zurich has vowed to continue fighting the claim, ostensibly to send a message that property policies are not designed to pay cyber claims.</p><p>Speaking about settling cyber claims disputes in court generally, Bousfield said he was not apportioning blame to any particular part of the insurance chain, but \"I think it is a massive failure of the insurance industry if somebody who buys insurance then has to then sue their insurance company because there was an ambiguity.\"</p><p>He added: \"At a time when ... we have Amazon, Uber and these big tech firms trying to play in this space, the last thing we need to do is show that we don't have any efficacy as a P&amp;C industry.\"</p><p>There is also regulatory pressure in some jurisdictions. The U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority, for example, wrote to insurance CEOs in January, ordering them to come up with an action plan to tackle silent cyber. In the U.S., where each state has its own regulator, rating agency A.M. Best has been leading the charge in pushing insurers to tackle silent cyber, according to Bousfield.</p><p>Peer pressure</p><p>Insurers are looking for help from the reinsurance industry to help bear their silent cyber burden. But reinsurers want to see insurers making progress toward reducing the risk themselves before offering affordable cover, according to Luke Foord-Kelcey, international head of cyber at Aon Reinsurance Solutions, the reinsurance broking division of Aon PLC.</p><p>He noted that his company had placed silent cyber-specific business with reinsurers, adding: \"In order to make that placement possible, or at least economically efficient for the buyer, there is quite a bit of work to demonstrate to the reinsurers that you are sufficiently tackling the issue.\"</p><p>Insurers have a variety of tools to manage silent cyberrisk within standard policies, including outright exclusion, establishing cyber sub-limits within a policy or charging a specific premium for the cyber coverage within a policy. Yet a surplus of capacity in the commercial insurance market makes it tough for insurers to push through any of these changes.</p><p>\"All the things the insurers are trying to do, the brokers are pushing back against,\" said Siobhan O'Brien, international cyber practice leader at reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. \"It's an enormous issue and it is not going to be easily solved.\"</p><p>Insurers can try to encourage their customers to buy purpose-built, stand-alone cyber coverage, but it will be a tough sell as long as buyers believe cyber cover is available under standard policies.</p><p>\"There is a reluctance to spend yet more money on insurance coverage if you have potentially got elements of insurance coverage in your existing policies,\" said Mark Synnott, global cyber practice leader at Willis Re.</p><p>Although the PRA has pushed insurers to take action in the U.K., Synnott feels that elsewhere \"you have got less regulatory onus on the part of insurers and reinsurers to act.\" He also feels rating agencies have not stepped up to the plate.</p><p>\"They have certainly taken a view on affirmative cyber,\" he said, \"but to date I think they have been quite slow in taking any action on the potential for silent cyber.\"</p><p>Gerry Glombicki, director in Fitch Ratings' North American insurance group, said in an emailed statement that silent cyber is not specifically mentioned in his company's ratings criteria, as \"Fitch cannot detail every possible risk an insurer faces in a concise methodology.\" He added that during its interactions with insurers' management, silent cyber \"is addressed often in terms of trying to both quantify and mitigate this risk.\"</p><p>Years, not decades</p><p>Some big names, notably Germany's Allianz Group, have set out plans for dealing with their silent cyber exposures, and the issue is not necessarily one with which the industry will still be wrestling in a decade's time.</p><p>\"I hope for the viability of our industry it will be five years not 10 years,\" said Capsicum Re's Bousfeld. \"What we are seeing and hearing from a lot of the large insurers, and it will trickle down from there, is that they are sorting this.\"</p><p>Aon's Foord-Kelcey said: \"We always advise our clients that the road to ... the affirmation process, is not a short road, so we typically advise to allow some three or four years to complete that process.\"</p><p>Added Guy Carpenter's O'Brien: \"I don't think it is unsolvable. It is probably more a case of: it's manageable going forward.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLEFD-52342876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLEFD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCP-05K1-F19Y-C166-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">375841</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL European Financials Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 18, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0008RPR</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (GAMBIA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0007EFP</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (UK)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00076UC</classCode><className>ZURICH INSURANCE GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DL3U</classCode><className>PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>SIC6411 INSURANCE AGENTS, BROKERS, &amp;

There is a rapidly growing market for affirmative cyber coverage, which is explicitly designed to pay cyber claims. Lloyd's of London estimated in a January report that global affirmative cyber premium for 2019 is $6.4 billion.</p><p>Cyber sell-by date</p><p>But there is evidence that the bulk of any cyber claims would still fall on policies not specifically designed to cover cyber. For example, loss data firm Property Claim Services puts insurance claims from the 2017 NotPetya malware attack at more than $3 billion, of which about 90% is silent, Artemis reported in November 2018.</p><p>\"Non-affirmative cyber has a sell-by date, because as an insurance industry we cannot continue to take on exposure for no premium and not tally what that exposure is,\" said Patrick Bousfield, executive director and head of the New York cyber practice at reinsurance broker Capsicum Re. \"It is just bad risk management.\"</p><p>Failure to tackle silent cyber could also be bad for the insurance industry's reputation. The confusion about what is covered in some cases means that insurance buyers are turning to the courts for clarity, as in the example of U.S. food company Mondelez's lawsuit alleging that Zurich Insurance Group AG was wrong to dismiss a NotPetya claim filed under a property insurance policy. Zurich has vowed to continue fighting the claim, ostensibly to send a message that property policies are not designed to pay cyber claims.</p><p>Speaking about settling cyber claims disputes in court generally, Bousfield said he was not apportioning blame to any particular part of the insurance chain, but \"I think it is a massive failure of the insurance industry if somebody who buys insurance then has to then sue their insurance company because there was an ambiguity.\"</p><p>He added: \"At a time when ... we have Amazon, Uber and these big tech firms trying to play in this space, the last thing we need to do is show that we don't have any efficacy as a P&amp;C industry.\"</p><p>There is also regulatory pressure in some jurisdictions. The U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority, for example, wrote to insurance CEOs in January, ordering them to come up with an action plan to tackle silent cyber. In the U.S., where each state has its own regulator, rating agency A.M. Best has been leading the charge in pushing insurers to tackle silent cyber, according to Bousfield.</p><p>Peer pressure</p><p>Insurers are looking for help from the reinsurance industry to help bear their silent cyber burden. But reinsurers want to see insurers making progress toward reducing the risk themselves before offering affordable cover, according to Luke Foord-Kelcey, international head of cyber at Aon Reinsurance Solutions, the reinsurance broking division of Aon PLC.</p><p>He noted that his company had placed silent cyber-specific business with reinsurers, adding: \"In order to make that placement possible, or at least economically efficient for the buyer, there is quite a bit of work to demonstrate to the reinsurers that you are sufficiently tackling the issue.\"</p><p>Insurers have a variety of tools to manage silent cyberrisk within standard policies, including outright exclusion, establishing cyber sub-limits within a policy or charging a specific premium for the cyber coverage within a policy. Yet a surplus of capacity in the commercial insurance market makes it tough for insurers to push through any of these changes.</p><p>\"All the things the insurers are trying to do, the brokers are pushing back against,\" said Siobhan O'Brien, international cyber practice leader at reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. \"It's an enormous issue and it is not going to be easily solved.\"</p><p>Insurers can try to encourage their customers to buy purpose-built, stand-alone cyber coverage, but it will be a tough sell as long as buyers believe cyber cover is available under standard policies.</p><p>\"There is a reluctance to spend yet more money on insurance coverage if you have potentially got elements of insurance coverage in your existing policies,\" said Mark Synnott, global cyber practice leader at Willis Re.</p><p>Although the PRA has pushed insurers to take action in the U.K., Synnott feels that elsewhere \"you have got less regulatory onus on the part of insurers and reinsurers to act.\" He also feels rating agencies have not stepped up to the plate.</p><p>\"They have certainly taken a view on affirmative cyber,\" he said, \"but to date I think they have been quite slow in taking any action on the potential for silent cyber.\"</p><p>Gerry Glombicki, director in Fitch Ratings' North American insurance group, said in an emailed statement that silent cyber is not specifically mentioned in his company's ratings criteria, as \"Fitch cannot detail every possible risk an insurer faces in a concise methodology.\" He added that during its interactions with insurers' management, silent cyber \"is addressed often in terms of trying to both quantify and mitigate this risk.\"</p><p>Years, not decades</p><p>Some big names, notably Germany's Allianz Group, have set out plans for dealing with their silent cyber exposures, and the issue is not necessarily one with which the industry will still be wrestling in a decade's time.</p><p>\"I hope for the viability of our industry it will be five years not 10 years,\" said Capsicum Re's Bousfeld. \"What we are seeing and hearing from a lot of the large insurers, and it will trickle down from there, is that they are sorting this.\"</p><p>Aon's Foord-Kelcey said: \"We always advise our clients that the road to ... the affirmation process, is not a short road, so we typically advise to allow some three or four years to complete that process.\"</p><p>Added Guy Carpenter's O'Brien: \"I don't think it is unsolvable. It is probably more a case of: it's manageable going forward.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLAFD-52342876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLAFD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCP-05K1-F19Y-C148-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427785</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Asia-Pacific Financials Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 18, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0008RPR</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (GAMBIA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0007EFP</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (UK)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00076UC</classCode><className>ZURICH INSURANCE GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DL3U</classCode><className>PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>SIC6411 INSURANCE AGENTS, BROKERS, &amp;

Lloyd's of London estimated in a January report that global affirmative cyber premium for 2019 is $6.4 billion.</p><p>Cyber sell-by date</p><p>But there is evidence that the bulk of any cyber claims would still fall on policies not specifically designed to cover cyber. For example, loss data firm Property Claim Services puts insurance claims from the 2017 NotPetya malware attack at more than $3 billion, of which about 90% is silent, Artemis reported in November 2018.</p><p>\"Non-affirmative cyber has a sell-by date, because as an insurance industry we cannot continue to take on exposure for no premium and not tally what that exposure is,\" said Patrick Bousfield, executive director and head of the New York cyber practice at reinsurance broker Capsicum Re. \"It is just bad risk management.\"</p><p>Failure to tackle silent cyber could also be bad for the insurance industry's reputation. The confusion about what is covered in some cases means that insurance buyers are turning to the courts for clarity, as in the example of U.S. food company Mondelez's lawsuit alleging that Zurich Insurance Group AG was wrong to dismiss a NotPetya claim filed under a property insurance policy. Zurich has vowed to continue fighting the claim, ostensibly to send a message that property policies are not designed to pay cyber claims.</p><p>Speaking about settling cyber claims disputes in court generally, Bousfield said he was not apportioning blame to any particular part of the insurance chain, but \"I think it is a massive failure of the insurance industry if somebody who buys insurance then has to then sue their insurance company because there was an ambiguity.\"</p><p>He added: \"At a time when ... we have Amazon, Uber and these big tech firms trying to play in this space, the last thing we need to do is show that we don't have any efficacy as a P&amp;C industry.\"</p><p>There is also regulatory pressure in some jurisdictions. The U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority, for example, wrote to insurance CEOs in January, ordering them to come up with an action plan to tackle silent cyber. In the U.S., where each state has its own regulator, rating agency A.M. Best has been leading the charge in pushing insurers to tackle silent cyber, according to Bousfield.</p><p>Peer pressure</p><p>Insurers are looking for help from the reinsurance industry to help bear their silent cyber burden. But reinsurers want to see insurers making progress toward reducing the risk themselves before offering affordable cover, according to Luke Foord-Kelcey, international head of cyber at Aon Reinsurance Solutions, the reinsurance broking division of Aon PLC.</p><p>He noted that his company had placed silent cyber-specific business with reinsurers, adding: \"In order to make that placement possible, or at least economically efficient for the buyer, there is quite a bit of work to demonstrate to the reinsurers that you are sufficiently tackling the issue.\"</p><p>Insurers have a variety of tools to manage silent cyberrisk within standard policies, including outright exclusion, establishing cyber sub-limits within a policy or charging a specific premium for the cyber coverage within a policy. Yet a surplus of capacity in the commercial insurance market makes it tough for insurers to push through any of these changes.</p><p>\"All the things the insurers are trying to do, the brokers are pushing back against,\" said Siobhan O'Brien, international cyber practice leader at reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. \"It's an enormous issue and it is not going to be easily solved.\"</p><p>Insurers can try to encourage their customers to buy purpose-built, stand-alone cyber coverage, but it will be a tough sell as long as buyers believe cyber cover is available under standard policies.</p><p>\"There is a reluctance to spend yet more money on insurance coverage if you have potentially got elements of insurance coverage in your existing policies,\" said Mark Synnott, global cyber practice leader at Willis Re.</p><p>Although the PRA has pushed insurers to take action in the U.K., Synnott feels that elsewhere \"you have got less regulatory onus on the part of insurers and reinsurers to act.\" He also feels rating agencies have not stepped up to the plate.</p><p>\"They have certainly taken a view on affirmative cyber,\" he said, \"but to date I think they have been quite slow in taking any action on the potential for silent cyber.\"</p><p>Gerry Glombicki, director in Fitch Ratings' North American insurance group, said in an emailed statement that silent cyber is not specifically mentioned in his company's ratings criteria, as \"Fitch cannot detail every possible risk an insurer faces in a concise methodology.\" He added that during its interactions with insurers' management, silent cyber \"is addressed often in terms of trying to both quantify and mitigate this risk.\"</p><p>Years, not decades</p><p>Some big names, notably Germany's Allianz Group, have set out plans for dealing with their silent cyber exposures, and the issue is not necessarily one with which the industry will still be wrestling in a decade's time.</p><p>\"I hope for the viability of our industry it will be five years not 10 years,\" said Capsicum Re's Bousfeld. \"What we are seeing and hearing from a lot of the large insurers, and it will trickle down from there, is that they are sorting this.\"</p><p>Aon's Foord-Kelcey said: \"We always advise our clients that the road to ... the affirmation process, is not a short road, so we typically advise to allow some three or four years to complete that process.\"</p><p>Added Guy Carpenter's O'Brien: \"I don't think it is unsolvable. It is probably more a case of: it's manageable going forward.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLINS-52342876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLINS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCP-05K1-F19Y-C1B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360261</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Insurance Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 18, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0008RPR</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (GAMBIA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0007EFP</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (UK)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00076UC</classCode><className>ZURICH INSURANCE GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DL3U</classCode><className>PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>SIC6411 INSURANCE AGENTS, BROKERS, &amp;

Google generated $136.8 billion in revenue in 2018. And Facebook boasts 2.3 billion monthly active users, or more than a third of the Earth's population.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each company has faced complaints that their sheer size and scale give them monopoly status. But their rapid and largely unsupervised growth has created privacy and other risks for consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, those regulatory winds may be starting to blow in another direction. After decades of inactivity, Congress, the Trump administration and investors are finding common ground to take on these companies.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which share responsibility for antitrust enforcement, have reportedly arrived at something of a divide-and-conquer approach, with the DOJ taking on Apple and Google and the FTC digging into Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee has announced its own investigation of tech companies and their potential monopoly power. On June 3, the committee launched what it billed as a \"bipartisan investigation\" into the digital marketplace and the businesses that control it. Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said at a hearing that the committee is investigating because \"there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content and communications.\"</p><p>\"Big Tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\" said the panel's ranking Republican, Doug Collins of Georgia. \"More and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive.\"</p><p>With bipartisanship so rare in the current Congress, particularly efforts to take on a massive business sector, it begs the question: Why now?</p><p>The answer is a combination of rising public concern over privacy and influence, as well as attention from 2020 presidential candidates and tougher measures by the European Union.</p><p>\"Antitrust at its best was always historically bipartisan,\" says Maurice Stucke, a former prosecutor in the Antitrust Division at Justice who now works in the private sector with the Konkurrenz Group, teaches law at the University of Tennessee and has authored several prior and upcoming books on competition policy in the digital age.</p><p>\"It isn't like we just woke up,\" Stucke says of the current regulatory push. \"It's the grinding away. You look at every measure of our economy ... how is it helping most Americans? And when you look at the economic measures, most of them are still pointing to a market power problem. And so I think that you're getting this backlash.\"</p><p>Echoes From Long Ago</p><p>More than a century after the immense chasm of wealth inequality in the Gilded Age led to the first U.S. antitrust law, vast disparities in wealth and opportunity are similarly challenging today's social order. Piles of research from the past decade seek to compare that earlier era with the current one, with our tiny fraction of American multi-billionaires, a larger percentage of multi-millionaires and 40 million people living below the poverty threshold.</p><p>While economists study and argue about what led us to this moment and what might lead us out, measures of public sentiment back Stucke's reading of the room.</p><p>A 2018 report by the Pew Research Center found the real average wage -- accounting for inflation -- to be on par with the purchasing power of the real average wage from 1978. About 63 percent of respondents to a different Pew survey that same year said they felt the U.S. economic system unfairly advantages the rich.</p><p>While oil, steel and railroads fueled the fortunes of the original robber barons, the modern U.S. economy runs on code, and the tech titans of Silicon Valley are the face of modern wealth. They are also the target of our other, more faceless concerns about privacy, surveillance, autonomy and even the future of democratic governance itself.</p><p>Facebook is not just a social network, but one of the world's largest advertising platforms -- and available globally. Nearly three years after the 2016 elections, the degree to which Russia sought to sway the outcome by using digital tools -- not only Facebook but also Google and Twitter -- to reach U.S. voters is still being realized.</p><p>Other elections globally, such as the United Kingdom's 2016 Brexit vote or recent EU elections, are also subject to interference from malicious actors using digital platforms. Facebook now frequently publishes updates about banning \"inauthentic\" actors from its site, such as a May 6 release involving two separate operations originating in Russia that created \"networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing.\"</p><p>Against this backdrop of both economic frustration and political frustration, the building tide of backlash becomes easier to see.</p><p>Political Winds</p><p>Though the formal congressional investigation has only just begun, Washington sentiment has been slowly turning against Big Tech.</p><p>Last September the Justice Department, at the time under the leadership of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, held a meeting with attorneys general from eight states and the District of Columbia to discuss ways in which privacy issues from Facebook and other tech firms might be challenged as anticompetitive.</p><p>President Donald Trump in November also offhandedly said during a televised interview that \"we are certainly looking at\" potential antitrust violations on the part of Facebook, Amazon and Google.</p><p>The DOJ has taken initial steps toward the opening of a federal antitrust investigation into Alphabet's Google, The Washington Post reported in May. The company escaped significant punishment over its alleged anticompetitive practices in 2012 when the FTC found no violation of antitrust law from the way Google arranges search engine results, but its luck may be running out.</p><p>Democrats, too, are considering the question as one of many issues on the crowded 2020 campaign field.</p><p>Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has for several years championed strong antitrust action to increase competition in the market, boost the creation of new business and both reduce prices and increase wages for consumers and workers. In March, she announced a public pledge to use antitrust law to break up existing large tech firms as a plank of her presidential campaign.</p><p>The 2020 presidential race is very much the biggest open question casting a shadow over any and all investigations of potentially anticompetitive behavior in the tech sector. Who will sit in the White House, and what they believe, can change everything.</p><p>Recent history provides an example: The DOJ mounted an antitrust case against Microsoft  in the late 1990s, alleging the company was not only behaving anticompetitively in the way it bundled other products such as Internet Explorer in with its Windows operating system, but in doing so was also violating a 1994 settlement agreement.</p><p>In the spring of 2000, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a judgment split into two parts. The first determined Microsoft's dominant position in the personal computer market to be a monopoly and found that the company had acted anticompetitively to quash potential threats.</p><p>The second followed the DOJ's request and ordered Microsoft broken up as a remedy. The order indicated the company should become two distinct entities: One to produce the Windows operating system, and the other to produce Microsoft's other software, including Internet Explorer and the Office suite of products.</p><p>The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2001 vacated Jackson's ruling, and in September 2001 the DOJ -- now under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush -- said it was no longer seeking to break up the company, instead pursuing different penalties.</p><p>Taking a breakup off the table \"was a political decision,\" Stucke says. \"It wasn't necessarily a legal consequence. If [Democrat Al] Gore was elected, there might have been a different Microsoft. We just don't know. It's not like there are just these natural forces in play.\"</p><p>Meantime, tech companies are working hard to woo lawmakers to their side.</p><p>Google spent about $21.7 million on lobbying in 2018, the eighth-highest amount of any single organization or company, according to data published by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Amazon and Facebook also cracked the top 20 last year, spending $14.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively.</p><p>European Crackdown</p><p>U.S. regulators in fact are among the last in an information-economy world to take on the technology firms in Washington's own backyard.</p><p>Germany's competition regulator, the Bundeskartellamt, launched an investigation into potentially anticompetitive behavior by Amazon last November, \"supplementing\" another probe into Amazon's treatment of third-party merchants being run by the European Commission's competition bureau.</p><p>The Bundeskartellamt also imposed \"far-reaching restrictions\" on Facebook in February, limiting its ability to collect and collate user data from multiple sources without explicit consent, citing \"exploitative abuse\" of users.</p><p>\"Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts,\" Bundeskartellamt President Andreas Mundt said in a February statement.</p><p>Many authorities, advocates and activists have questioned Facebook's methods for gathering and using consumer data, but the ruling from the Bundeskartellamt is the first to challenge its data practices directly on the grounds of market dominance. </p><p>In light of Facebook's unmatched market power, the Bundeskartellamt determined, \"an obligatory tick on the box to agree to the company's terms of use is not an adequate basis for such intensive data processing,\" because the user's choice \"cannot be referred to as voluntary consent.\"</p><p>European Union regulators have also been busy. The EU in March fined Google 1.49 billion euros for antitrust violations, the third time in as many years the commission penalized Google for anticompetitive conduct. The first, in June 2017, was a then-record 2.42 billion euro fine; a year later, in July 2018, the commission again set a new record by hitting Google with a 4.3 billion euro fine for abusing market power with regards to bundled software, such as the Chrome browser and Google search tools, on Android phones.</p><p>Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, antitrust chief for the European Commission, in a May interview also said she was \"definitely not done yet\" with investigating and potentially penalizing U.S. tech firms.</p><p>Competition regulators in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and other jurisdictions have likewise been considering how best to regulate tech firms and are discussing where the line between massive market power and anticompetitive market dominance is best drawn.</p><p>Public Pressure</p><p>Some investors, tired of waiting for Washington to act, are taking matters into their own hands. A resolution put forward for consideration at Alphabet's annual meeting of shareholders suggested that Alphabet \"may be too large and complex to be managed effectively,\" and noted that both U.S. and EU officials \"continue to be concerned about Alphabet's market power in view of restrictions on monopolies.\"</p><p>In light of those concerns, the resolution said, the board should study \"strategic alternatives\" for the business, including pre-emptively selling off some businesses or assets, as doing so would be more likely to maximize shareholder value than a breakup by regulators.</p><p>Alphabet investors, following the recommendation of the board, voted against the resolution at the company's June 19 meeting. Facebook faced a very similar shareholder resolution at its annual meeting in May, which was also voted down.</p><p>Who Is Harmed?</p><p>Ultimately any effort to rein in the tech behemoths may require wrestling with the key antitrust question: Can the government show that anyone is hurt by the alleged anticompetitive behavior?</p><p>Traditionally, regulators have focused on monopoly pricing power -- whether a company or group of participants is so dominant in a market that it can raise prices at will. With Google, Facebook and others providing their consumer products for free, a broader approach to judging harm may be needed, regulators say.</p><p>Existing law is up to the challenge, Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Antitrust Division at DOJ, said when he addressed the issue at a conference in Tel Aviv on June 11. But he added that the definition of harm from anticompetitive behaviors may be due for some careful reconsideration.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, the financial cost for the end consumer to use a service such as Facebook or Google is $0, which makes it difficult to argue that the companies' behavior is harmful based on price. Consumers typically don't pay for those services, which generate profit by monetizing users' app and web histories and data they often unknowingly provide.</p><p>That tradeoff of privacy for access, however, can involve another kind of payment -- and as German regulators recently determined, consumers making that trade may not be fully willing or fully informed.</p><p>A lack of competition, due to an anticompetitive marketplace, can harm product quality, Delrahim said, and privacy and data protections can be considered under that \"product quality\" banner.</p><p>Multiple companies in a sector can \"compete to expand privacy protections for products or services, or for greater openness and free speech on platforms,\" he told his audience in Tel Aviv.</p><p>\"Where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections,\" Delrahim concluded. \"Protecting competition means protecting all of those dimensions of competition.\"</p><p>Source: CQ Magazine<br/>Copyright 2019 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

Amazon[4], Facebook[5] and Google[6] are all reported to be willing to have their CEOs face questions about whether their companies are engaging in anti-competitive behaviors   The Washington Post[7] says the three companies have 'signalled' their plans, while Apple has not. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai signaled they are open to testifying to Congress as part of lawmakers' ongoing antitrust probe into the tech industry, while Apple has not yet explicitly agreed to send its leader. </p><p>The companies' commitments came in letters sent this weekend to the House Judiciary Committee, which has been investigating big tech since last year, according to two people familiar with the matter [] Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also has signaled he will participate in the hearing, after the e-commerce giant initially resisted lawmakers' demands [] Apple, meanwhile, told the committee that it would send a senior executive yet did not clearly commit its leader. The bipartisan Congressional probe is aiming to find out whether tech giants capitalize on their size to give themselves an unfair advantage over smaller companies, and whether they act in ways which are contrary to the best interests of consumers. In Apple's case, most of the concerns center on the cut the company takes from App Store sales and in-app payments and subscriptions. We've noted before[8] that this is just one of a slew of antitrust investigations into Apple. Apple is facing antitrust investigations on a number of fronts. In addition to the Congressional hearings, theDepartment of Justice[9]has its own investigation; theFederal Trade Commission[10]is investigating the legality of a deal between Apple and Amazon;a number of US states[11]are carrying out wide-ranging antitrust inquiries of their own;there are[12]anumber[13]ofcases[14]inother[15]countries; anda slew of lawsuits[16]. The latest of these was announced just yesterday[17]. Apple is now formally facing investigations on its conduct regarding the App Store and Apple Pay. European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager today said that the probes are a priority and revolve around Apple's role as gatekeeper. The Apple Pay investigation will look into whether Apple unfairly locked out competing contactless payment services by restricting the use of the NFC chip inside iPhones. The App Store investigation centers on the mandatory use of Apple In-App Purchase system for third-party apps, and the 30% revenue cut that implies. AsDaring Fireball[18] suggests, agreement from the other companies makes it seen unavoidable for Tim Cook to testify in person at the hearings. 'I'll go if you go' sounds a lot like the social dance of teenagers, but, well, some social interactions scale all the way up to the CEOs of the biggest companies in the world.

He declined to talk about it yesterday.  </p><p>Speaking at the recent swearing in of Justice Helen Winkelmann as Chief Justice before the mosque shootings, Parker predicted challenges for her in the area of social media. ?(EURO)oeWhere does the limit lie between freedom of speech and harmful fake news or hateful propaganda??(EURO) he asked.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeWhat duties are owed by those who profit from social media platforms to society, private citizens, or to the public institutions which democracy relies upon?  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThese are very important and complex issues for our time and the wisdom of the courts you lead will help achieve wise outcomes.?(EURO)  </p><p>And speaking after an assault on Green Party co-leader James Shaw just a day before the mosque shootings, Parker criticised the role of social media in spreading extreme opinions that fed political biases.  </p><p>He said the British digital culture, media and sport select committee, which looked into the issues of disinformation and fakes news, was right to call out the kind of extreme opinion shared via social media which fuelled biases and caused instability among some people.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeWe need to reflect upon what?(EURO)(TM)s going on in society that causes people to be so extreme in their reactions to things they disagree with,?(EURO) he said of last month?(EURO)(TM)s report.  </p><p>The committee called for:  </p><p>?-A compulsory code of ethics for tech companies overseen by an independent regulator.  </p><p>?-The regulator to be funded by a levy on tech companies operating in Britain.  </p><p>?-Powers for the regulator to launch legal action against companies breaching the code of ethics.  </p><p>?-Social media companies obliged to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation.  </p><p>?-Hefty fines for companies that fail in their obligations on harmful or illegal content.  </p><p>In releasing the report, MP Damian Collins said: ?(EURO)oeDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised ?(EURO)~dark adverts?(EURO)(TM) from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day.?(EURO)  </p><p>Collins said the big tech companies were failing in the duty of care they owed to their users to act against harmful content.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThese are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the ?(EURO)~move fast and break things?(EURO)(TM) culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission.?(EURO)  </p><p>Little, who is also in charge of the Harmful Digital Communications Act, says there is a willingness in Government to look more closely at what is wrong with social media and what powers could be used to rein in the worst aspects of it.  </p><p>He agreed social media was becoming more toxic. ?(EURO)oeIt?(EURO)(TM)s kind of got to the point where it?(EURO)(TM)s almost a parody of itself. You go on Twitter to bathe in the toxicity and putrescence of it.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeOn the other hand, I?(EURO)(TM)ve seen stuff on Facebook which causes my toes to curl and wonder about the mentality of some people.?(EURO)  </p><p>The act was about ?(EURO)oeclear expressions of hatred and threats expressed towards individuals through the internet, social media platforms and the like?(EURO), Little said.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeOne of the challenges [for] the law always has been to draw that line between upholding and protecting free speech but on the other hand clearly dealing with expressions that are calculated to cause harm or incite others to cause harm.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThe law is always trying to find that balance. I believe that legislation that we?(EURO)(TM)ve got in place ... does that.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeIf there?(EURO)(TM)s any call for review or change, let?(EURO)(TM)s have a look at that.?(EURO)      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHPlbmedia26</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR5-TYM1-F12B-J45V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Bloomberg broke\u00a0the news of China's alleged attack earlier this month, but many\u00a0experts, U.S. and U.K. security agencies and\u00a0the Silicon Valley-based companies\u00a0whose\u00a0products were supposedly affected, all expressed strong doubt that the attack happened in the manner reported, if at all. I count myself among them.</p><p>True or not, the report fueled an important discussion about whether businesses should make security more of a priority when it comes to their supply chains. Even the simplest devices can rely on parts from multiple suppliers, which may have their own suppliers and so on. But every supplier, no matter how small, represents a potential weak link in the chain. Hardware or software can present an entry for attack. Parts and algorithms can be altered to introduce malicious behavior. The technology used to manage the supply chain that provides the parts - such as the databases that hold contracting or ordering information - can also be breached and manipulated.</p><p>Supply chain risk management, as it's known, is the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to a supply chain and developing strategies to prevent a disruption anywhere along the road, from design to production to distribution. It encompasses cyber as well as more conventional threats. And yet, while every supplier in the chain needs to consider ensuring their systems are protected from tampering, identifying each supplier is a herculean task. It's impossible to determine which ones pose the most risk if you can't identify them, let alone try to ensure they comply with the most effective security practices. When the supplier is a continent away, the task is even more difficult.</p><p>Furthermore, the suppliers are running a business and want to maintain a competitive advantage. Companies are reticent to identify their sub-suppliers since a customer might skip the intermediary to obtain parts for less. Or a supplier lower on the chain might try to negotiate a higher price after learning what fancy product is being manufactured.</p><p>Solutions - largely commercially available products and frameworks - do exist to help manage supply-chain risks posed by conventional threats, including disruptions in operations caused by natural disasters, financial failures or poor-quality products. They offer features like geographic visualization that give locations and transportation routes of critical assets in the supply chain, real-time monitoring that provides news and updates about suppliers and compliance trackers to keep track of industry regulations.</p><p>But none of these solutions magically provides full visibility into a product's supply chain and processes, and most do not explicitly address vulnerabilities and threats specific to cybersecurity. This is likely because the cyber component of supply chain risk management is so nascent, and it is already a challenge to address conventional risks.</p><p>Furthermore, the unwillingness or inability of suppliers to share specific details about their supply chains could hamper the effectiveness of such solutions. While some sub-tier suppliers, in particular those supplying the Department of Defense, are required to report their security posture back to the top-level company or agency purchasing the product, there is often no oversight or auditing to make them prove they are maintaining appropriate security standards. Having formal requirements for doing so could help in selecting \"less risky\" suppliers and might reduce the overall likelihood of malicious manipulation.</p><p>One way to create such oversight is for the government to create a new authority that focuses on supply chain security and has the power to conduct meaningful audits. Or the task could be shared by existing organizations that already assess conventional supply chain risk.</p><p>Even if the the \"Big Hack,\" as Bloomberg called it, never happened, it serves as a potent reminder of the cybersecurity risks to the supply chain. Companies also need to do their part by establishing internal teams to oversee and guide risk assessments and audits of suppliers, lengthen timelines for production to make it easier to monitor the supply chain, and purchase goods from suppliers that comply with basic cybersecurity standards and are verified by an independent third-party organization.</p><p>Functionality, timeliness and profitability are often at odds with security - until a cyberattack occurs.\u00a0When an actual attack on the supply chain occurs, manufacturers and purchasers should be better positioned to respond and recover. Even in this modern high-tech era, old-fashioned oversight could make all the difference.</p><p>                          This was produced by                                                  The WorldPost                                                 , a partnership of the                                                  Berggruen Institute                                                  and The Washington Post.                    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-2b24dfb51dfe4b408aa54ec4e1c1f88c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TH3-75V1-DXKP-J1XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><timeReceived>3:29 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 16, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0005O62</classCode><className>RAND CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000218C</classCode><className>ADVANTAGE COS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC8732 COMMERCIAL ECONOMIC, SOCIOLOGICAL, &amp;

In an apparent response to these pressures, M&amp;A activity in pharma is back. This month, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced its $74 Billion acquisition of Celgene, and Eli Lilly did the same with its $8 Billion acquisition of Loxo. (At the recently concluded JP Morgan Healthcare Conference (JPM), the pharma/biotech sector's biggest event of the year, Eli Lilly's CEO indicated that conditions are ripe for an M &amp; A uptick in 2019)</p><p><br/>Acquisitions may be one way to stay on top of the marketplace changes; however, organic growth pressures remain. One way to address the challenge is through digital transformation. However, digital strategies within and across individual sub-sectors in healthcare may look different depending on what companies want to achieve at a corporate level, at a commercial level, and a technology level.<br/>Digital in pharma: eliminating frictionHealthcare is on a mission to put the focus back on patients, improve engagement levels and achieve better healthcare outcomes, and reduce costs. Digital has become the price of entry into a future state implied by this renewed focus. Digital is also seen as a powerful tool for differentiation.<br/>The most crucial purpose of a digital strategy may be the elimination of friction in the healthcare value chain. There are many areas that are ripe for improvement in pharma. One of them is to enable drug development by being able to measure things objectively to prove drug efficacy and demonstrate value. Another is to accelerate clinical trials through improved ways of recruiting and managing patients. Yet another is to develop digital therapeutic solutions to augment revenue streams.<br/>Greg Silvesti, Head of Digital Health and Innovation at Abbvie, (a $28.2 billion company best known for its blockbuster drug Humira), says that pharma companies are dancing on a pinhead for differentiation today. He suggests that digital itself isn't a strategy but an enabler to an overall strategy and a tool to unlock value. An overall digital strategy can be a combination of approaches depending on the strategic goals of the company. However, the key is building the approach with digital as an enabling technology for the overall strategy of the company.<br/>The maturing of digital health and its challenges in pharmaThe digital health space has matured in the last few years, attracting an eye-popping $8.1 billion in venture capital funding in 2018. There is no question that we are seeing a shift in how healthcare is being delivered through new digital health solutions. Telehealth is growing, as is remote monitoring. Vast amounts of increasingly diverse data sources from sensors and devices can now be aggregated and combined with traditional data sources such as electronic health records. Advanced analytical tools are now available to process these vast amounts of data in low-cost infrastructure on the cloud to develop and deliver insights at the point of care.<br/>However, the digital health startup ecosystem has not made as much progress as expected. Many startups have failed, and many are unable to provide an exit to investors. Even big tech firms with huge investments in health cloud platforms are yet to make a significant impact. I have discussed some of the challenges for digital health startups in general including the Last Mile problem and the Law of Small Numbers in earlier columns here.<br/>Succeeding in pharma requires digital health companies to recognize some unique principles and characteristics of the sector.<br/>\u00a0<br/>A positive ecosystem supports growth of all participants. Huawei Cloud aims to establish an ecosystem to help partners across the globe.<br/>Data is not worth muchA few years back, everybody was fascinated by just the data that could come off of a smart sensor or wearable. The internet of things (IoT) was all the rage. What we have seen since is that there is not that much value in data; in addition to issues with data quality, sufficiency, and interoperability, simply being able to capture transactional metrics off of smart sensors and wearables does not create tremendous value, unless we are able to obtain actionable information by using advanced analytics such as artificial intelligence or AI. \u00a0<br/>Forget the widget, focus on the problemFor many startups, digital health comes down to just an app. Startups that develop interesting technology also get stuck in trying to figure out a healthcare problem to apply it to; essentially, actually attacking the issue backwards. Silvesti advises people to get out of the mindset of being too enamored by the \"widget.\" He urges companies to focus more around the problems that pharma is trying to solve, for example in a patient population, and then working backwards into the ultimate solution for that patient population. \u00a0<br/>Recognize that pharma and the tech sector operate at different speedsPharma does not speak the same language as the tech sector and operates in a very traditional and straightforward way which may seem agonizingly slow to most of the tech sector (just ask startups that pivoted from a B2C to a B2B model thinking it will yield quicker results for their investors). Pharma is also much more deliberate in thinking about buy-borrow-build options for technology solutions. For their part, digital health companies have to resist building out a product completely; instead build it up to about 50% to 60% of the way, leaving room to develop the rest with a partner. Many pharma companies, including Abbvie, have set up innovation funds that take stakes in promising startups and actively collaborate on developing the products. (At the JPM conference, GlaxoSmithKline's CEO indicated the company would also be buying some of these early stage assets.)<br/>Ultimately, digital in pharma is not about the technologies; it is about solving the right problem and allowing the solution to evolve. It is taking a step back right from the sexiness of the technology which we all love to talk about and ensuring that everything is truly grounded in corporate strategy. In that sense, digital in and of itself it is not a strategy but an enabler to the broader bigger strategy.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1241043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DK-G4S1-JBYT-H1DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002S4Z</classCode><className>ELI LILLY &amp;

Not being a practising Catholic, the idea of being refused communion wouldn't bother me in the slightest.

From a Catholic perspective it was particularly appalling that \"Catholic\" politicians seemed to do so with impunity.</p><p>A number of brave priests did step up to the mark and clearly state that support for abortion was incompatible with Catholicism. In this context it is heartening to learn that Fr John Hogan refused communion to a politician who effectively voted for abortion.

The state should be separate from, and neutral towards, all forms of spirituality. Once that is accomplished, it would be unremarkable that Catholic politicians who supported gay marriage, abortion etc could not remain \"in good standing\" with the church.</p><p>The private spirituality of Irish politicians would then be just that - private.

However, it is paradoxical to assert that \"pimps and traffickers should be the target of our legislation\" while also endorsing \"legalisation\".</p><p>Legalising prostitution includes decriminalising pimping, and doesn't result in a reduction in sex trafficking. This is evident from regimes such as those in Germany and the Netherlands where pimps and traffickers benefit from these laws.</p><p>Normalising prostitution through legalisation increases demand. With growing demand come increasing vacancies to fill by coaxing, tricking and abusing vulnerable and impoverished women, including promises of a better life which don't materialise behind the closed doors of a brothel.</p><p>Sex buyers are not a benign cohort. Our 2018 campaign Andreea, available on the Ruhama YouTube channel, featured a fictitious prostituted woman identifying herself as a victim of trafficking. Some 68% of prospective buyers who called her nonetheless requested sexual services.</p><p>We advocate that those selling or sold for sex are legally protected. A vital component of the recent Sexual Offences Act 2017 was the decriminalisation of individuals in prostitution. The only law striving to meaningfully reduce the exploitation of prostitution is this \"partial decriminalisation\" model: decriminalising the seller while targeting both criminal organisations and demand.</p><p>                   Amanda Keane, Ruhama                   Caught in the act                    </p><p>Proponents of the 2017 act argued that a fear of prosecution for buying sexual services would lead to a fall in the number of clients, leading to a fall in the number of prostitutes required to cater for the reduced client base and, crucially, a consequent reduction in the number of girls trafficked as their transnational pimps noted the dramatic shrinkage in the number of Irish clients willing to risk conviction.</p><p>In other words, this law was introduced as a result of a crass conflation of trafficking and prostitution.</p><p>How many people have been convicted of trafficking for prostitution since the law was introduced? Apparently none.</p><p>The weight of outrage and determination for justice should have been specifically directed at those trafficking pimps - but in fact we already had specific legislation addressing that. The conflation of \"ordinary\", \"domestic\" prostitution with trafficking and transnational sex slavery was pointless. More importantly it was counterproductive, and is obviously proving unworkable.</p><p>                   C MacCarthy, by email                   Power ahead                   </p><p>I only buy one newspaper a week - The Sunday Times - and I congratulate you on the high standard of your writers. The one I most look forward to each week is Brenda Power. In the middle of screaming outrage, she is the voice of reason and common sense. It was recognised as a gift in the old days, and Power has it in abundance.</p><p>                   WM Patterson Manorcunningham, Co Donegal                   IRELAND IS VICTIM OF BREXIT FOLLY                   </p><p>Ireland did not vote for Brexit, Britain's folly, yet is going to be devastated by it, and some British people do not care one whit (\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pro-choice-td-troy-is-denied-holy-communion-6bqfcbnnj\">Border? What Border?</url></p><p>\", News Review, last week). Brexit, and its inevitable borders, are Britain's responsibility; it is they who voted for this mess. Yet Ireland is being victimised due to Britain's lack of planning, lack of interest, and arrogance.</p><p>                   Carrie McIntyre, Drogheda, Louth                   Heavyweight opportunity                   </p><p>Never in the field of political conflict has such a number of inept self-serving politicians been assembled in the mother of parliaments. As a result of the Brexit fiasco, people in Northern Ireland must surely now realise that the English do not care about this state, other than being kept in power by the Democratic Unionist Party.</p><p>That caricature of a politician Jacob Rees-Mogg once described the taoiseach Leo Varadkar as \"a rather lightweight Irish gentleman\". Well, his government have succeeded in making the taoiseach, a man bereft of any statesmanship, appear gargantuan. The UK's difficulty is now the Republic of Ireland's opportunity. And why not?</p><p>                   Wilson Burgess, Derry                   Undemocracy rules                    </p><p>Some 56% of the Northern Ireland electorate voted to remain. That rises to 65% in a recent opinion poll. All political parties in Northern Ireland, with the exception of the DUP, are remainers.</p><p>Those same parties, again with the exception of the DUP, supported Theresa May's deal. The small business community and the CBI in Northern Ireland supported the deal; the (mainly Protestant) Ulster Farmers' Union supported the deal.</p><p>When Ken Clarke recently described the DUP as sectarian and Protestant, he could easily have added self-serving and undemocratic.</p><p>                   Stephen McGarrigle, Co Tyrone                   Check off                    </p><p>When will Irish politicians realise the Republic is a small, insignificant part of Europe and dependent for most of its trade on the UK? A workable system for off-border checks was proposed early in the negotiations and rejected by Varadkar for internal political reasons.</p><p>                   William Berrow, Northampton                   Tread carefully                    </p><p>David Quinn neatly highlighted the way Irish politicians tiptoed around any reference to nationalism or \"taking back control\" during the recent ceremonies to mark the meeting of the first Dail (Comment, last week). No doubt they were scared of using any rhetoric that might link them to those obstreperous Brits and their drive to escape Brussels rule.</p><p>Our leaders apparently see no contradiction in honouring the revolutionary movement while ceding large amounts of our hard-won independence to EU institutions.</p><p>                   Martin Hand, Marino, Dublin                   Down tools                    </p><p>Compromise will win. Everyone knows the EU is using Ireland as a negotiation tool. If they allow the border issue to be reopened, there will be a very negative reaction not just from the Irish but many others in the EU about how they force nation states to do things against their wills.</p><p>                   Ian Skeet, Reading                   POINTS                   Safe space                   </p><p>It is deeply concerning that material which effectively promotes suicide and self-harm is so easily accessible online (\"Big Tech firms pushing teens into 'suicide trap'\", News, last week).

Self-regulation just hasn't worked in the face of self-harm forums, gaming addiction, cyber-bullying and online grooming.

Galway is great for running festivals and promoting street events by the likes of Macnas, but is an absolute \"dead zone\" in terms of its lack of provision for art to be displayed or performed. There is no public art gallery, no school of music, and no large concert venue.

Die so selbst- wie machtbewusste Wettbewerbskommissarin hat sich \u00f6ffentlichkeitswirksam mit der deutschen Autoindustrie und amerikanischen Digitalkonzernen angelegt und sich dabei viele Feinde gemacht. Nun greift sie nach der EU-Pr\u00e4sidentschaft.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Im ehemals gr\u00f6\u00dften deutschen Paketpostamt kommt erst Stimmung auf, als Margrethe Vestager das Kommando \u00fcbernimmt. Seit einer halben Stunde sitzt die EU-Kommissarin f\u00fcr Wettbewerb bei der re:publica in Berlin-Kreuzberg auf der B\u00fchne. Die gro\u00dfe Konferenz rund ums Infotainment in der Digitalgesellschaft ist f\u00fcr Vestager die perfekte Gelegenheit, um ein paar Grunds\u00e4tzlichkeiten \u00fcber Fairness und Wettbewerb in der Facebook- und Google-Welt loszuwerden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Der Moderator hat die D\u00e4nin im Stil eines Marktschreiers als \"Popstar der EU-Kommission\" und eine der \"gef\u00fcrchtetsten Frauen im Silicon Valley\" angek\u00fcndigt. Doch was folgt, ist eine beh\u00e4bige Fragerunde. Das Interesse des Publikums am Gast aus Br\u00fcssel ist begrenzt, viele scrollen auf Smartphones durch ihre Mails und Twitter-Accounts. Bis es Vestager reicht. Sie wei\u00df, was ihre Fans im Auditorium h\u00f6ren wollen, sagt: \"Ich glaube, viele hier teilen meine Frustration mit der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung: Es ist gut, dass wir diese digitalen B\u00fcrgerrechte jetzt haben. Aber es w\u00e4re noch sch\u00f6ner, wenn wir sie auch ausprobieren k\u00f6nnten.\" Endlich horcht der Saal auf. Vestager legt nach: \"Das h\u00e4tte jetzt aber einen viel, viel gr\u00f6\u00dferen Applaus geben m\u00fcssen.\" Gel\u00e4chter, gel\u00f6ste Mienen, gro\u00dfer Applaus. Na also.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HANDELN UND WANDELN .</p><p>Vestager ist es gewohnt, dass sie das Tempo und die Richtung bestimmt. Sie hat die Milliardenfusion von O2 und Hutchison abgelehnt und den Zusammenschluss der B\u00f6rsen in Frankfurt und London verhindert. Sie hat ein Lkw-Kartell zerschlagen und die in Berlin und Paris erw\u00fcnschte Zusammenlegung der Bahnsparten von Siemens und Alstom abgeblasen. Derzeit pr\u00fcft sie, ob deutsche Autobauer illegale Absprachen trafen, um die Einf\u00fchrung umweltfreundlicher Technologie zu verz\u00f6gern. Und nat\u00fcrlich legt sie sich immer wieder mit Big-Tech an.</p><p>2016 verdonnerte Vestager Apple zu einer Steuernachzahlung von 13 Milliarden Euro, die der US-Konzern im Mitgliedsland Irland zu wenig entrichtet hatte. Sie f\u00fchrte gleich drei Verfahren gegen Google: weil der Konzern Produkte seiner Tochterunternehmen bei Suchanfragen bevorzugte, weil Google \u00fcber sein Handybetriebssystem Android seine Suchmaschine zum Standard machte und weil Google seine marktbeherrschende Stellung missbrauchte. Am Ende standen Milliardenstrafen.</p><p>Seit Wochen denkt Vestager laut \u00fcber eine Zerschlagung von Facebook nach, wenn auch als \"last resort\" der EU-Kartellpolitik. Und sie untersucht, ob Amazon die Daten von kleinen Verk\u00e4ufern auf seiner Handelsplattform missbraucht, um sich ihnen gegen\u00fcber einen unrechtm\u00e4\u00dfigen Vorteil zu verschaffen. Man m\u00fcsse dar\u00fcber nachdenken, sagt Vestager, ob diese Daten wirklich Amazon geh\u00f6rten - oder ob es daf\u00fcr nicht eine quasistaatliche, unabh\u00e4ngige Daten-Verwaltungs-Agentur br\u00e4uchte.</p><p>Vestagers Handeln, ihre Auftritte, beeindrucken viele. Von der Netzelite wird sie gefeiert, von Konzernchefs gef\u00fcrchtet, von Politikern bewundert, von Journalisten gew\u00fcrdigt, inzwischen auch in den USA. F\u00fcr den \"Atlantic\" ist sie \"the most important technocrat of the century\", f\u00fcr das \"Wall Street Journal\" die \"Regulatorin des Silicon Valley\", f\u00fcr \"Foreign Policy\" eine der zehn einflussreichsten \"globalen Denkerinnen\" der vergangenen zehn Jahre. Selbst US-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump, dessen Europakenntnisse sich oft darauf beschr\u00e4nken, dass er Belgien f\u00fcr eine \"wundersch\u00f6ne Stadt\" h\u00e4lt, huldigt Vestager fast ehrf\u00fcrchtig als \"tax lady\".</p><p>Weltweit ist der Name Vestager in den vergangenen Monaten fast schon zu einem Synonym geworden f\u00fcr die Selbstbehauptung Europas - f\u00fcr eine EU, die sich als Hort einer regelbasierten Wirtschaft begreift, als ordnungspolitische Alternative zum vulg\u00e4ren Nationalkapitalismus in den USA und zum Kaderkapitalismus in China.</p><p>Liberale Regierungschefs, darunter Frankreichs Staatspr\u00e4sident Emmanuel Macron, verhehlen nicht, dass sie sich die D\u00e4nin als Nachfolgerin von EU-Kommissionspr\u00e4sident Jean-Claude Juncker w\u00fcnschen. Auch Kanzlerin Angela Merkel sch\u00e4tzt ihre Sachkenntnis und Entschlossenheit.</p><p>Und doch ist Vestagers Kr\u00f6nung nicht sicher. Nicht nur wird immer wieder Kritik laut am F\u00fchrungsstil der Kommissarin. Auch sind zuletzt eine Reihe ihrer so popul\u00e4ren Entscheidungen von Gerichten wieder kassiert worden. Vor allem aber gestaltet sich das Personal-Puzzle nach der Wahl zusehends schwierig. Zu viele Posten sind neu zu besetzen, zu viele Proportionalit\u00e4ten zu ber\u00fccksichtigen: Wer leitet k\u00fcnftig die Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank? Wer wird Hoher Au\u00dfenbeauftragter? Eine Chance auf den Top-Job hat Vestager wohl nur, wenn sich Macron und Merkel auf sie verst\u00e4ndigen - und das Europaparlament davon abl\u00e4sst, nur Spitzenkandidaten als Kommissionschef zuzulassen. Vestager ist eben das nicht. Und ihre liberale Fraktion mit ziemlicher Sicherheit nicht st\u00e4rkste Kraft im Parlament.</p><p>Es ist ein Dilemma: Alle sind sich einig, dass niemand in Europa der liberalen D\u00e4nin derzeit das Wasser reicht, wenn es um wertegeleitete Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit und Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit geht, um Sachinteresse und Tatkraft. Dennoch hat sie ihre Zukunft nicht mehr selbst in der Hand.</p><p>Wer Vestager trifft, erlebt eine zuvorkommende, h\u00f6fliche Frau, die doch ihr Selbst- und Machtbewusstsein kaum verhehlen kann. Nat\u00fcrlich, argumentiert Vestager, gehe es im Kampf gegen die \u00dcbermacht der Valley-Konzerne nie nur um ein paar Milliarden Euro. Sondern darum, wer die \"Regeln f\u00fcr das n\u00e4chste Jahrhundert\" setzt: Facebook und Google - oder sie, Margrethe Vestager, im Interesse von 500 Millionen Europ\u00e4ern.</p><p>Die Kommissarin agiert, anders als ihr Vorg\u00e4nger Joaquin Almunia, mit einer Mischung aus politischer Feinf\u00fchligkeit und Unnachgiebigkeit: um Popularit\u00e4t bem\u00fcht, ohne populistisch zu sein. Sie ignoriert in ihren Reden Europas Radikale, weil sie sie in der Minderheit wei\u00df, sie nicht durch Aufmerksamkeit aufwerten will. Stattdessen lobt sie Europa als den \"besten Platz zum Leben\", auch wenn verst\u00e4ndlich sei, warum sich viele Menschen von der EU abwendeten: Br\u00fcssel sei oft zu kompliziert, gewiss, zu un\u00fcbersichtlich. Br\u00fcssel habe ein \"Ort der L\u00f6sungen, nicht des Streits\" zu sein.</p><p>BAUCHGEF\u00dcHL UND KOPFKRITIK .</p><p>Kopenhagen, ein regnerischer Freitag, zwei Wochen vor der Europawahl. Margrethe Vestager hat sich einen schwarz-neongelben Schutzanzug \u00fcber ihr farbfroh-gebl\u00fcmtes Seidenkleid gezogen und im Yachthafen, gleich hinter der Meerjungfrau, ein Speedboat bestiegen. Es geht zum Europe Youth Summit, ein Politik-Festival, das auf der k\u00fcnstlichen Insel im Hafen der d\u00e4nischen Hauptstadt 200 Jugendliche versammelt.</p><p>Merkel oder Macron w\u00e4ren wohl mit dem Helikopter eingeflogen. Doch das passt nicht zum Auftritt der 51-J\u00e4hrigen. Sie will ein neues, kraftvolles, dynamisches Europa verk\u00f6rpern, sich dabei buchst\u00e4blich Wind und Wetter stellen. Und so steht sie, kaum angekommen, den Regen noch im kurzen, grauen, markant geschnittenen Haar, schon auf dem Kai und gibt Interviews, ruft wenig sp\u00e4ter, den Jugendlichen im Saal zu: \"Es war meine Generation, die nicht verstanden hat, was der Klimawandel bedeutet. Wir brauchen euch, um Europa den richtigen Weg zu weisen. Wir brauchen euch, um unsere gemeinsame Zukunft zu bauen.\" Frenetischer Applaus. Ovationen im Stehen. Vestager \"rockt\", sagt einer der Organisatoren.</p><p>Sie hat das: ein Gesp\u00fcr f\u00fcr Situationen und Stimmungen. Kann sich in junge Menschen ebenso hineinversetzen wie in Professoren. Als die Mutter dreier Kinder Anfang Februar einen H\u00f6rsaal an der Universit\u00e4t Cambridge betritt, liest sie den Raum wie eines ihrer Kommissionspapiere. Sie sucht den Blickkontakt zu den Zuh\u00f6rern, saugt die Stimmung auf, sagt dann, noch bevor sie \u00fcber die neuen Herausforderungen f\u00fcr das EU-Wettbewerbsrecht referiert: \"Ich biete Ihnen heute einen Brexit-freien Moment an.\" Sto\u00dfartig, als h\u00e4tte jemand gut gel\u00fcftet, weicht die Spannung aus dem Raum, macht Platz f\u00fcr eine lockere, offene Debatte.</p><p>Bauchgef\u00fchl ist ihr politischer Kompass, ihr Instinkt legend\u00e4r. Als Vestager in Br\u00fcssel ankam, dachte sie dar\u00fcber nach: Wie f\u00fchre ich am besten die Generaldirektion Wettbewerb? Am Ende, sagt sie, sei ihr \"nichts wirklich Gutes\" eingefallen. \"Also habe ich es gemacht wie immer.\" Auf die \"skandinavische Art\": Jeder kann in seiner Rolle zum Erfolg beitragen. Hierarchie ist nicht so wichtig. Die T\u00fcr steht offen.</p><p>Bei ihren Beamten kommt das gut an. Vestager schenkt ihnen schon mal pers\u00f6nlich Kaffee ein, h\u00f6rt gut zu, durchdringt die Themen, gibt ihren Leuten das Gef\u00fchl, wichtig zu sein. Doch sie kann auch anders. Lob verteilt sie gerne pers\u00f6nlich, Tadel indes l\u00e4sst sie \u00fcberbringen - oder wird ihn vor versammelter Mannschaft los. Wie beim deutschen Juristen Johannes Laitenberger, ihrem obersten Beamten, den sie vor der Truppe zurechtwies, weil er auf Fachtagungen zu explizit angedeutet hatte, in welche Richtung sich die Kommission in Sachen Wettbewerbsrecht bewegen k\u00f6nnte. Sie sei die Kommissarin, beschied Vestager ihm. Sie verbreite Neuigkeiten. Niemand sonst.</p><p>Den Job erledigen. Die \u00d6ffentlichkeit wissen lassen, dass man ihn erledigt. Gut, gewissenhaft, kraftvoll. Der Rest kommt von allein. Das ist Vestagers Machtgeheimnis.</p><p>Wenngleich es daran auch Kritik gibt. Als sie gleich nach der Amts\u00fcbernahme 2014 den ersten Google-Fall neu aufrollte und dekretierte, der US-Konzern habe Wettbewerber in seiner Shopping-Suchmaschine prominent zu listen, da gab es daf\u00fcr viel Applaus. Laut Vestager hat sich seither einiges getan, kommen kleinere Google-Wettbewerber zum Zug. Kritiker aber monieren, dass Google sich nicht an die Auflagen halte, \"Vestager will das Thema aussitzen\" ,so Fairsearch, eine Anti-Google-Lobbygruppe.</p><p>Auch andere prominente F\u00e4lle haken. Das EU-Gericht, die Instanz unter dem Europ\u00e4ischen Gerichtshof, hob zuletzt eine Serie von Vestagers Entscheidungen wieder auf, kam etwa zu dem Schluss, dass Belgien mit seinen Steuerrabatten f\u00fcr multinationale Konzerne nicht das EU-Recht verletze, wie von Vestager festgestellt. Das Urteil best\u00e4tigt jene Juristen, die davon ausgehen, dass auch Vestagers 13-Milliarden-Steuer-Nachforderung an Apple nicht Bestand haben wird.</p><p>SUPERMACHT UND KONTROLLVERLUST .</p><p>Vestager ficht das nicht an. Ihre D\u00e4nen sind ohnehin stolz auf die machtbewusste Kommissarin. Margarethe die Dritte nennen sie Vestager hier, als w\u00e4re sie eine Nachfahrin der K\u00f6nigin. Schon als Vize-Premier schrieb man ihr mehr Einfluss zu als der damaligen Regierungschefin Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Diesen \"Machtinstinkt\" habe sie in Br\u00fcssel gesch\u00e4rft, sagt eine alte Weggef\u00e4hrtin. Auch viele Europ\u00e4er w\u00fcnschen sich eine furchtlosere EU mit einer resoluten Kommissionsspitze. Und es ist kein Geheimnis, dass Vestager sich die Juncker-Nachfolge zutrauen w\u00fcrde. Als \u00d6konomin verf\u00fcgt sie auch theoretisch \u00fcber das R\u00fcstzeug, um Europa im Systemwettbewerb richtig zu verorten, gerade gegen\u00fcber China. Dort gebe es \"noch viel Spielraum f\u00fcr Europa, hartn\u00e4ckiger zu sein, etwa beim globalen Handel\", sagt Vestager. Das sei wohl ein Job f\u00fcr die Kommissionsspitze. Ein Job f\u00fcr sie.</p><p>Ist Vestager am Ende die richtige Frau, zur richtigen Zeit - nur in der falschen Partei? Um wirklich etwas zu \u00e4ndern, sagt Margrethe Vestager gerne, auch an die Adresse der Regierungschefs gerichtet, m\u00fcsse man sich selbst \u00fcberwinden. \"Das ist das Mutigste, was ein Mensch tun kann.\"</p><p>Damit das geschieht, muss es jedoch gl\u00fccklich laufen f\u00fcr sie: am Sonntag in Europa. Und bei den Wahlen in D\u00e4nemark Anfang Juni. Und auch wenn es derzeit nicht danach aussieht, als ob Vestagers liberale Partei der n\u00e4chsten Koalition in Kopenhagen angeh\u00f6ren wird - vielleicht hilft ihr am Ende der Br\u00fcsseler Erfolg. \"Ich bin in Kopenhagen beliebt, weil ich nicht hier bin\", sagt sie.</p><p>In Europa ist es eher umgekehrt: Sie macht sich bei den Richtigen unbeliebt - und man freut sich, dass sie in Br\u00fcssel ist.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Text und Bild als PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PDFWW20190524020\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"4872\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WRTWCH-WW8EC92987D4A543B7A8208E3A0C6490FB</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRTWCH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5T-5YM1-JDTJ-X0M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401704</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Handelsblatt GmbH - ein Unternehmen der Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt GmbH &amp; Co.

Supposedly, big technology companies like Amazon and Google want to be in the real estate finance business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their entry is inevitable, loanDepot CEO Anthony Hsieh warned at NMN's Digital Mortgage Conference last September.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Lots of power there, lots of intellect, and these companies understand digital,\" Hsieh said. \"There's no doubt they're going to widen their products and services. You have big brands making bets to add products and services. You have real estate service and lending companies looking at each other: we're friends. Or will that turn into foe?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's understandable for lenders to be concerned. But if this incursion is so certain, why hasn't it happened yet?</p><p>For starters, the barriers to entry in mortgage lending are still relatively high, particularly when it comes to regulatory compliance.</p><p>Besides licensing, there are various forms of net worth requirements to be a mortgage banker, including state regulations, warehouse lenders and secondary market partners. Audited financials are usually required to show that lenders meet those requirements. While the costs may not be a burden for Amazon, going through the process is not a simple task.</p><p>On the compliance side, mortgage originators are subject to examinations by state regulators. There are also rules addressing quality control, appraisals, loan officer compensation and other forms of expenses that cut the net income from originating a loan.</p><p>Or it may just be that Amazon has simply been too busy to consider mortgages in between acquisitions like Whole Foods, its increasingly contentious development of a second headquarters on the East Coast and other ongoing efforts to branch out beyond online retail into entertainment, cloud computing, mobile technology and other categories.</p><p>But make no mistake, any industry where data and automation hold a unique advantage presents an attractive opportunity for large technology developers. And given Amazon's uncanny ability to understand consumers and deliver an exceptional digital experience, it may be able to succeed where so many others have tried and failed.</p><p>There is a willing audience that would turn to Amazon and Google for a financial product instead of a traditional provider, according to a recent Fannie Mae study.</p><p>Approximately 16% of all respondents, including 20% of those aged between 18 and 34, trust their favorite financial technology company to handle their mortgage, according to Fannie's third-quarter 2018 National Housing Survey. However, nearly two-thirds said they do not trust any of the big technology firms - Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook - to provide any financial product out of concerns over data breaches and privacy.</p><p>Other surveys indicated similar interest by consumers in using nontraditional providers for a financial product. Nearly 20% of consumers would use Amazon or Google for their home insurance, according to a J.D. Power survey released in August 2018. For millennials, that increased to 33% willing to use Amazon to obtain a property/casualty policy and 23% for Google.</p><p>Meanwhile, a 2012 study from Carlisle &amp; Gallagher found one in three consumers said they would consider getting a mortgage from Walmart, while just under half said they would contemplate getting one from PayPal. But it is no sure thing that positive consumer sentiment around these big name companies translates into a sustainable mortgage business model.</p><p>\"Amazon is a good example of a tech firm that has the ability to scale its platform across industries, and the mortgage industry is mired in legacy platforms,\" said John Cabell, director, financial services customer satisfaction at J.D. Power. \"This combination makes it attractive for slick newcomers like Amazon and others.\"</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this story. Still, plenty of big names - technology firms, traditional retailers and providers of other financial services - have tried and failed to bring mortgage under the corporate umbrella.</p><p>In most cases, their demise was related to housing market cyclicality, especially during the Great Recession. But now, what might be keeping tech firms out are the regulatory and compliance burdens of the business.</p><p>\"These structures are daunting for newcomers. More than half of the mortgage origination customer experience is influenced by regulations, so lenders have to start with that template when creating a customer journey,\" Cabell said.</p><p>But some of that regulatory burden could shift because of the new fintech charter proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The charter allows holders to avoid state licensing while not letting them obtain federal deposit insurance. Some observers note this charter would work well for a nonbank digital lender.</p><p>Employees of chartered fintechs that originate mortgages would be included under the SAFE Act, which exempts mortgage loan officers who work at covered financial institutions such as OCC-regulated banks from state licensing requirements - but they would still have to be registered with the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System.</p><p>Should tech firms make a play in mortgage, they would likely seek to differentiate themselves by creating a user experience that meets the desires of the millennial generation, the largest pool of potential homebuyers.</p><p>\"As we know, over the long term, distinctive value and customer experience are critical to success in any market,\" Cabell said. \"The mortgage industry, lagging in customer adoption of digital usage by comparison with other financial services products, is no exception. Continuous improvement and adaptation now in this area are clear priorities for lenders as they plan for their future competition. Whoever that might be.\"</p><p>Those lenders that offered digital mortgage capabilities resulted in enhanced mortgage lender customer satisfaction, J.D. Power's 2018 originator survey concluded.</p><p>However, \"lenders may be making big assumptions about what consumers expect or know about a digital mortgage experience,\" Cabell said about the results from a separate J.D. Power consumer survey conducted in late 2018 about digital mortgages.</p><p>\"This industry uncertainty and the portability of technology expectations by consumers from retailers like Amazon may provide fertile ground for disruption,\" he added. \"If traditional lenders are unable to crack the code on creating seamless mortgage customer experience that balances the best of human and digital interaction, then perhaps new entrants will do so first.\"</p><p>If Amazon does indeed enter the mortgage business, it won't be the first time it's gotten involved in a highly regulated, complex and expensive industry. It made a significant push into the public policy debate involving health care. During 2018, the company entered into a joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase looking to improve how health care is distributed by reducing costs, aligning incentives and empowering the employees of the three companies.</p><p>The joint venture \"we hope will help improve the satisfaction of our health care services for our employees (that could be in terms of costs and outcomes) and possibly help inform public policy for the country. The effort will start very small, but there is much to do, and we are optimistic,\" Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to stockholders last April.</p><p>That announcement was followed by reports Amazon put out a request for proposal to team up with banks for an Amazon-branded checking account. Amazon also teamed up with Chase and Synchrony Financial to offer credit cards to consumers and with American Express to offer a small-business credit card.</p><p>Amazon, so far, has partnered with existing companies for its financial offerings. That makes it a question on whether it would become a direct lender, like Zillow through its recent purchase of Mortgage Lenders of America. There are all sorts of other arrangements that Amazon could adopt, such as franchising, joint ventures and affinity relationships.</p><p>The M&amp;A route does have its own issues. \"Skeptics have warned that Zillow will face an uphill battle,\" Cabell said. \"Unlike Amazon, which has been on an equally ambitious journey to reinvent retail, Zillow is operating in the notoriously cloistered world of residential real estate, where many - even Google - have tried and failed to disrupt the status quo.</p><p>\"It's not an easy business, and incumbents still have an edge when it comes to navigating the labyrinth of local contacts, entrenched relationships, and proven business models. But, the world and customer expectations are changing.\"</p><p>Google made a pair of attempts to enter the mortgage lead generation business. Not the financial success the company hoped for, it shut Google Advisor Mortgage in February 2012 after paring back the service the prior November.</p><p>The second try, done as part of the Google Compare product suite, was in conjunction with Zillow and LendingTree but it was short-lived - announced in November 2015 and gone by March 2016 when the entire service shut down, also for financial reasons.</p><p>Amazon's own reputation is at stake no matter which structure it chooses as its method of participating in the mortgage industry. Even before the social media era, a poor customer experience led to plenty of negative word of mouth campaigns.</p><p>Then there is the compliance risk. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stated that mortgage lenders are responsible for the acts of the third parties they hire.</p><p>Costco has an exclusive marketing relationship for its members to get access to mortgage loans with First Choice Loan Services. The parties work in conjunction with Affinity Partnerships, which monitors the participating lenders in the program.</p><p>\"There is an old loan originator adage which goes something like this: In every loan application a major issue or a bomb is waiting to go off, and it is the responsibility of the loan officer to defuse it before it does,\" said Affinity Partnerships president and CEO John Alexander. \"Our mission is to ensure Costco members have lenders who they can trust and are looking out for their best interests. When we do that, everyone wins.\"</p><p>Costco is not affiliated with either First Choice or Affinity Partnerships, nor is it responsible for any of the activities of the participating lenders. Alexander is also a director of First Choice.</p><p>Costco members access the program through a website. It has been in existence for 10 years, and it was recently renewed with a multiyear agreement.</p><p>There is an oversight provider to ensure participating lenders are focused on the needs of Costco members and that they are \"being treated in the Costco way,\" Alexander said.</p><p>\"To us it means each lender and their team must focus on doing what is right for the member first and foremost. In many cases, this impacts lender profitability. This is clearly not the most profitable for lenders and the demands for service are extremely high.\"</p><p>Costco \"has a heightened standard of customer service and value. Aggregated information is shared with them to assure them their members are happy and they're getting the value and the service they expect when they walk into a Costco warehouse,\" Alexander said.</p><p>Besides First Choice and its parent Berkshire Bank, other lenders participating are J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, Lending.com, Strong Home Loan and NBKC Bank.</p><p>Affinity Partnerships monitors and shares metrics about customer service with the participating lenders on a weekly basis. Companies that fail to meet those metrics have been removed from the Costco partnership.</p><p>It wouldn't be a stretch for Amazon to adopt a membership-only model because it already offers one, Amazon Prime. Mortgages could be another enticement to get people to join, much in the same way it uses the television programing it provides.</p><p>Another option is to create a mortgage brokerage franchise business along the lines of Remax Holdings' Motto Mortgage.</p><p>In less than two years, Motto has sold 100 franchises. Motto is merely a franchisor; it provides technology, sales, marketing and lead generation support, all of which are up Amazon's alley.</p><p>Motto is not licensed as a mortgage company. Each individual franchisee is responsible for compliance and licensing. Even though the legal risk is mitigated, the reputational risk remains.</p><p>Zillow's acquisition of MLOA was motivated by a desire to offer mortgages in its home flipping business, rather than the broader consumer market, the company said. Still, the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions used the Zillow deal as the reason in a letter to the House Financial Services Committee why fintech companies must be regulated.</p><p>Zillow was looking for institutional knowledge and experience when it decided to get into mortgage lending. \"We certainly realize our strength today is in technology,\" said Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgage at Zillow. \"That's why we wanted to acquire a company with a seasoned team and a long history of successful purchase originations throughout business cycles.\"</p><p>As a mortgage lead generator, Zillow was already licensed as a mortgage broker in 40 states and the District of Columbia. But it didn't originate loans using those licenses.</p><p>\"The most comparable type of company for what we're doing with Zillow Offers and mortgages are homebuilders, which have a long and rather successful history building and then selling homes and then also providing mortgage to the buyers of those homes through affiliated mortgage companies,\" said Lantz.</p><p>Zillow's name attracts consumers like a \"bug zapper\" to search for properties said John Campbell, managing director at Stephens. \"Zillow's approach over the last two years is aggressively moving down the funnel\" into other portions of the real estate transaction and this deal fits that mold, he said.</p><p>MLOA \"makes that bug zapper tool much better for the sell side\" of the real estate transaction, Campbell said.</p><p>The most successful cross-branding between the tech world and mortgage world is Quicken Loans. In October 1999, Intuit, a firm known for its accounting and tax preparation software, agreed to purchase Rock Financial from Dan Gilbert for $370 million. The technology company already operated a broker, QuickenMortgage.</p><p>After the acquisition, those businesses were combined and Rock Financial was renamed Quicken Loans. However, in June 2002, Intuit, because it changed its marketing focus to small businesses from consumers, sold the mortgage lender back to a holding company controlled by Gilbert for $23.3 million. But as part of that transaction, Intuit licensed the Quicken name to the new holding company, an arrangement that continues to this day.</p><p>While Quicken Loans has been in the forefront of the digital mortgage revolution, much of its current success comes from its reputation for service; it has consistently been at the top of the J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys over the past several years for originators and servicers.</p><p>Others left the mortgage industry as part of a refocusing back to their core business during a down cycle.</p><p>Online mortgage marketplace LendingTree got into the business through the purchase of HomeLoanCenter.com in September 2004 from its founder, Hsieh - the man behind loanDepot.</p><p>But in 2011, in the midst of the down real estate cycle and deciding to get back to its roots in the lead generation business, LendingTree sold HLC (then branded as LendingTree Loans) to credit card lender Discover. After several delays, the transaction was completed in the second quarter of 2012.</p><p>It took Discover only three years to realize the mortgage business could not meet its financial expectations, and it closed the rebranded Discover Home Loans in June 2015.</p><p>And for the record, Discover's former corporate parent, Sears, bailed on the mortgage business in 1993, as part of a broader divestiture of all its financial business as the retailer, troubled even back then, looked to refocus and save money. Sears, already the parent of Allstate, decided in the mid-1970s to expand its financial services footprint (including owning a real estate company) as an extension of its retail business.</p><p>Some other big names that pulled out of mortgages: General Electric, GM, Prudential, Ford and H &amp; R Block.</p><p>GE, which left the prime mortgage business around 2000, purchased subprime lender WMC Mortgage in 2004 at the beginning of the boom. Three years later, as the bust took a toll on the financials, the unit was shut.</p><p>GE remained on the hook for representation and warranty obligations for securities sold during that era, and the company is under federal investigation for possible Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act violations.</p><p>GE also owned a mortgage insurer, which it - along with its life insurance business - spun off into Genworth Financial in 2004 to focus on higher growth businesses.</p><p>General Motors was hit hard by the recession and the automaker was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2009. Its mortgage businesses were heavily weighted toward originating and servicing nonconforming loans and they suffered in the recession; GMAC Mortgage was cited for foreclosure document problems.</p><p>Before the mortgage crisis, Option One Mortgage was a strong performer for its owner, tax preparation firm H&amp;R Block. But by 2006 Option One became a drain on H&amp;R Block's financial results and the remnants were sold in 2008 to WL Ross &amp; Co., a company controlled by current Commerce Secretary William Ross.</p><p>In 2001, Microsoft bailed on its attempt to get a foothold in the mortgage industry, when it shut down HomeAdvisor Technologies Inc., citing a decision to focus on its core business.</p><p>Even travel website Priceline entered the mortgage business, holding a 49% interest in a joint venture with EverBank that started in 2001. But the venture was dissolved in July 2009 during the crash, although Priceline did walk away with an $8.9 million payout from the value of the venture's remaining assets.</p><p>Another option for a nonfinancial company like Amazon getting into mortgages is to go the private-label route, and hire an outsourcer to do the work in its name.

Then Amazon came along.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In October 2015, Amazon's cloud computing arm announced it was copying Elastic's free software tool, which people use to search and analyze data, and would sell it as a paid service. Amazon went ahead even though Elastic's product, called Elasticsearch, was already available on Amazon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Within a year, Amazon was generating more money from what Elastic had built than the start-up, by making it easy for people to use the tool with its other offerings. So Elastic added premium features last year and limited what companies like Amazon could do with them. Amazon duplicated many of those features anyway and provided them free.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In September, Elastic fired back. It sued Amazon in federal court in California for violating its trademark because Amazon had called its product by the exact same name: Elasticsearch. Amazon ''misleads consumers,'' the start-up said in its complaint. Amazon denied it had done anything wrong. The case is pending.</p><p>  Not since the mid-1990s, when Microsoft dominated the personal computer industry with Windows, has a technology platform instilled such fear in competitors as Amazon is now doing with its cloud computing arm. Its feud with Elastic illustrates how it brandishes power in that technical world. </p><p>  While cloud computing may appear obscure and geeky, it underlies much of the internet. It has grown into one of the technology industry's largest and most lucrative businesses, offering computing power and software to companies. And Amazon is its single-biggest provider.</p><p>Amazon has used its cloud computing arm -- called Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. for short -- to copy and integrate software that other tech companies pioneered. It has given an edge to its own services by making them more convenient to use, burying rival offerings and bundling discounts to make its products less expensive. The moves drive customers toward Amazon while those responsible for the software may not see a cent.</p><p>  Even so, smaller rivals say they have little choice but to work with Amazon. Given the company's broad reach with customers, start-ups often agree to its restrictions on promoting their own products and voluntarily share client and product information with it. For the privilege of selling through A.W.S., the start-ups pay a cut of their sales back to Amazon.</p><p>  Some of the companies have a phrase for what Amazon is doing: strip-mining software. By lifting other people's innovations, trying to poach their engineers and profiting off what they made, Amazon is choking off the growth of would-be competitors and forcing them to reorient how they do business, the companies said. </p><p>  All of this has fueled scrutiny of Amazon and whether it is abusing its market dominance and engaging in anticompetitive behavior. The company's tactics have led several rivals to discuss bringing antitrust complaints against it. And regulators and lawmakers are examining its clout in the industry. </p><p>  ''People are afraid that Amazon's ambitions are endless,'' said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, an A.W.S. competitor that protects websites from attacks. </p><p>  A.W.S. is just one prong of Amazon's push to dominate large swaths of American industry. The company has transformed retailing, logistics, book publishing and Hollywood. It is rethinking how people buy prescription drugs, purchase real estate and build surveillance for their homes and cities.</p><p>  But what Amazon is doing through A.W.S. is arguably more consequential. The company is the unquestioned market leader -- triple the size of its nearest competitor, Microsoft -- in the seismic shift to cloud computing. Millions of people unknowingly interact with A.W.S. every day when they stream movies on Netflix or store photos on Apple's iCloud, services that run off Amazon's machines. </p><p>  Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, once called A.W.S. an idea ''no one asked for.'' The service began in the early 2000s when the retailer struggled to assemble computer systems to start new projects and features. Once it built a common computer infrastructure, Amazon realized other companies needed similar capabilities.</p><p>  Now companies like Airbnb and General Electric essentially rent computing from Amazon -- otherwise known as using the ''cloud'' -- instead of buying and running their own systems. Businesses can then store their information on Amazon machines, pluck data from them and analyze it. </p><p>  For Amazon itself, A.W.S. has become crucial. The division generated $25 billion in sales last year -- roughly the size of Starbucks -- and is Amazon's most profitable business. Those profits enable the company to plow money into many other industries.</p><p>  In a statement, Amazon said the idea that it was strip-mining software was ''silly and off-base.'' It said it had contributed significantly to the software industry and that it acted in the best interest of customers. </p><p>  Some tech companies said they had found more customers through A.W.S.; even some companies that have tangled with Amazon have grown. Elastic, for instance, went public last year and now has 1,600 employees.</p><p>  But in interviews with more than 40 current and former Amazon employees and those of rivals, many said the costs of what the company was doing with A.W.S. were hidden. They said it was hard to measure how much business they had lost to Amazon, or how the threat of Amazon had turned off would-be investors. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the company.</p><p>  In February, seven software chief executives met in Silicon Valley and discussed bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the giant, said four people with knowledge of the gathering. Their grievances echoed a complaint by vendors who use Amazon's shopping site: Once Amazon becomes a direct competitor, it is no longer a neutral party. </p><p>  The C.E.O.s did not press forward with a legal action, partly out of concern that the process would take too long, the people said.</p><p>  Now regulators are approaching some of Amazon's software rivals. The House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the big tech companies, asked Amazon in a September letter about A.W.S.'s practices. The Federal Trade Commission, which is also investigating Amazon, has questioned A.W.S. competitors, according to officials at two software companies who were called in but were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p><p>  What Amazon is doing to software start-ups is unsustainable, said Salil Deshpande, founder of Uncorrelated, a venture capital firm. </p><p>  ''It has intercepted their monetization, it has forcibly wrestled control of software from their owners and it has siphoned customers to its own proprietary services,'' he said.</p><p>  'Strip Mining'</p><p>  When Amazon Web Services began last decade, Amazon was struggling to turn a consistent profit. A service to provide computing power seemed like a distraction.</p><p>  Yet start-ups embraced A.W.S. They saved money because they did not need to buy their own computing equipment, while spending only on what they used. Soon more companies flocked to Amazon for computing infrastructure and, eventually, the software that ran on its machines.</p><p>  In 2009, Amazon established a template for accelerating A.W.S.'s growth. That year, it introduced a service for managing a database, which is critical software to help companies organize information.</p><p>  The A.W.S. database service, an instant hit with customers, did not run software that Amazon created. Instead, the company plucked from a freely shared option known as open source. </p><p>  Open-source software has few parallels in business. It is akin to a coffee shop giving away coffee on the hopes that people spend on milk or sugar or pastries. </p><p>  But open source is a tried and true model nurtured by the software industry to get technology to customers quickly. A community of enthusiasts often springs up around the shareable technology, contributing improvements and spreading the word about its benefits. Traditionally, open-source companies later earn money for customer support or from paid add-ons.</p><p>  Technologists initially paid little attention to what Amazon had done with database software. Then in 2015, Amazon repeated the maneuver by copying Elasticsearch and offering its competing service.</p><p>  This time, heads turned.</p><p>  ''There was a company that built a business around an open-source product that people like using and, suddenly, they have a competitor using their own stuff against them,'' said Todd Persen, who started a non-open-source software company this year so there was ''zero chance'' that Amazon could lift his creations. His previous start-up, InfluxDB, was open source.</p><p>  Again and again, the open-source software industry became a well that Amazon turned to. When it copied and integrated that software into A.W.S., it didn't need permission or have to pay the start-ups for their work, creating a deterrent for people to innovate.</p><p>  That left little recourse for many of these companies, which could not suddenly start charging money for what was free software. Some instead changed the rules around how their wares could be used, restricting Amazon and others who want to turn what they have created into a paid service. </p><p>Amazon has worked around some of their changes.</p><p>  When Elastic, now based in Silicon Valley, shifted the rules for its software last year, Amazon said in a blog post that open-source software companies were ''muddying the waters'' by limiting access to certain users. </p><p>  Shay Banon, Elastic's chief executive, wrote at the time that Amazon's actions were ''masked with fake altruism.'' Elastic declined to make Mr. Banon available for an interview.</p><p>  Last year, MongoDB, a popular technology for organizing data in documents, also announced that it would require any company that manages its software as a web service to freely share the underlying technology. The move was widely viewed as a hedge against A.W.S., which does not openly share its technology for creating new services.</p><p>  A.W.S. soon introduced its own technology with the look and feel of MongoDB's older software, which did not fall under the new requirements. </p><p>  That experience was top of mind this year when Dev Ittycheria, MongoDB's chief executive, attended the dinner with the heads of six other software companies. Their conversation, held at the home of a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, shifted to something drastic: whether to publicly accuse Amazon of behaving like a monopoly.</p><p>  At the meal, which included the heads of the software firms Confluent and Snowflake, some of the C.E.O.s said they faced an uneven playing field, according to the people with knowledge of the gathering. No complaint has materialized. </p><p>  ''A.W.S.'s success is built on strip-mining open-source technology,'' said Michael Howard, chief executive of MariaDB, an open-source company. He estimated that Amazon made five times more revenue from running MariaDB software than his company generated from all of its businesses. </p><p>  Andi Gutmans, an A.W.S. vice president, said some companies wanted to be ''the only ones'' to make money off open-source projects. He said Amazon was ''committed to making sure that open-source projects remain truly open and customers get to choose how they use that open-source software -- whether they choose A.W.S. or not.'' </p><p>  By the time A.W.S. held its first developer conference in 2012, Amazon was no longer the only big player in cloud computing. Microsoft and Google had introduced competing platforms.</p><p>  So Amazon unveiled more software services to make A.W.S. indispensable. In a speech at the event, Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S., said it wanted to ''enable every imaginable use case.''</p><p>Amazon has since added A.W.S. services at a blistering pace, going from 30 in 2014 to about 175 as of December. It also built in a home-field advantage: simplicity and convenience. </p><p>  Customers can add new A.W.S. services with a single click and use the same system to manage them. The new service is added to the same bill and requires no extra permission from a finance or compliance department. </p><p>  In contrast, using a non-Amazon service on A.W.S. is more complicated.</p><p>  Today when a customer logs onto A.W.S., they see a home page called the management console. At the center is a list of about 150 services. All are A.W.S.'s own products.</p><p>  When someone types ''MongoDB,'' the search results do not fetch information for MongoDB's service on A.W.S.; it instead suggests an offering from Amazon that is ''compatible with MongoDB.''</p><p>  Even after a customer has selected a non-Amazon option, the company sometimes continues pushing its own product. When someone creates a new database, they are presented an ad for Amazon's own technology called Aurora. If they pick something else, Amazon still highlights its option as ''recommended.''</p><p>  Mr. Gutmans said A.W.S. worked closely with many companies to integrate their offerings ''as seamlessly as possible.''</p><p>  Banning Words</p><p>Amazon's A.W.S. developer conference is now one of the world's biggest technology events, drawing tens of thousands of people to Las Vegas every year. </p><p>  The highlight is a speech from Mr. Jassy where he showcases new services. Because a new A.W.S. feature often spells hardship for some start-up, the presentation has earned the nickname ''The Red Wedding,'' a bloody event in a ''Game of Thrones'' episode.</p><p>  ''Nobody knows who is going to get killed next,'' said Corey Quinn of the Duckbill Group, who helps companies manage their A.W.S. bills and writes a newsletter called ''Last Week in A.W.S.'' </p><p>  At last year's conference, Amazon unveiled a new tool -- Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights -- to help customers analyze information about its services. </p><p>  Daniel Vassallo, a former A.W.S. software engineer who helped develop the product, said executives wanted to go after the market, but were worried it would look like Amazon was targeting a company called Splunk, which offers a similar tool and is also a major spender with A.W.S. </p><p>  So Amazon previewed its new product to Splunk before the conference and agreed not to announce it during Mr. Jassy's speech, Mr. Vassallo said. </p><p>  ''They weren't particularly happy. Who would be?'' Mr. Vassallo, who left Amazon in February, said of Splunk. ''But we still went ahead and did it anyway.''</p><p>Splunk said it had a ''strong partnership'' with A.W.S. and declined to comment further. </p><p>Amazon has also created rules for its developer conference. Companies that pay tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for a booth said they must submit their banners, pamphlets and news releases to Amazon for approval. </p><p>  According to an A.W.S. document from August explaining marketing guidelines for companies it works with, Amazon bans certain words or phrases, such as ''multi-cloud,'' the concept of using two or more cloud platforms. An Amazon spokesman said it had stopped this practice. </p><p>  Companies are also instructed to strike claims about being ''the best,'' ''the first,'' ''the only,'' ''the leader,'' unless substantiated by independent research.</p><p>  'Love-Hate Relationship'</p><p>  Redis Labs was founded in 2011 in Tel Aviv, Israel, to build a business around managing a free software called Redis, which people use to organize and update data quickly. Amazon soon offered a competing paid service. </p><p>  While that created a formidable rival to Redis Labs, Amazon's move also validated Redis technology. The start-up has since raised $150 million, exemplifying the can't-live-with-can't-live-without relationship that many software companies have with Amazon.</p><p>  Former Redis Labs employees estimate that Amazon generates as much as $1 billion a year from Redis technology -- or at least 10 times more revenue than Redis Labs. They said Amazon also tried to poach its staff and undercut it with hefty discounts.</p><p>  A.W.S. offers a discount to customers who commit to spending at least a certain amount with it, but it does not treat money spent on A.W.S.'s own services and rival services equally. Spending on outside services counts as only 50 cents on the dollar toward the balance. And discounts do not apply to non-Amazon products, according to A.W.S. customers.</p><p>  If a customer still chooses Redis Labs through A.W.S., Redis Labs is required to kick back around 15 percent of its revenue to Amazon.</p><p>  At one point, Amazon's attempts to hire Redis Labs employees became so aggressive that executives removed some online biographies of its technical staff, said the former employees. A Redis Labs spokesman said the start-up had no recollection of that.</p><p>  Some Redis Labs executives considered bringing an antitrust action against Amazon this year, the former employees said. Others balked because 80 percent of the start-up's revenue came from customers on A.W.S.</p><p>  ''It was a love-hate relationship,'' said Leena Joshi, a former vice president of marketing at Redis Labs. ''On one hand, most of our customers ran on A.W.S. so it was in our interest to be tightly integrated with them. At the same time, we knew they were taking away our business.''</p><p>  Redis Labs declined to comment on its revenues or A.W.S. actions. It said Amazon offered ''important services.''</p><p>  Not every company views A.W.S. as a threat. Ali Ghodsi, chief executive of Databricks, a San Francisco start-up that uses artificial intelligence to analyze data, said A.W.S. salespeople have lifted sales of his company's products. </p><p>  ''I don't see them using shenanigans to stop us,'' he said.</p><p>  But Saket Saurabh, chief executive of Nexla, a 14-person start-up in Millbrae, Calif., said he had reservations about Amazon.</p><p>  In August, Amazon began a service for processing and monitoring data that competes with Nexla. Investors warned him about sharing too much information with the giant.</p><p>  Mr. Saurabh went ahead anyway and signed his company up to work with Amazon in September. The reason? Amazon's giant sales teams can give Nexla access to a vast audience. </p><p>  ''What choice do we have?'' he said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: The cloud pavilion of Amazon Web Services at a 2016 trade fair in Hanover, Germany.

Then Amazon came along.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In October 2015, Amazon's cloud computing arm announced it was copying Elastic's free software tool, which people use to search and analyze data, and would sell it as a paid service. Amazon went ahead even though Elastic's product, called Elasticsearch, was already available on Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Within a year, Amazon was generating more money from what Elastic had built than the startup by making it easy for people to use the tool with its other offerings. So Elastic added premium features last year and limited what companies like Amazon could do with them. Amazon duplicated many of those features anyway and provided them free.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In September, Elastic fired back. It sued Amazon in federal court in California for violating its trademark because Amazon had called its product by the exact same name: Elasticsearch. Amazon \"misleads consumers,\" the startup said in its complaint. Amazon denied it had done anything wrong. The case is pending.</p><p> Not since the mid-1990s, when Microsoft dominated the personal computer industry with Windows, has a technology service instilled such fear in competitors as Amazon is now doing with its cloud computing arm.</p><p> While cloud computing may appear obscure, it has grown into one of the technology industry's largest and most lucrative businesses, offering computing power and software to companies. And Amazon is its single-biggest provider.</p><p>Amazon has used its cloud computing arm \u2014 called Amazon Web Services, or AWS \u2014 to copy and integrate software that other tech companies pioneered. It has given an edge to its own services by making them more convenient to use, burying rival offerings and bundling discounts to make its products less expensive. The moves drive customers toward Amazon, while those responsible for the software may not see a cent.</p><p> Even so, smaller rivals said they have little choice but to work with Amazon. Given the company's broad reach with customers, startups often agree to its restrictions on promoting their own products and voluntarily share client and product information with it. For the privilege of selling through AWS, startups pay a cut of their sales back to Amazon.</p><p> Some of the companies have a phrase for what Amazon is doing: strip-mining software. By lifting other people's innovations, trying to poach their engineers and profiting off what they made, Amazon is choking off the growth of would-be competitors and forcing them to reorient how they do business, the companies said.</p><p> All of this has fueled scrutiny of Amazon and whether it is abusing its market dominance and engaging in anti-competitive behavior. The company's tactics have led several rivals to discuss bringing antitrust complaints against it. And regulators and lawmakers are examining its clout in the industry.</p><p> \"People are afraid that Amazon's ambitions are endless,\" said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, an AWS competitor from San Francisco that protects websites from attacks.</p><p> AWS is just one prong of Amazon's push to dominate large swaths of the U.S. industry. The company has transformed retailing, logistics, book publishing and Hollywood.</p><p> But what Amazon is doing through AWS is arguably more consequential. The company is the unquestioned market leader \u2014 triple the size of its nearest competitor, Microsoft \u2014 in the seismic shift to cloud computing. Millions of people unknowingly interact with AWS every day when they stream movies on Netflix or store photos on Apple's iCloud, services that run off Amazon's machines.</p><p> Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, once called AWS an idea \"no one asked for.\" The service began in the early 2000s when the retailer struggled to assemble computer systems to start new projects and features. Once it built a common computer infrastructure, Amazon realized other companies needed similar capabilities.</p><p> Now companies like Airbnb and General Electric essentially rent computing from Amazon \u2014 otherwise known as using the \"cloud\" \u2014 instead of buying and running their own systems. Businesses can then store their information on Amazon machines, pluck data from them and analyze it.</p><p> For Amazon itself, AWS has become crucial. The division generated $25 billion in sales last year and is Amazon's most profitable business.</p><p> But in interviews with more than 40 current and former Amazon employees and those of rivals, many said the costs of what the company was doing with AWS were hidden. They said it was hard to measure how much business they had lost to Amazon or how the threat of Amazon had turned off would-be investors. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the company.</p><p> Now regulators are approaching some of Amazon's software rivals. The House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the big tech companies, asked Amazon in a September letter about AWS' practices. The Federal Trade Commission, which is also investigating Amazon, has questioned AWS competitors, according to officials.</p><p> When Amazon Web Services began last decade, Amazon was struggling to turn a consistent profit.</p><p> Startups embraced AWS. They saved money because they did not need to buy their own computing equipment, spending only on what they used. Soon more companies flocked to Amazon for computing infrastructure and, eventually, the software that ran on its machines.</p><p> In 2009, Amazon established a template for accelerating AWS' growth. That year, it introduced a service for managing a database, which is critical software to help companies organize information.</p><p> The AWS database service, an instant hit with customers, did not run software that Amazon created. Instead, the company plucked from a freely shared option known as open source.</p><p> Technologists initially paid little attention to what Amazon had done with database software. Then in 2015, Amazon copied Elasticsearch and offered its competing service.</p><p> This time, heads turned.</p><p> \"There was a company that built a business around an open-source product that people like using, and suddenly they have a competitor using their own stuff against them,\" said Todd Persen, who started a non-open-source software company this year so there was \"zero chance\" that Amazon could lift his creations.</p><p> Again and again, the open-source software industry became a well that Amazon turned to. When it copied and integrated that software into AWS, it did not need permission or have to pay the startups for their work.</p><p> That left little recourse for many of these companies, which could not suddenly start charging money for what was free software. Some instead changed the rules around how their wares could be used, restricting Amazon and others who want to turn what they have created into a paid service.</p><p> Last year, MongoDB, a popular technology for organizing data in documents, announced that it would require any company that manages its software as a web service to freely share the underlying technology. The move was widely viewed as a hedge against AWS, which does not openly share its technology for creating new services.</p><p> AWS soon introduced its own technology with the look and feel of MongoDB's older software, which did not fall under the new requirements.</p><p> That experience was top of mind this year when Dev Ittycheria, MongoDB's chief executive, attended the dinner with the heads of six other software companies. Their conversation, held at the home of a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, shifted to something drastic: whether to publicly accuse Amazon of behaving like a monopoly.</p><p> At the meal, which included the heads of software firms Confluent and Snowflake, some of the CEOs said they faced an uneven playing field, according to people with knowledge of the gathering. No complaint has materialized.</p><p> \"AWS' success is built on strip-mining open-source technology,\" said Michael Howard, chief executive of MariaDB, an open-source company that has its U.S. headquarters in Redwood City. He estimated that Amazon made five times more revenue from running MariaDB software than his company generated from all its businesses.</p><p> Andi Gutmans, an AWS vice president, said some companies wanted to be \"the only ones\" to make money off open-source projects. He said Amazon was \"committed to making sure that open-source projects remain truly open and customers get to choose how they use that open-source software \u2014 whether they choose AWS or not.\"</p><p> By the time AWS held its first developer conference in 2012, Amazon was no longer the only big player in cloud computing. Microsoft and Google had introduced competing platforms. So Amazon unveiled more software services to make AWS indispensable.</p><p>Amazon has since added AWS services at a blistering pace, going from 30 in 2014 to about 175 as of December. It also built in a home-field advantage: simplicity and convenience.</p><p> Customers can add new AWS services with one click and use the same system to manage them. The new service is added to the same bill, while using a non-Amazon service on AWS is more complicated.</p><p> Saket Saurabh, chief executive of San Francisco startup Nexla, said he signed his company to work with Amazon in September. The reason? Amazon's giant sales teams can give his data-processing and monitoring service access to a vast audience.</p><p> \"What choice do we have?\" he said.</p><p> Daisuke Wakabayashi is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-86c531a7fdcd993a42831c123751ea956297af12</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XT0-NJ11-JBCN-4450-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Then Amazon came along.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In October 2015, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing arm announced it was copying Elastic\u2019s free software tool, which people use to search and analyze data, and would sell it as a paid service. Amazon went ahead even though Elastic\u2019s product, called Elasticsearch, was already available on Amazon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Within a year, Amazon was generating more money from what Elastic had built than the start-up, by making it easy for people to use the tool with its other offerings. So Elastic added premium features last year and limited what companies like Amazon could do with them. Amazon duplicated many of those features anyway and provided them free.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In September, Elastic fired back. It sued Amazon in federal court in California for violating its trademark because Amazon had called its product by the exact same name: Elasticsearch. Amazon \u201cmisleads consumers,\u201d the start-up said in its complaint. Amazon denied it had done anything wrong. The case is pending.</p><p>Not since the mid-1990s, when Microsoft<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">dominated</url> the personal computer industry with Windows, has a technology platform instilled such fear in competitors as Amazon is now doing with its cloud computing arm. Its feud with Elastic illustrates how it brandishes power in that technical world. </p><p>While cloud computing may appear obscure and geeky, it underlies much of the internet. It has grown into one of the technology industry\u2019s largest and most lucrative businesses, offering computing power and software to companies. And Amazon is its single-biggest provider.</p><p>Amazon has used its cloud computing arm \u2014 called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">Amazon Web Services</url>, or A.W.S. for short \u2014 to copy and integrate software that other tech companies pioneered. It has given an edge to its own services by making them more convenient to use, burying rival offerings and bundling discounts to make its products less expensive. The moves drive customers toward Amazon while those responsible for the software may not see a cent.</p><p>Even so, smaller rivals say they have little choice but to work with Amazon. Given the company\u2019s broad reach with customers, start-ups often agree to its restrictions on promoting their own products and voluntarily share client and product information with it. For the privilege of selling through A.W.S., the start-ups pay a cut of their sales back to Amazon.</p><p>Some of the companies have a phrase for what Amazon is doing: strip-mining software. By lifting other people\u2019s innovations, trying to poach their engineers and profiting off what they made, Amazon is choking off the growth of would-be competitors and forcing them to reorient how they do business, the companies said. </p><p>All of this has fueled scrutiny of Amazon and whether it is abusing its market dominance and engaging in anticompetitive behavior. The company\u2019s tactics have led several rivals to discuss bringing antitrust complaints against it. And regulators and lawmakers are examining its clout in the industry. </p><p>\u201cPeople are afraid that Amazon\u2019s ambitions are endless,\u201d said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, an A.W.S. competitor that protects websites from attacks. </p><p>A.W.S. is just one prong of Amazon\u2019s push to dominate large swaths of American industry. The company has transformed retailing, logistics, book publishing and Hollywood. It is rethinking how people <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">buy prescription drugs</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">purchase real estate</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">build surveillance</url> for their homes and cities.</p><p>But what Amazon is doing through A.W.S. is arguably more consequential. The company is the unquestioned market leader \u2014 triple the size of its nearest competitor, Microsoft \u2014 in the seismic shift to cloud computing. Millions of people unknowingly interact with A.W.S. every day when they stream movies on Netflix or store photos on Apple\u2019s iCloud, services that run off Amazon\u2019s machines. </p><p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once called A.W.S. an idea \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">no one asked for</url>.\u201d The service began in the early 2000s when the retailer struggled to assemble computer systems to start new projects and features. Once it built a common computer infrastructure, Amazon realized other companies needed similar capabilities.</p><p>Now companies like Airbnb and General Electric essentially rent computing from Amazon \u2014 otherwise known as using the \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 instead of buying and running their own systems. Businesses can then store their information on Amazon machines, pluck data from them and analyze it. </p><p>For Amazon itself, A.W.S. has become crucial. The division generated $25 billion in sales last year \u2014 roughly the size of Starbucks \u2014 and is Amazon\u2019s most profitable business. Those profits enable the company to plow money into many other industries.</p><p>In a statement, Amazon said the idea that it was strip-mining software was \u201csilly and off-base.\u201d It said it had contributed significantly to the software industry and that it acted in the best interest of customers. </p><p>Some tech companies said they had found more customers through A.W.S.; even some companies that have tangled with Amazon have grown. Elastic, for instance, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">went public last year</url> and now has 1,600 employees.</p><p>But in interviews with more than 40 current and former Amazon employees and those of rivals, many said the costs of what the company was doing with A.W.S. were hidden. They said it was hard to measure how much business they had lost to Amazon, or how the threat of Amazon had turned off would-be investors. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the company.</p><p>In February, seven software chief executives met in Silicon Valley and discussed bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the giant, said four people with knowledge of the gathering. Their grievances <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">echoed a complain</url>t by vendors who use Amazon\u2019s shopping site: Once Amazon becomes a direct competitor, it is no longer a neutral party. </p><p>The C.E.O.s did not press forward with a legal action, partly out of concern that the process would take too long, the people said.</p><p>Now regulators are approaching some of Amazon\u2019s software rivals. The House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the big tech companies, asked Amazon in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">a September letter</url> about A.W.S.\u2019s practices. The Federal Trade Commission, which is also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">investigating Amazon</url>, has questioned A.W.S. competitors, according to officials at two software companies who were called in but were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p><p>What Amazon is doing to software start-ups is unsustainable, said Salil Deshpande, founder of Uncorrelated, a venture capital firm. </p><p>\u201cIt has intercepted their monetization, it has forcibly wrestled control of software from their owners and it has siphoned customers to its own proprietary services,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u2018Strip Mining\u2019</p><p>When Amazon Web Services began last decade, Amazon was struggling to turn a consistent profit. A service to provide computing power seemed like a distraction.</p><p>Yet start-ups embraced A.W.S. They saved money because they did not need to buy their own computing equipment, while spending only on what they used. Soon more companies flocked to Amazon for computing infrastructure and, eventually, the software that ran on its machines.</p><p>In 2009, Amazon established a template for accelerating A.W.S.\u2019s growth. That year, it introduced a service for managing a database, which is critical software to help companies organize information.</p><p>The A.W.S. database service, an instant hit with customers, did not run software that Amazon created. Instead, the company plucked from a freely shared option known as open source. </p><p>Open-source software has few parallels in business. It is akin to a coffee shop giving away coffee on the hopes that people spend on milk or sugar or pastries. </p><p>But open source is a tried and true model <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">nurtured by the software industry</url> to get technology to customers quickly. A community of enthusiasts often springs up around the shareable technology, contributing improvements and spreading the word about its benefits. Traditionally, open-source companies later earn money for customer support or from paid add-ons.</p><p>Technologists initially paid little attention to what Amazon had done with database software. Then in 2015, Amazon repeated the maneuver by copying Elasticsearch and offering its competing service.</p><p>This time, heads turned.</p><p>\u201cThere was a company that built a business around an open-source product that people like using and, suddenly, they have a competitor using their own stuff against them,\u201d said Todd Persen, who started a non-open-source software company this year so there was \u201czero chance\u201d that Amazon could lift his creations. His previous start-up, InfluxDB, was open source.</p><p>Again and again, the open-source software industry became a well that Amazon turned to. When it copied and integrated that software into A.W.S., it didn\u2019t need permission or have to pay the start-ups for their work, creating a deterrent for people to innovate.</p><p>That left little recourse for many of these companies, which could not suddenly start charging money for what was free software. Some instead <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">changed the rules</url> around how their wares could be used, restricting Amazon and others who want to turn what they have created into a paid service. </p><p>Amazon has worked around some of their changes.</p><p>When Elastic, now based in Silicon Valley, shifted the rules for its software last year, Amazon said in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">a blog post</url> that open-source software companies were \u201cmuddying the waters\u201d by limiting access to certain users. </p><p>Shay Banon, Elastic\u2019s chief executive, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">wrote at the time</url> that Amazon\u2019s actions were \u201cmasked with fake altruism.\u201d Elastic declined to make Mr. Banon available for an interview.</p><p>Last year, MongoDB, a popular technology for organizing data in documents, also announced that it would require any company that manages its software as a web service to freely share the underlying technology. The move was widely viewed as a hedge against A.W.S., which does not openly share its technology for creating new services.</p><p>A.W.S. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">soon introduced its own technology</url> with the look and feel of MongoDB\u2019s older software, which did not fall under the new requirements. </p><p>That experience was top of mind this year when Dev Ittycheria, MongoDB\u2019s chief executive, attended the dinner with the heads of six other software companies. Their conversation, held at the home of a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, shifted to something drastic: whether to publicly accuse Amazon of behaving like a monopoly.</p><p>At the meal, which included the heads of the software firms Confluent and Snowflake, some of the C.E.O.s said they faced an uneven playing field, according to the people with knowledge of the gathering. No complaint has materialized. </p><p>\u201cA.W.S.\u2019s success is built on strip-mining open-source technology,\u201d said Michael Howard, chief executive of MariaDB, an open-source company. He estimated that Amazon made five times more revenue from running MariaDB software than his company generated from all of its businesses. </p><p>Andi Gutmans, an A.W.S. vice president, said some companies wanted to be \u201cthe only ones\u201d to make money off open-source projects. He said Amazon was \u201ccommitted to making sure that open-source projects remain truly open and customers get to choose how they use that open-source software \u2014 whether they choose A.W.S. or not.\u201d </p><p>By the time A.W.S. held <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">its first developer conference</url> in 2012, Amazon was no longer the only big player in cloud computing. Microsoft and Google had introduced competing platforms.</p><p>So Amazon unveiled more software services to make A.W.S. indispensable. In a speech at the event, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">Andy Jassy</url>, the head of A.W.S., said it wanted to \u201cenable every imaginable use case.\u201d</p><p>Amazon has since added A.W.S. services at a blistering pace, going from 30 in 2014 to about 175 as of December. It also built in a home-field advantage: simplicity and convenience. </p><p>Customers can add new A.W.S. services with a single click and use the same system to manage them. The new service is added to the same bill and requires no extra permission from a finance or compliance department. </p><p>In contrast, using a non-Amazon service on A.W.S. is more complicated.</p><p>Today when a customer logs onto A.W.S., they see a home page called the management console. At the center is a list of about 150 services. All are A.W.S.\u2019s own products.</p><p>When someone types \u201cMongoDB,\u201d the search results do not fetch information for MongoDB\u2019s service on A.W.S.; it instead suggests an offering from Amazon that is \u201ccompatible with MongoDB.\u201d</p><p>Even after a customer has selected a non-Amazon option, the company sometimes continues pushing its own product. When someone creates a new database, they are presented an ad for Amazon\u2019s own technology called Aurora. If they pick something else, Amazon still highlights its option as \u201crecommended.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Gutmans said A.W.S. worked closely with many companies to integrate their offerings \u201cas seamlessly as possible.\u201d</p><p>Banning Words</p><p>Amazon\u2019s A.W.S. developer conference is now one of the world\u2019s biggest technology events, drawing tens of thousands of people to Las Vegas every year. </p><p>The highlight is a speech from Mr. Jassy where he showcases new services. Because a new A.W.S. feature often spells hardship for some start-up, the presentation has earned the nickname \u201cThe Red Wedding,\u201d a bloody event in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d episode</url>.</p><p>\u201cNobody knows who is going to get killed next,\u201d said Corey Quinn of the Duckbill Group, who helps companies manage their A.W.S. bills and writes a newsletter called \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/19/business/us-v-microsoft-the-issues-stopping-a-monopoly-from-begetting-others.html\">Last Week in A.W.S.</url>\u201d </p><p>At last year\u2019s conference, Amazon unveiled a new tool \u2014 Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights \u2014 to help customers analyze information about its services. </p><p>Daniel Vassallo, a former A.W.S. software engineer who helped develop the product, said executives wanted to go after the market, but were worried it would look like Amazon was targeting a company called Splunk, which offers a similar tool and is also a major spender with A.W.S. </p><p>So Amazon previewed its new product to Splunk before the conference and agreed not to announce it during Mr. Jassy\u2019s speech, Mr. Vassallo said. </p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t particularly happy. Who would be?\u201d Mr. Vassallo, who left Amazon in February, said of Splunk. \u201cBut we still went ahead and did it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Splunk said it had a \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with A.W.S. and declined to comment further. </p><p>Amazon has also created rules for its developer conference. Companies that pay tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for a booth said they must submit their banners, pamphlets and news releases to Amazon for approval. </p><p>According to an A.W.S. document from August explaining marketing guidelines for companies it works with, Amazon bans certain words or phrases, such as \u201cmulti-cloud,\u201d the concept of using two or more cloud platforms. An Amazon spokesman said it had stopped this practice. </p><p>Companies are also instructed to strike claims about being \u201cthe best,\u201d \u201cthe first,\u201d \u201cthe only,\u201d \u201cthe leader,\u201d unless substantiated by independent research.</p><p>\u2018Love-Hate Relationship\u2019</p><p>Redis Labs was founded in 2011 in Tel Aviv, Israel, to build a business around managing a free software called Redis, which people use to organize and update data quickly. Amazon soon offered a competing paid service. </p><p>While that created a formidable rival to Redis Labs, Amazon\u2019s move also validated Redis technology. The start-up has since raised $150 million, exemplifying the can\u2019t-live-with-can\u2019t-live-without relationship that many software companies have with Amazon.</p><p>Former Redis Labs employees estimate that Amazon generates as much as $1 billion a year from Redis technology \u2014 or at least 10 times more revenue than Redis Labs. They said Amazon also tried to poach its staff and undercut it with hefty discounts.</p><p>A.W.S. offers a discount to customers who commit to spending at least a certain amount with it, but it does not treat money spent on A.W.S.\u2019s own services and rival services equally. Spending on outside services counts as only 50 cents on the dollar toward the balance. And discounts do not apply to non-Amazon products, according to A.W.S. customers.</p><p>If a customer still chooses Redis Labs through A.W.S., Redis Labs is required to kick back around 15 percent of its revenue to Amazon.</p><p>At one point, Amazon\u2019s attempts to hire Redis Labs employees became so aggressive that executives removed some online biographies of its technical staff, said the former employees. A Redis Labs spokesman said the start-up had no recollection of that.</p><p>Some Redis Labs executives considered bringing an antitrust action against Amazon this year, the former employees said. Others balked because 80 percent of the start-up\u2019s revenue came from customers on A.W.S.</p><p>\u201cIt was a love-hate relationship,\u201d said Leena Joshi, a former vice president of marketing at Redis Labs. \u201cOn one hand, most of our customers ran on A.W.S. so it was in our interest to be tightly integrated with them. At the same time, we knew they were taking away our business.\u201d</p><p>Redis Labs declined to comment on its revenues or A.W.S. actions. It said Amazon offered \u201cimportant services.\u201d</p><p>Not every company views A.W.S. as a threat. Ali Ghodsi, chief executive of Databricks, a San Francisco start-up that uses artificial intelligence to analyze data, said A.W.S. salespeople have lifted sales of his company\u2019s products. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see them using shenanigans to stop us,\u201d he said.</p><p>But Saket Saurabh, chief executive of Nexla, a 14-person start-up in Millbrae, Calif., said he had reservations about Amazon.</p><p>In August, Amazon began a service for processing and monitoring data that competes with Nexla. Investors warned him about sharing too much information with the giant.</p><p>Mr. Saurabh went ahead anyway and signed his company up to work with Amazon in September. The reason? Amazon\u2019s giant sales teams can give Nexla access to a vast audience. </p><p>\u201cWhat choice do we have?\u201d he said.</p><p>PHOTOS: The cloud pavilion of Amazon Web Services at a 2016 trade fair in Hanover, Germany. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once called A.W.S. an idea \u201cno one asked for.\u201d Now it is the unquestioned market leader. \u201cPeople are afraid that Amazon\u2019s ambitions are endless,\u201d said Matthew Prince, C.E.O. of CloudFlare, right.

Then Amazon came along.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In October 2015, Amazon's cloud computing arm announced it was copying Elastic's free software tool, which people use to search and analyze data, and would sell it as a paid service. Amazon went ahead even though Elastic's product, called Elasticsearch, was already available on Amazon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Within a year, Amazon was generating more money from what Elastic had built than the start-up, by making it easy for people to use the tool with its other offerings. So Elastic added premium features last year and limited what companies like Amazon could do with them. Amazon duplicated many of those features anyway and provided them free.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In September, Elastic fired back. It sued Amazon in federal court in California for violating its trademark because Amazon had called its product by the exact same name: Elasticsearch. Amazon \"misleads consumers,\" the start-up said in its complaint. Amazon denied it had done anything wrong. The case is pending.</p><p>Not since the mid-1990s, when Microsoft dominated the personal computer industry with Windows, has a technology platform instilled such fear in competitors as Amazon is now doing with its cloud computing arm. Its feud with Elastic illustrates how it brandishes power in that technical world. </p><p>While cloud computing may appear obscure and geeky, it underlies much of the internet. It has grown into one of the technology industry's largest and most lucrative businesses, offering computing power and software to companies. And Amazon is its single-biggest provider.</p><p>Amazon has used its cloud computing arm - called Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. for short - to copy and integrate software that other tech companies pioneered. It has given an edge to its own services by making them more convenient to use, burying rival offerings and bundling discounts to make its products less expensive. The moves drive customers toward Amazon while those responsible for the software may not see a cent.</p><p>Even so, smaller rivals say they have little choice but to work with Amazon. Given the company's broad reach with customers, start-ups often agree to its restrictions on promoting their own products and voluntarily share client and product information with it. For the privilege of selling through A.W.S., the start-ups pay a cut of their sales back to Amazon.</p><p>Some of the companies have a phrase for what Amazon is doing: strip-mining software. By lifting other people's innovations, trying to poach their engineers and profiting off what they made, Amazon is choking off the growth of would-be competitors and forcing them to reorient how they do business, the companies said. </p><p>All of this has fueled scrutiny of Amazon and whether it is abusing its market dominance and engaging in anticompetitive behavior. The company's tactics have led several rivals to discuss bringing antitrust complaints against it. And regulators and lawmakers are examining its clout in the industry. </p><p>\"People are afraid that Amazon's ambitions are endless,\" said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, an A.W.S. competitor that protects websites from attacks. </p><p>A.W.S. is just one prong of Amazon's push to dominate large swaths of American industry. The company has transformed retailing, logistics, book publishing and Hollywood. It is rethinking how people buy prescription drugs, purchase real estate and build surveillance for their homes and cities.</p><p>But what Amazon is doing through A.W.S. is arguably more consequential. The company is the unquestioned market leader - triple the size of its nearest competitor, Microsoft - in the seismic shift to cloud computing. Millions of people unknowingly interact with A.W.S. every day when they stream movies on Netflix or store photos on Apple's iCloud, services that run off Amazon's machines. </p><p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, once called A.W.S. an idea \"no one asked for.\" The service began in the early 2000s when the retailer struggled to assemble computer systems to start new projects and features. Once it built a common computer infrastructure, Amazon realized other companies needed similar capabilities.</p><p>Now companies like Airbnb and General Electric essentially rent computing from Amazon - otherwise known as using the \"cloud\" - instead of buying and running their own systems. Businesses can then store their information on Amazon machines, pluck data from them and analyze it. </p><p>For Amazon itself, A.W.S. has become crucial. The division generated $25 billion in sales last year - roughly the size of Starbucks - and is Amazon's most profitable business. Those profits enable the company to plow money into many other industries.</p><p>In a statement, Amazon said the idea that it was strip-mining software was \"silly and off-base.\" It said it had contributed significantly to the software industry and that it acted in the best interest of customers. </p><p>Some tech companies said they had found more customers through A.W.S.; even some companies that have tangled with Amazon have grown. Elastic, for instance, went public last year and now has 1,600 employees.</p><p>But in interviews with more than 40 current and former Amazon employees and those of rivals, many said the costs of what the company was doing with A.W.S. were hidden. They said it was hard to measure how much business they had lost to Amazon, or how the threat of Amazon had turned off would-be investors. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the company.</p><p>In February, seven software chief executives met in Silicon Valley and discussed bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the giant, said four people with knowledge of the gathering. Their grievances echoed a complaint by vendors who use Amazon's shopping site: Once Amazon becomes a direct competitor, it is no longer a neutral party. </p><p>The C.E.O.s did not press forward with a legal action, partly out of concern that the process would take too long, the people said.</p><p>Now regulators are approaching some of Amazon's software rivals. The House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the big tech companies, asked Amazon in a September letter about A.W.S.'s practices. The Federal Trade Commission, which is also investigating Amazon, has questioned A.W.S. competitors, according to officials at two software companies who were called in but were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p><p>What Amazon is doing to software start-ups is unsustainable, said Salil Deshpande, founder of Uncorrelated, a venture capital firm. </p><p>\"It has intercepted their monetization, it has forcibly wrestled control of software from their owners and it has siphoned customers to its own proprietary services,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Strip Mining'</emphasis></p><p>When Amazon Web Services began last decade, Amazon was struggling to turn a consistent profit. A service to provide computing power seemed like a distraction.</p><p>Yet start-ups embraced A.W.S. They saved money because they did not need to buy their own computing equipment, while spending only on what they used. Soon more companies flocked to Amazon for computing infrastructure and, eventually, the software that ran on its machines.</p><p>In 2009, Amazon established a template for accelerating A.W.S.'s growth. That year, it introduced a service for managing a database, which is critical software to help companies organize information.</p><p>The A.W.S. database service, an instant hit with customers, did not run software that Amazon created. Instead, the company plucked from a freely shared option known as open source. </p><p>Open-source software has few parallels in business. It is akin to a coffee shop giving away coffee on the hopes that people spend on milk or sugar or pastries. </p><p>But open source is a tried and true model nurtured by the software industry to get technology to customers quickly. A community of enthusiasts often springs up around the shareable technology, contributing improvements and spreading the word about its benefits. Traditionally, open-source companies later earn money for customer support or from paid add-ons.</p><p>Technologists initially paid little attention to what Amazon had done with database software. Then in 2015, Amazon repeated the maneuver by copying Elasticsearch and offering its competing service.</p><p>This time, heads turned.</p><p>\"There was a company that built a business around an open-source product that people like using and, suddenly, they have a competitor using their own stuff against them,\" said Todd Persen, who started a non-open-source software company this year so there was \"zero chance\" that Amazon could lift his creations. His previous start-up, InfluxDB, was open source.</p><p>Again and again, the open-source software industry became a well that Amazon turned to. When it copied and integrated that software into A.W.S., it didn't need permission or have to pay the start-ups for their work, creating a deterrent for people to innovate.</p><p>That left little recourse for many of these companies, which could not suddenly start charging money for what was free software. Some instead changed the rules around how their wares could be used, restricting Amazon and others who want to turn what they have created into a paid service. </p><p>Amazon has worked around some of their changes.</p><p>When Elastic, now based in Silicon Valley, shifted the rules for its software last year, Amazon said in a blog post that open-source software companies were \"muddying the waters\" by limiting access to certain users. </p><p>Shay Banon, Elastic's chief executive, wrote at the time that Amazon's actions were \"masked with fake altruism.\" Elastic declined to make Mr. Banon available for an interview.</p><p>Last year, MongoDB, a popular technology for organizing data in documents, also announced that it would require any company that manages its software as a web service to freely share the underlying technology. The move was widely viewed as a hedge against A.W.S., which does not openly share its technology for creating new services.</p><p>A.W.S. soon introduced its own technology with the look and feel of MongoDB's older software, which did not fall under the new requirements. </p><p>That experience was top of mind this year when Dev Ittycheria, MongoDB's chief executive, attended the dinner with the heads of six other software companies. Their conversation, held at the home of a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, shifted to something drastic: whether to publicly accuse Amazon of behaving like a monopoly.</p><p>At the meal, which included the heads of the software firms Confluent and Snowflake, some of the C.E.O.s said they faced an uneven playing field, according to the people with knowledge of the gathering. No complaint has materialized. </p><p>\"A.W.S.'s success is built on strip-mining open-source technology,\" said Michael Howard, chief executive of MariaDB, an open-source company. He estimated that Amazon made five times more revenue from running MariaDB software than his company generated from all of its businesses. </p><p>Andi Gutmans, an A.W.S. vice president, said some companies wanted to be \"the only ones\" to make money off open-source projects. He said Amazon was \"committed to making sure that open-source projects remain truly open and customers get to choose how they use that open-source software - whether they choose A.W.S. or not.\" </p><p>By the time A.W.S. held its first developer conference in 2012, Amazon was no longer the only big player in cloud computing. Microsoft and Google had introduced competing platforms.</p><p>So Amazon unveiled more software services to make A.W.S. indispensable. In a speech at the event, Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S., said it wanted to \"enable every imaginable use case.\"</p><p>Amazon has since added A.W.S. services at a blistering pace, going from 30 in 2014 to about 175 as of December. It also built in a home-field advantage: simplicity and convenience. </p><p>Customers can add new A.W.S. services with a single click and use the same system to manage them. The new service is added to the same bill and requires no extra permission from a finance or compliance department. </p><p>In contrast, using a non-Amazon service on A.W.S. is more complicated.</p><p>Today when a customer logs onto A.W.S., they see a home page called the management console. At the center is a list of about 150 services. All are A.W.S.'s own products.</p><p>When someone types \"MongoDB,\" the search results do not fetch information for MongoDB's service on A.W.S.; it instead suggests an offering from Amazon that is \"compatible with MongoDB.\"</p><p>Even after a customer has selected a non-Amazon option, the company sometimes continues pushing its own product. When someone creates a new database, they are presented an ad for Amazon's own technology called Aurora. If they pick something else, Amazon still highlights its option as \"recommended.\"</p><p>Mr. Gutmans said A.W.S. worked closely with many companies to integrate their offerings \"as seamlessly as possible.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Banning Words</emphasis></p><p>Amazon's A.W.S. developer conference is now one of the world's biggest technology events, drawing tens of thousands of people to Las Vegas every year. </p><p>The highlight is a speech from Mr. Jassy where he showcases new services. Because a new A.W.S. feature often spells hardship for some start-up, the presentation has earned the nickname \"The Red Wedding,\" a bloody event in a \"Game of Thrones\" episode.</p><p>\"Nobody knows who is going to get killed next,\" said Corey Quinn of the Duckbill Group, who helps companies manage their A.W.S. bills and writes a newsletter called \"Last Week in A.W.S.\" </p><p>At last year's conference, Amazon unveiled a new tool - Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights - to help customers analyze information about its services. </p><p>Daniel Vassallo, a former A.W.S. software engineer who helped develop the product, said executives wanted to go after the market, but were worried it would look like Amazon was targeting a company called Splunk, which offers a similar tool and is also a major spender with A.W.S. </p><p>So Amazon previewed its new product to Splunk before the conference and agreed not to announce it during Mr. Jassy's speech, Mr. Vassallo said. </p><p>\"They weren't particularly happy. Who would be?\" Mr. Vassallo, who left Amazon in February, said of Splunk. \"But we still went ahead and did it anyway.\"</p><p>Splunk said it had a \"strong partnership\" with A.W.S. and declined to comment further. </p><p>Amazon has also created rules for its developer conference. Companies that pay tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for a booth said they must submit their banners, pamphlets and news releases to Amazon for approval. </p><p>According to an A.W.S. document from August explaining marketing guidelines for companies it works with, Amazon bans certain words or phrases, such as \"multi-cloud,\" the concept of using two or more cloud platforms. An Amazon spokesman said it had stopped this practice. </p><p>Companies are also instructed to strike claims about being \"the best,\" \"the first,\" \"the only,\" \"the leader,\" unless substantiated by independent research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Love-Hate Relationship'</emphasis></p><p>Redis Labs was founded in 2011 in Tel Aviv, Israel, to build a business around managing a free software called Redis, which people use to organize and update data quickly. Amazon soon offered a competing paid service. </p><p>While that created a formidable rival to Redis Labs, Amazon's move also validated Redis technology. The start-up has since raised $150 million, exemplifying the can't-live-with-can't-live-without relationship that many software companies have with Amazon.</p><p>Former Redis Labs employees estimate that Amazon generates as much as $1 billion a year from Redis technology - or at least 10 times more revenue than Redis Labs. They said Amazon also tried to poach its staff and undercut it with hefty discounts.</p><p>A.W.S. offers a discount to customers who commit to spending at least a certain amount with it, but it does not treat money spent on A.W.S.'s own services and rival services equally. Spending on outside services counts as only 50 cents on the dollar toward the balance. And discounts do not apply to non-Amazon products, according to A.W.S. customers.</p><p>If a customer still chooses Redis Labs through A.W.S., Redis Labs is required to kick back around 15 percent of its revenue to Amazon.</p><p>At one point, Amazon's attempts to hire Redis Labs employees became so aggressive that executives removed some online biographies of its technical staff, said the former employees. A Redis Labs spokesman said the start-up had no recollection of that.</p><p>Some Redis Labs executives considered bringing an antitrust action against Amazon this year, the former employees said. Others balked because 80 percent of the start-up's revenue came from customers on A.W.S.</p><p>\"It was a love-hate relationship,\" said Leena Joshi, a former vice president of marketing at Redis Labs. \"On one hand, most of our customers ran on A.W.S. so it was in our interest to be tightly integrated with them. At the same time, we knew they were taking away our business.\"</p><p>Redis Labs declined to comment on its revenues or A.W.S. actions. It said Amazon offered \"important services.\"</p><p>Not every company views A.W.S. as a threat. Ali Ghodsi, chief executive of Databricks, a San Francisco start-up that uses artificial intelligence to analyze data, said A.W.S. salespeople have lifted sales of his company's products. </p><p>\"I don't see them using shenanigans to stop us,\" he said.</p><p>But Saket Saurabh, chief executive of Nexla, a 14-person start-up in Millbrae, Calif., said he had reservations about Amazon.</p><p>In August, Amazon began a service for processing and monitoring data that competes with Nexla. Investors warned him about sharing too much information with the giant.</p><p>Mr. Saurabh went ahead anyway and signed his company up to work with Amazon in September. The reason? Amazon's giant sales teams can give Nexla access to a vast audience. </p><p>\"What choice do we have?\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006849037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSS-VSC1-JC85-N000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The prime minister has secured an important bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump. Tick. But the substantial parts of her agenda - climate change and the Christchurch Call - have been in the works for months, and could be a lot harder to make any progress on, particularly without the United States on board.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At last year's UN leaders' week, Ardern made a splash by being herself: in tow with partner Clarke Gayford and baby daughter Neve.</p><p>This time around in essence it will be about the prime minister demonstrating not who she is, but what she can achieve as a global leader and how effectively she can achieve it.</p><p>READ MORE: * Jacinda Ardern to formally meet with Donald Trump for the first time * Jacinda Ardern on how to respond to gun violence * Simon Bridges says Christchurch Call 'was a big talkfest in Paris' * Christchurch call summit will look into how tech companies monetise hate with business models</p><p>The Christchurch Call - which creates voluntary commitments for governments, companies and civil society to work together to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online - has received mostly international acclaim.</p><p>But it is hitting domestic opposition. National Leader Simon Bridges last week called it \"a pretty nebulous feel-good proposal\" that will do little to stop terror or help everyday New Zealanders.</p><p>Stuff caught up with the prime minister ahead of the UN trip to ask what constitutes a win at this international confab. Ardern says that working alongside, and putting pressure on, the global tech giants to stop the spread of terror online is both a key priority.</p><p>\"It brings both political and a bit of financial pressure which I think is really important. I think some people have asked 'will NZ remove its government advertising on Facebook': that is a drop in the ocean\", Ardern told Stuff.</p><p>The Christchurch Call aims to do what governments around the Western world have struggled to: wrangle the global tech giants - primarily Facebook (which also owns Instagram), Alphabet (which owns Google) and Twitter - to act more quickly to stop the sort of grisly video linked to the Christchurch shooting being spread online.</p><p>That difficulty, says Ardern, is what makes getting co-operation so important.</p><p>\"In terms of the response - take down policies and penalties regimes for social media who don't remove objectionable material - we can do that through domestic legislation. But actually most of that is going to have a time period where [the content remains online and] harm can be done.\"</p><p>In foreign affairs-land the Christchurch Call is a big deal. New Zealand rarely leads on global initiatives of this kind, but the Christchurch massacre threw New Zealand into a position of global leadership which Ardern intends to exploit.</p><p>\"It's been interesting to reflect on a little bit: although this isn't something New Zealand expected ... we have a responsibility there that we never anticipated and that we never wanted.</p><p>\"Because we were the first to have that experience, I think we would have been neglecting one of the many elements of harm in that event if we didn't look at what happened online,\" she says.</p><p>But given that these companies are primarily regulated in the US, success can only be achieved through pressure, not the law.</p><p>The Christchurch Call has garnered significant international support. The NZ Super Fund is leading a group of 89 wealth funds - local and global - with $13 trillion under management. All hold, or would consider holding shares in the big tech companies. The NZ Super Fund itself holds $200 million in shares in Facebook.</p><p>If those funds were to dump their big tech holdings it could potentially hit the value of those companies. That fact alone lends real-world financial heft to the prime minister's claim. And it is a signal of the strong diplomatic work done by the government.</p><p>The other key area for Ardern in New York is climate change. Although the Government's Zero Carbon Bill looks like being passed into law, emissions from agriculture remain a sticking point. Targets are weaker than the Greens would like.</p><p>\"New Zealand has been asked to take a particular leadership role during that week, and I don't think that is because New Zealand is demonstrating perfection,\" Ardern says.</p><p>\"I think it is because we are demonstrating ambition and an action plan that's trying to take on some really tricky areas\".</p><p>Despite the Australian Government smarting at some of her climate change comments at the Pacific Islands Forum in August, Ardern says that behind closed doors, leaders have an appreciation that cutting carbon emissions is different in each country.</p><p>\"Everyone else has got their own piece of the puzzle, but we're all unified in that fact that we know we've got to do our own bit,\" she says.</p><p>[Other leaders] might say 'look, your renewable energy options are great', but at the same time I think that many will acknowledge we've got a hard challenge because of the proportion that agriculture makes up for us.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STUFNZ-STF1909200053115877600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STUFNZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X34-Y541-JCBN-V01H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">466477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 \u00a9 Stuff Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>STUFF.CO.NZ</publicationName><edition>Digital Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Mr. President, on Sunday I had the great honor of joining President Trump in welcoming Prime Minister Modi to the Lone Star State in an event that was appropriately named ``Howdy, Modi.'' When his trip was announced, people on the west coast and the east coast wondered, ``Why Texas?'' They thought, maybe, he would go to Silicon Valley to talk to Big Tech executives or spend some time in Washington hobnobbing with diplomats and legislative leaders. Those are great places to visit, but Houston is the energy capital of the world. It is providing literal fuel for our growing relationship with the Nation of India. After nearly a four-decade ban on U.S crude oil exports was lifted, Texas sent the first American crude oil to India, and today India is increasingly running on American natural gas. The reason that is important is, when I visited India for the first time in 2004, I witnessed a country that is a study in contrast--some highly populated areas like Delhi and others, and then rural areas on the way to the Taj Mahal in Agra, you can see people literally living off the land and using dried cow manure as fuel for their food and for warmth. Obviously, India needs access to affordable energy that America--and Texas, in particular--can provide to help improve their standard of living. This trade is also vital to our economy in Texas, and we will keep exporting our greatest natural resource to our friends in India and around the world as a result of the energy renaissance we have seen and as a result of the use of unconventional extraction techniques like fracking and horizontal drilling. Those must sound like foreign words to people in Washington, DC, who think we ought to be able to live on solar panels and windmills exclusively, but I always say, as important as renewable energy is--and it is important--Texas generates the most electricity for any State in the Nation from wind turbines. The wind doesn't always blow and the Sun doesn't always shine, and you need some sort of baseload to try to keep the electricity flowing so people can be afforded the comforts of life and particularly in hot Texas summers make sure the air-conditioner continues to work. For as deep as our economic ties are, our cultural ties are just as strong. Texas is home to a vibrant Indian diaspora, with more than 150,000 Indian Americans living in the Houston area alone and perhaps about half a million across our entire State. I was glad the Prime Minister had a chance to witness the Indian culture that is woven into the fabric of our State and meet a number of proud Indian Americans, including the 50,000 who showed up for the ``Howdy, Modi'' events in Houston on Sunday, from 48 States, I am told. Knowing the importance of a strong U.S -India relationship, 15 years ago I cofounded the U.S -India Caucus in the Senate. That was at the request of one of my constituents who founded one of the Indo-American Chambers in the metroplex in Dallas, TX, years ago. He is the one who encouraged my wife and I to travel to India in the first place, where I learned a lot about the country--the study in contrasts I mentioned but also that this is the world's largest democracy, and we shared so many values with that country because of our common English heritage and particularly our respect for the rule of law and use of the English language predominantly. We also saw the advantage of collaborating with India economically-- 1.3 billion people--a great market for the things we make and grow in the United States and a great way to raise the standard of living in India as we deepen our ties militarily and from a national security standpoint. The difference between today and what things were like as recently as 2008, in terms of trade, is just like night and day. In 2016, the United States designated India as a ``major defense partner,'' with the goal of elevating our partnership with India to the same level as those of our other closest allies. Since then, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our defense relationship, such as establishing ministerial dialogue, increasing arms sales to India, and the first U.S -India triservice exercise later this year. We have made real progress, but there is more we can do to ensure that our efforts are aligned, just as our interests are aligned. Particularly as China is on the march, having a strong and vibrant economy and a strong defense partner in India is more important than ever. Earlier this year, I also introduced an amendment to the National Defense [[Page S5652]] Authorization Act, which requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on U.S -India defense cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean within 180 days of enactment. It will allow us to get a clearer picture of current military activities and will enable the Secretary of Defense to enter into military cooperation agreements and conduct regular joint military training and operations with India in the Western Indian Ocean. This would be a major step to bolster our relationship and strengthen our defense cooperation. I am hopeful this provision will ultimately be included in the Defense authorization bill that is now going through the conference committee between the House and the Senate, and I am optimistic we will be able to get the President's signature and see this critical legislation enacted into law. (Ms. McSALLY assumed the Chair.) Tropical Storm Imelda Madam President, briefly, on one other matter, Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall in Southeast Texas last week and dumped massive amounts of rain all across the region. It is just 2 years after Hurricane Harvey, which is a more familiar name to people up here in DC, but the scenes are heartbreakingly similar. It wasn't the high winds so much as it was the incredible amount of water that was dumped into the Houston area and the surrounding counties. Neighborhood streets began to look more like rivers than roads. Folks were wading in the water, carrying children on their shoulders, and personal belongings washed away with raging floodwaters. We have learned before, and we were reminded again, that these storms aren't only disruptive; they are incredibly dangerous. Five people have died as a result of the storm, and hundreds more remain displaced. Imelda was the fifth wettest tropical cyclone in the continental United States, with some areas receiving more than 3\\1/2\\ feet of rain in a very short period of time. But as we have learned before, these trying times seem to somehow bring out the best in people. A group of residents in the small community of Cheek, TX, waded through chest-high water to rescue nine horses. Furniture store owner Jim McIngvale, known to all of us as ``Mattress Mack,'' once again opened up his stores as a shelter for victims. His employees were running rescue operations, taking furniture trucks out to pick up those who had been stranded by high water. There was even a 21-year-old college student who worked all night alone at a Beaumont hotel for 32 hours straight. Not only did he singlehandedly manage a hotel, he and other guests ventured out into the flood to help distribute food and water to truckers stranded in their trucks. I am grateful to the countless people who have helped their neighbors in big and small ways alike and who will no doubt continue supporting their communities in the months ahead. For many Texans, this is the second time in 2 years they have had to recover from extraordinary flooding. The storm completely devastated communities throughout the southeast part of my State, and folks are just now beginning what will undoubtedly be a major cleanup effort. With waters receding, local officials are now taking stock of the damage and moving from response to recovery. These rain events--these huge floods--are often more than any one city or one county can manage alone. It is an all-hands-on-deck moment that brings together local, State, and Federal officials, as well as nongovernmental organizations. Governor Abbott declared a state of disaster in several counties to ensure State resources are available to local government agencies. Last week, I spoke to many of the county judges who have jurisdiction over much of these flooded areas, the hardest hit areas, and I offered my support. I want to assure everyone who has been impacted by the storm that they are not alone and that we are committed to working together as State, local, and Federal officials to ensure that they have what they need to recover from this devastating Tropical Storm Imelda. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, I want to express to the Senator from Texas our concern and our thoughts for all of those who have been so impacted. Digital Responsibility Madam President, the Senator from Texas mentioned the floods and the impact that had happened. I found out about some of the good work of the Good Samaritans in the area by watching what was taking place on social media, and I am certain millions of Americans saw firsthand some of the generosity and the help that was given there. Indeed, the internet and social media platforms have transformed the way we communicate, the way we send out information, and many times the way we receive it. Correspondence that, just a few years ago, would have taken pen, paper, and postage is now sent and received with a simple click of a mouse. Everything happens online, from communicating about disasters to shopping to party planning and to campaigning. We share photos and milestones with our ``friends.'' We let people know that we are OK in times of disasters or that we need help. We share all of this not only with our friends, but we are also sharing it with companies that have built multibillion-dollar empires based on their ability to convince us to surrender just one more little piece of unique data about us or about our families. Beyond social media, we live our everyday transactional lives online also. We bank via apps. We sign up for credit cards using codes we have received in an email and manage our finances with cloud-based software. Information we once would have locked securely in a desk drawer, we now plug into an online forum without ever giving it a second thought. We have contributed to our own, as I call it, ``virtual you''; that is, our personal online footprint unique to us, unique only to us. We have done this by trusting these platforms to keep our data secure. In a way, this level of connectivity and trust has made life a lot easier and more convenient, but it has also made us vulnerable to exploitation and exposure. I have spoken before about consumers' justifiable expectation of a right to privacy online. This year, I introduced the BROWSER Act, which I had previously introduced when I was in the House. It is an effort to codify this right to privacy that consumers expect. BROWSER gives Big Tech basic guidelines to follow when collecting and selling user data, and that user is you. It has become understood that you are the product when you are using these social media apps and experiencing this connectivity. You are the product. You have the right to know that you are that product, and you have the right to decide what is shared about your life. But protecting an individual's data is only part of this picture. Last week, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology held a hearing to address the role that digital services play in the distribution of violent and extremist content. We welcomed testimony from Facebook, Twitter, and Google, detailing what they are doing to remove extremist content on platforms. I will tell you, before we talk about policing content, we, as Members of this body, need to make sure we understand how the American people view their use of social media and the internet. Whether social media platforms should be regulated under the First Amendment is beside the point. Americans view these services as open public forums, where they can speak their minds on everything from defense funding to the Emmy Awards. These consumers don't want the Wild West, nor do they want to be censored based on a content reviewer's subjective opinion. What they want is an objective cop on the beat-- just as in the public square, an objective cop on the beat who is equipped to properly identify incitement, threats, and other types of speech that could put lives at risk. This, of course, is easier said than done. In the case of Facebook, for example, that translates to creating a set of standards that 30,000 in-house engineers and analysts and 15,000 content reviewers will be able to apply--45,000 people, and that is just one platform. There is a reason that time and again Big Tech executives look at Congress [[Page S5653]] and say ``Oh, more regulatory control over the way we do business,'' and it is this: Policing legitimately dangerous content is a big job, and policing ``awful but lawful'' content as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg likes to call it, is an even bigger, more daunting task. It takes 45,000 people to do a bare-minimum job for one company. Imagine trying to create easy-to-understand, bright-line standards that 45,000 employees will be able to digest and apply quickly enough to keep up with the flow of content. That has to be an intimidating task. I will tell you, if those executives think the government could do a better job of deciding down to the letter what those standards should be, I think they are mistaken. Only the engineers and innovators know their companies well enough to set their own internal policies for acceptable uses of their platform, but that is not to say that I will not be taking an interest in their ideas. We need to have a Federal standard of privacy and data security. We need to review censorship and prioritization, competition, and antitrust. For example, Facebook is in the process of putting together a content oversight board to adjudicate users whose posts have been deemed in violation and taken down. They have pledged to make the identities of the moderators and their decisions public--barring any safety risks-- and to choose a diverse panel. The biggest unanswered questions here are these: Will the moderators really reflect the American political spectrum? How will they be chosen? The American people will demand more than a promise to be fair and impartial. As I said, government cannot make these decisions in total for Big Tech, but we can help guide them along the way by passing privacy and data security standards. This is where working groups like the Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force come into play. Last week, I was speaking to a group of private sector tech gurus, and I told them that the only way we will be able to move forward is if the government does more listening and they do more talking and work with us on setting these basic standards. I stand by what I said. It is not--and should not be--Congress's job to decide in retrospect what sort of culture companies like Facebook and Twitter meant to create. It is imperative that these companies understand the American public views them as a public square, an online public square, and it is up to them to be certain that there is an objective cop on the beat. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Declaration of National Emergency Mr. UDALL. Madam President, thank you for the recognition. The Constitution demands that ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'' Like any other matter, it is Congress's power and responsibility to determine how much taxpayer money is spent on the President's request for a border wall. Like most Presidents, he didn't get every dollar he wanted. Now the President, through a sham national emergency declaration, is taking $3.6 billion of funds we appropriated for military construction projects to pay for his wall. The real question is not whether the President is usurping our article I power to appropriate; he is, no doubt about it. The real question is, Will we do something about it? Today I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of our resolution terminating the President's national emergency declaration. Madam President, starting off the debate, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following materials: a joint declaration from former national security officials outlining why the President's border emergency does not qualify under the National Emergencies Act and a September 18, 2019, Washington Post article outlining the dire outcomes warned by the Pentagon if the military construction projects don't go forward. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Joint Declaration of Former United States Government Officials We, the undersigned, declare as follows: 1. We are former officials in the U.S government who have worked on national security and homeland security issues from the White House as well as agencies across the Executive Branch. We have served in senior leadership roles in administrations of both major political parties, and collectively we have devoted a great many decades to protecting the security interests of the United States. We have held the highest security clearances, and we have participated in the highest levels of policy deliberations on a broad range of issues. These include: immigration, border security, counterterrorism, military operations, and our nation's relationship with other countries, including those south of our border. Madeleine K.

On February 15, 2019, the President declared a ``national emergency'' for the purpose of diverting appropriated funds from previously designated uses to build a wall along the southern border. We are aware of no emergency that remotely justifies such a step. The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates. We have lived and worked through national emergencies, and we support the President's power to mobilize the Executive Branch to respond quickly in genuine national emergencies. But under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the President to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border. To our knowledge, the President's assertion of a national emergency here is unprecedented, in that he seeks to address a situation: (1) that has been enduring, rather than one that has arisen suddenly; (2) that in fact has improved over time rather than deteriorated; (3) by reprogramming billions of dollars in funds in the face of clear congressional intent to the contrary; and (4) with assertions that are rebutted not just by the public record, but by his agencies' own official data, documents, and statements. 3. Illegal border crossings are near forty-year lows. At the outset, there is no evidence of a sudden or emergency increase in the number of people seeking to cross the southern border. According to the administration's own data, the numbers of apprehensions and undetected illegal border crossings at the southern border are near forty-year lows. Although there was a modest increase in apprehensions in 2018, that figure is in keeping with the number of apprehensions only two years earlier, and the overall trend indicates a dramatic decline over the last fifteen years in particular. The administration also estimates that ``undetected unlawful entries'' at the southern border ``fell from approximately 851,000 to nearly 62,000'' between fiscal years 2006 to 2016, the most recent years for which data are available. The United States currently hosts what is estimated to be the smallest number of undocumented immigrants since 2004. And in fact, in recent years, the majority of currently undocumented immigrants entered the United States legally, but overstayed their visas, a problem that will not be addressed by the declaration of an emergency along the southern border. 4. There is no documented terrorist or national security emergency at the southern border. There is no reason to believe that there is a terrorist or national security emergency at the southern border that could justify the President's proclamation. a. This administration's own most recent Country Report on Terrorism, released only five months ago, found that ``there was no credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States.'' Since 1975, there has been only one reported incident in which immigrants who had crossed the southern border illegally attempted to commit a terrorist act. That incident occurred more than twelve years ago, and involved three brothers from Macedonia who had been brought into the United States as children more than twenty years earlier. b. Although the White House has claimed, as an argument favoring a wall at the southern border, that almost 4,000 known or suspected terrorists were intercepted at the southern border in a single year, this assertion has since been widely and consistently repudiated, including by this administration's own Department of Homeland Security. The overwhelming majority of individuals on terrorism watchlists who were intercepted by U.S Customs and Border Patrol were attempting to travel to the United States by air; of the individuals on the terrorist watchlist who were encountered while entering the United States during fiscal year 2017, only 13 percent traveled by land. And for those who have attempted to enter by land, only a small fraction do so at the southern border. Between October 2017 and March 2018, forty-one foreign immigrants on the terrorist watchlist were intercepted at the northern border. Only six such immigrants were intercepted at the southern border. 5. There is no emergency related to violent crime at the southern border. Nor can the administration justify its actions on the grounds that the incidence of violent crime on the southern border constitutes a national emergency. Factual evidence consistently shows that unauthorized immigrants have no special proclivity to engage in criminal or violent behavior. According to a Cato Institute analysis of criminological data, undocumented immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated nationwide than are native- born citizens. And in Texas, undocumented immigrants were found to have a first-time conviction rate 32 percent below that of native-born Americans; the conviction rates of unauthorized immigrants for violent crimes such as homicide and sex offenses were also below those of native-born Americans. Meanwhile, overall rates of violent crime in the United States have declined significantly over the past 25 years, falling 49 percent from 1993 to 2017. And violent crime rates in the country's 30 largest cities have decreased on average by 2.7 percent in 2018 alone, further undermining any suggestion that recent crime trends currently warrant the declaration of a national emergency. 6. There is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can be addressed by a wall at the southern border. The administration has claimed that the presence of human and drug trafficking at the border justifies its emergency declaration. But there is no evidence of any such sudden crisis at the southern border that necessitates a reprogramming of appropriations to build a border wall. a. The overwhelming majority of opioids that enter the United States across a land border are carried through legal ports of entry in personal or commercial vehicles, not smuggled through unauthorized border crossings. A border wall would not stop these drugs from entering the United States. Nor would a wall stop drugs from entering via other routes, including smuggling tunnels, which circumvent such physical barriers as fences and walls, and international mail (which is how high-purity fentanyl, for example, is usually shipped from China directly to the United States). b. Likewise, illegal crossings at the southern border are not the principal source of human trafficking victims. About two-thirds of human trafficking victims served by nonprofit organizations that receive funding from the relevant Department of Justice office are U.S citizens, and even among non-citizens, most trafficking victims usually arrive in the country on valid visas. None of these instances of trafficking could be addressed by a border wall. And the three states with the highest per capita trafficking reporting rates are not even located along the southern border. 7. This proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian concerns that do exist at the southern border. There are real humanitarian concerns at the border, but they largely result from the current administration's own deliberate policies towards migrants. For example, the administration has used a ``metering'' policy to turn away families fleeing extreme violence and persecution in their home countries, forcing them to wait indefinitely at the border to present their asylum cases, and has adopted a number of other punitive steps to restrict those seeking asylum at the southern border. These actions have forced asylum-seekers to live on the streets or in makeshift shelters and tent cities with abysmal living conditions, and limited access to basic sanitation has caused outbreaks of disease and death. This state of affairs is a consequence of choices this administration has made, and erecting a wall will do nothing to ease the suffering of these people. 8. Redirecting funds for the claimed ``national emergency'' will undermine U.S national security and foreign policy interests. In the face of a nonexistent threat, redirecting funds for the construction of a wall along the southern border will undermine national security by needlessly pulling resources from Department of Defense programs that are responsible for keeping our troops and our country safe and running effectively. a. Repurposing funds from the defense construction budget will drain money from critical defense infrastructure projects, possibly including improvement of military hospitals, construction of roads, and renovation of on-base housing. And the proclamation will likely continue to divert those armed forces already deployed at the southern border from their usual training activities or missions, affecting troop readiness. b. In addition, the administration's unilateral, provocative actions are heightening tensions with our neighbors to the south, at a moment when we need their help to address a range of Western Hemisphere concerns. These actions are placing friendly governments to the south under impossible pressures and driving partners away. They have especially strained our diplomatic relationship with Mexico, a relationship that is vital to regional efforts ranging from critical intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to cooperative efforts to address the growing tensions with Venezuela. Additionally, the proclamation could well lead to the degradation of the natural environment in a manner that could only contribute to long-term socioeconomic and security challenges. c. Finally, by declaring a national emergency for domestic political reasons with no compelling reason or justification from his senior intelligence and law enforcement officials, the President has further eroded his credibility with foreign leaders, both friend and foe. Should a genuine foreign crisis erupt, this lack of credibility will materially weaken this administration's ability to marshal allies to support the United States, and will embolden adversaries to oppose us. 9. The situation at the border does not require the use of the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the use of the armed forces. We understand that the administration is also claiming that the situation at the southern border ``requires use of the armed forces,'' and that a wall is ``necessary to support such use'' of the armed forces. These claims are implausible. a. Historically, our country has deployed National Guard troops at the border solely to assist the Border Patrol when there was an extremely high number of apprehensions, together with a particularly low number of Border Patrol agents. But currently, even [[Page S5655]] with retention and recruitment challenges, the Border Patrol is at historically high staffing and funding levels, and apprehensions--measured in both absolute and per-agent terms--are near historic lows. b. Furthermore, the composition of southern border crossings has shifted such that families and unaccompanied minors now account for the majority of immigrants seeking entry at the southern border; these individuals do not present a threat that would need to be countered with military force. c. Just last month, when asked what the military is doing at the border that couldn't be done by the Department of Homeland Security if it had the funding for it, a top-level defense official responded, ``[n]one of the capabilities that we are providing [at the southern border] are combat capabilities. It's not a war zone along the border.'' Finally, it is implausible that hundreds of miles of wall across the southern border are somehow necessary to support the use of armed forces. We are aware of no military- or security-related rationale that could remotely justify such an endeavor. 10. There is no basis for circumventing the appropriations process with a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. We do not deny that our nation faces real immigration and national security challenges. But as the foregoing demonstrates, these challenges demand a thoughtful, evidence-based strategy, not a manufactured crisis that rests on falsehoods and fearmongering. In a briefing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on January 29, 2019, less than one month before the Presidential Proclamation, the Directors of the CIA, DNI, FBI, and NSA testified about numerous serious current threats to U.S national security, but none of the officials identified a security crisis at the U.S - Mexico border. In a briefing before the House Armed Services Committee the next day, Pentagon officials acknowledged that the 2018 National Defense Strategy does not identify the southern border as a security threat. Leading legislators with access to classified information and the President's own statements have strongly suggested, if not confirmed, that there is no evidence supporting the administration's claims of an emergency. And it is reported that the President made the decision to circumvent the appropriations process and reprogram money without the Acting Secretary of Defense having even started to consider where the funds might come from, suggesting an absence of consultation and internal deliberations that in our experience are necessary and expected before taking a decision of this magnitude. 11. For all of the foregoing reasons, in our professional opinion, there is no factual basis for the declaration of a national emergency for the purpose of circumventing the appropriations process and reprogramming billions of dollars in funding to construct a wall at the southern border, as directed by the Presidential Proclamation of February 15, 2019.

The warnings are contained in Defense Department budget requests sent to lawmakers in recent years. They include potentially hazardous living conditions for troops and their families, as well as unsafe schools that would impede learning. In numerous cases, the Defense Department warned that lives would be put at risk if buildings don't meet the military's standards for fire safety or management of explosives. Even before $3.6 billion in construction funding was pulled to support a wall along the U.S -Mexico border, military buildings across the country often had been neglected in favor of other priorities. The defense spending limits that took effect after a 2013 budget deal designed to end a government shutdown starved the military's construction budget for years, officials and analysts say, meaning many construction projects are long overdue. The details in the budget documents--annual requests the Pentagon sends to Capitol Hill that are mostly public-- underscore the risky trade-offs Trump made in declaring a national emergency that allowed him to divert funding for the wall. A Pentagon spokesman did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. In requests to Congress over the past three years, military officials describe dilapidated World War II-era warehouses with ``leaking asbestos panel roof systems,'' a drone pilot training facility with sinkholes and a bat infestation, explosives being stored in buildings that didn't meet safety standards and a mold-infested middle school. In numerous instances, Defense Department officials wrote that the infrastructure problems were hurting the military's readiness and impeding the department's national security mission. Democrats and some Republicans strongly oppose the emergency declaration. The Senate is expected to vote for a second time in the coming weeks to overturn it, but Congress does not appear to have enough votes to overcome Trump's veto of such a disapproval resolution. A list of the military construction projects being defunded to pay for the wall was released in early September. But it did not contain details of the Pentagon's explanations to Congress about why the projects were needed--and what would happen if they were not completed. The Washington Post's review of the budget documents is the first attempt to detail those Pentagon warnings. The Post uncovered budget documents pertaining to 29 of the 43 military construction projects in the mainland United States--not including those in territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam--that are being canceled to pay for the wall. The review excluded two projects that had been canceled before the emergency authorization. Many of these documents are publicly available but have not been previously reported. The Pentagon insists that the projects are merely being delayed, not canceled, and Republicans say they will try to ``backfill'' the money in question, but Democrats oppose that strategy. In recent days, the fight over the border wall money has caused angry divisions among lawmakers trying to write annual spending bills to keep the government running, raising the specter of another shutdown this year. Last winter's record-long 35-day partial government shutdown ended only after Trump declared a national emergency because Congress wouldn't give him all the money he wanted for his wall. (During his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed that Mexico would pay for the construction.) Congressional Democrats have rallied around the issue, decrying unsafe conditions in their home districts and nationwide. ``We see across the country--communities, military bases and people in the military--saying, `Taking away this money hurts us,' '' Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y ) said on the Senate floor this week. ``All the Democrats are asking for is to protect the troops from having their resources robbed for a border wall--resources that Congress said should go to the military.'' Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said ``it shocks me that, as commander in chief, [Trump] now insists that it's got to be our troops, our military families and our nation's security that have to be sacrificed for his foolishness,'' noting that $77 million had been ``raided'' from projects in his state. Ominous warnings This month, the Pentagon announced that 127 military construction projects stood to lose funding to pay for Trump's wall. Although Pentagon officials have expressed confidence that the projects ultimately will go forward, there is no guarantee that they will. In many cases, the Pentagon has been ominous in describing the potential outcomes should the projects not happen. The Air Force has been seeking a new training facility for drone pilots at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico because the current training facility had sinkholes and a bat infestation. It also prevents pilot trainees from operating in a classified environment, the Air Force wrote in its publicly accessible budget request. This means trainees could not use a safety system designed to alert drone pilots to the location of ground-based personnel, as well as a separate system designed to prevent aircraft from crashing into one another. The Air Force has been seeking a new control center at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, designed to replace a pair of ``dilapidated WWII-era warehouses'' used for air traffic control and mission control operations even though they have been labeled ``structurally deficient'' and don't meet regulations. The Air Force noted in its budget request that air traffic control equipment is at risk of being destroyed by ``roof leaks from failing asbestos panel roof systems.'' If the $28 million project is not finished, the Air Force warned in 2017, service members will continue to operate in ``aging dilapidated buildings that were never intended for the purpose they are now serving.'' The Air National Guard has been seeking to replace the aircraft parking ramp at a New Orleans facility, which abuts a public roadway. This means munitions-loaded aircraft--which are kept on alert so they can be scrambled quickly in the event of a terrorist attack--expose the public to the ``unacceptable risk'' of being affected by an explosive accident, the Air Force wrote in 2018. An Air Force analysis calculated that members of [[Page S5656]] the public are inside the jets' ``explosive arc'' for about 3,800 hours per year as they pass by the base. In addition, the shelters that hold the aircraft when they aren't parked on the runway are on concrete slabs that are sinking, causing pipes and electrical connections to pull loose. The shelters also did not have fire protections, the Defense Department wrote in 2018. The Defense Department also warned that overly decentralized weapons maintenance buildings in Anniston, Ala., would continue to increase the risk of accidents because of the ``unnecessary movement of artillery pieces.'' The Air Force has been seeking $41 million to repair a central heat power plant boiler at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The Air Force warned in its budget justification to Congress that the boiler, installed in 1951, is expected to fail within the next several years at a base where winter temperatures can plunge as low as 65 degrees below zero. That outcome ``would be devastating to facilities and the missions housed in those facilities,'' the Air Force said. The base could be forced to evacuate, and the facilities would then freeze and require ``many millions of dollars'' to make them usable again. The system in question is one of two 1950s-era boilers that require urgent replacement at Eielson. The failure of the other one is described as ``imminent'' and also could force an evacuation, followed by a deep freeze that would cost millions of dollars to recover from, according to the Air Force's description from 2017. `Substandard,' `unsafe' A different issue looms at Camp Lejeune, N.C , where medical and dental care is provided in ``substandard, inefficient, decentralized and uncontrolled facilities,'' according to the military, which has sought congressional approval to build a new ambulatory care center on the base. Not doing so ``will result in compromised readiness, uncoordinated care delivery, and inappropriate use of medical resources,'' the Pentagon said. At Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, the military sought funding to build a satellite fire station, without which ``personnel . . . will continue to work from a significantly undersized and unsafe facility.'' In another example, the military is seeking to repair a middle school at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, a project that has been championed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and that he has vowed to protect even after its appearance on the list of installations at risk of being canceled to pay for Trump's wall. The Pentagon described conditions at the middle school as ``substandard'' and told lawmakers in requesting $62.6 million to repair it that ``the continued use of deficient, inadequate, and undersized facilities that do not accommodate the current student population will continue to impair the overall education program for students.'' At Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, meanwhile, construction of a much-needed new child-care center has been put on hold in favor of Trump's wall. The Pentagon notes that the facility ``has suffered from sewage backups, heating, ventilation and air conditioning failures and mold and pest management issues.'' The upgraded facility is supposed to accommodate 165 children and staff members. As of February 2018, 115 children were on a waiting list to get in. Joint Base Andrews is also home to the hangar that holds Air Force One. That hangar is being relocated at a cost of $154 million to accommodate a larger Boeing model now being used for Trump. But the new hangar displaces a specialized area designed for unloading hazardous cargo and a separate disposal range where Air Force officials could be trained to defuse bombs. The Air Force requested $37 million for a new hazardous-cargo pad and explosive-ordnance center, but that project has been included on the list of those being canceled to pay for the barrier along the border. The Air Force One hangar project was left untouched. As a result, a temporary facility will be provided. But not replacing the hazardous-cargo pad would cause ``enduring systemic weaknesses'' at the base, while the lack of an explosive-ordinance range would ``adversely impact'' training, which would have to happen somewhere off the base at greater cost, the military said. Mr. UDALL. Madam President, with that, I yield to Senator Murray. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I join my Democratic colleagues on the floor to once again speak out against this President and his administration's outrageous abuses of Executive power. While, unfortunately, there is a myriad of Presidential abuses to which I could be referring, today, this evening, I am here to discuss two of his most recent and most egregious actions that have not only run afoul of Congress's authority and our constitutional system of checks and balances but also compromise our national security. It began with the President making a phony national emergency declaration to bypass Congress and steal money to build his border wall under the auspices of a ``crisis''--one of the President's own making-- in pursuit of advancing the most anti-immigrant agenda this country has seen in generations, all manufactured to secure Federal funds to build his often-touted vanity wall on our southern border. This is a wall the American people were not supposed to pay for and that we, time and again, have indicated we do not want. Now, one would think this extreme overreach of Executive authority alone would get our colleagues on the other side of the aisle riled up enough to defend the Constitution's system of checks and balances, but in declaring his national emergency, President Trump took his overreach one step further, ransacking critical Federal funds--taxpayer dollars-- that were appropriated by Congress to fund important military construction projects and national security priorities across the country. To do what with? To put money toward building his border wall. To be clear, instead of Federal funds going toward military infrastructure priorities such as a new pier and maintenance facility at Naval Base Kitsap in my home State of Washington that would help guide and protect our Navy's vital nuclear submarines, those funds are now going to pay for Trump's border wall. Instead of our military using Federal funds already authorized by Congress to increase access to childcare for our servicemembers and their families, those funds are now going into paying for Trump's wall. While this behavior from our President is predictable, it is no less wrong, underhanded, and unacceptable, and I know I am not the only one who thinks that way. Since the President's rash move to reprogram billions of dollars from our military construction budget toward his border wall, I have heard repeatedly from constituents who are upset by this President's brazen acts of recklessness and are wondering how the President of the United States can just step over Congress to do whatever he wants with our Federal budget, especially when it is on the backs of our troops and their families. I refuse to stand by and do nothing while this President hurts my State and so many others. Why? Because he cares more about his vanity project than our troops, the military community, or the American people. That is why, in the coming days, I plan to introduce new legislation that will not only recoup the military construction funds that were shamefully raided for Trump's border wall but put in place new safeguards to make sure no President today or in the future can so effortlessly bypass the will of Congress to loot the Federal budget. We need to put a check on this President, plain and simple. Right now, we can do so by standing up for Congress and our constitutional authority to set the Federal budget and pay our Nation's bills. So I urge my colleagues to join Democrats in voting to rescind President Trump's bogus national emergency declaration, taking that first step to roll back the President's plunder and hold him accountable because as a coequal branch of our Federal Government, it is not just our job, it is our sworn duty and one this body and our Republican colleagues cannot ignore. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I agree with my distinguished colleagues from Washington State and New Mexico for what they have said. Sometimes casting a vote on the Senate floor is just a matter of course. It is something we do routinely, often without considering the impact of that vote on the Senate as an institution, let alone our constitutional Republic as we know it, but this week's vote on President Trump's national emergency declaration is different. It is a pivotal moment in this body's history. It is a stress test of the very notion of separation of powers. The Constitution speaks of Congress as being a coequal branch of government. Well, this is going to be viewed as a moment when Congress either asserted itself as a coequal branch of government or surrendered as a subordinate to the will of a President who now claims his powers are absolute. This is a President who has said out loud that the Constitution gives him the right to do ``whatever I want as [[Page S5657]] President.'' It makes one wonder if the President has ever actually read the Constitution of the United States. This President is attempting to ignore the explicit will of Congress by simply declaring a national emergency to fund his ``big, beautiful'' wall. That is after, time and time and time again, he gave us his word that Mexico would pay for the wall. For 3 years, he failed to convince Congress that the wall was a good idea. Even when his own party controlled both the House of Representatives and the U.S Senate, his tweets and tantrums could not convince enough Members that his cynical campaign promise was worthy of tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. He could not convince anybody, Republican or Democrat, that he was telling the truth when he said Mexico would pay for it. So when Congress did not comply, he directed his yes-people to tell them he could fund his pet project, nonetheless, by declaring a national emergency out of thin air and stealing the money from our troops and their families. He even admitted his national emergency declaration was a matter of political expediency rather than justified by facts. I remember him standing in the Rose Garden. He said he did not ``need'' to invoke a national emergency; he could ``build the wall over a longer period of time,'' but he just wanted to do it ``faster.'' Once again, the whims and tweets of the President were used to trample our Constitution. President Trump's declaration of a national emergency to build his wall should offend all 100 Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike-- in this body. First and foremost, he is using it to steal $3.6 billion from critical military construction projects that would benefit our men and women in uniform and their families. This impacts 127 military construction projects, including a child development center, an elementary school, a fire and rescue station--all falling victim to his fixation on the wall. He is telling the families of our military who are living in substandard housing--some of it with mold and other damaging health conditions--that, no, you are not going to get that money you need to fix that up. I am going to put it toward my wall. We already ask our military families to sacrifice so much to keep our country safe. Now they have to sacrifice, yet again, and to what end? To keep this President's ego safe. Furthermore, I would note that his national emergency declaration is a transparent end-run around Congress's constitutional power of the purse. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution, which I doubt the President has ever bothered to read, states that Congress--and Congress alone--decides how to spend Americans' hard-earned tax dollars. That has been the case from the time of the founding of this country until today. It is one of the most critical checks and balances in our constitutional system. In our democracy, Presidents must respect--and normally do--the appropriations decisions of Congress but, for the first time, not this President. I was here when Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976. When we passed it then, we assumed that any President would have enough respect for the office to invoke the extraordinary powers granted under it judiciously and only in times when there was, in fact, an emergency to be addressed. But not this President. Where the world sees women and children seeking refuge at our southern border, he sees criminals and terrorists invading our country. Where the world sees declining border crossings-- crossings have dropped steeply since June--he sees an escalating border crisis that only his wall can fix. Facts may not matter to a President willing to invent a hurricane path with a sharpie marker, but they should matter to us. We must not allow this President to invoke such sweeping powers--powers we granted to him for real emergencies--simply to address some emergency he has concocted in his head. So this week I hope all Senators, no matter what their political background is, will think carefully about their vote on the President's national emergency declaration. I hope each of us thinks long and hard about what it would mean for our role as a coequal branch, for the separation of powers, for the Constitution, which has protected our country all these years, and what would it mean if we fail to reject this naked power grab by President Trump. In March, 12 of my Republican friends joined Democrats in rejecting the President's emergency declaration, forcing him to override our vote with a veto. I hope every one of us tonight will go home and read the Constitution and realize what we must do. I hope more Republicans will join Democrats this time in voting aye on the joint resolution of disapproval. We must send this President a veto-proof message that Congress will rise above party to protect what is most precious in our American democracy; the Senate will stand for the Constitution above all else; that the Senate will be the conscience of the Nation, as we should be. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues and very much appreciate Senator Udall's leadership on the joint resolution we are speaking to today. This is the resolution that would end the President's unconstitutional emergency declaration, which is diverting money from critical military construction projects to fund a costly and ineffective border wall. Congress has made it abundantly clear that we did not provide funding for the President's border wall and that we don't approve of raiding military resources to fund his campaign promise--which, by the way, the President vowed Mexico would pay for. It is important to note that Congress works on a bipartisan basis to provide funding to secure the southern border. According to the Constitution, it is Congress and not the President who holds the power of the purse. Just 6 months ago, in a strong bipartisan vote, a majority of this body--59 Senators--successfully passed the resolution disapproving of the President's emergency declaration. Unfortunately, President Trump chose to veto that legislation, which is why we have brought it to the floor again for a vote. It is imperative that this legislative body--this Senate--defend its authority as derived from the Constitution and protect funding that is vital to our troops and to our national security. I think it is difficult to overstate the critical role military construction projects play in maintaining military readiness and supporting our national defense. Yet this administration is treating funding set aside for our national security like a slush fund. Take military construction, for instance. At the Portsmouth Naval shipyard in New Hampshire and Maine--it is on the border between New Hampshire and Maine--any disruptions for funding in construction projects can result in costly delays to our military's carefully crafted plans to upgrade aging infrastructure. Delays in projects that support the shipyard's mission threaten to exacerbate the Navy's already high demand for submarine maintenance and the projected submarine shortfall in the coming years. In addition, New Hampshire's National Guard readiness centers are in desperate need of modernization, and they can't afford further delays to readiness center improvements. All those projects are funded through the military construction program. While New Hampshire's and Maine's shipyard and National Guard were spared from President Trump's latest money grab, the same can't be said for 127 other important military construction projects across this country. The 552 middle school children at Fort Campbell in the majority leader's home State of Kentucky will have to wait for a new school as President Trump diverts construction funding to the border. Critical projects in Virginia that would improve a cyber operations facility and replace hazardous materials in warehouses are another casualty of President Trump's political games. The Child Development Center in Maryland, the missile field in Alaska, the weapon maintenance shop in Alabama--the list of projects that are affected by the President's unconstitutional mandate just goes on and on. It includes hundreds of millions of dollars for critical infrastructure to support the Defense Department's European Deterrence Initiative. What message does that send to our European allies [[Page S5658]] on our efforts to deter Russian aggression? The impact of the President's actions and Congress's own complacency is painfully real to the men and women who serve our Nation. These are the same men and women who are being deprived of the resources they need to complete their mission. Perhaps not surprising, there are now reports indicating that the Trump administration is again planning to take military construction funds appropriated by Congress to build the border wall. According to the Washington Post, you can see this pretty clearly. The administration plans to pitch its appropriations request to Congress as replenishment money to the Department of Defense for the money they took this year to fund the border wall. A Trump administration official said: The plan is to sell it as replenishment money. . . . Then once they got it from Congress, they would take it again. This isn't just a one-time deal. We are talking about the administration setting us up to do this again and again and again. This type of deception from the administration makes funding the government extremely difficult for Congress because we can't trust--we don't know if the President is negotiating in good faith. The Members of the legislative branch are endowed by the Constitution with the power to fund the government. We must be sure that the resources we provide in spending legislation are being used as they were intended by the Congress. This constitutional duty is particularly salient when the President has shown such a flagrant disregard for congressional intent and the constitutional separation of powers. The authority of the Congress is very clear: The power of the purse is held by the legislative branch. Those powers were enumerated for the very reason that we are here today--to shield against an overreaching Executive. This isn't about Democrat versus Republican; this is about whether Congress votes to uphold its powers and responsibilities--powers and responsibilities that are enshrined in the Constitution. We must take action now in defense of both our Constitution and our national security. I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect our constitutional authority as Members of Congress, to defend our national security, and to support the resolution to terminate President Trump's emergency declaration. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I very much appreciate being joined on the floor by my colleagues at this critical time in history. Senator Shaheen just spoke. We also had Senator Murray and Senator Leahy down here. This issue will come to a head tomorrow. We are really at a crossroads. This body can continue to allow the President to subvert our constitutional authority to appropriate, or we can take back our power of the purse and exercise it as the Founders intended. The issue before us is not partisan; it is constitutional. If we don't put the Constitution above party, above politics, we might as well pack up our bags and go home. The voters did not send us here to shirk our responsibilities. History will not be kind to us if we allow the Executive to run roughshod over our constitutional authority. For the second time, we have introduced a bipartisan resolution to terminate the President's national emergency declaration along our southern border. I thank Senators Collins and Shaheen for once again joining this resolution and affirming their commitment to the Constitution. Our first vote on this resolution in March passed 59 to 41. We had strong bipartisan support because the President's emergency declaration is clearly an end run around Congress. We have the power to bring this resolution back every 6 months. I hope we can add to our majority this time because what were once fears about a so-called emergency in March have become a stark reality in September. While I firmly oppose the President's approach on immigration, this vote is not about whether you oppose or support that approach. In March, a Republican Senator wrote in conviction about the President's emergency declaration: It is my responsibility to be a steward of the article I branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the past century. I stood by that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand by it now. We all have another opportunity to stand with the Constitution and to object to a President actively diverting billions in defense funding for a political purpose. Congress, not the President, was given the power of the purse to make sure taxpayer money was spent on projects with broad public support. We have different views in Congress, but as a whole, we have responded to the American people, and we have not appropriated all the funds the President has sought for his wall. But instead of allowing Congress to decide on spending, which is what the Constitution envisions, the President caused the longest shutdown in American history to get his wall. That 35-day shutdown caused a lot of pain and anxiety for many Federal workers and contractors and their families in New Mexico and across the Nation. When the shutdown didn't work, the President issued his emergency declaration. If we allow this President to issue an emergency declaration to get funding for his wall, we will be setting a dangerous precedent--a precedent that could be used by future Presidents on issues my Republican colleagues surely wouldn't like. The President is now taking $3.6 billion from 127 military construction projects that we have approved and funded. We all know the rigor with which these projects have been vetted, scrutinized, and approved. According to the Pentagon, these projects are necessary for national security and military readiness, necessary to ensure the safety of our men and women in uniform and their children. In other words, they are not projects simply designed to fulfill a campaign slogan. Two projects in New Mexico are on the chopping block, and both are critical. One is an $85 million drone pilot training center at Holloman Air Force Base to replace a facility that is falling apart, and the other is a $40 million secure information technology facility at White Sands Missile Range. Both of those are gone. In Utah, the Air Force has sought a new control center at Hill Air Force Base to replace ``structurally deficient, dilapidated World War II-era warehouses'' for mission control. In Louisiana, the Air National Guard sought to replace an aircraft parking ramp in a New Orleans facility that exposes the public to ``unacceptable risks'' of being impacted by an explosive accident. In Indiana, Army servicemembers have worked in violation of safety standards for handling explosives and need additional space from munitions. In Kentucky, the military seeks to repair substandard, deficient, inadequate, and undersized facilities at a majority school at Fort Campbell that impairs the overall education program for the children of servicemembers. Back in March, we worried that this would happen, but now it is a reality. Our men and women in uniform and their children are paying for the wall. And if we do not stand up and stop it today, it will happen again and again. This is unacceptable, and I believe it is unlawful and unconstitutional. We here in the Senate have decided to fund these projects and others in 23 States instead of a border wall, and with good reason. Some in Congress are calling for us to backfill 127 projects and reappropriate the funds for them. Backfilling does not solve the problem. It does not repair the constitutional violation. It only gives license to the President to continue raiding funds we have already appropriated for military construction projects. Unless we stop the emergency, the backfilled money will be subject to being raided again. If your house is robbed, it is foolish to buy new valuables without putting a new lock on the door. Canceling these 127 projects is not just a one-off; we all know the President fully intends to keep it. It has already been reported that if the President doesn't get the $5 billion he has requested for his wall in 2020, the administration plans to take another $3.6 billion from the Pentagon's construction budget.

As the Right Honourable lady will fully understand, the decisions about criminal investigations in Northern Ireland are a matter for the Police Service of Northern Ireland and for the independent public prosecution service. We very much hope as a government that any member of the public who has information that will lead to Lyra's murderers being brought to justice comes forward, and I am hopeful, given the sense of community solidarity that there has been in Londonderry, Derry and Northern Ireland generally, that that information will be forthcoming. I thank the Minister for his answer and I know he speaks with huge authority and passion on the issue. </p><p>Reading the statement from the so-called new IRA last week with its talk of attacking Emily forces and its sincere condolences -- enemy forces. for the death of Lyra is a sickening throwback to what we thought we had left behind 20 years ago, from despicable individuals whose only desire is to turn back the clock and destroy the progress made. So does the Minister for the Cabinet Office agree with me that this is one of the central reason is that we must find an answer to the Northern Irish border question rather than give these evil terrorists the divisions that they crave? I think that I would draw a distinction between the issues that the Right Honourable lady has raised as important. But I don't think that those murderers in Derry were motivated by any thoughts about the border or customs arrangements, important though those issues are. I think what the Right Honourable lady said that I wholly agreed with was the utter unacceptability of references to police officers in Northern Ireland as if they were somehow a legitimate target. One of the great achievements of the peace building process in Northern Ireland has been the very difficult and controversial reform of the police service where you now have young men and women from both Unionist and nationalist communities who served gladly together upholding law and justice in Northern Ireland and we should all of us in this House continue to send every officer our full support. I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed, but can I bring him back to the issue of the border. Because I agree with him about the ends he tries to achieve but the fundamental problem is the means. We know his own party and the DUP will not accept the current backstop and the only way the government plans to avoid the backstop is to deliver a so called invisible border, but last week we saw a leaked Home Office presentation stating that, and I quote, \"no government worldwide currently has a system in place and 2030 is the time for the UK and there is currently no budget for either a pilot or for the programme itself. So can the Minister tell us are the Home Office wrong? Well, I'm not going to comment on alleged leaks from government departments, but what I can say to the House is that the government has allocated #20 million to invest in work on alternative measures that would bring benefits in terms of seamless trade, both to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but which, if successful, more generally, could be applied to give us smart borders on all of the UK's external borders and perhaps offer us export opportunities for that technology as well. It's interesting what the minister says, but the Home Office also says that there are six problems with deploying the technological solutions. It is expensive, there is no budget. It has to operate with 28 different government agencies. It has to operate on both sides of the border. It won't be deliverable until 2030. With covenant has a poor track record on big tech projects. And nobody in the world has done anything similar. So that, Mr Speaker, is hardly a recipe for success. The real answer to the Northern Ireland border question is staring the government in the face. 28 months ago and two Brexit secretaries ago I told the minister from this dispatch box that the only way to avoid a hard border was staying in a customs union and, of course, the alignment of all rules and regulations</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-0a75e681125c4725b7c4b44a82b83ce1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W02-43V1-JBH6-C4H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Will the pipeline flow both ways?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When people discuss what Amazon's second headquarters will mean for Northern Virginia, they speak of big numbers. There is the tech giant's promise of $2.5 billion in investment and 25,000 jobs, a $1 billion Virginia Tech Innovation Campus in the works, George Mason University's planned $250 million School of Computing, and a branch of the University of Virginia's $120 million School of Data Science. Together, these ventures aim to turn a Washington, D.C., suburb historically reliant on federal employment and defense contracts into a vibrant, high-tech mecca rich with entrepreneurs and start-ups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For game-changing impact, however, someone like Luis Hernandez may be the more important gauge. The son of El Salvadoran immigrants and father of three felt an itch to return to school after working in restaurants, roofing, and property management. After completing his first semester studying datacenter operations at Northern Virginia Community College, he now, at the age of 27, has a high-tech toehold: an internship with Equinix, whose growing chain of data centers is a direct-connect partner of Amazon Web Services, the company's database storage and cloud computing arm.</p><p>NOVA, as the school Hernandez attends is known, may be a dark-horse institution in the region's transformation. But the two-year public college, one of the country's largest, plays an outsize role in the race to broaden participation and address a critical shortage of tech talent. Though the deficit affects businesses nationwide, the situation is particularly acute in Virginia, where economic planners estimate that 10 percent of all IT positions-about 30,000 jobs-go unfilled. That compares with a 6 percent gap between demand and supply in California, Massachusetts, and New York.</p><p>Redefining Relationships</p><p>Amazon's arrival presents educators with similarly exciting opportunities \"to do something different\" and \"think about pathways more broadly,\" says Julia Ross, Virginia Tech's engineering dean. That includes collaborating more closely with industry to design flexible certificate and master's degree programs for working professionals that actually provide the knowledge and skills needed to advance or switch careers. Ross believes that the university's long-planned expansion- which calls for enrolling 2,000 more engineering and computer science students and adding 140 new faculty in Blacksburg, while tripling the size of its Northern Virginia footprint and hiring 40 new faculty for the Innovation Campus-will not only provide a competitive advantage when recruiting faculty but also facilitate scholarship and advocacy at the \"intersection of engineering and policy.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a trailblazing program launched by NOVA last October in partnership with George Mason University could prove a model for increasing inclusion and equity in engineering, technology, and computer science. ADVANCE removes barriers that have long frustrated community college students seeking affordable routes to a bachelor's degree: inadequate guidance on choosing a major and course requirements, credits wasted because they don't count toward the degree, and the need to spend extra time and money catching up. Instead, students have dedicated advisers and \"success coaches\" throughout their academic journey, a coordinated curriculum so that credits convey between institutions, and guaranteed admission to GMU for qualified NOVA students. \"The goal is to have a seamless transfer,\" says GMU's engineering dean, Kenneth Ball, who predicts ADVANCE \"will have a huge impact on diversity\" in engineering and computer science. The first cohort of 129 ADVANCE students will start to graduate in 2022, just in time to seize early opportunities in the Amazon era. A number of them currently are pursuing computer science, a path stressed by the state. \"We are working on a cloud [computing] pathway that maps perfect- ly with George Mason,\" says Chad Knights, provost ofinformation and engineering technologies at NOVA. The college shares a similarly mapped program with George Washington University as well, but \"we don't have a fancy name for it yet\"</p><p>Virginia evidently made a convincing case that it could supply talent, graduate education for working professionals, and skills upgrades. Northern Virginia's large and expanding pool of engineering and computer science graduates, academic experts, and research labs, in addition to the state's long-range commitment to education, ultimately outweighed the hefty tax incentives dangled by some other HQ2 finalists. But given Amazon's stake in the capital region, it's a wonder that other jurisdictions were even in the running. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. His company won a $600 million cloud-computing contract from the CIA in 2013, is competing against Microsoft for a new Pentagon contract worth $10 billion, and is likely to seek a share of a new intelligence cloud-computing project- dubbed C2E-that could be worth tens of billions of dollars, according to the Washington Post. HQ2's benefits will reach beyond Virginia, argues Darryll Pines, engineering dean at the University of Maryland-College Park. \"There's a huge pool of talent in the DMV (District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia) region that Amazon will want to tap into,\" he says. Devdas Shetty, engineering dean at the University of the District of Columbia, believes his school's new emphasis on cloud computing and big data should prepare students for jobs at Amazon as well as other tech firms. \"What I suspect is, starting next year, students will get more internships with them,\" he says.</p><p>Amazon's ties with academia defy simple definition. It's at once a marketer, employer, donor (see sidebar), research sponsor, and talent scout. Hiring criteria defy description as well. \"The company is interested inherently in 'Is there a better mousetrap to build? ' The hiring we will do here will be to build better mousetraps,\" Steve Hartell, Amazon's director for U.S. public policy, told a February forum.</p><p>AWS Educate, part of Amazon's high-earning cloud-computing business ($25.7 billion in 2018), sells an array of classroom and lab tools to universities. NOVA is helping to shape AWS collaborated with AWS Educateon a cloud computing curriculum. The firm encourages tomorrow's technology developers with contests like the Picking Challenge and follow-on Amazon Robotics Challenge. AWS Research Initiatives, meanwhile, works with the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health to sponsor computer, engineering, biomedical, and information science research. The company also sponsors faculty members through Amazon Research Awards (ARA). \"I expect we will collaborate with them on research over time,\" says Deborah Crawford, George Mason's vice president for research.</p><p>Fairer Algorithms and Privacy Protection</p><p>Virginia Tech's Bert Huang thought his research topic would grab the attention of ARA judges, and he was right, winning an award of about $66,000. His project, Measuring and Mitigating Intersectional Unfairness of Recommendation Engines, investigates ways that Web recommendation engines may skew their suggestions based on a user's race, age, gender, or economic status. \"Algorithms don't know we're not supposed to do that,\" says Huang, an assistant professor of computer science. Widely used by Amazon and others to market books, movies, and other products based on perceived customer desires, such recommendation algorithms could draw on flawed, discriminatory historical data to influence a range of decisions, such as how harsh a criminal penalty to impose or whether a female student should major in STEM. Huang's team aims to build fairness into recommendations. \"We want to make sure the algorithm will consider multiple dimensions\" of a person's identity, he says.</p><p>Amazon also could benefit from a special niche carved out by U.Va.'s new School of Data Science, argues Philip Bourne, director of the existing Institute of Data Science and the new school's interim dean. Among some 130 similar programs nationwide, \"what distinguishes us,\" he says, \"is the notion of responsible data science-data science for the public good.\" Funded by a $120 million gift from hedge-fund founder Jaffray Woodriff, a U. Va. alumnus, the school will draw heavily on partnerships with experts in behavioral sciences and the humanities in building ethical approaches to data collection and use. As Facebook and other big tech firms face a firestorm over exploiting users' data, \"it's clear companies want this,\" he says-\"any company grappling with the implications of data algorithm bias [and its] potential to backfire.\"</p><p>Such initiatives didn't sprout overnight. Three years before Amazon launched its HQ2 search, Virginia Tech began developing a vision for sustained, dramatic transformation focused on large increases in computer science and engineering enrollment and faculty along with building a new tech-focused campus for graduate education and entrepreneurship in northern Virginia. Thus, when state economic planners held what one participant called a \"very messy\" conference call with dozens of Virginia higher-education leaders to discuss how their schools might contribute to the commonwealth's-and Amazon's-tech talent pipeline, the Blacksburg landgrant institution was ready. Plans had already advanced for the Innovation Campus, a million-square-foot graduate education facility with research labs, a start-up incubator, housing, and retail. Virginia then pledged $250 million-a quarter of the funds to build it. \"This is actually well aligned with us,\" says Luke Lester, professor and chair of electrical and computer engineering at Virginia Tech. \"What Amazon did was give us the incentive to double what we're doing\" to produce more engineers.</p><p>Close behind is George Mason, the state's largest public university, where enrollment in engineering has almost doubled-to just shy of 8,000-since Ball became dean in 2012. Much of the growth has been in computer-related fields, including information and data science and cybersecurity. Besides the planned School of Computing, half of which will be funded by the state and half through fundraising, GMU will create an Institute for Digital InnovAtion (IDIA), which Crawford sees as \"an ecosystem to help young companies make it,\" combining research, graduate training, and technology transfer.</p><p>Both Virginia Tech's and George Mason's plans mesh with Virginia's vision for higher education, which calls for an increase in undergraduate enrollment statewide and a focus on preparing more residents for the tech economy. They also fit a new reality that computing is part of every engineering discipline and of other fields besides. \"It's all about convergence,\" Ball says, and preparing students for \"a digitized, data-driven economy.\" As a large, consumer-oriented IT company, Amazon also will \"have a catalytic effect\" in helping to steer the region's economy away from overly heavy dependence on the federal government, says Crawford.</p><p>Along with opportunities for \"new and innovative\" partnerships with industry, particularly the many defense contractors that cluster near the Pentagon, Virginia Tech's engineering dean Ross says the new campus's proximity to Washington's power corridors will allow academics to more easily shape the regulatory environment in which their breakthrough technologies will operate. \"It's a real opportunity for us,\" Ross says. \"There's a lot of policy that doesn't exist yet\" in fields like autonomous systems, in which Virginia Tech is actively engaged, operating a drone flight research center for the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Indeed, research and development on drones is one field where Amazon-a company built on speedy delivery-has an obvious interest, say engineering educators. No single school has a monopoly on the technology, and progress has been rapid. At around midnight on April 18, a drone carried a donor kidney 2.6 miles in 10 minutes across Baltimore to the University of Maryland Medical Center, where surgeons successfully transplanted it into a patient with renal failure. The flight relied on algorithms provided by the university's aerospace engineering department, Pines notes.</p><p>Public policy is an area where Howard University anticipates deep involvement. \"We want to play a significant role in addressing questions pertaining to how we embrace technology,\" says Moses Garuba, associate dean for academic affairs at Howard University's College of Engineering and Architecture. Howard is among the founding members, along with Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, MIT, and Stanford, of the new Public Interest Technology University Network, an initiative of the liberal-leaning New America Foundation. The school has adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Amazon and can probably afford to, given its flourishing relationship with Google. Launched in 2017 at Go ogle's Silicon Valley headquarters, Howard West is now a full academic-year program, renamed Tech Exchange, with 65 students and five faculty members from Howard and 10 other minority-serving institutions.</p><p>Like local residents who worry about Amazon's effect on housing prices and traffic, Virginia's institutions must grapple with the headaches that accompany growth. One faculty skeptic, speaking anonymously, is wary of too close an association with a corporate behemoth and wonders if faculty members will be consulted in what he says has been a top-down, consultant-driven planning process. Virginia Tech's Ross acknowledges the \"heavy lift\" to ramp up on a now accelerated timeline while still adhering to the rigorous process for approving new programs that ensures a rich educational experience for students. GMU's Ball, meanwhile, faces the quotidian challenge of finding room for his burgeoning faculty and student body. \"Physical resources are going to be strained,\" he says. \"It takes a lot of flexibility, a lot of planning, a lot of better space utilization.\"</p><p>Change will be a challenge for the whole region as Amazon settles in. But Hernandez, reflecting on his new career path as he trains to run one of proliferating local data centers, recalls his time as a roofer. \"My boss told me that I probably didn't want to do this the rest of my life, and I thought, you know what? He's right.\"</p><p>Mary Lord is deputy editor, Jennifer Pocock is associate editor, and Mark Matthews is editor of Prism.</p><p>DEAR JEFF, CAN YOU SPARE A COUPLE OF MILLION?</p><p>In Seattle, Amazon is a GENEROUS benefactor, but picky about hiring.</p><p>By Margaret Loftus</p><p>When the University of Washington's School of Computer Science and Engineering needed money to lure two rising East Coast stars in the machine-learning world, they knew just whom to contact. \"I sent Jeff an e-mail asking if Amazon could help,\" says Ed Lazowska, a computing science professor who holds the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Chair. \"Within 24 hours, we had a commitment for two $1 million Amazonendowed professorships in machine learning.\"</p><p>It didn't hurt that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had recently been on campus explaining to Lazowska and his colleagues why he considered machine learning the key to the future. The faculty coup \"transformed us into a power in machine learning,\" Lazowska says. The endowment exemplifies the strong relationship the online retail giant has with the academic community in its hometown, particularly in computer science and engineering.</p><p>As the region's leading research institution, UW has reaped the lion's share of Amazon's attention. Earlier this year, the school opened a second computer science building that includes the 240-seat Amazon Auditorium, named in recognition of a $10 million gift from the company. But the company is generous to smaller programs as well. Seattle University expects to receive a $3 million gift to support its Center for Science and Innovation, slated to open in 2021. The new center will help to increase the number of computer science and engineering students the university graduates, currently 400 per year.</p><p>\"[Amazon] still has a start-up mentality,\" says Michael Quinn, the dean of the College of Science and Engineering at Seattle University. \"They're very focused on growing fast, so that affects the way we engage with them. They're laser-focused on how we can help them.\"</p><p>Still, there's by no means a direct pipeline to Amazon from Seattle-area universities, says Gail Cornelius, who's helmed UW's College of Engineering career center since its founding in 2015. \"It's very difficult to get in,\" she says, pointing out that local grads are still up against those from elite programs around the country. For instance, Amazon has hired only 124 students fresh out of UW with bachelor's-degrees in the past five years. And out of the 1,100 engineering students that will graduate this year, Cornelius says, \"I wouldn't bank on more than 40 going to Amazon.\"</p><p>But the job market is bolstered by all manner of start-ups spawned by the presence of Amazon and Microsoft. \"Even though most of our students do not work at Microsoft and Amazon right after graduation, preparing for interviews at these two giants still prepares our students well for interviewing and securing jobs at the numerous other companies in town,\" says Melani Plett, director of engineering and computer science at Seattle Pacific University.</p><p>Amazon plays host to myriad networking events that bring together job seekers and the industry. For instance, it hosts UW computer science alumni mixers and recently helped the local chapter of AnitaB.org, which supports women in high tech, to put on Hopperx1, a two-day conference. \"Networking is a huge factor in getting tech jobs,\" says Roshanak Roshandel, chair of the computer science department at Seattle University. \"Amazon does a good job of fostering relationships and making themselves available for these kinds of events, which is critical for the tech community and culture.\"</p><p>It also fosters cross-fertilization. Some 25 Amazon employees are currently enrolled in UW's professional computer science master's program and one of the school's top robotics faculty members, Sidd Srinivasa, is on a partial leave of absence for the next few years as he runs the company's 700-person fulfillment center robotics group. \"Amazon afforded him the opportunity to see what decades of research in robotics could do in the real world in an exceptionally challenging environment-an opportunity he could never have as a 'pure' faculty member, building robots in a lab and publishing papers,\" says Lasowska.</p><p>Roshandel, too, has been working at Amazon. On sabbatical since October, she joined the Amazon Scholars program, which hires academics from around the world on a temporary basis to focus on large-scale technical challenges at the company. \"It's been an amazing opportunity from a professional development point of view,\" she says. She plans to transition back to academia this fall. \"Amazon has done a lot of good things for the community,\" Roshandel says. \"And from the point of view of a computer science professor, it has definitely enriched my students' experiences.\"</p><p>OF THIS YEAR'S 1,100 ENGINEERING GRADUATES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, \"I WOULDN'T BANK ON MORE THAN 40 GOING TO AMAZON.\"</p><p>- GAIL CORNELIUS</p><p>CAREER CENTER DIRECTOR</p><p>\"THE COMPANY IS INTERESTED INHERENTLY IN 'IS THERE A BETTER MOUSETRAP TO BUILD?'

Will the pipeline flow both ways?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When people discuss what Amazon's second headquarters will mean for Northern Virginia, they speak of big numbers. There is the tech giant's promise of $2.5 billion in investment and 25,000 jobs, a $1 billion Virginia Tech Innovation Campus in the works, George Mason University's planned $250 million School of Computing, and a branch of the University of Virginia's $120 million School of Data Science. Together, these ventures aim to turn a Washington, D.C., suburb historically reliant on federal employment and defense contracts into a vibrant, high-tech mecca rich with entrepreneurs and start-ups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For game-changing impact, however, someone like Luis Hernandez may be the more important gauge. The son of El Salvadoran immigrants and father of three felt an itch to return to school after working in restaurants, roofing, and property management. After completing his first semester studying datacenter operations at Northern Virginia Community College, he now, at the age of 27, has a high-tech toehold: an internship with Equinix, whose growing chain of data centers is a direct-connect partner of Amazon Web Services, the company's database storage and cloud computing arm.</p><p>NOVA, as the school Hernandez attends is known, may be a dark-horse institution in the region's transformation. But the two-year public college, one of the country's largest, plays an outsize role in the race to broaden participation and address a critical shortage of tech talent. Though the deficit affects businesses nationwide, the situation is particularly acute in Virginia, where economic planners estimate that 10 percent of all IT positions-about 30,000 jobs-go unfilled. That compares with a 6 percent gap between demand and supply in California, Massachusetts, and New York.</p><p>Redefining Relationships</p><p>Amazon's arrival presents educators with similarly exciting opportunities \"to do something different\" and \"think about pathways more broadly,\" says Julia Ross, Virginia Tech's engineering dean. That includes collaborating more closely with industry to design flexible certificate and master's degree programs for working professionals that actually provide the knowledge and skills needed to advance or switch careers. Ross believes that the university's long-planned expansion- which calls for enrolling 2,000 more engineering and computer science students and adding 140 new faculty in Blacksburg, while tripling the size of its Northern Virginia footprint and hiring 40 new faculty for the Innovation Campus-will not only provide a competitive advantage when recruiting faculty but also facilitate scholarship and advocacy at the \"intersection of engineering and policy.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a trailblazing program launched by NOVA last October in partnership with George Mason University could prove a model for increasing inclusion and equity in engineering, technology, and computer science. ADVANCE removes barriers that have long frustrated community college students seeking affordable routes to a bachelor's degree: inadequate guidance on choosing a major and course requirements, credits wasted because they don't count toward the degree, and the need to spend extra time and money catching up. Instead, students have dedicated advisers and \"success coaches\" throughout their academic journey, a coordinated curriculum so that credits convey between institutions, and guaranteed admission to GMU for qualified NOVA students. \"The goal is to have a seamless transfer,\" says GMU's engineering dean, Kenneth Ball, who predicts ADVANCE \"will have a huge impact on diversity\" in engineering and computer science. The first cohort of 129 ADVANCE students will start to graduate in 2022, just in time to seize early opportunities in the Amazon era. A number of them currently are pursuing computer science, a path stressed by the state. \"We are working on a cloud [computing] pathway that maps perfect- ly with George Mason,\" says Chad Knights, provost ofinformation and engineering technologies at NOVA. The college shares a similarly mapped program with George Washington University as well, but \"we don't have a fancy name for it yet\"</p><p>Virginia evidently made a convincing case that it could supply talent, graduate education for working professionals, and skills upgrades. Northern Virginia's large and expanding pool of engineering and computer science graduates, academic experts, and research labs, in addition to the state's long-range commitment to education, ultimately outweighed the hefty tax incentives dangled by some other HQ2 finalists. But given Amazon's stake in the capital region, it's a wonder that other jurisdictions were even in the running. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. His company won a $600 million cloud-computing contract from the CIA in 2013, is competing against Microsoft for a new Pentagon contract worth $10 billion, and is likely to seek a share of a new intelligence cloud-computing project- dubbed C2E-that could be worth tens of billions of dollars, according to the Washington Post. HQ2's benefits will reach beyond Virginia, argues Darryll Pines, engineering dean at the University of Maryland-College Park. \"There's a huge pool of talent in the DMV (District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia) region that Amazon will want to tap into,\" he says. Devdas Shetty, engineering dean at the University of the District of Columbia, believes his school's new emphasis on cloud computing and big data should prepare students for jobs at Amazon as well as other tech firms. \"What I suspect is, starting next year, students will get more internships with them,\" he says.</p><p>Amazon's ties with academia defy simple definition. It's at once a marketer, employer, donor (see sidebar), research sponsor, and talent scout. Hiring criteria defy description as well. \"The company is interested inherently in 'Is there a better mousetrap to build? ' The hiring we will do here will be to build better mousetraps,\" Steve Hartell, Amazon's director for U.S. public policy, told a February forum.</p><p>AWS Educate, part of Amazon's high-earning cloud-computing business ($25.7 billion in 2018), sells an array of classroom and lab tools to universities. NOVA is helping to shape AWS collaborated with AWS Educateon a cloud computing curriculum. The firm encourages tomorrow's technology developers with contests like the Picking Challenge and follow-on Amazon Robotics Challenge. AWS Research Initiatives, meanwhile, works with the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health to sponsor computer, engineering, biomedical, and information science research. The company also sponsors faculty members through Amazon Research Awards (ARA). \"I expect we will collaborate with them on research over time,\" says Deborah Crawford, George Mason's vice president for research.</p><p>Fairer Algorithms and Privacy Protection</p><p>Virginia Tech's Bert Huang thought his research topic would grab the attention of ARA judges, and he was right, winning an award of about $66,000. His project, Measuring and Mitigating Intersectional Unfairness of Recommendation Engines, investigates ways that Web recommendation engines may skew their suggestions based on a user's race, age, gender, or economic status. \"Algorithms don't know we're not supposed to do that,\" says Huang, an assistant professor of computer science. Widely used by Amazon and others to market books, movies, and other products based on perceived customer desires, such recommendation algorithms could draw on flawed, discriminatory historical data to influence a range of decisions, such as how harsh a criminal penalty to impose or whether a female student should major in STEM. Huang's team aims to build fairness into recommendations. \"We want to make sure the algorithm will consider multiple dimensions\" of a person's identity, he says.</p><p>Amazon also could benefit from a special niche carved out by U.Va.'s new School of Data Science, argues Philip Bourne, director of the existing Institute of Data Science and the new school's interim dean. Among some 130 similar programs nationwide, \"what distinguishes us,\" he says, \"is the notion of responsible data science-data science for the public good.\" Funded by a $120 million gift from hedge-fund founder Jaffray Woodriff, a U. Va. alumnus, the school will draw heavily on partnerships with experts in behavioral sciences and the humanities in building ethical approaches to data collection and use. As Facebook and other big tech firms face a firestorm over exploiting users' data, \"it's clear companies want this,\" he says-\"any company grappling with the implications of data algorithm bias [and its] potential to backfire.\"</p><p>Such initiatives didn't sprout overnight. Three years before Amazon launched its HQ2 search, Virginia Tech began developing a vision for sustained, dramatic transformation focused on large increases in computer science and engineering enrollment and faculty along with building a new tech-focused campus for graduate education and entrepreneurship in northern Virginia. Thus, when state economic planners held what one participant called a \"very messy\" conference call with dozens of Virginia higher-education leaders to discuss how their schools might contribute to the commonwealth's-and Amazon's-tech talent pipeline, the Blacksburg landgrant institution was ready. Plans had already advanced for the Innovation Campus, a million-square-foot graduate education facility with research labs, a start-up incubator, housing, and retail. Virginia then pledged $250 million-a quarter of the funds to build it. \"This is actually well aligned with us,\" says Luke Lester, professor and chair of electrical and computer engineering at Virginia Tech. \"What Amazon did was give us the incentive to double what we're doing\" to produce more engineers.</p><p>Close behind is George Mason, the state's largest public university, where enrollment in engineering has almost doubled-to just shy of 8,000-since Ball became dean in 2012. Much of the growth has been in computer-related fields, including information and data science and cybersecurity. Besides the planned School of Computing, half of which will be funded by the state and half through fundraising, GMU will create an Institute for Digital InnovAtion (IDIA), which Crawford sees as \"an ecosystem to help young companies make it,\" combining research, graduate training, and technology transfer.</p><p>Both Virginia Tech's and George Mason's plans mesh with Virginia's vision for higher education, which calls for an increase in undergraduate enrollment statewide and a focus on preparing more residents for the tech economy. They also fit a new reality that computing is part of every engineering discipline and of other fields besides. \"It's all about convergence,\" Ball says, and preparing students for \"a digitized, data-driven economy.\" As a large, consumer-oriented IT company, Amazon also will \"have a catalytic effect\" in helping to steer the region's economy away from overly heavy dependence on the federal government, says Crawford.</p><p>Along with opportunities for \"new and innovative\" partnerships with industry, particularly the many defense contractors that cluster near the Pentagon, Virginia Tech's engineering dean Ross says the new campus's proximity to Washington's power corridors will allow academics to more easily shape the regulatory environment in which their breakthrough technologies will operate. \"It's a real opportunity for us,\" Ross says. \"There's a lot of policy that doesn't exist yet\" in fields like autonomous systems, in which Virginia Tech is actively engaged, operating a drone flight research center for the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Indeed, research and development on drones is one field where Amazon-a company built on speedy delivery-has an obvious interest, say engineering educators. No single school has a monopoly on the technology, and progress has been rapid. At around midnight on April 18, a drone carried a donor kidney 2.6 miles in 10 minutes across Baltimore to the University of Maryland Medical Center, where surgeons successfully transplanted it into a patient with renal failure. The flight relied on algorithms provided by the university's aerospace engineering department, Pines notes.</p><p>Public policy is an area where Howard University anticipates deep involvement. \"We want to play a significant role in addressing questions pertaining to how we embrace technology,\" says Moses Garuba, associate dean for academic affairs at Howard University's College of Engineering and Architecture. Howard is among the founding members, along with Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, MIT, and Stanford, of the new Public Interest Technology University Network, an initiative of the liberal-leaning New America Foundation. The school has adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Amazon and can probably afford to, given its flourishing relationship with Google. Launched in 2017 at Go ogle's Silicon Valley headquarters, Howard West is now a full academic-year program, renamed Tech Exchange, with 65 students and five faculty members from Howard and 10 other minority-serving institutions.</p><p>Like local residents who worry about Amazon's effect on housing prices and traffic, Virginia's institutions must grapple with the headaches that accompany growth. One faculty skeptic, speaking anonymously, is wary of too close an association with a corporate behemoth and wonders if faculty members will be consulted in what he says has been a top-down, consultant-driven planning process. Virginia Tech's Ross acknowledges the \"heavy lift\" to ramp up on a now accelerated timeline while still adhering to the rigorous process for approving new programs that ensures a rich educational experience for students. GMU's Ball, meanwhile, faces the quotidian challenge of finding room for his burgeoning faculty and student body. \"Physical resources are going to be strained,\" he says. \"It takes a lot of flexibility, a lot of planning, a lot of better space utilization.\"</p><p>Change will be a challenge for the whole region as Amazon settles in. But Hernandez, reflecting on his new career path as he trains to run one of proliferating local data centers, recalls his time as a roofer. \"My boss told me that I probably didn't want to do this the rest of my life, and I thought, you know what? He's right.\"</p><p>Mary Lord is deputy editor, Jennifer Pocock is associate editor, and Mark Matthews is editor of Prism.</p><p>DEAR JEFF, CAN YOU SPARE A COUPLE OF MILLION?</p><p>In Seattle, Amazon is a GENEROUS benefactor, but picky about hiring.</p><p>By Margaret Loftus</p><p>When the University of Washington's School of Computer Science and Engineering needed money to lure two rising East Coast stars in the machine-learning world, they knew just whom to contact. \"I sent Jeff an e-mail asking if Amazon could help,\" says Ed Lazowska, a computing science professor who holds the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Chair. \"Within 24 hours, we had a commitment for two $1 million Amazonendowed professorships in machine learning.\"</p><p>It didn't hurt that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had recently been on campus explaining to Lazowska and his colleagues why he considered machine learning the key to the future. The faculty coup \"transformed us into a power in machine learning,\" Lazowska says. The endowment exemplifies the strong relationship the online retail giant has with the academic community in its hometown, particularly in computer science and engineering.</p><p>As the region's leading research institution, UW has reaped the lion's share of Amazon's attention. Earlier this year, the school opened a second computer science building that includes the 240-seat Amazon Auditorium, named in recognition of a $10 million gift from the company. But the company is generous to smaller programs as well. Seattle University expects to receive a $3 million gift to support its Center for Science and Innovation, slated to open in 2021. The new center will help to increase the number of computer science and engineering students the university graduates, currently 400 per year.</p><p>\"[Amazon] still has a start-up mentality,\" says Michael Quinn, the dean of the College of Science and Engineering at Seattle University. \"They're very focused on growing fast, so that affects the way we engage with them. They're laser-focused on how we can help them.\"</p><p>Still, there's by no means a direct pipeline to Amazon from Seattle-area universities, says Gail Cornelius, who's helmed UW's College of Engineering career center since its founding in 2015. \"It's very difficult to get in,\" she says, pointing out that local grads are still up against those from elite programs around the country. For instance, Amazon has hired only 124 students fresh out of UW with bachelor's-degrees in the past five years. And out of the 1,100 engineering students that will graduate this year, Cornelius says, \"I wouldn't bank on more than 40 going to Amazon.\"</p><p>But the job market is bolstered by all manner of start-ups spawned by the presence of Amazon and Microsoft. \"Even though most of our students do not work at Microsoft and Amazon right after graduation, preparing for interviews at these two giants still prepares our students well for interviewing and securing jobs at the numerous other companies in town,\" says Melani Plett, director of engineering and computer science at Seattle Pacific University.</p><p>Amazon plays host to myriad networking events that bring together job seekers and the industry. For instance, it hosts UW computer science alumni mixers and recently helped the local chapter of AnitaB.org, which supports women in high tech, to put on Hopperx1, a two-day conference. \"Networking is a huge factor in getting tech jobs,\" says Roshanak Roshandel, chair of the computer science department at Seattle University. \"Amazon does a good job of fostering relationships and making themselves available for these kinds of events, which is critical for the tech community and culture.\"</p><p>It also fosters cross-fertilization. Some 25 Amazon employees are currently enrolled in UW's professional computer science master's program and one of the school's top robotics faculty members, Sidd Srinivasa, is on a partial leave of absence for the next few years as he runs the company's 700-person fulfillment center robotics group. \"Amazon afforded him the opportunity to see what decades of research in robotics could do in the real world in an exceptionally challenging environment-an opportunity he could never have as a 'pure' faculty member, building robots in a lab and publishing papers,\" says Lasowska.</p><p>Roshandel, too, has been working at Amazon. On sabbatical since October, she joined the Amazon Scholars program, which hires academics from around the world on a temporary basis to focus on large-scale technical challenges at the company. \"It's been an amazing opportunity from a professional development point of view,\" she says. She plans to transition back to academia this fall. \"Amazon has done a lot of good things for the community,\" Roshandel says. \"And from the point of view of a computer science professor, it has definitely enriched my students' experiences.\"</p><p>OF THIS YEAR'S 1,100 ENGINEERING GRADUATES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, \"I WOULDN'T BANK ON MORE THAN 40 GOING TO AMAZON.\"</p><p>- GAIL CORNELIUS</p><p>CAREER CENTER DIRECTOR</p><p>\"THE COMPANY IS INTERESTED INHERENTLY IN 'IS THERE A BETTER MOUSETRAP TO BUILD?'

Mockford/Getty Images The Duke of Cambridge Prince William criticised big tech for failing to deal with problems like cyberbullying and hate-speech profligating on their platforms in a speech at the BBC, the Telegraph reports[1]. The Duke heads up an anti-cyberbullying taskforce, and has dealt with companies including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, Apple, and Google, but has found their response to the problems at hand frustrating. \"The noise of shareholders, bottom lines, and profits is distracting them from the values that made them so successful in the first place,\" the Prince said. Prince William rebuked big tech firms for failing to adequately respond to problems on their platforms like cyberbullying and hate-speech, the Telegraph reports[2]. In a speech at the BBC ahead of the launch of its KOW app, designed to prevent children from sending or receiving troubling material on their devices, William accused the tech industry of failing to live up to its responsibilities. </p><p>The Prince has been leading a taskforce to combat cyberbullying, but said he has found tech companies including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Youtube, Apple and Google, unwilling to fully cooperate. \"What I found very quickly though was that the sector did not want to own this issue,\" he said. \"I heard doubts being cast about the scale of the problem. I was told that companies were already doing plenty and just needed more credit for it. I saw denials issued about the prevalence of young children on some of our most popular platforms. And crucially I heard over and over again that a collective approach - across the industry, with charity partners, ISPs, researchers, and parents - just wouldn't work,\" the Prince added. He said that he is \"worried though that our technology companies still have a great deal to learn about the responsibilities that come with their significant power,\" saying that on the issues of fake news, extremism, polarisation, hate speech, trolling, mental health, privacy, and bullying, \"our tech leaders seem to be on the back foot.\" Read more: How online hate speech moves from the fringes to the mainstream[3] He suggested that tech companies' self-image is muddying their perception of the problems at hand. \"Their self-image is so grounded in their positive power for good that they seem unable to engage in constructive discussion about the social problems they are creating,\" he said. The drive towards profit, he said, also poses a problem. \"The noise of shareholders, bottom lines, and profits is distracting them from the values that made them so successful in the first place.\" The Prince said that he, like many, had been optimistic ad the advent of social media. But he spelled out the concerns about the real-world harm these platforms have been seen to facilitate. \"We have seen that the technology that can allow you to develop an online community around a shared hobby or interest can also be used to organise violence,\" he said. \"The tools that we use to congratulate each other on milestones and successes can also be used to normalise speech that is filled with bile and hate,\" he added. He criticised big tech for being, \"resigned to a posture with governments and regulators that will be defined by conflict and discord,\" and urged them to see, \"It does not have to be this way.\" Business Insider has contacted Twitter, Snapchat, Apple, and Google for comment. Facebook declined to comment.NOW WATCH: Why autocorrect makes so many mistakes, according to the former Apple engineer who helped create it[4]See Also: One of the most popular ways of telling if

In recent months, Facebook announced that it intended to introduce end-to-end encryption across its messaging services. It's happening.\u00a0</p><p>The scale and extent of harm on Facebook apps is real and already a huge cause for concern.\u00a0Earlier this week, new NSPCC research showed that 1 in 25 children using Facebook may have been groomed on the site.\u00a0Even before end-to-end encryption is rolled out, Facebook-owned apps account for more than half of grooming offences\u00a0recorded by police\u00a0in England and Wales.\u00a0In the six-month period\u00a0October 2018\u00a0to April this year, the number of offences of sexual communication with a child\u00a0on Instagram jumped by 200 per cent\u00a0compared with the same period in\u00a0the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>In the face of the existing threat, it seems remarkable that Facebook wasn't quick off the blocks with promises of new investment and commitments on children's safety.\u202f\u202fInstead we got an announcement that they would focus on end-to-end encryption.\u00a0In cavalier fashion, Mark Zuckerberg declared that end-to-end encryption <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/30/facebook-threatening-hinder-police-increasing-encryption-warns/\">\"is\u00a0the right thing to d</url> o\", even though that meant \"an inherent trade-off because we will never find all of the potential harm we do today\".\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/30/facebook-threatening-hinder-police-increasing-encryption-warns/\">Duty of Care white paper</url></p><p>For Zuckerberg, the move to encryption \"seems right to me, as long as we take the time to build the appropriate safety systems that stop bad actors as much as we possibly can\". But, and here's the kicker, \"within the limits of an encrypted service\".\u00a0In translation, we'll look to build better tools that can detect suspicious patterns of grooming. But we won't be able to read the contents of messages, retrieve them, or provide vital evidence to police that could result in prosecutions.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tech firms, like Facebook, are asking the police to protect children with a blindfold over their eyes. So amid Big Tech's apparent indifference to children's safety, the Home Secretary's intervention this week is important.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Ministers from the UK, US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia have a clear opportunity to tell the tech firms that if they won't act to keep children safe, governments will step in and prevent such retrograde measures.\u00a0</p><p>It's fair to point out that the trade-off between privacy and safety is not new, and it is one that firms and governments around the world will increasingly need to wrestle with.\u202fAcross many aspects of our lives, end-to-end encryption will be a force for good. It will increasingly be a part of keeping us and our data safe, from banking and bill payment through to healthcare services.\u00a0And there is an understandable public appetite, following the succession of scandals about how our data is harvested and used, for products that offer greater privacy when we share information about ourselves online.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>But the online risks to children are\u00a0too\u00a0considerable to ignore. We cannot continue to allow tech firms to treat children's safety as a second order issue.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>So\u00a0what needs to happen?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Firstly, the UK Government has shown real global leadership in its mission to make Britain the safest place in the world to be online.\u00a0However, the tech firms'\u00a0plans to end-to-end encrypt children's accounts are simply irreconcilable with the principle of a legal duty of care, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/30/facebook-threatening-hinder-police-increasing-encryption-warns/\">as this paper has campaigned for</url>, and we need the Government to state that clearly.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/30/facebook-threatening-hinder-police-increasing-encryption-warns/\">Duty of Care campaign | Read more</url></p><p>Later this year, the Home Office will publish an interim Code of Practice setting out\u00a0clear expectations about how companies must protect children from the risks of sexual abuse and exploitation.\u00a0This Code should make clear that platforms should not encrypt children's messages unless and until there\u00a0are adequate safety protections in place.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And the\u00a0new Prime Minister and his cabinet\u00a0should make clear that a duty of care regulator is on the way, with a commitment to introducing an Online Harms Bill\u00a0early\u00a0next year.\u00a0</p><p>If platforms continue to proceed with plans for end-to-end encryption, despite the clear risks to children,\u00a0then\u00a0there is a growing case for law enforcement to be given proportionate powers to investigate increasingly complex online abuse.\u202f\u00a0If this means through \"back door\"\u00a0access to prise open the lid of otherwise encrypted communications, we should have that debate.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Across the world, countries are beginning to take action to tackle online harms, and to make tech firms take steps to protect children that they've previously resisted.\u00a0It's increasingly likely\u00a0that both the United States and\u00a0European Union may revisit the existing legislation which has allowed social media companies to act as intermediaries, avoiding liability for the risks that stem from their sites.\u00a0</p><p>The UK has a huge opportunity to lead by example on the world stage: to set the rules for the digital age,\u00a0not simply accept them.\u00a0</p><p>                       Andy Burrows is head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-54910575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPG-W6V1-JCJY-G4VS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><timeReceived>7:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

16:11:03</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> May 29 -- Privacy activist Max Schrems called on the European authorities to push the Irish regulator to speed up its handling of cases he has brought against Facebook on the second anniversary of the introduction of rules designed to help protect the data of consumers.\u00a0Schrems, long a thorn in the side of Facebook, bemoaned the lack of progress since the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regime across Europe in 2018.\u00a0\"After two years, we feel that the time has come to shine light on the shortcomings of the GDPR's current enforcement in Ireland and bring the debate into the public,\" the letter, published on Monday, says.\u00a0The procedure adopted by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) was \"highly inefficient and partly Kafkaesque.\"\u00a0The letter's recipients are the national data protection authorities, the European Commission, the EU Parliament and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).\u00a0The GDPR overhauled data protection laws in the European Union that predated the rise of the internet and, most importantly, gave regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues for companies that break the rules.\u00a0Schrems, who previously won a landmark European ruling on data transfer in 2015, said he would seek a judicial review of the DPC's actions at the Irish High Court as soon as coronavirus-related restrictions are lifted.\u00a0Ireland's DPC, asked for comment on the letter, said it had currently 23 \"big tech\" inquiries open and last Friday announced significant developments in a number of these inquiries, including three that were initiated after complaints received from Max Schrems's non-profit organisation noyb.\u00a0\"One of these complaint-based inquiries, which focuses on Facebook Ireland's obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing, has now moved to the decision-making phase,\" the DPC said.\u00a0Schrems filed complaints against Google, Facebook and its affiliates Instagram and WhatsApp immediately after GDPR came into effect in May 2018, arguing that their approach violated the rights of users to choose themselves whether to allow companies to use their data.\u00a0The Irish Data Protection Commission is the lead regulator in the Facebook cases as the firm has its European headquarters in Dublin.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>The case against Google was dealt with in France, where the regulator CNIL imposed a 50 million euro fine for breaching the EU privacy rules in January last year.\u00a0<br/>Schrems said the Irish watchdog had requested to keep documents confidential and to not even share them with other national counterparts.\u00a0<br/>\"We request the European Commission to act and issue infringement procedures against any member state with legislation that prevents the effective application of the GDPR, with overly complicated and long procedures, or without any effective remedy against delayed procedures,\" the letter says.\u00a0<br/>Facebook declined comment on the DPC process.\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) at a Wednesday hearing on the topic. \"No one in an elected position made a decision on this. These 18 states [using this technology] -- that's more than half the population of the country. That is scary. It was just eight years ago the IRS targeted people for their political beliefs. It doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, this should concern us all.\"</p><p>While some representatives focused more on government use of facial recognition tech -- like police use --  others drilled down on private use and what they called \"surveillance capitalism.\"</p><p>When progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked, \"Do you think it's fair to say Americans are being spied on and surveilled on a massive scale without their consent or knowledge?\" the witnesses replied yes.</p><p>Clare Garvie, senior associate at Georgetown University's Center on Privacy &amp; Technology said there is a distinction between how Facebook uses facial recognition tech versus how Amazon uses the tech.</p><p>According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Amazon aggressively markets its facial recognition software, Rekognition, to law enforcement agencies in Orlando, Florida and Washington County, Oregon. Emails obtained by the ACLU show law enforcement agencies in Arizona and California are also interested in using the tech.</p><p>In addition to the intrusion of privacy, the witnesses' primary concern is facial recognition tech misidentifying American citizens. As witness Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithm Justice League, pointed out, a black man sued Apple in April for misidentifying him as a thief.</p><p>This is because facial recognition tech still hasn't matured, she said, and the data used by the facial recognition algorithms is imperfect and incomplete, resulting in racial biases.</p><p>For many facial recognition algorithms, she said, white men are used as the template, which means the error rate for identifying people of color is very high. For black women, the error rate is 37.4 percent.</p><p>\"When we're hearing from communities, it's with a great deal of anxiety about facial recognition,\" she said. \"It's been done without community input, without clear roles, and without the right standards to protect the First Amendment and other core values. We should study the harms before we roll something out.\"</p><p>Law enforcement agencies may be the biggest offenders when misidentifying suspects or criminals. The criminal justice system's data is notoriously faulty and racially biased, and advocates like the ACLU have condemned other types of algorithms using criminal justice data.</p><p>Even if Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and others continue to perfect their software, they're still going to produce bad results if the data is bad.</p><p>\"We must caution against anyone who says these algorithms are getting better and therefore the results are getting better,\" Garvie said. \"It doesn't matter how good an algorithm gets, if law enforcement agencies put unreliable or wrong data in, we will get wrong results out. These algorithms are not magic.\"</p><p>The Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (PAI) -- whose members include Amazon, Facebook and Google -- released a report in April condemning use of algorithmic tools in the criminal justice system, but Amazon and IBM continue to market their software to local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI.</p><p>A few of the witness took a more nuanced position on a facial recognition moratorium.</p><p>The University of the District of Columbia's Professor of Law Andrew Ferguson said facial surveillance should be banned, but there should be regulation for different uses of the tech.</p><p>\"My opinion is if we're not going to regulate, we should push the pause button on this tech because it's dangerous,\" he said.</p><p>Cedric Alexander, former president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, thinks law enforcement agencies could use facial recognition tech responsibly, but right now too may agencies are rushing to use the tech without stopping to consider safeguards or potential abuses.</p><p>\"What I'm more concerned about is the failed use and misuse of the tech, and how we differentiate when it's being used correctly and when it's not,\" he said. \"The police end up being the end user of this technology. If I'm not properly trained or supervised, there's no transparency about how and when this tech is being utilized, then I, the police department, ends up being the bad guy. And that's one thing the police don't need in this environment when we're trying to build relationships between police and community. I need to make sure there's ethics, morals, standards, good practices we know and feel good about.\"</p><p>Representatives from both parties called for bipartisan legislation on the issue. Garvie said much of the work on facial recognition tech relies at least in part on federal grant money, so Congress could influence how companies use and market the tech.</p><p>\"By and large there are no rules around this,\" she said.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Burdening our communities with the need to discern how complex terms of service and algorithms could harm us will only serve to reinforce discriminatory corporate practices.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, raised how the monitoring capabilities of homes assistants such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Home are \u201cdesigned to spy on families and children\u201d and advocated \u201c21stcentury legislation.\u201d</p><p>Caitriona Fitzgerald, policy director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, also highlighted how corporations are able to disregard existing regulations as they are aware that the FTC lacks rulemaking authority and that it often fails to enforce rules.</p><p>When presented with the proposals by Adweek, Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman Sen.

I welcome a conversation about what reforms are needed to protect Americans from anti-competitive conduct and abuses of their privacy.\u201d</p><p>Sen. Warner earlier spoke with Adweek about his concerns on mass data collection\u00a0and the subsequent impact on citizens\u2019 privacy and has been a leading voice on Capitol Hill over the failure of large corporations to address data protection with the urgency it warrants.</p><p>Also discussing the terms with Adweek, Shane Green, CEO of advocacy group Digi.Me, said such lobbying of government sources is welcome to offset the \u201cweak privacy principles\u201d that pro-industry groups urge politicians to adopt.</p><p>\u201cI am quite concerned that those kinds of industry groups are trying to co-opt privacy regulations in a way that both weakens the laws and reinforces the market dominance of the incumbents by requiring burdensome measures,\u201d said Green.</p><p>He went on to add, \u201cThis framework also addresses one of my biggest concerns, which is algorithmic governance.

In this article, we identify five of the biggest trends in privacy and data security, including the mammoth European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) taking effect, the hurried passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the rapidly escalating political scrutiny emanating from revelations surrounding the 2016 election and social media accountability, and the new challenges raised by high-profile data breaches and emerging technology.1. Omnibus privacy legislation becomes 'a thing' Far-reaching and industry-spanning privacy legislation finally matured in 2018. It is now a thing. After years of ramp-up and speculation as to its immediate impact, the GDPR finally became effective on May 25, 2018. Thus far, enforcement actions utilizing the GDPR's severe civil penalty provisions\u2014which include up to \u20ac20 million or 4 percent of a business's global annual turnover\u2014have been limited to data security incidents, including a \u20ac400,000 fine to a Portuguese hospital for granting broader-than-needed access to patient profiles and a \u20ac20,000 fine to a hacked German chat platform that failed to pseudonymize and encrypt sensitive information. European data protection authorities have signaled that enforcement actions for violations of the GDPR's non-breach-related provisions will ramp up shortly. </p><p>Whether an American Big Tech firm will be hit with the massive, front-page penalty that many have prognosticated since May 25 remains to be seen. Also in May, Californians for Consumer Privacy (CCP), a relatively little-known consumer privacy rights group, submitted enough signatures to qualify the 'California Consumer Personal Information Disclosure and Sale Initiative' for the November 2018 ballot in California. In a last-ditch effort to force the initiative into legislative control\u2014and thus subjecting the law to a much easier threshold for later amendment\u2014the California legislature hurriedly drafted a bill that convinced the CCP to agree to drop the ballot measure. The result was the CCPA, passed on June 28, 2018. As many stakeholders in companies with consumers or employees in California are undoubtedly now aware, the CCPA adopts several GDPR concepts for the protection of data subjects, including the rights to ask a company what personal information it possesses on the consumer, to delete certain personal information and to opt out of any sales of personal information to third parties. The CCPA also implements a first-of-its-kind private right of action for data breaches that attaches civil penalties between $100 and $750 per consumer, per incident. Already the subject of an amendment, the law is expected to undergo additional amendments in the coming legislative sessions in Sacramento. It is currently set to go into effect between January 1 and July 1, 2020, varying by the provision and the date that the California Attorney General introduces implementing regulations. Other jurisdictions will continue the march toward comprehensive privacy protections. In August, for instance, Brazil passed its General Data Privacy Law, which reflects many GDPR concepts and is set to become effective in 2020. That same month, Indian legislators unveiled the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, which attempts to combine elements of European, American and Chinese data protection regimes. 2. Privacy and security take their turn in the political spotlight The ongoing scrutiny of the role of social media in the 2016 presidential election promises to continue into 2019. These issues bring enough gravity that it is reasonable to conclude that privacy issues will never again be able to hide from the national spotlight. Scrutiny of Big Tech continued throughout 2018, with a number of major data breaches making headlines. In addition, the U.S. Congress convened several high-profile hearings in April and September in which Big Tech executives were grilled about privacy- and security-related issues. Several big data breaches also became front-page news. In April, the Federal Trade Commission revealed that a 2016 breach of Uber resulted in the exposure of personal information of more than 20 million people. The company agreed to a $148 million settlement with the attorneys general of all 50 states and the District of Columbia in September. In December, hotel chain Marriott disclosed a data breach exposing the information of up to 500 million people. The incident is notable not only for its size, but because it apparently emanated from Marriott's acquisition of the Starwood brand and its separate guest reservation system and, according to recent reports, investigators believe the incident is traceable to hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government. If there is anyone who doubts the sobering implications of the CCPA's new statutory penalties for data breaches, simply multiply the minimum penalty of $100 (or if you really want to scare yourself, the maximum of $750) by any of the above numbers and compare the resulting amount to the going rate for civil and regulatory settlements of alleged data breaches. The stakes for data breaches are about to be raised even higher. 3. States continue to expand existing protections Other states expanded the reach of their privacy and security protections as well, even if they have thus far declined to follow California's example of omnibus legislation. On September 4, 2018, the latest phase of the New York Department of Financial Services' (DFS) Cybersecurity Requirements took effect following the regulation's initial March 2017 implementation. The regulation represents perhaps the most sweeping cybersecurity regime in the nation, requiring covered entities to assess their specific risk profile and design programs ensuring information security, establish written cybersecurity policies, adopt encryption and monitoring mechanisms, and design audit trails allowing operational continuity in the event of a breach. By March 2019, these entities will also be expected to evaluate the risks presented by third-party data service providers. Cybersecurity legislation was passed also in Colorado and Ohio in 2018, with the latter jurisdiction providing a notable affirmative defense to breach allegations for companies that implement a recognized cybersecurity framework. State data breach laws also undertook a steady expansion of coverage last year. On June 1, 2018, Alabama\u2014the last state lacking such a law\u2014implemented its notice statute, which notably defines covered PII to include data types on the outer reaches of most notice statutes, such as information relating to medical history and health insurance. Meanwhile, Colorado joined Florida in adopting the most stringent notification deadline, requiring notification no later than 30 days after determining that a security breach has occurred. 4. Emerging tech scrambles pre-existing notions of privacy protection Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning. The Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain. If these concepts were not already in the popular lexicon, they are now. Together, these and other emerging technologies have already reshaped the debate over how best to secure personal information before the prior debate was anywhere near its conclusion. Real-world applications such as digital assistants, self-driving cars, cryptocurrency, facial recognition and data science have already demonstrated the bare minimum of what these technologies are capable of\u2014as well as the many challenging privacy implications presented. Understandably, lawmakers are well behind on legislating for such rapid innovation, but there was some progress in 2018. In May, Vermont passed a first-in-the-nation law to regulate data brokers, or businesses that knowingly sell or license the personal information of consumers with whom that business does not have a direct relationship. As of January 1, 2019, data brokers are required to register annually with the Vermont Secretary of State, disclose details regarding their identity and practices, and provide minimum information security requirements. In September, California passed the first state legislation addressing the security of IoT devices. Effective on January 1, 2020, the law mandates that manufacturers of connected devices follow reasonable security standards and require authentic access codes. It is enforceable by the California Attorney General. 5. A more regulated future awaits The conventional wisdom is that the developments described above may soon converge into a federal privacy law with pre-emptive power over the CCPA and similar state laws. In August, it was reported that several Silicon Valley companies were lobbying the Trump administration to begin outlining a federal privacy law that would pre-empt the CCPA. And there appears to be bipartisan agreement on the now-divided Capitol Hill that privacy legislation is necessary. The remaining question is: What will a successful bill look like? In little more than a month's time, we have already seen three examples of where we may be headed. On November 1, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Consumer Data Protection Act, which resembles the GDPR and turned heads by proposing up to 20 years in prison for executives responsible for misrepresentations in annual reports to the FTC. On November 6, Intel released a 6,000-word draft bill and online portal for further discussion that differs from the Wyden bill by protecting companies from civil actions and moving away from data minimization, among other things. Finally, on December 12, a group of 15 senators led by Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) introduced the Data Care Act, which is notable for, among other things, introducing a fiduciary duty for online service providers and allowing both the FTC and states to enforce privacy violations. What does it mean for financial services companies? Financial services companies are already more familiar with privacy and data security laws than the average American business due to the sectoral focus of American privacy regulation, which has seen legislative schemes such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the New York Department of Financial Services' Cybersecurity Regulation. However, these existing regimes may be quickly eclipsed by the trend toward omnibus privacy laws and stricter oversight. For now, the CCPA's exemption for GLBA-regulated PII somewhat eases the pain of implementation, but it remains to be seen whether new potential laws at the federal and state levels will afford similar leniency. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111548101762202251761700055</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7W-VX51-F03R-N1T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1775\"/><timeReceived>8:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

In August 2018, Martin Schneider (not his real name) requested all of his personal data from Amazon - one of his rights under a new slate of privacy rules that went into effect last year in the European Union.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A few months later, the German citizen received a package of files, including about 1,700 voice memos from an Amazon Alexa compatible device.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just one problem: Mr. Schneider didn't own a voice assistant and didn't recognize any of the voices in the files.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This story, as relayed by Heise, a German technology magazine, points to how imperfect companies' data handling practices can be.</p><p>That's even in light of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, a set of data privacy rules aimed at making it easier for consumers to request their data from firms and to understand how it's being used.</p><p>So one year after the regulation went into effect on May 25, 2018, what exactly has changed for consumers?</p><p>\"One year on, GDPR is not hype,\" said Odia Kagan, a partner and chair of GDPR compliance and international privacy at Fox Rothschild LLP in Philadelphia.</p><p>\"The enforcement is coming and the changes are being taken seriously. The fact that it looks like nothing has happened is not really true. Things are bubbling under the surface.\" Shifting company philosophy</p><p>When Ms. Kagan asked her law students what \"privacy\" meant, she was blasted with typical answers that you'd see in a legal studies textbook.</p><p>\"Everybody was like, search and seizure, Fourth Amendment, the government,\" she said. \"I'm like, what about social media? The concern is now there.\"</p><p>Privacy, today, is all about companies learning to protect consumers' personal data, Ms. Kagan said.</p><p>And GDPR has forced those firms to think more actively about how they get consent from customers, she said. That means changing those check-the-box exercises - meant to ensure users understand and agree to privacy policies - to something more substantive and active.</p><p>\"We'll have to see whether or not this changes the philosophy of companies and how they operate,\" Ms. Kagan added.</p><p>And due to globalization, GDPR rules extend to companies in the U.S. like Facebook and Google since their customers are from all around the world.</p><p>To make necessary changes to comply, companies must fundamentally rethink the design of their websites or apps to make privacy policies as intuitive as possible for the public.</p><p>That's not always a breeze, considering user experience designers are still adapting to the new rules, according to Bart Willemsen, a senior director analyst for Gartner, a research and advisory firm based in Stamford, Conn.</p><p>\"GDPR has brought a trigger for numerous innovations, and we must bear in mind the markets enabling compliance are only emerging, and developing in high speed,\" said Mr. Willemsen, who is based in the Netherlands.</p><p>He expects to see user experience designers focused on privacy shifting more focus toward GDPR compliance within the next five years - creating sites with transparency, notice, consent and preference management all in once place. Big tech accountability</p><p>In the first nine months after the new rules went into effect, 206,326 GDPR breaches were reported, according to a February paper from the European Data Protection Board, an independent group created by GDPR that oversees the equal application of data and privacy rules in the European Economic Area.</p><p>Total fines in that period reached 55.96 million Euros (about $63 million).</p><p>The majority of that sum was levied against Google in January after a French watchdog group said the Mountain View, Calif.-based tech company offered inadequate information about privacy to users by spreading it across multiple pages. The company also failed to receive adequate consent from users when personalizing ads to them, the group said.</p><p>Still, that's chump change to Google's parent company, Alphabet, which reported fourth-quarter revenue of over $39 billion in February.</p><p>For her part, Ms. Kagan is not surprised that massive fines haven't surfaced yet.</p><p>\"The regulators are saying that the big ticket judgments are more complicated. You need time to get this organized,\" she said, noting that it's still only been about one year.</p><p>\"It's a 'stay tuned' on what happens to big tech,\" Ms. Kagan continued.</p><p>For mid-to-small-size enterprises, regulators are more understanding if those firms are not yet compliant, as long as they're making strides.</p><p>\"They like to see that you made the effort ... and you're on your way to compliance,\" Ms. Kagan said. \"Regulators will take that into consideration, if you have a plan and you're caught as noncompliant.\"</p><p>Regardless of the size of the business, GDPR regulators have more tools in their toolbox than mere fines.</p><p>Regulators can give noncompliant companies up to 90 days to fix their privacy related flaws, Ms. Kagan said. And if the companies don't? They'll lose that data central to their business models.</p><p>\"They've said to companies: 'look, you have 90 days, fix it. Or you're going to lose the information.' That's obviously much harder to deal with than the fine.\"</p><p>That's pivotal, considering many firms are not yet compliant after the first year of GDPR.</p><p>Mr. Willemsen of Gartner predicted in 2016 that \"by the time 2019 would knock on the door,\" less than 50% of companies affected would be in full compliance.</p><p>\"The way to think about GDPR compliance is that it's not something that happens at one point in time,\" Ms. Kagan said.</p><p>\"It's not like, I've got my driver's license and now I'm good. It's like an annual physical, you have to maintain it. It's a process.\" California a trendsetter</p><p>As a result of the European regulation, the U.S. - which has virtually no universal privacy laws outside of the health and banking industries - has started considering similar legislation.</p><p>In January, the U.S. Government Accountability Office put out a report calling for the U.S. to adopt GDPR-like privacy rules.</p><p>\"Comprehensive internet privacy legislation ... could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy,\" the authors of the report note.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission, which currently oversees internet privacy, has filed only 101 enforcement actions against companies violating consumer internet privacy rights. Nearly every case was settled out in court and required some action from the violators, though they could not be fined as the FTC lacks such power.</p><p>Most significantly, the new California Consumer Privacy Act - effective in January 2020 - is a comprehensive law addressing the processing of personal information, giving consumers rights to control their information.</p><p>\"That is pushing toward privacy regulation in the U.S. that we haven't' seen before,\" Ms. Kagan said. \"California is a trendsetter.\"</p><p>Until - and if - other states pass similar legislation, regulators mustn't forget the human side.</p><p>\"The only reason we see so much follow-through on GDPR ... is because people simply want - need - to be protected in what is a fundamental human right,\" Mr. Willemsen said.</p><p>\"Without a regulation like the GDPR, [consumers] would still want it,\" he said. \"Once we accept that, and the fact that our most valuable asset often is not our data, but our customer, [we will earn] their trust.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING: Daniel Marsula/Post-Gazette: No Caption\\</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-19052625100401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6C-FVV1-DYRS-T367-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 P.G.

LESSONS Learned 38 VI. CONCLUSION 41</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. INTRODUCTION</p><p>Over a decade ago, legal scholars and advocates started a discussion on the intersection of privacy and competition law and policy. This discussion arose from the merger of Google and DoubleClick, and the possibility that the privacy practices of the merged entity could be cognizable under the antitrust merger review at the FTC. Advocates such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) (1) and FTC Commissioner Pamela Harbour (2) argued that privacy as such was a relevant aspect of competition falling within the scope of merger review. The FTC majority at the time, however, thought otherwise, and approved the merger after finding that advertising competitors would have access to the data they needed to compete. (3)</p><p>At the time, privacy scholar Peter Swire offered the now-standard explanation of how competition law could accommodate privacy concerns. Without taking a position on the merits of the Google-DoubleClick merger, he argued that: \"[P]rivacy harms can lead to a reduction in the quality of a good or service, which is a standard category of harm that results from market power. Where these sorts of harms exist, it is a normal part of antitrust analysis to assess such harms and seek to minimize them.\" (4)</p><p>What is the realistic potential for merger reviews to address privacy concerns, especially among digital platforms where privacy concerns are most pronounced? In order to answer this question, this Article focuses on how merger reviews under current competition law treat privacy as a dimension of competition. (5) After making some general remarks on the topic, this Article illustrates how merger reviews can assess privacy through an examination of two recent merger reviews involving digital platforms: the European Commission's decisions in their reviews of the Facebook/WhatsApp merger (6) and the Microsoft/Linkedln merger. (7)</p><p>This Article avoids embracing the neo-Brandeisian antitrust reform perspective, which has given a huge impetus to the growing discussion of privacy and antitrust. The neo-Brandeisian movement urges antitrust enforcers to look beyond the consumer welfare standard that has guided antitrust law and policy for several generations. (8) According to this perspective, if antitrust should consider issues such as wage inequality, political corruption, and the power of companies to influence elections, then surely the protection of privacy in the age of big data is also within scope. (9)</p><p>The problem, however, is that this broader neo-Brandeisian perspective requires reform of antitrust law. In particular, it would need adjustment of merger review standards, which would be a long and uncertain process. Legislative reforms to improve privacy might ultimately be needed. After all, the conclusion of this Article is that it might be wiser to look elsewhere than current merger reviews if we want to address the privacy concerns that are a focus of such widespread public concern. But before going that route, it might be helpful to see how far we can get without a legislative adjustment to antitrust law.</p><p>Instead, this Article adopts the traditional antitrust perspective that merger reviews can examine privacy as an element of competition and take steps to preserve this privacy competition by blocking or conditioning proposed transactions that substantially lessen this form of competition. It also seeks to assess, however, the realistic prospects for making progress on privacy in this way.</p><p>The implications of this assessment should not give us cause for optimism. Any exercise of antitrust merger review mechanisms to address privacy concerns necessarily confronts a range of legal, factual, and practical considerations that collectively amount to large and potentially insurmountable obstacles. These include the inability to apply or extend privacy law directly, the unresolved conceptual knots in clarifying the notion of privacy competition, the empirical difficulties in determining the existence and extent of privacy competition, and the requirement to show that any post-merger failure to satisfy privacy preferences results from a substantial lessening of competition, rather than from independent business judgements or the proper operation of competitive forces. (10) Finally, merger reviews face a fundamental legal limitation in the form of an inability to introduce new competition into the marketplace. (11) This makes it highly unlikely, though not impossible, for merger reviews to increase privacy protections beyond what would already be provided for in the marketplace.</p><p>The topic of antitrust and privacy is broad, and this Article deals only with a fraction of the possible overlap--the role of privacy competition in merger reviews. Another area of overlap concerns whether data sets themselves are such crucial competitive assets that antitrust authorities should block or condition mergers that create very large concentrations of data, or take other steps to limit anticompetitive unilateral conduct based on monopoly control of data. (12) In principle, antitrust action to reduce the size or exclusive access to data sets to preserve competition could limit privacy risks. It is important to be aware, however, that competition remedies to data control issues do not necessarily work in favor of privacy protection. Some merger conditions or other measures to remedy dominant positions in the control of competitively essential data, such as mandated data sharing, might create additional privacy risks, for example, by requiring the transfer of information a customer shared with one company to a company with less privacy protective data practices. (13)</p><p>A further intensively discussed overlap is whether antitrust action against abuse by dominant companies can impose data protection requirements--such as additional consent requirements--that are effectively more stringent than the data protection rules that have to be followed by non-dominant companies. (14) This might not improve matters for all companies, but like merger conditions that effectively imposed net neutrality obligations on merging communications companies, they remedy special problems created by mergers or strong market positions. (15)</p><p>An assessment of these other areas might yield other ways in which antitrust enforcers could improve privacy protection. But they are outside the scope of this Article and hopefully will be dealt with in future work.</p><p>It is certainly legitimate for antitrust authorities to take privacy into account in merger reviews in certain circumstances. It is not bad policy to do this, but such efforts are not likely to improve privacy very much. If we want more privacy than current law requires, and more than companies would normally provide on their own, we will need to establish it through other resources available to competition law or directly through new national privacy legislation.</p><p>In Section II, this Article makes general remarks about the relationship of traditional merger review and privacy. In Sections III and IV, this Article discusses the European Commission's review of the Facebook/WhatsApp merger and the Microsoft/Linkedln merger to reveal how they treated privacy as an element of competition. Section V reviews some lessons learned from these cases, and Section VI concludes that merger reviews should not be relied upon as a significant legal mechanism securing the maintenance of privacy protections. The results of this Article strongly suggest that it would be better to turn to other aspects of antitrust law or to privacy law itself to vindicate privacy rights.</p><p>II. GENERAL REMARKS</p><p>A. Traditional Antitrust Merger Review Preserves, But Does Not Enhance, Competition.</p><p>Merger reviews under traditional antitrust principles seek to block the loss of competition. Section 7 of the Clayton Act bars any acquisition with an effect that \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\" (16) The \"unifying theme\" of the Justice Department's 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines is that \"mergers should not be permitted to create, enhance, or entrench market power or to facilitate its exercise.\" (17)</p><p>European competition law is similar. Under the European Council's Merger Regulation:</p><p>[A] concentration which would not significantly impede effective competition . . . shall be declared compatible with the common market . . . [and] ... a concentration which would significantly impede effective competition, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position, shall be declared incompatible with the common market. (18)</p><p>Thus, the touchstone of antitrust merger review is the preservation, not the enhancement of existing competition. Reviewing agencies do not have the capacity to block a transaction on the grounds that it does not introduce new competition that was not previously there. (iy) A merger review is forward-looking only to the extent that is does not want to allow the competitive future to be worse than the past.</p><p>This is in contrast to the standard of review that applies to mergers under the jurisdiction of some sector-specific regulatory agencies. For instance, the FCC reviews mergers when they involve the assignment and transfer of control of certain spectrum licenses and approves them only when it determines that they serve the \"public interest, convenience and necessity.\" (20) The FCC can and does apply traditional analysis relating to the loss of competition in its merger reviews, but it also must make a broader public interest determination. In particular, the FCC considers \"whether a transaction will enhance, rather than merely preserve, existing competition, and often takes a more expansive view of potential and future competition in analyzing that issue.\" (21)</p><p>As a result of this fundamental difference, the best that might be expected from traditional antitrust merger reviews is that they will block or condition mergers that would substantially weaken the privacy competition that existed in the market prior to the merger. It is hard to see how a traditional antitrust merger review could condition a merger so as to require companies to provide customers with improved privacy protections that they previously did not enjoy.</p><p>Despite this obstacle, it is possible to imagine circumstances in which a merger condition imposed purely to remedy a competition problem could have the effect of improving privacy protection. For instance, as described in the German antitrust case against Facebook, the social media company requires its users to accept tracking on third-party websites as a condition of using its service. (22) An antitrust authority could, of course, simply block the merger as anticompetitive, and this would leave privacy protections exactly the way they were before the proposed merger. But it could also seek to offset that anticompetitive effect by prohibiting the merged entity from combining third-party tracking data with data from activity on the social media site or requiring it to get separate consent to do so. That is, it could try to require the social media company to be more protective of its existing users' privacy as a condition of approving the merger. This would have the effect of improving privacy protection for its existing users, as well as protecting competitors in the advertising market. (23)</p><p>This example suggests that it is possible for traditional antitrust authorities to seek in the context of a merger review to improve the state of privacy protection beyond what is already being provided in the market. This possibility seems to arise where the antitrust authority could establish that a merger would lessen competition due to a combination of data that foreclosed competition. With the growth of data as a competitive asset in today's digital economy, this might not be rare. Still, the antitrust authority would need to explain why prohibiting the combination of data wouldn't be sufficient to resolve the issue, rather than improving privacy protections for existing users. This might be an uphill climb both legally and factually. My sense is that while an activist antitrust authority might try to improve privacy protections in this way, it would be unlikely to succeed.</p><p>B. Advancing Privacy Protections is Not a Legitimate Objective of Traditional Antitrust Merger Reviews</p><p>As discussed further in this section, traditional antitrust merger review has no authority to consider extraneous factors, such as privacy, independently of the transaction's effect on competition. (24) Not only is it unlikely to advance privacy values beyond what would occur in the marketplace, it may not independently consider such matters at all.</p><p>This contrasts with transaction reviews conducted by some specialized agencies. When the FCC reviews mergers, it is required to take into account values other than competition including ensuring a \"diversity of sources of information\" and \"whether the transaction will affect the quality of communications services or will result in the provision of new or additional services to consumers.\" (25)</p><p>In its Google/DoubleClick decision, the FTC articulated this notion that merger reviews can aim only at preserving competition, not preserving or enhancing other values:</p><p>The Commission has been asked before to intervene in transactions for reasons unrelated to antitrust concerns, such as concerns about environmental quality or impact on employees. Although such issues may present important policy questions for the Nation, the sole purpose of federal antitrust review of mergers and acquisitions is to identify and remedy transactions that harm competition. (26)</p><p>This view has the backing of Supreme Court precedent. In United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, the Court ruled that the effect upon competition is the sole criterion to determine whether a merger violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act. (27) The fact that the merger would increase employment in a particular city was deemed irrelevant. (28)</p><p>European competition law enforcers take the same general view. For instance, the European Commission adopted it in its review of the Facebook/WhatsApp merger:</p><p>Any privacy-related concerns flowing from the increased concentration of data within the control of Facebook as a result of the Transaction do not fall within the scope of the EU competition law rules but within the scope of the EU data protection rules. (29)</p><p>The European Court of Justice upheld this view of the relationship between competition law and data protection law: \"[S]ince ... any possible issues relating to the sensitivity of personal data are not, as such, a matter for competition law, they may be resolved on the basis of the relevant provisions governing data protection.\" (30) This is the antitrust consensus even today. Antitrust scholar Carl Shapiro recently said: \"Antitrust is not designed or equipped to deal with many of the major social and political problems associated with the tech titans, including threats to consumer privacy and data security, or the spread of hateful speech and fake news.\" (31)</p><p>Moreover, the recent Common Understanding among the G7 competition authorities also repeats the point that: \"[Governments should avoid using competition law enforcement to address non-competition objectives...,\" (32)</p><p>Of course, an agency review that blocks a merger on the grounds that it would substantially lessen competition in the advertising market might also preserve data practices that people value as privacy protective. In a similar way, conditions on a merger designed to preserve competitive conditions in the advertising market after the merger might also preserve valued data practices, as in the social media example sketched above. Antitrust practitioners likely would not look askance upon merger controls that accidentally preserved privacy in this way.</p><p>On the other hand, these possibilities should not give much comfort to the proponents of using merger reviews to protect privacy, since it would be only a coincidence that merger controls aiming to preserve competition also improve privacy. Privacy advocates would want more from privacy-aware merger reviews than this sort of accidental privacy protection.</p><p>C. Relationship of Privacy Law to Merger Review</p><p>This general point that merger reviews are focused on preserving competition, not enhancing or maintaining privacy, has several implications that are worth emphasizing. One is that merger control reviews do not apply or enforce existing privacy law. A second is that data collection practices of the merging companies must be viewed as satisfying current legal requirements. Third, any merger requirements for data practices that exceed current legal privacy requirements must be justified as necessary to sustain competition. They cannot be based solely on the idea that they constitute better privacy protection.</p><p>Traditional antitrust merger reviews apply the standards of competition law, not the requirements of privacy or data protection law. (33) In the cases we consider below the European Commission reviewed potential mergers between companies that, prior to the merger, were in full compliance with European data protection law. There was no question of using merger review as a way to bring non-compliant companies into compliance with data protection law.</p><p>Both the US and Europe have extensive legal structures aimed at promoting privacy. In its complaint to the FTC in connection with the Google/DoubleClick merger, EPIC properly noted that: \"The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right in the United States.\" (34) Privacy is also regulated by specialized agencies, the FTC, and a variety of state laws, including the recently passed California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. (35) In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), adopted in 2018, provides a comprehensive framework to vindicate what European law regards as the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. (36)</p><p>But in assessing mergers through the lens of privacy, compliance with privacy law is not at issue. The question before the reviewing agency is not whether companies comply with privacy law. The question is whether the merger substantially lessens competition, and in doing so whether it harms consumers, including whether the loss of competition deprives them of privacy choices they previously had and valued. (37)</p><p>This is not to say that competition law in general in Europe is powerless to apply data protection law. The European Commission's practice of avoiding data protection enforcement in merger reviews is in sharp contrast to the approach taken by Germany's Federal Cartel Office (FCO) in its action against Facebook. In that case, the FCO claimed authority to act as an enforcer of the European GDPR. (38) It determined that Facebook needed consent from its users to combine third-party data with its data from user interactions on Facebook's own service. (39) Because of its dominance in social media, the take-it-or-leave it form of choice it provided did not amount to genuine consent. And it imposed a data protection remedy in the form of a separate consent requirement. (40)</p><p>But this was a case of abuse of dominance, not a merger review, and it was brought under German law, not European competition law. It is not clear that the same legal opportunity arises for merger reviews in light of Asnef-Equifax, a decision by the European Union Court of Justice, which held that: \"[I]ssues relating to the sensitivity of personal data are not, as such, a matter for competition law.\" (41) As a result, at this point merger reviews are not an occasion for enforcement of privacy laws in Europe.</p><p>This means that the data practices assessed in the context of a merger review are all legal practices. These practices might involve greater or lesser collection and use of data, and a corresponding increase or decrease in product or service personalization. But they are all within the parameters allowed by existing privacy and data protection law. In so far as merger reviews under competition law are concerned, no data practice that is legal under data protection law has a preferred status.</p><p>Merger reviews can take privacy into account, but not directly, by ascertaining whether the rivalry among companies in the markets affected by a proposed transaction takes place significantly along the dimension of these differing but legal data practices. And if a merger review finds the existence of significant privacy competition, it then needs to assess whether measures are needed to preserve that competition in a post-merger world.</p><p>This point affects some of the language used to describe the way in which merger authorities can take privacy into account. Peter Swire, for example, describes the consumer loss connected to loss of privacy competition as \"privacy harms.\" (42) This phrase suggests to me that the company has used data in a way that violates consumer privacy rights and that it is a legitimate role of merger analysis to take these privacy law violations into account in assessing a merger.</p><p>But the consumer harm involved, if any, is not that the companies are violating consumer privacy rights, but that they are not satisfying consumer privacy preferences. This failure to satisfy consumer privacy preferences, even when there is no legal obligation to do so, is likely what Swire intends by the phrase \"privacy harm.\" But it has, to my ear anyway, suggestions of illegality under privacy law. (43)</p><p>Finally, some advocates think that merger reviews should consider possible improvements in privacy law that might more adequately vindicate the fundamental right to privacy. (44) An opt-in form of consent might be more protective of privacy than opt-out, for instance, and so a merger review might contemplate imposing that requirement as a merger condition, even if it is not required by current privacy law. The merging of separate data sets might create new privacy risks in the form of new and more detailed consumer profiles. These collections of data might be entirely legal under existing privacy law, but a merger review might block a transaction that would merge these data sets or might condition the merger on maintaining them in a separate non-linkable form. The reviewing agency might think it would be better for the merging companies to face privacy rules that go beyond their current legal obligations under privacy law.</p><p>But these measures would be unavailable to merger reviewing agencies if aimed at improving privacy protections instead of maintaining competitive conditions. The FTC recognized this restriction on advancing privacy interests in the context of merger reviews, saying in its decision on Google/DoubleClick: \"[T]he Commission lack[s] legal authority to require conditions to this merger that do not relate to antitrust. . . ,\" (45)</p><p>This is not to say that privacy law is perfect and cannot be improved. It is rather that needed improvements of privacy law are not within the scope of traditional merger reviews.</p><p>D. Privacy Can Be Legitimately Treated as an Aspect of Competition in Merger Reviews</p><p>Despite constraints on the ability of merger reviews to advance privacy interests, there is a way forward for merger reviews to account for privacy. Merger control might advance privacy interests by rejecting or conditioning a merger that would restrict consumer choice of stronger privacy practices. This would have the effect of maintaining privacy protections that the merger might eliminate because it would block or condition a merger that would absorb or marginalize a competitor with more privacy protective data practices.</p><p>This approach treats privacy as a non-price aspect of competition. Merger reviews are not limited to examining whether the merged entity could impose an anticompetitive price increase unrelated to an improvement in quality. A company might choose to exercise its post-merger market power by a cost-saving reduction in the quality of its product or service. It might also reduce its efforts to innovate, since it no longer faces the prospect that strong competitors will steal customers by introducing new features that make the product or service faster, more convenient, or easier to use. Merger reviews can investigate whether the resulting market conditions would allow any substantial reduction in competition along any dimension of product or service quality that is valued by consumers and that forms the basis for rivalry between competing firms.</p><p>The DOJ Merger Guidelines countenance steps that would enable reviewing agencies to consider privacy in the context of merger reviews. (46) They note that impermissible increases in market power following a merger can be manifested in \"non-price terms and conditions that adversely affect customers, including reduced product quality, reduced product variety, reduced service, or diminished innovation.\" (47) Data practices that adversely affect consumer privacy preferences could be considered one of these \"non-price terms and conditions.\" (48)</p><p>The Guidelines explicitly recognize that the loss of product variety is a cognizable antitrust harm: \"If the merged firm would withdraw a product that a significant number of customers strongly prefer to those products that would remain available, this can constitute a harm to customers over and above any effects on the price or quality of any given product.\" (49) The loss of a service providing strong privacy protections following a merger might be viewed as a reduction in product variety and taken into account fn a merger review.</p><p>Companies could compete on privacy in any number of ways: providing clearer, easier to read descriptions of their data collection practices, allowing choice about data use in a wider range of circumstances, adjusting the choice architecture to provide for opt-in rather than opt-out choice, allowing secondary use only with affirmative opt-in consent, not sharing customer data for third-party marketing, minimizing the data collected and discarding it after its initial use. When differences in these privacy practices are valuable for consumers and a basis for choice among competing products or services, they are a dimension, aspect, or parameter of competition.</p><p>Traditional antitrust officials increasingly accept the idea that privacy can be an aspect or dimension of competition. Former FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen has written: \"Privacy therefore increasingly represents a non-price dimension of competition.\" (50) European Commission competition officials Eleonora Ocello and Cristina Sjodin say that in digital markets, \"the degree of privacy afforded by the platform (i.e. the type of data protection policy in place) may thus become a relevant parameter of competition.\" (51) The current head of the DOJ Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has also supported this view: \"[Consumers may choose . . . online search services based on more accurate results or greater privacy protections.\" (52) Proponents of incorporating privacy considerations into antitrust enforcement such as Maurice Stucke and Allen Grunes agree with this framework whereby privacy can be incorporated into merger control analysis, accepting as a touchstone \"the requirement that privacy be an 'important' factor in the decision to purchase or a 'key' parameter of competition.\" (53)</p><p>As a result, notwithstanding the general principle that competition policy is concerned solely with protecting competition, when privacy is a \"main\" or \"key\" or \"important\" element in consumers' decisions to purchase a good or service, a merger that eliminated or reduced competition along this non-price dimension could be blocked or conditioned under antitrust law. This possibility means merger reviews could in principle maintain privacy-protective data practices that already exist in the marketplace.</p><p>E. Some Conceptual Points</p><p>Noting that privacy can be considered as a feature or parameter of competition invokes the question of how to do it. An important first step is to develop a concept of privacy that is suitable for merger control analysis.</p><p>European competition policy officials involved in the Commission's review of the Facebook/WhatsApp merger offer a common conceptualization of how to treat privacy as an element of competition in a merger review case:</p><p>In two-sided markets, where products are offered to users for free and monetised through targeted advertising, personal data can be viewed as the currency paid by the user in return for receiving the 'free' product, or as a dimension of product quality. Hence, a website that, post-merger, would start requiring more personal data from users or supplying such data to third parties as a condition for delivering its 'free' product could be seen as either increasing its price or as degrading the quality of its product. In certain circumstances, this behaviour could arguably amount to an infringement of competition law (irrespective of whether or not it also constitutes an infringement of data protection rules). However, while technically viable, this theory of harm could only be relevant in those cases where privacy is an important factor in the decision to purchase a product or service, i.e. a key parameter of competition. (54)</p><p>As this quotation illustrates, these Commission officials conceptualize data collection and use as a reduction in the quality of a service. In doing this, they are accepting a widespread notion that data collection and use is a uniformly negative phenomenon or, equivalently, that a decrease in data collection and use is intrinsically a good thing. Privacy becomes like product safety or the power of a car engine, something that all consumers would likely want more of rather than less. This conception of privacy as a loss of product quality feeds into merger reviews because degradation of quality is a consumer loss that can be considered in merger reviews. (55)</p><p>But is it really useful for merger reviews to think of a decreased flow of information as uniformly a good thing? Is a company that collects more information really, objectively, and for that reason alone, providing a worse product or service?</p><p>For merger review purposes it is much more realistic to think of privacy as subjective in that it \"may be valuable only to some consumers, or more valuable to some than others.\" (30) Whether a company collects a lot of data or a small amount of it is as objective a fact as the engine power or color of a car. The data practices of data collection, choice architecture, data minimization and retention, and so on are all objective conditions that in principle are observable. What is subjective is the value that people place on these practices.</p><p>Alan Westin's surveys over a thirty-year period show substantial variation in the value people place on privacy. Some people value privacy highly in almost all circumstances (the privacy fundamentalists, roughly 25%), some are largely indifferent (the privacy unconcerned, roughly 25%), and the rest (the privacy pragmatists, about 50%) say it depends on the context. (57)</p><p>Moreover, people's responses to survey questions likely do not match their marketplace behavior. A solid line of research has shown the existence of a \"privacy paradox: users claim to be very concerned about their privacy but do very little to protect their personal data.\" (58) This well-established phenomenon makes it difficult to assume universal agreement that more privacy and less data collection is inherently good.</p><p>The variation in consumer preferences in surveys and the lack of fit between those surveys and actual consumer behavior might very well be attributable to market defects in the provision of adequate information to allow a timely and informed privacy choice. Consumers might never be able to develop an adequate and timely understanding of information uses simply because of the complexities of modern data collection and analysis techniques. Moreover, companies might be using overly complicated legalistic notices to discourage proper understanding and might design websites and apps deceptively through the use of \"dark patterns\" to encourage information sharing that might not be in the best interests of consumers or reflect their true preferences. (59)</p><p>But it is not clear how to bring these insights to bear in a merger review. These marketplace defects would be more appropriately remedied through additional consumer protection measures designed to provide consumers with adequate and timely information. Indeed, that is the purpose of many privacy laws. A new law might also be needed to prevent deceptive dark pattern. (60) But these reforms cannot be implemented as part of a merger review. For merger control purposes, preferences expressed in measures of marketplace demand have to be assumed to reflect real preferences.</p><p>Competition law has to conceive of privacy as a feature of a service that is offered to consumers on the market. People have different preferences for different economic goods, including differing preferences in connection with privacy. Those differences must be acknowledged when engaged in competition analysis.</p><p>As a result, in an assessment of competition in privacy for merger review purposes, people have to be viewed as having privacy tastes in the same way that they have color tastes or food tastes. It is no more legitimate from the point of view of assessing marketplace privacy competition to say that privacy protective practices are higher quality than it is to say, without any evidence from surveys or other assessments of effective actual consumer preferences, that blue cars are of higher quality than yellow cars or that corn is better than green beans.</p><p>James Cooper provides an additional perspective on why increasing data collection and use might not always amount to a reduction in product quality. He suggests that data collection and use is an intermediate good, an input that companies use to improve the overall quality of their product and services:</p><p>Taking additional consumer data is not the same as skimping on quality, because collecting, storing, and analyzing data is an additional cost. For the publisher, improved data is an investment. The publisher hopes to enhance its revenue by using the additional data to improve the quality of its content and through selling more finely targeted ads. (61)</p><p>The result is that consumers are offered additional benefits associated with the additional data collection. It is that bundle that consumers are asked to evaluate, not the additional data collection all by itself. As Cooper notes, consumers do not reach a uniform judgment about the value of these bundles:</p><p>Some consumers may care little about being tracked online or having Google read their e-mails, and they may derive great utility from easier searching and highly relevant ads. On the other hand, there are others who may detest targeted ads and the \"creepy\" feeling from knowing that their search and browsing histories are stored on multiple servers. For these people, data collection may well be a net reduction in quality. (62)</p><p>The key idea here is that data collection and use are inputs for production of goods and services. In the absence of a given level of data collection and use, the product or service would be different. In particular, it would differ in the level of personalization it would provide, that is, in the extent to which it was designed to satisfy the interests and preferences of the consumer.</p><p>Companies compile personal information about their customers or potential customers in order to tailor their services to their interests and needs and thereby make it more attractive to them and to increase their engagement with the service. (63) This is true of many digital companies such as search engines, social networks, and online marketplaces, whether they are general marketplaces selling a variety of products or providing specific services such as streaming music or videos. In a social network, for instance, the additional data collection and use make possible recommendations for content and contacts that better match the interests of the user. In networks supported by targeted advertising, the data collection and use also powers ads that are more likely to be of interest to the user.</p><p>This use of data to personalize services is broader than digital companies, and broader than two-sided markets for \"free\" goods. To name just two other sectors, healthcare providers use data to personalize medicine (64) and educators use data to personalize education. (65) The oddity of conceptualizing data collection and use as a quality degradation is perhaps more apparent in these cases where such a conception would have to treat the increases in the quality of medicine and education from personalization as a decline in service quality.</p><p>The same point arises from consideration of traditional ways personal information is used to provide services. Sharing personal, and sometimes sensitive, information with your doctor, lawyer, counselor, or bank in order to get services relevant to your situation is the only way to get the services, or at least to get them in a form that provides real value. It is hard to see such information sharing as intrinsically reducing the quality of the service provided.</p><p>Privacy conceived of as limited data collection and use often operates at the expense of personalization. The two vary inversely. As privacy goes up, personalization goes down, and vice versa. Consumers typically purchase a bundle, not privacy as an isolated feature of a product or service. The range of possible bundles a company could offer would extend from one extreme of very high personalization and data collection to the other extreme of very low personalization and data collection. (66)</p><p>Economist Joseph Farrell has a different perspective on these conceptual issues. (67) He understands that privacy comes bundled with a service but conceives of this bundling as productively inoperative, a feature that can be arbitrarily added or removed from the service without making any difference to its other features that consumers might value. (68) In his view, book-selling companies might attach a privacy policy allowing them to collect and use information or not, with no other difference to the consumer in the service that the book-selling company offers. (69)</p><p>It is this assumption--that data collection and use has no role in the production of the service--that allows him to assert, as a key element in his economic model of privacy as \"just another good\" that: \"A book, bundled with privacy policy B, is a less attractive good than the book bundled with privacy policy A,\" where B allows greater data collection and use and A allows less. (70) In fact, a book-selling service that collects substantial information about its purchasers is able to make recommendations that might match the consumers' interests and tastes far more effectively than a service that discards this information, and might therefore provide a service that is more valued, not one that is automatically inferior because of its greater data collection practices.</p><p>It is true that in some circumstances, data collection could be completely disconnected from the provision of the service. This seems to be the case with the example Farrell has in mind of a publisher who simply sells consumer information to the highest bidder, without changing the nature or character of the books it sells or recommends. (71) But that is not the central case of data collection and use. Companies typically collect information about their customers to improve the service they provide and, when they are advertiser-supported, to target ads more closely to their interests. (72)</p><p>For this reason, Farrell's model of data collection and use as arbitrarily added to a final good is not likely to be of much help in merger reviews. Much more relevant is the conception of data collection as an intermediate good which is used to produce a final service. It is this final service which consumers value, some more than others. (73)</p><p>Much conceptual work needs to be done on privacy as a form of competition. For example, data sharing could be viewed as the \"price\" that users pay for personalization of a service. (74) It could also be thought of as a form of labor or an asset that users provide to companies for which compensation is needed. (75) These conceptualizations need to be explored more fully and their place in merger reviews should be better understood.</p><p>In the meantime, a step toward conceptual clarity might come from rethinking the idea of privacy as an objective improvement in a product or service. It might be more useful to recognize that the value consumers place on privacy is subjective. Moreover, to understand the nature of privacy competition, it might be helpful in merger reviews to think of data collection and use as an input to the personalization of a service. Companies compete along this privacy-personalization frontier, offering consumers not simply more privacy or less privacy but a bundled choice of more privacy and less personalization or more personalization and less privacy. The preferences of consumers for these bundles then have to be assessed empirically as part of a merger review.</p><p>F. Empirical Requirements</p><p>This recognition that privacy preferences differ, in part because privacy comes bundled with personalization services, has important implications for the assessment of privacy competition in merger reviews. In particular, it implies that an observed difference in data practices cannot be assumed to reflect different levels of consumer value. Changes in consumer welfare resulting from changes in data practices have to be assessed empirically by assessing actual consumer preferences.</p><p>It is possible that changes in company data practices following a merger might constitute a significant consumer harm. However, this cannot be assumed as a matter of definition any more than--to use Cooper's example in a merger context--it could be assumed that a restaurant's post-merger decision \"to replace corn with green beans on its menu\" would constitute a consumer harm that needs to be assessed in a merger review. (76)</p><p>Even if privacy is conceptualized as an increase in product quality, the size of the increase must be assessed empirically. As the European Commission competition officials said after outlining their view of data collection as intrinsically harmful: \"However, while technically viable, this theory of harm could only be relevant in those cases where privacy is an important factor in the decision to purchase a product or service, i.e. a key parameter of competition.\" (77) That is, even if merger reviewing authorities assume that increased data collection degrades product quality, there still remains the empirical question of how large this effect might be.</p><p>Swire recognizes this point as well. About the Google/DoubleClick merger, he says:</p><p>If the merger is approved, then individuals using the market leader in search may face a search product that has both \"deep\" and \"broad\" collection of information. For the many millions of individuals with high privacy preferences, this may be a significant reduction in the quality of the search product--search previously was conducted without the combined deep and broad tracking, and now the combination will exist. I am not in a position to quantify the harm to consumers from such a reduction in quality. (78)</p><p>Let me emphasize that in this quotation Swire says that a merger creating more data collection \"may be a significant reduction in the quality\" of the product. He is not arguing that the merger would create this harm, merely that it is possible. In order to be considered in a merger review, such possible harm has to be demonstrated as actual and its size estimated.</p><p>Even if privacy is thought of as an increase in quality, it still might be that these differences in quality are too small to affect consumer behavior. A market investigation must assess and confirm that \"privacy is an important factor in the decision to purchase a product or service.\" (79)</p><p>The FTC did such an assessment in its Google/DoubleClick merger review. (80) Despite its view that the prevention of harm to competition is the sole aim of merger review, the FTC also \"investigated the possibility that this transaction could adversely affect non-price attributes of competition, such as consumer privacy.\" It \"concluded that the evidence does not support a conclusion that it would do so.\" (81)</p><p>To determine that privacy is an important parameter of competition, it is necessary to assess whether a significant number of people base market choices on their privacy preferences. Universality is not needed. As one commentator says: \"[I]t seems unreasonable to conclude that protecting competition over privacy would require a finding that consumers are unanimous in their preference for additional privacy protections.\" (82) When large numbers of people make their decisions about the goods or services that they buy on the basis of the privacy practices of the companies involved, then privacy is a \"key\" or \"important\" parameter of competition in those markets.</p><p>The way to ascertain the value of privacy for merger review purposes is through consumer surveys or interrogation of the expert opinion of those involved in the marketplace and have experience in seeking to meet consumer demand as it manifests itself in consumer behavior. (83) Expert opinion might be preferable to asking people specific hypothetical questions about their preferences in connection with the merged company's data practices. Surveys in this area are especially unreliable, as the privacy paradox phenomenon shows. (84)</p><p>As described in the two case studies in Sections III and IV, obstacles to an accurate empirical assessment of the role of privacy in marketplace competition are formidable. (85) But if merger reviews are ever to be a reliable mechanism to address privacy concerns, they have to be faced and overcome.</p><p>G. Privacy Competition Can Be Reduced After a Merger in Several Different Ways</p><p>Consumer harm can take the form of a post-merger failure to satisfy consumer privacy preferences that were satisfied before the merger. And in some circumstances, this can be a cognizable consumer harm that needs to be addressed in merger reviews.</p><p>A diminution of privacy competition post-merger could take place a variety of ways. One would be a merger in which a company with weak privacy protections takes over a company with strong privacy protections and reduces these protections after the merger. Some analysts seem to think that this cannot be a problem because a company that provides weak privacy protection does not compete with a company that provides strong privacy protection. (86) They are not in the same market of aiming to satisfy consumer privacy preferences and so a merger cannot result in any consumer harm. (87)</p><p>Stucke and Grunes rightly point out that consumers who are dissatisfied with the privacy features of one company rarely go looking for another company with poor privacy protection. (88) If consumer preferences for privacy are important in the market, \"privacy is a dimension on which (companies) are competing, whether they offer a lot of protection for the data or a little.\" (89) Indeed, given the bundled nature of personalization and privacy described earlier, it is hard to see how companies could fail to compete.</p><p>As a result, the failure to satisfy consumer privacy preferences post-merger could be a real consumer harm that is properly subject to assessment in merger review, even when one of the companies has no interest in protecting privacy beyond what is legally required. As we will see, this was an important issue in the Facebook/WhatsApp merger.</p><p>A fact pattern similar to that in the abuse of dominance case brought by Germany's Federal Cartel Office (FCO) against Facebook might also arise in a merger context. (90) In its case, the FCO observed Facebook's practice of requiring users to accept, as a condition of using Facebook, the collection of information about their use of third-party and affiliated services and the combination of this information with the information about their use of the Facebook service itself (91) The FCO said that this practice was both a violation of European privacy law and a violation of German competition law. (92)</p><p>The FCO said that this practice was a violation of the General Data Protection Directive--specifically, its requirement that Facebook must have a legal basis for the collection and use of personal information. (93) Because Facebook occupies a dominant position in the social media marketplace, the legal basis for data collection cannot be consent because consent has to be voluntary and the lack of genuine alternatives to Facebook means that Facebook users cannot give genuine consent to data collection.* (4) Moreover, the third-party and affiliate data collection cannot be based on contractual necessity, since the collection of this extra data is not necessary for the provision of Facebook service. (95) Finally, the data collection cannot be based on Facebook's legitimate interests because the extent of the data collection so far exceeded the reasonable expectations of Facebook's users that only marketplace dominance could explain why users accepted it. (96)</p><p>In addition, the FCO asserted that the collection and combination of third-party data was a competition problem because the resulting profiles, which can exist only because of Facebook's abuse of its dominant position, gave it an unfair and insuperable advantage in the advertising marketplace. (97) In effect, the FCO asserted that the combined data set does not leave enough data left over for advertising rivals to function effectively. (98)</p><p>The FCO proposed what is essentially a data protection remedy. Facebook must allow its users a separate choice in connection with third party and affiliate data collection and combination that would enable them to refuse this collection and combination of data and still be able to use the Facebook social media service. (99) Failing that, it may continue to collect third-party and affiliate data from its users, but it may not combine them together with organic Facebook data to create a single user profile. (100)</p><p>This fact pattern can be reimagined as a merger circumstance, in which a social media company seeks to merge to a position of dominance through the acquisition of another social media company with pro-privacy data practices. The merged entity might change the pro-privacy practices of its acquired company, thereby depriving its users of their previous pro-privacy choice. The merged entity's dominance in the social media market prevents these users from moving to a viable alternative, and so the loss of privacy choice is a direct result of the loss of competition.</p><p>A merger could harm privacy competition in a different way. If a firm aiming to provide strong privacy protections merges with the only other firm also aiming to provide strong privacy protections, the merged company might, under certain conditions, be able to reduce privacy protections for its customers without fear of retaliation from other companies. (101) This would provide an interesting case for competition authority to review, but to my knowledge no such case has arisen yet in practice.</p><p>A third way privacy competition could be adversely affected by a merger might arise if the acquiring company has a dominant position in a separate market related to the market in which its target competes. The merged entity might then be able to use this dominant position in the related market to advantage its new acquisition against its rivals. When the new acquisition provides less privacy protection than its rivals in the related market, the result might be the foreclosure or marginalization of competitors who provide better privacy protection. This is the fact pattern that arose in the Microsoft/Linkedln merger review. (102)</p><p>H. Consumer Harms Connected to Privacy Are Cognizable in Merger Analysis Only If They Result from a Lessening of Competition</p><p>Even if privacy preferences are an important element of competition in the marketplace and even if the merged company would not satisfy them, a review should not necessarily block or condition a proposed transaction. It is not enough to show that a merger leaves some consumer preferences for privacy unsatisfied compared to the market situation before the merger. The privacy loss has to result from the loss of competition.</p><p>This is a very general point. Consumer harm counts in merger reviews only if the harm results from a lessening of competition post-merger. Consumer preferences that are no longer satisfied after a merger count as a cognizable merger harm only if the post-merger failure to satisfy them is related to some defect of competition.</p><p>The DOJ Merger Guidelines are explicit on this point. They say that a merger \"enhances market power if it is likely to encourage one or more firms to raise price, reduce output, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm customers as a result of diminished competitive constraints or incentives. (103)</p><p>The DOJ Guidelines note that a merged firm might withdraw a product that a significant number of people value. (104) But they add that if there is evidence that this has happened, \"the Agencies may inquire whether the reduction in variety is largely due to a loss of competitive incentives attributable to the merger.\" (105) The reason for making this additional attribution inquiry is that:</p><p>Reductions in variety following a merger may or may not be anticompetitive. Mergers can lead to the efficient consolidation of products when variety offers little in value to customers. In other cases, a merger may increase variety by encouraging the merged firm to reposition its products to be more differentiated from one another. (106)</p><p>The DOJ Merger Guidelines consider the circumstance in which two actual or potential competitors merge. When that happens, of course, they no longer compete with each other. Following such a merger, there might be consumer harm such as a price increase or unsatisfied consumer preferences. But the reviewing agency can consider those post-merger consumer harms only when they \"result directly from the loss of that competition.\" (107)</p><p>Some examples illustrate the point. Color might be an important dimension of car competition and a merged car company's decision to stop making yellow cars might leave some consumers unsatisfied. But if the merged company's decision is based on a market assessment of demand, or even if it is just based on the whim of the new owners, there is nothing merger review should do to stop this. The merger review might reach a different conclusion if the merger would change competitive conditions so that the merged car company faces substantially lessened competition, which might be the case in a merger to monopoly. Then the company's decision to stop making yellow cars would be predicated on its understanding that in the post-merger world it will not face any competitive response.</p><p>To take another example, suppose credit card company American Express seeks acquiring rival Visa and vows that at the end of the transaction Visa will no longer accept transactions for porn merchants. American Express has long had a policy of not accepting the business of porn merchants, because it seeks to preserve what it views as an attractive brand and valuable business image. After the merger, it wants to extend this branding policy to its new acquisition. As a result, some customer preferences will be frustrated after the merger, both on the merchant side and on the cardholder side. Nevertheless, according to DOJ Guidelines, antitrust authorities should be indifferent to this consumer harm as long as there is sufficient competition in the market so that another payment company seeking to gain market share is free to pick up those disgruntled porn merchants as customers. If the loss in consumer satisfaction derives from a newly created dominant position, however, rather than from a branding preference of the acquiring company, then it is cognizable by the merger reviewer, but not otherwise.</p><p>The same reasoning applies to a reduction of privacy alternatives after a merger, even when consumers make marketplace choices in large measure on the basis of privacy. It is not enough to show that a merged company might end the pro-privacy practices of an acquired rival by merging. It is also not enough to show that a merged company might be able to defeat a rival that offers its customers more privacy protection. These results have to be the consequence of some reduction of competition in the post-merger market. If there would continue to be plenty of rivals in the market, if entry and expansion in the market would remain inexpensive and easy, and if network effects would pose no extraordinary barriers to entry or expansion, then there would be no lessening of competitive conditions after the merger. In the presence of these competitive conditions, especially if privacy is truly an important dimension of competition in that market, a company that did not provide the privacy that many customers want would almost certainly face a strong competitive response. Actual or potential rivals would be able to provide it without facing anticompetitive barriers, and, especially if privacy preferences are strong, they would have every incentive to step forward to provide it.</p><p>Swire understands the need to connect any consumer harm in a merger analysis to some failure of competition: \"Possible harm to product quality, due to monopoly power, has been clearly recognized in the courts.\" (108) As a result, even if the \"broadening and deepening\" of information collection following the Google/DoubleClick merger is accepted as a consumer harm, a reviewing agency has to ask, so what? (109) If the consumer harm-failure to satisfy some consumer preferences, who nevertheless continue to use the product--is not caused by a lack of competition, then the merger review cannot reach it.</p><p>In a similar way, Stucke and Grunes understand that a reviewing agency might want to object to a hypothetical Facebook/WhatsApp transaction where it has the effect of eliminating all viable texting choices where privacy is protected. (110) But, as they also point out, this objection can only have force in a merger review where the loss of these choices is \"because of entry barriers and network effects\" that result in a \"lessening of competition.\" (111) The key is that the elimination of choice derives from failure of competitive conditions due to entry barriers and network effects, not simply from the decision of the merged entity to increase data collection. As we will see later, the European Commission approved the Facebook/WhatsApp merger, even if Facebook would have eliminated WhatsApp's privacy protective business model, because it found plenty of suppliers in the marketplace for communications apps, no substantial entry or switching barriers, and weak network effects.</p><p>It is sometimes easy to forget this added burden in merger reviews. Stucke and Grunes raise the possibility of a hypothetical Google/DuckDuckGo merger and say correctly that a key issue in a merger review \"would be the degradation in privacy protection post-merger.\" (112) But they do not focus on the more critical question of whether the loss of DuckDuckGo's privacy protective business model derives solely from a business decision of the new owner or whether it is an exercise of newly-formed market power deriving from the merger itself.</p><p>This need to trace consumer harm to a loss of competition requires a substantial showing, as is revealed by considering what would have to be established to condition or block a Google/DuckDuckGo merger. DuckDuckGo has a one percent market share; its search technology differs from Google's, and it has generated profit every year for the last five years by selling contextual ad services that do not track its users. (113) Even if Google acquired the company and ended its pro-privacy practices, a merger review that follows the DOJ Guidelines would have to show that the resulting lack of competitive conditions would prevent other companies from replicating these elements of a successful business model to meet the frustrated demand of people for whom DuckDuckGo's privacy practices were attractive. (114) With that showing, the merger could possibly be blocked or conditioned, but not without it.</p><p>To see how privacy-aware merger reviews work in practice and to derive some lessons for the future, the rest of this Article looks carefully at the European Commission's reviews of the Facebook/WhatsApp merger and the Microsoft/Linkedln merger. The questions we will be examining in the assessments that follow include whether the merger review considered the differences in privacy practices and, if it did, whether it rejected or conditioned the merger on the basis of these differences. An additional and crucial question is whether the conditions imposed directly or indirectly served to maintain the pro-privacy practices that were at risk in the merger.</p><p>III. FACEBOOK/WHATSAPP</p><p>In 2014 the European Commission conducted a review of the proposed Facebook merger with the messaging service WhatsApp. (115) Facebook controlled its own competing communications app, Facebook Messenger. (116) The Commission reviewed the possible loss of competition in the social media market, (117) in the communications app market, (118) and in the online advertising market, (119) and approved the merger without conditions. (120)</p><p>A key issue in the merger review was one of the possibilities of privacy and antitrust overlap discussed earlier, namely, that the merger would create an excessive concentration of commercially valuable data. (121) Despite its general statement in the decision that privacy issues as such belonged with the data protection authorities, the Commission nonetheless reviewed these data issues. (122) It considered whether the combination of Facebook and WhatsApp user data sets could create a data monopoly. (123) It found that there would be plenty of data left over after the merger for competitors: \"[R]egardless of whether the merged entity will start using WhatsApp user data to improve targeted advertising on Facebook's social network, there will continue to be a large amount of Internet user data that are valuable for advertising purposes and that are not within Facebook's exclusive control.\" (124)</p><p>In addition, and as a separate matter, the Commission extensively considered the role of privacy as an element of competition. It started by recognizing that: \"[Contrary to WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger enables Facebook to collect data regarding its users that it uses for the purposes of its advertising activities.\" (125) It noted that it was a deliberate choice for WhatsApp to build its business \"around the goal of knowing as little about [users] as possible.\" (126) Also, the Commission said that while the importance of privacy and security \"varies from user to user . . . [they] are becoming increasingly valued, as shown by the introduction of consumer communications apps specifically addressing privacy and security issues . . . ,\" (127)</p><p>In particular, the Commission observed that besides WhatsApp, two other messaging services, Threema and Telegram, were more protective of privacy than Facebook Messenger. (128) It further noted that privacy concerns \"seem to have prompted a high number of German users to switch from WhatsApp to Threema in the 24 hours following the announcement of Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp.\" (129) And it also noted that \"after the announcement of WhatsApp's acquisition by Facebook and because of privacy concerns, thousands of users downloaded different messaging platforms, in particular Telegram, which offers increased privacy protection.\" (130) In sum, while not a \"maverick\" in the marketplace, WhatsApp provided \"behavioural ads.\" (131)</p><p>So, the Commission, while not taking privacy as such into account, spent a significant part of its merger review on observing different privacy practices present in the market. Still, the Commission did not conclude that these differences in privacy practices were an important element in the competition between the merging messaging services. (132) It found instead that privacy was just like some of the other relatively minor differences between Facebook and WhatsApp. (133)</p><p>These minor differences included the contrasting identifiers used to access the services and the different sources of the contact information used to connect users. (134) Price was a differentiator as well. While most apps were provided for free, Threema charged a subscription fee, as did WhatsApp in some markets. (135)</p><p>These contrasting features, including the privacy differences, were real ways in which the services differed, but they were not key factors driving competition in that marketplace, not the main or the paramount basis for consumer choice of communications app.</p><p>The Commission concluded instead that, in general: \"[T]he main drivers of the competitive interaction between consumer communications apps appear to be (i) the functionalities offered and (ii) the underlying network.\" (136) It found that the competition between Facebook and WhatsApp also turned on these same two factors: communications functionalities offered and network size. (137) In particular, the size of the network seemed of crucial importance to a typical user since it increases \"the number of people he or she can reach.\" (138)</p><p>Moreover, the Commission observed that WhatsApp users did not seem to reject Facebook's privacy practices. The Commission noted: \"[B]etween [70-80]% and [80-90]% of WhatsApp users were Facebook users and were therefore already within the reach of Facebook Messenger.\" (139) If WhatsApp users were genuinely put off by Facebook's privacy practices, so much so that they would prefer to use WhatsApp instead, why were up to 90% of them Facebook users?</p><p>Stucke and Grunes wonder why a Facebook user would avoid Facebook Messenger and use WhatsApp instead. (140) Why not just use Facebook Messenger? They speculate that these Facebook users wanted the greater WhatsApp privacy protections. (141) But an alternative possibility is that these users needed WhatsApp to reach the people they wanted to be in touch with who were not Facebook users, and they had no need of the additional people they could reach on Facebook Messenger. So, the Commission concluded privacy was not a \"main\" driver of competition in the consumer communications market. (142) It found, moreover, that the merger would not significantly impede effective competition in that communications market. (143)</p><p>The proposed transaction would increase the combined company's market share to as much as 40%, with the rest spread among smaller providers. (144) But the Commission also found that, due to substantial overlap of their user base, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp were more like providers of complementary services than close competitors. (145) So, the merger did not really a diminish existing competition.</p><p>It also found that there would be many alternative providers after the merger for users to easily choose, (146) that there were no significant barriers to entry, (147) and that network effects would not seriously hinder competitor expansion or entry, (148) even if Facebook integrated its Messenger service with WhatsApp. (149)</p><p>The results of the merger have not been what privacy advocates might have hoped. At the time of the merger, WhatsApp founder Jan Koum said: \"Here's what will change for you, our users: nothing.\" (150) However, in 2016 things began to change. WhatsApp began to share information with Facebook about WhatsApp users, including a user's phone number, last seen data, operating system, mobile country code, mobile carrier code, screen resolution, and device identifier. (151) Two years later, Facebook clarified that WhatsApp would join Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger as an app that advertisers could use to reach their intended audience. These actions triggered the resignation of the WhatsApp founders from Facebook. (152) In May 2019, Facebook announced that the first ads would begin to appear on WhatsApp in 2020. (153)</p><p>One result of the merger, then, is that WhatsApp's pro-privacy practices have largely been replaced with the less protective but still legal data collection and use practices typical of the rest of the Facebook product family.</p><p>This result might seem to be a step backwards in privacy protection, perhaps attributable to a mistake in the merger review process.</p><p>Is it the case, for instance, that the approval was dependent on misleading information that Facebook provided to the Commission during the review? It is true that Facebook faced disciplinary action from the Commission for providing misleading information during the merger review. (154) It was, in fact, able to automatically match users who had both the Facebook app and the WhatsApp app installed on their phones, using the phone's unique code as a common identifier. (155) Facebook, however, had not disclosed this possibility to the Commission during the merger review, even though it had developed such a matching system for Facebook and Instagram, and was working to implement it for WhatsApp after the merger. (156) Facebook admitted that it had negligently provided incorrect or misleading information to the Commission during the merger review. (157) The Commission fined it [euro]110 million. (158)</p><p>But the Commission did not change its decision about the legitimacy of the merger even knowing about the ease with which Facebook could merge Facebook and WhatsApp data and it would not have made a different decision if it had been told the truth. (159) It had evaluated the merger based on the assumption that Facebook would be able to merge the data sets after the merger and it still found that the merger did not substantially lessen competition. (160) It said that if Facebook managed to integrate WhatsApp and Facebook data despite apparent technical difficulties, it would \"pose a business risk\" because \"users could switch to competing consumer communications apps.\" (161) That is, there was still plenty of competition available so that users who wanted to switch to privacy-protective communications apps would be able to do so. (162)</p><p>The change in WhatsApp privacy practices after the merger could perhaps be reached by consumer protection law. At the time of the merger, the United States FTC sent a letter to Facebook, saying:</p><p>WhatsApp has made a number of promises about the limited nature of the data it collects, maintains, and shares with third parties - promises that exceed the protections currently promised to Facebook users. We want to make clear that, regardless of the acquisition, WhatsApp must continue to honor these promises to consumers. Further, if the acquisition is completed and WhatsApp fails to honor these promises, both companies could be in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act and, potentially, the FTC's order against Facebook. (163)</p><p>The FTC has not taken any such consumer protection enforcement actions, but there is clearly a remedy available for companies who mislead the public and their consumers about their data practices. That might be a more productive avenue to pursue to reverse changes in WhatsApp privacy practices post-merger, rather than reopening the merger decision to address privacy issues.</p><p>There might have been some mistakes in the European Commission's review of the proposed merger. (164) But the Commission's judgment at the time of the merger that privacy was not a crucial element of competition between Facebook and WhatsApp seems reasonable, even today. At the time of the review, there was no compelling evidence that WhatsApp's pro-privacy practices were a distinguishing feature of communications app competition. (165) Functionality and user base seemed to be the key elements of competition, not privacy. (166) The merger review reasonably avoided blocking or conditioning the merger on the basis of a likely threat to reduce privacy competition.</p><p>IV. MlCROSOFT/LlNKEDlN</p><p>In 2016, the European Commission reviewed the proposed Microsoft/Linkedln merger. (167) After determining that the merger posed a risk of competitive harm in the market for professional social networks, it accepted Microsoft's commitments in the area of pre-installation and integration with Microsoft's other products and approved the merger with these conditions. (168)</p><p>The Commission assessed the possibility of a data monopoly emerging from the sharing of data between Microsoft and Linkedln. (169) The Commission concluded that there would be no dearth of data for competitors after the merger: \"[T]he combination of their respective datasets does not appear to result in raising the barriers to entry/expansion for other players in this space, as there will continue to be a large amount of internet user data that are valuable for advertising purposes ... not within Microsoft's exclusive control.\" (170)</p><p>Separately and independently, the Commission also assessed the state of privacy competition in the market. Its conclusion on privacy competition in this case was different:</p><p>Privacy related concerns as such do not fall within the scope of EU competition law but can be taken into account in the competition assessment to the extent that consumers see it as a significant factor of quality, and the merging parties compete with each other on this factor. In this instance, the Commission concluded that data privacy was an important parameter of competition between professional social networks on the market, which could have been negatively affected by the transaction. (171)</p><p>The Commission determined that Xing, a professional social network competing with Linkedln in Germany and Austria, \"seems to offer a greater degree of privacy protection than Linkedln.\" (172) Xing had a separate box to tick to accept its privacy policy, while Linkedln users automatically accepted its privacy policy when they pressed the \"join now\" button. (173) Moreover, Xing sought active user consent for new policies and allowed users to continue to use the service regardless of their choice. (174) In contrast, Linkedln notified users of its privacy policy changes and assumed consent if they continued to use the service. (175) The Commission found that these differences were important in determining consumer choice: \"[P]rivacy is an important parameter of competition and driver of customer choice in the market for (professional social network) services...,\" (176)</p><p>This conclusion on the strength of privacy competition was mentioned in the Commission's determination of a potential competition problem with the merger. (177) The Commission was concerned that Microsoft after the merger could use certain integration and pre-installment practices in connection with its newly acquired Linkedln app to foreclose competition in the market for professional social networks. (178) This foreclosing of competition would reduce consumer choice for their preferred social network. (179) But it would also prevent consumers from choosing the professional social network that would best protect their privacy. As the Commission put it:</p><p>[T]o the extent that these foreclosure effects would lead to the marginalisation of an existing competitor which offers a greater degree of privacy protection to users than Linkedln (or make the entry of any such competitor more difficult), the Transaction would also restrict consumer choice in relation to this important parameter of competition when choosing a [professional social network]. (180)</p><p>To remedy that potential foreclosure problem, the Commission solicited and accepted 5-year commitments from Microsoft restricting their conduct in connection with integrating and pre-installing the Linkedln app. (181) With these commitments, the Commission cleared the merger. (182)</p><p>How did the Commission reach its conclusion on privacy competition? How did it use that conclusion in its final decision and remedy?</p><p>The Commission provided an analysis of the market for professional social network services, distinguishing that market from personal social networks such as Facebook, from more specialized professional social networks such as Academia, and from closed social networks such as those limited to a particular enterprise. (183) It identified the other marketplace participants, XING, Viadeo, and GoldenLine, (184) and listed their market shares. (185) The Commission noted the \"essential\" functionalities that all competing professional social networks must and do have, including: \"the creation and update of a CV, searching for jobs, receiving alerts and ads about jobs, and asking to be introduced to new contacts through a common connection.\" (186) But it did not include disclosing its privacy protections as one of these essential functionalities.</p><p>It is unclear from the Commission's account what the evidence was for its conclusion that privacy was an \"important parameter\" in the competition between Linkedln and Xing, as opposed to just a relatively minor difference between the social networks that did not determine consumer choice. (187) It cited only the \"results of the marketplace investigation\" and some questions in a survey distributed to social networks. (188)</p><p>This lack of detail is disappointing. Moreover, the finding is implausible on its face. Would a person seeking a quality professional social network really base the decision in whole or in substantial part on the basis of the opt-in or opt-out choice structure for data sharing and policy updates described by the Commission? In addition, if privacy was such a major element of competition, why didn't the Commission list a privacy policy as one of the essential functionalities that a professional social network must provide?</p><p>To this point, business press accounts of the rivalry between Linkedln and Xing, its main competitor in German-speaking countries, make no mention of privacy differences, providing some evidence that consumers do not view privacy as a major element of competition. (189) These accounts suggest that a contrast between local and international focus seems to be the key to consumer choice, not privacy. (190) Xing is most compatible with local culture and styles in German-speaking countries, while Linkedln is more connected with global networks. Privacy does not figure in the rivalry in these accounts at all. If privacy is such a driver of competition in this market, why don't the industry accounts of competition between Linkedln and Xing in Germany mention it?</p><p>As a separate matter, it is hard to interpret the Commission's perplexing assertion that their conclusion on privacy competition in Microsoft/Linkedln dovetails with their finding in the Facebook/WhatsApp case: \"The finding of the importance of privacy as parameter of competition is consistent with the Commission's findings in Facebook/WhatsApp ... in relation to consumer communication services.\" (191)</p><p>As we saw, the WhatsApp decision clearly says that: \"The only factors on the basis of which WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger were considered close competitors ... are the communications functionalities offered and the size of their respective networks.\" (1)' (2) And the Commission in that case determined that privacy was not a \"main\" driver of competition. (193)</p><p>Moreover, expert commentary two years after the Microsoft/Linkedln decision from Commission officials who were close to both decisions presents a clear contrast between the conclusions in the two cases:</p><p>For example, in Facebook/WhatsApp, in 2014, the Commission found that, while an increasing number of users valued privacy and security, at that time the majority of consumer communications apps (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Line, etc.) did not (mainly) compete on privacy features. When reviewing Microsoft/Linkedln in 2016, the Commission found that privacy was an important parameter of competition among professional social networks, in particular in certain EU Member States, such as Germany. (194)</p><p>So, according to these Commission experts, the Commission found in the Facebook/WhatsApp case that privacy was not a \"main\" driver of competition and found in the Microsoft/Linkedln case that privacy was an \"important\" driver of competition. (195)</p><p>The Commission seemed to be going to extraordinary lengths to make their disparate conclusions seem consistent. It is hard to see the motivation for this. It is reasonable, even likely, that privacy will be a more important driver of competition in one market than in another. There is no need to impose an artificial consistency between the two cases.</p><p>In any case, the finding of privacy as an important driver of professional social network competition was not a determinant of the Commission's conclusion. (196) It might have added weight to the Commission's reasoning in favor of conditioning the merger before approving it. (197) But the crucial finding was that Microsoft had the incentive and ability to foreclose competition in the professional social network market, regardless of what the drivers of competition in that market actually were. (198) This competition problem derived from Microsoft's control over key business productivity software that allowed it to provide its affiliated Linkedln app with ease of access and price advantages that competitors would not be able to match. (199) The resulting consumer harm was ultimately the loss of choice of alternative professional social networks, and with it the loss of a privacy alternative that consumers valued. (200) The reasoning was from a foreclosing tie to a consumer harm, rather than from the loss of privacy competition to a competition problem. (201)</p><p>Moreover, the Commission's remedy did nothing to address Linkedln's post-merger privacy practices. (202) It did not require the post-merger Linkedln to make its data practices more pro-privacy or even to preserve the status quo in its data practices by not weakening privacy protections below what they were before the merger. (203) Indeed, the Commission's remedy to avoid certain pre-installation and integration practices would have been exactly the same if the Commission had concluded that privacy was not a parameter of competition at all.</p><p>V. LESSONS LEARNED</p><p>This review of Commission practice in two high-profile cases reveals the existence of substantial legal and factual obstacles to making progress on privacy through thinking of privacy as an element of competition and using antitrust merger review tools to preserve it. It confirms and illustrates many of the general points made earlier, including the inapplicability of data protection law and the need for factual case-by-case evaluation of privacy preferences. The cases also illustrate some of the formidable empirical difficulties in establishing the existence and strength of privacy preferences. Finally, the cases show that even when agencies examine privacy competition in merger reviews, these considerations do not necessarily play a strong role in the decision itself or in the formulation of the conditions designed to remedy competitive harm.</p><p>In both cases, the European Commission explicitly asserted that it did not apply data protection law in its merger reviews and that privacy as such belonged with data protection law, not with antirust merger reviews. Without explicitly stating so, it presumed that different privacy practices it observed in the marketplace all complied with data protection law. It did not seek out violations of data protection law and did not seek to remedy any perceived data protection violations through conditions on the mergers. It did not presume that robust privacy protective practices it observed from some companies in the marketplace were better, or more worthy or of higher quality than the less protective practices of others.</p><p>This respect for the differing privacy practices was particularly evident in the Commission's avoidance of the language of product quality. (204) It did not describe privacy as an aspect of product quality, but as a parameter of competition, and focused on the extent to which consumers made their choices in the marketplace on the basis of the differences in data practices of the competing companies. It acknowledged that consumer privacy preferences varied in the marketplace, that some consumers valued it highly and others did not.</p><p>In short, it validated the conception of privacy as subjective. It was guided by its assessment of the value people placed on the pro-privacy data practices of WhatsApp or Xing, not by its own evaluation of the objective quality of these data practices. It sought to determine whether the privacy practices involved were a key determinant of market demand for the product.</p><p>In neither case did the Commission simply assert or deny that privacy was a key element of competition in markets involving the merging entities, that is, that privacy preferences were strong determinants of consumer behavior in the marketplace. This is an important distinction between asserting the possibility that privacy is a key element of competition and a finding that it is or is not a key determinant of consumer decisions. (205)</p><p>Instead, the Commission based its conclusions on investigations of the specific markets relevant to each merger review, and it reached different factual conclusions in each case. The analysis in the Facebook/WhatsApp case was fuller and more detailed, assessing the differences among the key marketplace participants and dividing them into those that were important drivers of competition and those with weaker impact. The assessment in the Microsoft/Linkedln case was closer to mere assertion, with only a vague reference to an underlying market investigation and no assessment of other factors driving competition in the professional social media market.</p><p>Neither case was challenged by the parties involved, so we do not have a good idea of what level of evidence would be required by a reviewing court to sustain a challenge to an agency finding concerning privacy competition. However, the paucity of evidence in the Microsoft/Linkedln case, its surface implausibility, and its lack of fit with external business assessments of marketplace drivers suggest that the level of empirical support in the Microsoft/Linkedln case would not have been sufficient to sustain a finding of privacy as a key parameter of competition in the face of a determined challenge.</p><p>The two cases reveal the underlying empirical weakness in assessing the importance of privacy as an element of competition in merger review cases. These two merger analyses produced qualitative, hard-to-assess judgments on privacy competition that are open to speculative challenges. For instance, Stucke and Grunes speculate that privacy was an important element in the choice by Facebook users to use WhatsApp instead of Facebook Messenger. (206) That might be true. Perhaps they were worried about the extra privacy intrusion involved in one company knowing not only your social media interactions but also your messenger interactions. Or maybe they just needed the network of friends and contacts that WhatsApp had and Facebook did not. But how, other than mindreading, introspection, intuition, or speculation, can a reviewing agency make these determinations?</p><p>Also illustrating the slipperiness of the assessments involved is the Commission's attempt to show consistency between the two merger decisions despite the finding in the one case that privacy was an important parameter of competition and the finding in the other case that it was not. It raises the question of the role of external policy factors in determining the outcome of these assessments.</p><p>This lack of clarity and consistency might be thought to illustrate the inherent instability in trying to treat an intangible factor such as privacy as a non-price dimension of competition. But privacy practices are observable phenomena. It is a reasonably objective matter whether a company collects data for targeted advertising purposes or provides an opt-in choice for data collection or use.</p><p>The problem is not the intangibility of assessing a company's privacy practices. Rather, it is the difficulty of objectively assessing which factors play a crucial role in consumer purchasing decisions. To the extent that competition authorities are going to rely on assessing the relative importance of different dimensions of competition in merger reviews, they will need to develop more sophisticated empirical tools to guide their marketplace investigations. How to transform these qualitative and shifting judgments into something more empirical is a major challenge for the idea that competition policy can usefully advance privacy goals in merger reviews.</p><p>In the absence of firmer standards of evidence, the role of privacy in merger assessment might vary with shifting external policy priorities. It is worth noting that Microsoft/Linkedln was reviewed in 2016 and Facebook/WhatsApp in 2014. During the two-year interval, the importance of privacy in European public policy discussions vastly increased, as European policymakers made the final push to pass the General Data Protection Regulation. (207) Final passage took place in April 2016, very close in time to the Commission's merger review of Microsoft/Linkedln. (208) Merger review officials are not immune to these changes in policy emphasis and that might have given them a greater incentive in 2016 to focus on privacy as a dimension of competition than they did in 2014.</p><p>A final lesson from these two cases is that even when merger reviewing authorities take privacy competition into account, it might not be a major driver of the decision result or of any conditions devised. If the reviewing authority finds that there is little or no privacy competition in the markets under assessment in a merger review, privacy competition can play no further role in the review, even if there might be other reasons to block or condition the proposed merger.</p><p>The Facebook/WhatsApp merger review illustrates how privacy competition can become irrelevant to antitrust decision making in a case. The Commission observed the difference between the privacy practices of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger but found that consumers largely did not make their choice of communications apps on that basis. The merger assessment then proceeded to analyze whether the merger would substantially lessen competition in each of three markets--communications apps, social networking, and online advertising--without further addressing the effect on the relatively minor privacy competition.</p><p>But the irrelevance of privacy competition to the Commission's ultimate decision is more pronounced than that. The Commission's approval of the merger without conditions would not have been different if the Commission had found that privacy was a key parameter of competition between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. The reason is that even if privacy had been important, the presence of other competitors providing large and reliable networks and/or pro-privacy data practices, the lack of entry and switching barriers, and the limited role of network effects all meant that competition in privacy would have been preserved in the post-merger world.</p><p>In the Microsoft/Linkedln case, the Commission reached the opposite conclusion--that privacy competition was strong in the market for professional social networks. But here too, the finding was essentially irrelevant to the determination that conditions were needed to sustain competition in the market and to the crafting of appropriate conditions.</p><p>The Commission's concern in Microsoft/Linkedln had nothing to do with privacy competition. Its concern was the dominant position that Microsoft had in the marketplace for productivity software and the likelihood that, unchecked, it would use this position to pre-install and integrate its newly acquired professional software app, Linkedln, in a way that gave it an insuperable advantage over rival professional social networks. The previous vibrant competition between Linkedln and other professional social networks, in particular Xing, would be substantially diminished. The presence or absence of privacy competition was beside the point in this assessment.</p><p>Moreover, in devising the remedy, the Commission did not consider any special measures to preserve privacy protection. Various commitments voluntarily limiting Microsoft's option for pre-installation and integration were sufficient to warrant Commission approval of the merger. The remedy it imposed was unrelated to the merged entity's privacy practices.</p><p>VI. CONCLUSION</p><p>Carl Shapiro makes the fundamental point that more competition might very well be the enemy of privacy, not its friend: \"Indeed, it is not even clear that more competition would provide consumers with greater privacy, or better combat information disorder: unregulated, competition might instead trigger a race to the bottom, and many smaller firms might be harder to regulate than a few large ones.\" (209) More competition might impel companies to outdo their rivals through ever more intensive exploitation of their consumers' information. In this view of things, privacy law is needed to counteract the harmful tendency of competition to undermine privacy, and the last thing we need to improve privacy is more competition!</p><p>But suppose Shapiro is wrong, and instead suppose that competition has driven or is likely to drive companies to provide more privacy than is required by law. Imagine that consumer demand for pro-privacy data practices is strong and some companies seek, or are on the cusp of seeking, to distinguish themselves from their rivals by aiming to satisfy these preferences. In other words, assume that there is strong privacy competition, that is, competition for consumer business based on their privacy preferences. Can merger reviews under competition law realistically preserve this privacy competition?</p><p>In principle the answer is yes. If some companies responding to strong consumer demand provide or are likely to provide more privacy protection than required by current law, competition policy authorities might be able to preserve that competition-driven privacy by blocking or conditioning a merger that would threaten their continued ability to provide that extra level of privacy protection.</p><p>However, to achieve this modest result for privacy protection, antitrust authorities must overcome high legal and factual obstacles. They need to show not only that some companies are providing or are likely to provide additional levels of privacy protection, but that a significant number of consumers make their choice to patronize these companies largely on the basis of privacy protection. This in fact is the practical meaning of the oft-repeated phrase that privacy can be a key parameter of competition in the marketplace.</p><p>But this feature of marketplace competition cannot be simply assumed. Merger authorities must demonstrate the existence of privacy competition through a fact-based market investigation, where, as we have seen from the two cases examined in this Article, the standards of evidence are unclear.</p><p>Then the reviewing authority must show that this provision of additional privacy protection is not likely to endure in the post-merger world. This could happen in a variety of ways, but the reviewing authority must establish an incentive for the merged entity to reduce the level of privacy protection below that which would have been provided in the absence of the merger. This loss of privacy protection would then be a consumer harm that could be considered in assessing the merger.</p><p>Finally, and most crucially, this consumer harm must be likely to arise because of some reduction in competitive conditions in the post-merger world. It is not enough to show that the post-merger world would be one with lower privacy protections. If the reduction in privacy protection is due to a business reassessment of consumer demand or even to the whims of the new owners, it is not determinative under merger review standards, even though it is a real loss for consumers.</p><p>The consumer harm connected to a privacy loss must be traceable to a substantial lessening of competitive forces. If there would be plenty of rivals, if entry and expansion would be easy, if network effects would pose no fundamental obstacles to entry or expansion, then, especially if privacy demand is strong in the marketplace, it is hard to see why the loss of valued privacy protections would not be quickly remedied in this fully competitive marketplace. In the presence of strong consumer demand for privacy, the merged company might have an incentive to reduce privacy protection, but vibrant marketplace competition either will block them from doing so successfully or will impel existing rivals or new entrants to fill their shoes.</p><p>Finally, it is not clear how central considerations of privacy competition would be even in these cases. All the real work in merger review might be accomplished outside a consideration of privacy preferences in assessing whether an unconditioned merger will lead to a significant loss in competitive conditions and whether there are measures short of disallowance that will maintain competition. Considerations of competition in privacy might very well add weight to these considerations in that any loss of competitive conditions will also reduce privacy competition and any steps to maintain competition will also maintain privacy competition. But privacy will not be determinative of the outcome.</p><p>It should not be a surprise that such formidable legal and factual obstacles loom in front of any attempt to use privacy competition as a key element in seeking to block or condition mergers. High hurdles are present in all attempts to block or condition mergers. Under existing competition law and jurisprudence, it is hard, and it is supposed to be hard, to do this. If that is true in general, it is not less true when privacy is a major factor in marketplace competition.</p><p>Taken together, the state of the competition law and numerous practical considerations in assessing privacy competition cast a shadow over the efficacy of merger reviews as a significant legal mechanism for maintenance of privacy protections. In this Article, I have described the considerations involved in deploying merger control resources against the increased collection and use of personal information by digital platforms and other firms. The results strongly suggest that it would be better to turn to other aspects of competition law or to privacy law itself to vindicate privacy rights.

Considering data as an asset will be increasingly important in merger reviews, but it is not the same as assessing privacy competition in merger reviews. The key question in thinking of data as a key asset is whether there will be enough of it left over after the merger for rivals to compete fairly. That is different from the question of whether companies compete over privacy. Data as a competitive asset was a focal point of the FTC's merger review of the Google/DoubleClick merger.See FTC Statement, Google/Doublechck, supra note 3.

See EU Commission Decision, Facebook/WhatsApp, supra note 6; EU Commission Decision, Microsoft/Linkedln, supra note 7.

In his classic article, Richard Posner thinks of privacy and prying as intermediate goods, leading to other things that people value rather than valued for their own sake: \"We could regard them purely as consumption goods, the way economic analysis normally regards turnips or beer; and we would then speak of a 'taste' for privacy or for prying. But this would bring the economic analysis to a grinding halt because tastes are unanalyzable from an economic standpoint.\" Richard A. Posner, The Right of Privacy, 12 GA L. REV. 393, 394 (1977). Farrell also thinks of the possibility of privacy as an intermediate good, when, for example, he mentions that withholding information can protect people from adverse decisions in credit and employment. But his model focuses on the marginal case of companies who collect data for no reason related to the customization of a service or its supporting adverting. See Farrell, supra note 67.</p><p>(74.) See, e.g., SHOSHANA ZUBOFF, THE AGE OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM 52, PublicAffairs (2018) (attributing to tech companies the view, which she criticizes, that privacy is \"the price one must pay for the abundant rewards of information, connection, and other digital goods when, where, and how you want them.\").</p><p>(75.)

The extent to which this was a detailed, empirical investigation of whether privacy was an element of competition between Google and DoubleClick is unclear. It might have just been fall-out from the Commission's general conclusion that Google and DoubleClick did not compete at all: \"Because Google and DoubleClick do not presently compete in the same relevant market these two companies do not act as significant competitive restraints on one another. In practical terms, this means that the parties do not significantly affect each other's prices, nor non-price product attributes, such as consumer privacy protections or service quality.''Id. at 8, n.7.</p><p>(82.)

The competition authority conceded that the collection of data from the use of its own service is necessary for the provision of Facebook's service, despite the existence of theoretical alternatives such as user fees or non-targeted advertising support. For this reason, the FCO did not require Facebook to rely on voluntary consent as a legal basis for data collection, which might be vitiated by Facebook's dominant marketplace position. Presumably, it would accept contractual necessity as the legitimate basis for Facebook's collection and use of data on its own service. In any case, it interposed no objections to Facebook requiring, as a condition of using the Facebook service at all, that users accept virtually unlimited data collection about their activities on Facebook's own social media service.</p><p>(96.)

This raises the question why it did not prohibit combining third-party data with Facebook's own data, rather than independent consent to that linkage of data.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Stop me if you've heard this before: The chief executive of a huge tech company with vast stores of user data, and a business built on using it to target ads, now says his priority is privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  This time it was Google's <person><nameText>Sundar Pichai, </nameText></person>at the company's annual conference for developers. ''We think privacy is for everyone,'' he explained on Tuesday. ''We want to do more to stay ahead of constantly evolving user expectations.'' He reiterated the point in a New York Times Op-Ed, and highlighted the need for federal privacy rules.</p><p>  The previous week, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>delivered similar messages at Facebook's developer conference. ''The future is private,'' he said, and Facebookwill focus on more intimate communications. He shared the idea in a Washington Post op-ed just weeks before, also highlighting the need for federal privacy rules.</p><p>Googlewent further than Facebook's rough sketch of what this future looks, and unveiled tangible features: It will let users browse YouTube and GoogleMaps in ''incognito mode,'' will allow auto-deletion of Googlehistory after a specified time and will make it easier to find out what the company knows about you, among other new privacy features.</p><p>  Fatemeh Khatibloo, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, told The Times: ''These are meaningful changes when it comes to the user's expectations of privacy, but I don't think this affects their business at all.'' Googlehas to show that privacy is important, but it will still collect data.</p><p>  What Googleand Facebookare trying to do, though, is reshape the privacy narrative. You may think privacy means keeping hold of your data; they want privacy to mean they don't hand data to others. (''Googlewill never sell any personal information to third parties,'' Mr. Pichai wrote in his Op-Ed.)</p><p>  Werner Goertz, a research director at Gartner, said Googlehad to respond with its own narrative. ''It is trying to turn the conversation around and drive public discourse in a way that not only pacifies but also tries to get buy-in from consumers, to align them with its privacy strategy,'' he said.</p><p>  Politics of privacy law</p><p>Facebookand Googlemay share a voice on privacy. Lawmakers don't.</p><p>  Members of the Federal Trade Commission renewed calls at a congressional hearing on Wednesday to regulate big tech companies' stewardship of user data, my colleague Cecilia Kang reported. That was before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, on which ''lawmakers of both parties agreed'' that such a law was required, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>  Sounds promising.</p><p>  But while the F.T.C. was united in asking for more power to police violations and greater authority to impose penalties, there were large internal tensions about how far it should be able to go in punishing companies. And the lawmakers in Congress ''appeared divided over key points that legislation might address,'' according to The Journal. Democrats favor harsh penalties and want to give the F.T.C. greater power; Republicans worry that strict regulation could stifle innovation and hurt smaller companies.</p><p>  Finding compromise will be difficult, and conflicting views risk becoming noise through which a clear voice from Facebookand Googlecan cut. The longer disagreement rages, the more likely it is that Silicon Valley defines a mainstream view that could shape rules.</p><p>Uber's I.P.O. day</p><p>  The most hotly anticipated initial public offering of 2019 saw Uber trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p><p>  The company hit the markets valued at $82.4 billion, after pricing its shares at $45 a share. That was below the $100 billion that Uber had forecast to some investors, and far below the $120 billion that some bankers suggested. (It was, however, above the $76 billion that an August fund-raising round pegged it at.)</p><p>Uber's was one of the largest I.P.O.s ever, but its sliding valuation suggests that this darling disrupter has lost some of its charm. That could spell trouble for other unicorns, like Slack and WeWork, that are expected to make I.P.O.s this year.</p><p>Uber's concern now: avoiding the fate of its rival, Lyft. Lyft's shares quickly fell after its I.P.O. in March, and on Friday were 29 percent below the offering price.</p><p>  [Bonus: How today's tech I.P.O.s differ from the dot-com boom's.]</p><p>  Antitrust in the App Store</p><p>  Here's a story: Company makes smartphone. Company encourages third parties to build services for smartphone, to encourage adoption. Smartphone sells. Third parties prosper. Smartphone sales plateau. Company decides to build services.</p><p>  We're living the next chapter, and it's messy.</p><p>  In March, Spotify filed a complaint with European regulators, accusing Apple of using its App Store to squash rivals of its own services, like Apple Music. A focus: the 30 percent fee that Spotify and others pay for using the Apple's payment system for subscriptions sold via the App Store. (Other app makers have made antitrust complaints about the App Store, too.)</p><p>  Unidentified sources told The Financial Times that the European Union's competition commission would open an investigation into Spotify's complaint. That would result in a lengthy process that could result in Apple's being fined as much as 10 percent of its global turnover, or forced to change its behavior.</p><p>  If Apple is found at fault, the correct response is unclear. Pablo Ib\u00c3\u00a1\u00c3\u00b1ez Colomo, a professor at the London School of Economics who specializes in competition law, said regulators would struggle to know how far to go. Acting strictly may require the App Store to be micromanaged -- but who polices that? If a response doesn't go that far, what happens about the inevitable flood of complainants wanting their own justice?</p><p>  A can of worms is set to explode, though it comes with a long fuse.</p><p>  And some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 A Facebook founder wants it broken up. Chris Hughes, who left the company a decade ago, says it is now ''a leviathan that crowds out entrepreneurship and restricts consumer choice.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Investors don't dig climate start-ups. Venture capitalists want returns within years, and many clean-tech start-ups work to longer timelines, which means they struggle to secure funding.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Chinese spies captured the National Security Agency's weapons. They intercepted the tools from an N.S.A. attack on their own computers, ''like a gunslinger who grabs an enemy's rifle and starts blasting away,'' and then used them against ally nations.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 How will Elizabeth Holmes defend herself? The lawyers for Ms. Holmes, the former Theranos chief executive, look set to take the high-risk strategy of going after the government.</p><p>   \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Amazon had a rough week. It admitted to having been hit by an ''extensive'' fraud, got federal discrimination complaints from three Muslim workers and has been accused of violating a child privacy law.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Europe's clampdown on Big Tech is proving controversial. Critics are sounding alarms because, as I've argued, it risks limiting free expression and undercutting the ideals of an open web.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 What do you do when you get rich in San Francisco? For the millennials whom companies like Uber and Lyft have turned into millionaires, the answer is: Move somewhere with lower taxes.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Unimpressed by service at the Apple Store? So is its staff. Some of its members told Bloomberg that brand building had become more important than serving shoppers.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Don't buy a 5G phone yet. The phones are currently bigger and heavier than their 4G counterparts, and the networks won't really be worth using until 2020 or 2021.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

The Seattle-based company unveiled more than a dozen new products last week, many of which are integrated with the company's voice assistant Alexa. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Amazon employs people to listen in to conversations users have with Alexa, a revelation which was not refuted by the tech giant. The new devices on show include Echo Loop (Alexa-enabled ring to be worn on one's finger), Echo Frames (Alexa eyeglasses), and Echo Buds (Alexa earbuds). All these devices take forward Amazon's ambition to make Alexa ubiquitous, an end whose means include recording audio to train the algorithm to become more efficient. </p><p>However, with greater regulatory scrutiny on Big Tech, Dave Limp, a top Amazon executive, said that the company wants to make right the negative perception surrounding its data privacy policies. However, the promise of greater controls over what users chose to share with Alexa - an invisible presence, privy to intimate conversations in most homes - seem forced, at best. Alexa has adapted to Indian accents and has become better at understanding and servicing requests from users in the subcontinent, an achievement impossible without greater involvement of artificial intelligence and machine language tools with a feedback loop. Untitled Carousel In Amazon's defence, people seem to care little about how data collected by their smart speakers is used. The biggest validation of Amazon's policies is evidenced in the sales figures of its Echo speakers. Many customers seem to believe that the convenience afforded by Alexa is worth the privacy trade off. At the unveiling of the 2018 batch of the Echo range, not even a single mention of privacy was made in the 80-minute presentation, a testament to the company's conviction that people will, reservations notwithstanding, accept its terms of service. With regulators raining their guns on tech companies, Amazon's Dave Limp said last week that users will now be given the option to automatically delete their voice data on three-month and 18-month cycles. However, users will not be allowed to automatically delete voice data on a daily basis, with the reason being that by doing so, the voice assistant will not have the requisite data to get smarter if there were no data to fine-tune its self-learning neural network. Amazon and other tech companies in the virtual assistant game record human-machine interactions and transcribe the conversation, a practice called \"supervised learning.\" Given the extent to which Alexa has improved, it is safe to assume that Amazon staff and contract workers have been listening in on millions of hours' worth of conversation, transcribing, and annotating the text to make Alexa smarter. The company's default privacy setting assumes that users permit strangers - individuals authorized by Amazon - to access their voice recordings. The company's new feature does not come as default, and even if people opt out of sharing their data, it will be available to the company for at least three months. Amazon's next play comes in the wearable market, where its Alexa-enabled earbuds will be able to listen in on more conversations than its smart speakers. The experimental eyewear and ring are invitation-only and limited quantities will be manufactured. With a toehold in the wearables segment, Amazon will be able to glean information about user behavior, routines, and location data, which are currently the purview of software companies like Google. This is, however, the first time that Amazon has mentioned data privacy, even in passing. But if Alexa is to get smarter, Amazon will have to strike a tenuous balance between its expansionist plans and the sanctity of its customers' data.

Doyle said Noyb had not responded but instead complained that it needed French and German translations of the investigator's inquiry report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Max Schrems has complained about the DPC in the past</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-161306295</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608X-GPM1-JCBW-N536-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And the in-app mobile advertising economy\u2013ads not served across the mobile web\u2013is forecast to be worth $226 billion across the globe by 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a cloud hovers above the space because the industry\u2019s major platform providers (with regulators peering over their shoulders) are growing increasingly preoccupied with privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, Google confirmed it would retire the use of cookies for ad targeting within its market-leading Chrome web browser by 2022\u2013this followed almost a year of public speculation\u2013in a decision that mirrors that of Apple and Mozilla with their respective Safari and Firefox web browsers. All of these major platform providers cite user privacy in their rationale for taking such decisions which inhibits the ability for advertisers to both target and measure the efficacy of their online media spend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many in the space now believe that in-app mobile advertising is set for the introduction of similar restraints. Principally, experts believe that mobile advertising IDs, often referred to as MAIDs, are set to be retired by the sector\u2019s two major power brokers: Apple with its IDFA tool and Google with its Android equivalent AdID.</p><p>Last year, Apple announced the introduction of a series of updates\u00a0that inhibit app developers\u2019 (and advertisers\u2019) ability to track user iOS location, restricting any ad revenue they can generate.</p><p>The iPhone maker claimed it was \u201cshutting the door on abuse\u201d and last week, Google appeared to echo these sentiments with the announcement of planned policy updates to its Play store.</p><p>\u201cLater this year, we will be updating Google Play policy to require that developers get approval if they want to access location data in the background,\u201d Krish Vitaldevara, director of product management trust &amp; safety, Google Play, wrote in a blog post.</p><p>As a result, starting in August, app developers will have to have any background location-tracking features approved by the Google Play team when they are submitting new apps to the outlet.</p><p>Law firm Hopkins Carley notes how these requests appear to line up with the California Consumer Privacy Act, which requires a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d notice for data collection on mobile devices.</p><p>\u201cBusinesses and application developers that aggressively aim to collect additional data through broad permission requests will now need to disclose what categories of information are being collected, and thus may want to evaluate whether such aggressive collection is worth potentially alienating users,\u201d reads an advisory note from partners at the firm.</p><p>Given the industry\u2019s preoccupation with privacy (and the mood music trumpeting from the industry\u2019s major players) there is now rampant debate as to whether or not Apple and Google will revoke their respective MAIDs, which some claim are more persistent identifiers than cookies.</p><p>The notion appears to be validated, as Facebook, a company that relies considerably on mobile app advertising, quietly updated its terms and conditions to state that it will no longer pass device IDs back to marketers.</p><p>One source, who requested anonymity given his/her organization\u2019s ongoing negotiations with such platforms, told Adweek that Apple considered withdrawing IDFA last year, but execs opted to watch which privacy measures Google would introduce first.</p><p>Paul Gubbins, an ad tech consultant who specializes in mobile, explained to Adweek the potential impact such a move (from both Apple and Google) could have for both app developers and advertisers.</p><p>\u201cAs an app developer, you\u2019re fundamentally reliant on that device ID,\u201d he said, adding that the app ecosystem relies on a host of third parties such as mobile attribution providers.</p><p>A separate source from an app developer that is highly reliant on programmatic demand who requested anonymity due to his/her employer\u2019s communication policy, predicted that both Apple and Google will pull support for MAIDs within the same timeframe as the Chrome browser pulling support for cookies.</p><p>The source informed Adweek their organization has forecast that such a scenario could result in a 60% reduction in revenue.</p><p>And while programmatic demand can be substituted with direct sales, such a measure will lead to an increase in costs, plus put paid to their earlier efforts.</p><p>However, some believe the power brokers of the mobile app ecosystem will offer ad-supported players an olive branch. After all, hamstringing a multi-billion dollar industry is unlikely to paint such players in a favorable light with regulators that increasingly have Big Tech in their crosshairs.</p><p>Matt Barash, svp of business strategy and business development at mobile advertising outfit AdColony, explained to Adweek his theory that the mobile app ecosystem won\u2019t necessarily follow the cookie-based web ecosystem.</p><p>\u201cMost developers rely on the ad-supported model and for Apple to totally upend the existing identity framework would be massively disruptive, potentially catastrophic, to their businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may morph and change to respect user privacy concerns and privacy legislation, but MAIDs aren\u2019t cookies and we shouldn\u2019t assume their fates are intertwined.\u201d</p><p>Separately, Charles Manning, founder and CEO of mobile attribution provider Kochava, detailed how his company has constructed \u201can identity model that is flexible,\u201d an approach necessary after Apple began continually depreciating the data that can be extracted from MAIDs since the early 2010s.</p><p>\u201cAnd so, we have constantly been in a place of we cannot rely on a singular ID,\u201d he added.</p><p>The attribution provider works with developers to place software, dubbed IdentityLink, on their in-app ads that helps provide performance analytics.\u00a0Kochava is possible as Kochava drops a first-party cookie after an app user has clicked on an ad, this happens via a mobile redirect.</p><p>From here, the company is then able to construct a cross-screen identity graph that app developers and marketers can use to measure advertising performance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve really taken an abstracted view of identity separate from a cookie and separate from an AdID or an IDFA,\u201d Manning added.</p><p>When asked about the ability to perform these kinds of analytics should MAIDs be retired, Manning cited the 2018 introduction of SKAdNetwork by Apple\u2013a company that notoriously plays its cards close to its chest\u2013as the potential genesis of an in-app advertising ecosystem post-IDFA.</p><p>Apple has not communicated much with the app ecosystem since SKAdNetwork documents were first made public, but there is a hypothesis that centers upon the potential for it effectively using it as a registry for approved app monetization partners.</p><p>In such a scenario, Apple would require monetization partners, such as analytics providers or ad servers, to sign up with SKAdNetwork to gain approval for their privacy measures; otherwise, an app developer\u2019s submission to the App Store will be rejected.</p><p>Manning further hypothesized Apple\u2019s approach to in-app advertising will be similar to how it requires app developers to send push notifications. Its current policies require third parties wanting to send push notifications to app users to do so via Apple.</p><p>\u201cIf SKAdNetwork is what I read it to be it would treat ad delivery similar to push notifications where they control that whole closed-loop,\u201d Manning added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Robert Webster, cofounder of consultancy Canton Marketing Solutions, explained his expectation that Google\u2019s efforts to maintain an ad-supported ecosystem post the (expected) removal of AdID will involve its Privacy Sandbox\u2013an initiative to explore data-led marketing with less PII.</p><p>\u201cThis may mean MAIDs survive another 18 months, Apple will likely follow suit, I expect an announcement on the end of MAIDs before the summer from Google or Apple,\u201d he concluded.</p><p>With so much resting on the decisions made by just two companies, the entire ecosystem is holding its breath, with advertisers and developers making what provisions they can given the scant amount of detail currently on offer.</p><p>However, what is certain is that key dates to mark the calendar will be\u00a0Google I/O\u00a0in May and Apple WWDC in June, conferences where the two power brokers typically make some seismic announcements.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1127341</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9K-KT51-DYRK-H3PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1368\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cozy with big tech.</p><p>\"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech companies are generally calling for more regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC.</p><p>\"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter, which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote in an email.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote.</p><p>\"In the government's proposal under the Digital Charter, a further step would be added, in the form of a review by the Attorney General.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cosy with big tech.</p><p>\"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech companies are generally calling for more regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC.</p><p>\"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter, which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote in an email.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote.</p><p>\"In the government's proposal under the Digital Charter, a further step would be added, in the form of a review by the Attorney General.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.
