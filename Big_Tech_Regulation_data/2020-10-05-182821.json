California is the biggest state, Texas is second.</p><p>And California is the dream for many Americans. Those beautiful beaches, movie stars, great weather. Its population grew at more than double the national average -- until 1990.</p><p>Then, something changed. Last decade, two million more Americans moved out of California than moved in. Many moved to other states like Texas. In the last decade, Texas' pola -- population grew at double the national rate.</p><p>And one of those new Texans is Chuck DeVore. He used to be a California politician. Now he's the author of \"The Texas Model,\" which argues that Texas governs better.</p><p>Matt Welch of \"Reason\" magazine also moved from California, but his magazine is still based there.</p><p>So why is that?</p><p>If you're getting out...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>STOSSEL: -- if California is so bad, why is \"Reason\" magazine, my favorite magazine, in this horrible state?</p><p>MATT WELCH, REASON MAGAZINE: Well, that's, uh, where we've been since 1971 and it informs thinking that gets us a little bit outside of the kind of Beltway Acela, uh, track of thinking.</p><p>But it's a -- it's a challenge to be there. Businesses, anyone, to stay in California these days. And you're exactly right to point out, it's a new thing in California. We no longer attract immigrants.</p><p>STOSSEL: But, Chuck, there's still something thriving. There's the - - the tech industry, the movie industry. Stuff is happening in...</p><p>CHUCK DEVORE, FORMER CALIFORNIA POLITICIAN, AUTHOR OF \"THE TEXAS MODEL\": Absolutely. California does have a lot of assets. It has Silicon Valley. It does have Hollywood. It has the biotech industry.</p><p>The problem is that you can't live off of those narrow bands of industry forever. And what's happening is that because of high taxes, big regulations, uh, unhealthy lawsuit climate and a lot of government spending, people are leaving the state.</p><p>STOSSEL: It started in the '90s. Gray Davis said we've got all this cash from the dot-com boom and they -- well, tell me what happened.</p><p>WELCH: Well, first of all, he spent the dot-com cash on public sector pension promises and just general spending to everybody.</p><p>Even in the last five years of so-called austerity, spending has continued to go up.</p><p>STOSSEL: Up beyond inflation and population growth?</p><p>WELCH: Yes.</p><p>STOSSEL: A new thing, global warming measures ...</p><p>WELCH: For high speed rail projects that no one needs, no one wants, yet will cost $68 billion.</p><p>STOSSEL: And even Arnold, the Republican, the Terminator, I thought - - really, I fell in love, at one point. I thought here's a politician quoting Milton Friedman. This is a guy who gets it. He'll make it better.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>DEVORE: Well, what happened was, he helped enact the largest tax increase in U.S. history at the state level in 2009. It was so bad that I resigned as chief Republican whip in the state assembly in protest of the tax increase.</p><p>STOSSEL: And he also supported government funds to fund stem cell research. I -- I talked to the guy pushing this once. He was a rich businessman. He -- I said you billionaires could pay for this by yourselves, why is this a government job?</p><p>WELCH: It was only a government job because people wanted to stick -- Democrats wanted to stick a thumb in the eye of George W. Bush, which is the same -- their global warming emissions standard. This is an expensive way to say we are not Republicans, we are Californians.</p><p>DEVORE: On borrowed money.</p><p>STOSSEL: And -- and three, a couple of years later, I read in the papers, oh, this organization has to be revamped. We suspect self-dealing, a conflict of interest. All this money is wasted.</p><p>And yet now I read, I balanced the budget, says the governor.</p><p>WELCH: Yes, well, they just passed by a ballot initiative, one of the largest, uh, tax increases in the history...</p><p>STOSSEL: Tax the rich.</p><p>WELCH: They've increased taxes by $50 billion. So, yes, suddenly, it's going to look a lot more balanced there.</p><p>But they're also lying. I mean they're talking about a -- revenue projections that will not come true. It's an annual tradition in California, your budget looks balanced in January when you propose it. And then when the revenues actually start coming in, you say, oh, there's a shortfall.</p><p>And that shortfall could be $8 billion. It has been as high as $30 billion in recent years. We'll see that happen again.</p><p>STOSSEL: All right, Chuck, you've moved to Texas. You say this couldn't be a more interesting lab experiment.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>DEVORE: Well, because the states are so similar, right? You have the -- the biggest state and the second biggest state in population, the second and third biggest state in land mass. They're both demographically very diverse, more similar than different. They both are blessed with quite a few natural resources and a coastline with ports.</p><p>And so with everything so similar on the surface, what you have to look at then is why are the results so different. And, of course, the results are different because they're governed differently.</p><p>Government, at the state and local level, consumes about a third more of the economy in California than it does in Texas. And that -- with that extra government, you have things like one third of the nation's welfare recipients are in California, even though they only have one eighth of the population.</p><p>You have more regulations, more taxes, everything.</p><p>STOSSEL: We're -- we have a graph of the -- the welfare recipients, the percentage of households receiving public assistance, much higher in California than the U.S. average and lower than average in Texas.</p><p>DEVORE: Absolutely. And that...</p><p>STOSSEL: But that just means you're starving poor people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DEVORE: Well, not so. The cost of living in Texas is 42 percent less than the cost of living in California. And in point of fact, the U.S. Census Bureau has been criticized by Congress for 20 years for not taking into account cost of living, the fact that different states have different costs of living when it comes to housing and food and clothing.</p><p>STOSSEL: And that's relevant when you look at the poverty rate. There -- there was an old poverty rate measure, where Texas lost to California; 16 percent of the people in, uh, California, were in poverty; 17 percent in Texas. But now there's a new measure...</p><p>DEVORE: Yes.</p><p>STOSSEL: -- that includes the cost of living.</p><p>DEVORE: It does include the cost of living and it also includes some government benefits. And with this new measure that came out just one week after the election, what you see is the state with the highest poverty rate in the nation is California, higher even than the District of Columbia.</p><p>And -- and that should really be a warning or a caution to progressives who maintain that this big government model is really the path to prosperity.</p><p>We argue that it's entirely the opposite, that, in fact, Texas is a model for how America could be better run and there could be more prosperity by having less government.</p><p>STOSSEL: There's been more job growth in Texas. Texas gained, in the past 10 years, more than a million jobs. California lost about half a million jobs.</p><p>But Paul Krugman says, in the \"New York Times,\" \"What's this Texas miracle?\" this was when Governor Perry was running for president. \"There's no -- it's an un-miracle. The Texas unemployment rate was 8.2 percent.\"</p><p>DEVORE: ... 8.2 percent isn't great, but California, at the time, was 11.8 percent.</p><p>WELCH: California has had over 10 percent unemployment every month of Barack Obama's presidency until basically last November.</p><p>STOSSEL: And it's still 3 percent higher than Texas.</p><p>WELCH: Yes. And it's -- it's been higher, it's -- in California than the national average every month since 1990.</p><p>STOSSEL: Now, regulation. You're freer in Texas?</p><p>DEVORE: Oh, it's a huge difference. In fact, it was so bad in California that the Democrats allowed this law to be passed that sought to find the cost of regulations on small business.</p><p>And when it came out, Governor Schwarzenegger was so embarrassed, he didn't want it to come out.</p><p>Finally, we pressured for it to come out. The cost on the average business in California for regulatory compliance is $133,000 per year.</p><p>WELCH: The legislature passes, on average, around 900 bills a year, laws. Here you go, governor. Nine -- three a day, or even four a day, when they're in session.</p><p>The Texas legislature is it's -- it's in session every two years, is that right?</p><p>DEVORE: Every two years for 130, 140 days.</p><p>WELCH: Right. They just don't have enough time. And the kind of laws that they're passing in California, they're saying you can't, as a parent, hire a psychiatrist to try to make your kid not gay. I mean it's that level of crazy specificity. We're going to increase ...</p><p>STOSSEL: (INAUDIBLE) - But stay on that one for a moment, because I've covered these gay cure psychiatrists. And I think it's nonsense.</p><p>WELCH: Sure.</p><p>STOSSEL: But it should be your right to pursue something that...</p><p>WELCH: It should be your right.</p><p>STOSSEL: -- we disagree with.</p><p>WELCH: And it shouldn't be the right of the legislature to tell you what kind of things you need to do. And -- and let's increasing the -- the penalties, the fines, for throwing citrus onto a minor league baseball field, seriously, that was a law passed a couple of years ago.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WELCH: This is the level of the -- of the way the legislature is there...</p><p>DEVORE: I didn't vote for it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>STOSSEL: And if you're one of these big tech companies, Facebook or Google, you could navigate these regulations.</p><p>DEVORE: Well, you hire attorneys. You hire, uh, tax experts. You hire compliance experts that help navigate through this bureaucratic maze.</p><p>A good example is if you want to build a strip mall. It takes -- just to get permission to break ground and start construction, it takes four to five months, on average, in Texas. It takes four to five years, on average, in California.</p><p>And that's one of the things that helps drive up the cost of housing and business complexes and factories in California.</p><p>STOSSEL: All right, this is obvious to me, looking from the outside. One works, the other doesn't work as well for its people.</p><p>But the politicians are unfazed.</p><p>What's that about?</p><p>WELCH: Well, part of it is that you have a great home field advantage in California, which is that it's an awful nice place to live, especially along the coast. It's -- it's especially nice if you work in one of the highlight industries.</p><p>And then everywhere else in the hinterlands, there's a lot of desperation, poverty and population just leaking and running away.</p><p>And so that part on the coast can generate incredible wealth, dynamism. It's fun as hell to work in those industries, right?</p><p>But the rest of the state is having a much harder time.</p><p>STOSSEL: And they don't have the political clout.</p><p>DEVORE: Well, there -- there's another issue, as well, that comes into play in California, in that California is not a right to work state. They have very powerful unions, especially government unions.</p><p>They're -- there's no counterpart to that in Texas. People are free to have their associations and the unions aren't there to spend millions and millions of dollars to promote bigger government and higher taxes.</p><p>STOSSEL: Hence, more prosperity in Texas.</p><p>Thank you, Matt and Chuck.</p><p>Coming up, want a free car?</p><p>We'll tell you how absurd government benefits get.</p><p>But next, gun control in Texas versus California.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Of course he had a gun. This is Texas. Everybody has a gun. My florist has a gun.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOSSEL: That scene from the movie \"Miss Congeniality\" has truth to it.</p><p>Want to buy a gun in Texas?</p><p>It's easy. No Texas restrictions, just a federal background check. In three days, you can get a gun.</p><p>California has lots of restrictions, like waiting periods, an assault weapons ban. After the recent school shooting in Connecticut, California politicians proposed more rules. They want to make hundreds of thousands of previously legal guns illegal. And their owners would have to give them to the government.</p><p>By contrast, in Texas, some politicians want to make it easier for teachers to carry guns in school.</p><p>What a terrible idea, says California State Senator, Leland Yee.</p><p>He joins us from San Francisco.</p><p>Welcome.</p><p>Also, from...</p><p>LELAND YEE, CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR: Thank you for having me, John.</p><p>STOSSEL: Thank you.</p><p>From Texas, Suzanna Hopp, who likes the idea of teachers packing heat.</p><p>So, Suzanna, why?</p><p>SUZANNA HOPP \"FROM LUBY'S TO THE LEGISLATURE. ONE WOMAN'S FIGHT AGAINST GUN CONTROL\": I guess you could probably say because of my background. I know what it's like to be in a defenseless situation with a crazed shooter that's just there to execute people.</p><p>Look, lawyers can protect themselves on the job. Teachers or -- or -- or chiropractors can protect themselves on the jobs.</p><p>Why can't our teachers protect themselves on the job?</p><p>STOSSEL: And...</p><p>HOPP: They're being treated like second class citizens.</p><p>STOSSEL: And -- and let's review your background about this. Years ago, you were in a Luby's restaurant when a gunman came in and killed your mom and dad. And that made you want...</p><p>HOPP: Well, he killed 23 people. That was the first real mass shooting in this country, uh, back in 1991. And...</p><p>STOSSEL: That would...</p><p>HOPP: Yes, he was...</p><p>STOSSEL: -- that would make a lot of people say I want tougher gun laws. But you say the opposite. And you've written the book, \"From Luby's to the Legislature: One Woman's Fight Against Gun Control.\"</p><p>HOPP: Yes, sir.</p><p>STOSSEL: So explain your reasoning.</p><p>HOPP: At that time, in the state of Texas, you couldn't get a concealed carry permit. They didn't exist.</p><p>So I began leaving my gun in my car very dutifully. And, um, my parents and I were having lunch. A madman drove his truck through the window and began executing people.</p><p>And I've got to tell you, I -- I can't begin to tell you what it's like to be like a fish in a barrel waiting for it to be your turn.</p><p>The only thing that the gun laws did was prevent me and some others in that restaurant from being able to protect ourselves and our families.</p><p>STOSSEL: So, Mr. Yee, I assume you strongly disagree with this. Make your case.</p><p>YEE: -- I used to work - I used to work in the schools as a psychologist. And I will tell you, I don't know of any teacher or administrator that wants to carry a gun into a classroom into a school. You know, if you start doing that with schools, then why not look at supermarkets?</p><p>Why don't we look at hospitals, where there's...</p><p>STOSSEL: Fine.</p><p>YEE: -- where there's been some gun plays there.</p><p>STOSSEL: Fine.</p><p>YEE: We...</p><p>STOSSEL: Let them all have guns.</p><p>YEE: But that's not the way -- that's not the way in which we want to operate in our society \\here in California. We're -- we're about educating kids, we're not about telling kids to go and pack guns and shoot 'em up if someone comes, you know, into your schools.</p><p>STOSSEL: Suzanna?</p><p>HOPP: Wow! We're not talking about the children being able to carry weapons. We're talking about the people that can already carry weapons in the supermarkets, as he said. All we're talking about...</p><p>YEE: But, but, but...</p><p>HOPP: -- doing is allowing...</p><p>YEE: -- but what is the lesson...</p><p>HOPP: -- them to carry in a school.</p><p>YEE: -- that we adults are saying to kids, that when you are a child and you grow up, to solve your problem, carry a gun. And that is not the life lesson we ought to be teaching...</p><p>HOPP: Oh.</p><p>YEE: -- children.</p><p>HOPP: Oh, heaven's -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOSSEL: That's what the...</p><p>YEE: It's this society...</p><p>STOSSEL: -- that's what the police do.</p><p>HOPP: Look, that...</p><p>YEE: -- that we have is too violent already.</p><p>STOSSEL: The police carry guns...</p><p>HOPP: A gun is not a guarantee...</p><p>YEE: And -- and that's fine.</p><p>HOPP: A gun...</p><p>YEE: Police ought to carry a gun. They are there to protect the people of California.</p><p>STOSSEL: California has all these gun restrictions, but there are more murders in California per capita than Texas. The -- the gun laws don't work.</p><p>YEE: No, no, that's absolutely not true. You know, studies upon studies have demonstrated that the states that have jurisdictions that have, uh, the toughest gun laws are the ones that are the safest per capita.</p><p>STOSSEL: That's -- that's nonsense.</p><p>YEE: I mean that's just...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOSSEL: That's absurd.</p><p>HOPP: That is not true. That is absolutely wrong.</p><p>STOSSEL: Chicago, Washington, DC, look at -- look at California cities like Oakland.</p><p>YEE: All -- all I'm saying is per capita. When -- when you look at the per capita data that it is absolutely true that jurisdictions with the toughest gun control are, in fact, the safest. I -- I mean the reality...</p><p>HOPP: No.</p><p>YEE: -- in California...</p><p>HOPP: That is absolutely false.</p><p>STOSSEL: Oakland has the sixth highest murder rate...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOPP: Mr. Yee, can I interject something?</p><p>STOSSEL: -- murder rate in the nation. Stockton, the 11th highest murder rate ...</p><p>HOPP: Mr. Yee, can I ...</p><p>STOSSEL: Hang on, Suzanne. I just want to...</p><p>HOPP: OK.</p><p>STOSSEL: -- contradict what seems to be going against the fact here.</p><p>How do you explain Stockton, per capita, and Oakland, the highest murder rate -- among the highest murder rates in the nation?</p><p>YEE: No, what -- what -- you know, what I'm saying is that if you look at the entire state, if you look at the entire jurisdiction, that's what we're talking about. You -- you can't look at, you know, specific, you know, individual cities and so on, because that, of course, is -- is...</p><p>STOSSEL: Well, I think this is the data...</p><p>YEE: -- it's going to give you a lot bit of bias.</p><p>STOSSEL: -- from the whole state, but...</p><p>YEE: But if you look across...</p><p>STOSSEL: Suzanna?</p><p>HOPP: I'd like to ask Mr. Yee a question. Mr. Yee, can you name one single place in the United States where one of these mass shootings has occurred where guns were allowed?</p><p>Because if guns are the problem, why haven't we seen these mass shootings at the dreaded gun show that you all are trying to make illegal or NRA conventions?</p><p>YEE: Look, look, you know, Olympia...</p><p>HOPP: If guns are the problem...</p><p>YEE: -- you know, let me show you ...</p><p>HOPP: -- you're talking about the places...</p><p>YEE: In...</p><p>HOPP: -- where there are thousands of guns in the hands of -- of law- abiding citizens, yet we only see...</p><p>YEE: In -- in -- in the...</p><p>HOPP: -- these mass shootings at places...</p><p>YEE: -- in the Columbine shooting...</p><p>HOPP: -- where guns are not allowed.</p><p>YEE: -- there were armed guards there. And that did not stop those young individuals from coming into Columbine and shooting and slaughtering individuals.</p><p>HOPP: What -- what did stop it?</p><p>YEE: That's all I'm saying, that -- that...</p><p>HOPP: What did stop it?</p><p>YEE: -- just having a gun is not going to stop all these other individuals, uh, coming into a school, coming into a playground...</p><p>HOPP: I'll tell you what...</p><p>YEE: -- and shooting our children.</p><p>HOPP: -- it will stop.</p><p>YEE: We've got to look at...</p><p>HOPP: It absolutely will stop them.</p><p>YEE: -- other ways of dealing with...</p><p>HOPP: And, in fact...</p><p>YEE: -- this particular problem.</p><p>HOPP: -- in Texas -- in Texas, we already have several schools where the administrators, you mentioned earlier that no teachers and no administrators would want to carry.</p><p>On the contrary, we have several teachers and administrators that already do carry in some school districts.</p><p>YEE: Well, you know, I think...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOSSEL: The law in Texas allows the district to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOSSEL: -- make its own decisions.</p><p>HOPP: They don't have law enforcement...</p><p>YEE: You're always going to find one...</p><p>HOPP: -- handy.</p><p>YEE: -- or two administrators here and there. But overall, when you ask the question, teachers, do you want to pack guns going into your classroom, the answer, resoundingly, is no. No teacher goes to...</p><p>STOSSEL: Well, then, you know...</p><p>YEE: -- uh, to college to be a teacher...</p><p>STOSSEL: -- politicians don't have to get involved.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YEE: -- to say I'm going to be carrying a gun.</p><p>STOSSEL: If the teacher doesn't want to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOSSEL: Nobody is forcing teachers to carry a gun. Why do you politicians have to get involved...</p><p>HOPP: That's right.</p><p>STOSSEL: -- and say the teacher who wants to, thinks it makes her safer, she may not?</p><p>HOPP: Yes.</p><p>YEE: No. If you happen to be a teacher, and you go and purchase a gun and you want to go through the background checks and so on, ultimately you're going to have a gun.</p><p>STOSSEL: You can have it in a school in California? It's OK with you?</p><p>YEE: No. Absolutely not. You're not going to carry a gun in the school. We don't allow students to carry guns. Why are we going to let teachers carry guns? (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOPP: You're making it a killing zone. Mr. Yee, you're making them killing zones.</p><p>YEE: No, schools are a gun-free zone. We're not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOPP: Yes, and that's exactly where bad guys, where they want to rack up a big body bag count is the gun-free zone. That's where they rack up big body bag counts. That's where they go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOSSEL: We're not going to solve this in this show. Thank you both. I have to stop you, Suzanna Hopp, Leland Yee.</p><p>Coming up, what happens when your town goes bankrupt. And what else can we learn comparing Texas and California?</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING, \"HOTEL CALIFORNIA\")</p><p>STOSSEL: But people do leave Hotel California these days because they can't pay the bills. Four California cities have now declared bankruptcy, Stockton the biggest and San Bernardino. The result isn't pretty.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The community's slowly breaking down to nothing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) empty, lots that are empty, parking lots that are empty.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, people are suffering and people are going through, you know, and there's no opportunity, there's nothing. It's like a ghost town here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOSSEL: Three-fourths of the city's money went to what they call public safety. That means unionized cops and firemen. Politicians promised them much more money than the town had. So do the people in San Bernardino realize that's the reason the town went belly up? No.</p><p>This show's special correspondent, Kennedy, went there to ask and heard that even bankruptcy, people like cops and firefighters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we were not the ones that (INAUDIBLE) the problem.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Firefighters are heroes, cops are heroes. So who's to say what's too much and what's not?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't blame anyone in particular. It's just a matter of things that happened over the course of years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOSSEL: This next man is in the prison guards' union. California prison guards make $66,000 a year before benefits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The people of California, we gave them so much, you know, and we're not getting anything back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because we give it all to the unions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, we don't.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, yes. We absolutely do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pay union dues. No, we don't.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, you pay the union dues; we pay for your pensions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, of course.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOSSEL: Of course. And the pensions make that $66,000 pay close to $100,000. They're big in California.</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, yes, and the firefighters in San Bernardino, their salary has doubled. And now they make $150,000 a year.</p><p>STOSSEL: But people weren't upset at them.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I would say ignorance is bliss. But no one there seemed very happy. So maybe that adage doesn't hold true for San Bernardino.</p><p>STOSSEL: Well, Kennedy thought the mayor's office would be a place to go to learn more about what caused the bankruptcy. So she tried that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: That's San Bernardino City Hall. It's a really nice building, and it looks really expensive, which might be part of the problem. Let's go get some answers.</p><p>There must be people in there working seven days a week to solve these problems.</p><p>Mayor's office, 6.</p><p>I walk down an empty hallway looking for the mayor -- looking for anyone. I felt like I was in a horror movie. It was creepy.</p><p>Is anyone here?</p><p>Hello?</p><p>So I found an empty conference room and decided I would take over as mayor.</p><p>All right, everyone, thanks for coming. It's really great to have you here. I'm the acting mayor.</p><p>There's not a lot happening. Does anyone have anything that I should be looking at on the rundown, the agenda, show of hands? All right. Not all at once. It's a busy day, San Bernardino. We have a lot of problems, lot of people out of work, lot of businesses with shuttered doors. And I don't hear any answers from any of you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOSSEL: All right. They were supposed to be in the office that day.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, the mayor's office is supposed to be fully stocked on Fridays. There are other agencies that take Friday furloughs.</p><p>STOSSEL: The city's less safe, the city attorney told residents, go home, lock your doors and load your guns.</p><p>KENNEDY: By the way, he was there and he would not talk to us.</p><p>STOSSEL: One union blamed the mayor and former city manager that -- for spending money on a downtown movie theater.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, the movie theater is nice, but it's nothing compared to the $45.8 million deficit that the City of San Bernardino is running. And by the way, when they filed for bankruptcy, they had $150,000 in the city bank account.</p><p>STOSSEL: San Bernardino politicians said we didn't see it coming. How could they -- they owed $46 million. They had $100,000 in the bank.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. And they have payments that they're required to pay into CalPERS, $1.8 million a month. And they didn't see that coming, with $150K in the bank.</p><p>STOSSEL: And San Bernardino tried to raise money through fees, like expensive parking tickets, traffic tickets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at all the money we just paid, more than $400-$500 on a -- just a speeding ticket. And they're going bankrupt?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: What he didn't tell you is he was going 90 in a school zone.</p><p>STOSSEL: So he should pay. But it's not going to cover all these pension obligations.</p><p>KENNEDY: Nothing's going to cover these pensions obligations, not in San Bernardino, not in Stockton, not in Vallejo, not in Compton, not in any of these other cities in California that are simply failing.</p><p>STOSSEL: Finding a silver lining, I hear that there's more civil society perking up. Volunteers are doing park maintenance, working at the animal shelter, replacing broken street lights. Neighborhood Watch associations are starting to blossom to police neighborhoods. That's good.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, and they want their city back. So they're taking it themselves. And it just goes to show the private solution is always better.</p><p>STOSSEL: And it's what they're going to have to go when the government has spent all the money.</p><p>Thank you, Kennedy.</p><p>Next, we take this same problem that bankrupted San Bernardino and see what it does to the whole state. It's not pretty.</p><p>STOSSEL: California is paradise for government workers. Per person, Texas actually has more of them. But California pays better and gives out such generous retirement benefits that California will probably go broke.</p><p>Some 50-year-old retirees were promised they can collect forever, well, until they die, but actually after that too, because their spouse may collect after they die. And the money just isn't there.</p><p>Dan Mitchell studies state pension problems nationally for the CATO Institute. Kevin James is running to be mayor of Los Angeles. So before we get to what Kevin discovered in Los Angeles, how bad is this? These people want to be responsible, I would think.</p><p>DAN MITCHELL, CATO INSTITUTE: I'm not sure they want to be responsible. I think the politicians want to get reelected and the state government workers want to get as much as they can before the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.</p><p>The problem is, is California is Greece, the Greece of America. There are too many people riding in the wagon, not enough people pulling the wagon. Now they've raised taxes. So you're going to see the productive people leaving the state and more and more people living off the government, voting for more government.</p><p>But sooner or later, nobody is there to pay the bills.</p><p>STOSSEL: All right. They pay the workers more in California, but California has a higher cost of living.</p><p>MITCHELL: It does, but even with all that, that doesn't justify the difference between, say, $50,000 average wage salary versus $70,000 in California. California is pricing itself out of the market.</p><p>STOSSEL: Plus the benefits, which go into this fund, called CalPERS, and they assumed for years an 8 percent rate of return. Oh, we're going to make so much money. Now they've just lowered it from 7.75 percent to 7.5 percent, like that's responsible.</p><p>Where do they get off thinking that they can make that rate of return? Why is that acceptable?</p><p>MITCHELL: I'm going to assume tonight I'm going to party with Victoria's Secret supermodels. I don't think it's going to happen, though. And likewise, I don't think that CalPERS is going to meet those targets that it set.</p><p>And if they don't meet those targets, it means they're an unfunded liability, which is huge already, will become enormous. And they simply won't be able to pay it in the same way that Greece hasn't been able to pay its bills.</p><p>STOSSEL: All right. And, Kevin, let's talk about Los Angeles. You're running for mayor, so we won't go into your campaign specifically. But one thing you told me that astounded me is that the Los Angeles City council-members are paid $178,000 per year?</p><p>KEVIN JAMES (R), LOS ANGELES MAYORIAL CANDIDATE: They are the highest paid legislative body in the nation, John. You know, we just had a councilwoman that -- Janice Hahn went to Congress, the House of Representatives, and she has to take a cut in pay. They make more money that United States senators for a Los Angeles City Council.</p><p>STOSSEL: Los Angeles, each councilman is given a car?</p><p>JAMES: Well, each councilman, I'll tell you something else that really gets Angelenos, they get a car that has a license plate that says \"exempt.\" So they can park in meters and they don't get tickets.</p><p>And in Los Angeles, our parking tickets are through the roof.</p><p>And just as you were talking about in the last segment with all of these fines and fees that they keep wanting to take from people that come to Los Angeles, it's not good for business. It chases customers away from our city and from our local businesses into neighboring communities, where they don't get abused by city hall.</p><p>STOSSEL: One hundred seventy eight thousand dollars per year in Los Angeles versus in Dallas $37,000, San Antonio $1,400.</p><p>JAMES: Well, those are part-time -- those are part-time city councils. In Los Angeles...</p><p>STOSSEL: But they seem to get it done.</p><p>JAMES: ... they're a full-time council.</p><p>STOSSEL: It's not like Los Angeles is...</p><p>JAMES: Who gets -- of course they do.</p><p>STOSSEL: ... is so well-governed.</p><p>Dan, put this in perspective nationally. Is it a mindset in California that says politicians just work magic and need to be compensated?</p><p>MITCHELL: I think what happened is during the boom years in California, for decades after World War II, people were just pouring into the state. There was a lot of opportunity, great climate.</p><p>And, sure, government can charge a little bit more to get the great climate in California. But at some point you hit the tipping level, where all of a sudden it's just too expensive to create jobs. It's too expensive to finance a bloated workforce. It's too expensive to maintain all of these pensions.</p><p>But by the time you've reached that level, if more than 50 percent of the voters in your state are somehow riding on the wagon, are either government welfare beneficiaries, government workers, or the retired living off government, how do you ever change?</p><p>And that's what makes me so pessimistic. A beautiful state that I think is being ruined by big government.</p><p>STOSSEL: Thank you, Dan Mitchell, and Kevin James.</p><p>So far tonight in the battle between Texas and California, Texas is winning. But when we return, a reason Texans should prefer California.</p><p>STOSSEL: Texas is less likely to go broke than California. And they have fewer stupid rules, probably. They do have less total regulation. But Texas has plenty of control-freak politicians. And as a result, your property may be safer in California than Texas, so says Scott Bullock from the Institute for Justice.</p><p>So why is your property not as safe in Texas?</p><p>SCOTT BULLOCK, INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE: Well, Texas has some bad laws with regards to private property rights. Civil forfeiture laws are very aggressive and very potent in Texas, where the government can take your property, even if you have not been convicted or even arrested for a crime. And then the burden is on the property owner to try to get their property back.</p><p>STOSSEL: All right. Explain civil forfeiture more. The Institute for Justice, your group, made this video about it. So if police arrest you, prosecutors must prove that you are guilty before they can put you in jail.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But if police suspect your car was involved in a crime, they can take it, sell it, and in most places pocket the proceeds to pad their budgets. With civil forfeiture, your property is guilty until you prove it innocent to get it back.</p><p>And because most state and federal laws allow police and prosecutors to pocket the proceeds, they have a big incentive to pursue profits, not justice. How big? In 1986, the Justice Department's forfeiture fund took in $94 million. Now it has more than a billion.</p><p>Citizens are seeing cash, cars, and other property taken away for the flimsiest of reasons. Carrying too much cash? Police can accuse you of selling drugs or laundering money and seize it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOSSEL: Come on, just because you have a lot of cash in the car, they can take your car?</p><p>BULLOCK: Yes.</p><p>STOSSEL: And the cash?</p><p>BULLOCK: They can take the car and the cash, and accuse you of either being a drug dealer or laundering money, even if there are no drugs in the car or they have no other reason to suspect you of wrongdoing.</p><p>And then the burden shifts...</p><p>STOSSEL: How much cash, typically?</p><p>BULLOCK: It could be what the police officers considers to be an unusually large amount of cash, which could be as small as $900, $1,200, $2,000. And then the burden shifts to the property owner in Texas to try to get their property back.</p><p>Also in Texas...</p><p>STOSSEL: And hiring a lawyer to defend yourself would cost you much more than $1,200.</p><p>BULLOCK: Absolutely. So most people just give up, and because it's a civil proceeding, the government can win by default. And that's the way many of these cases turn out.</p><p>STOSSEL: You have one client whose truck was lost, because he loaned it to somebody else who drove drunk.</p><p>BULLOCK: That's right. And this happens all the time where people who are wholly innocent of wrongdoing can still face the loss of their property.</p><p>Also in Texas, police and prosecutors keep 90 percent of the proceeds from forfeiture, giving them a very direct and a very perverse incentive to go out and try to take as much property as possible.</p><p>STOSSEL: In one state, chief of police bought a margarita-maker for his office with the funds. California isn't great on this either.</p><p>BULLOCK: It's not great, but it is better than Texas. In California, police and prosecutors only keep 65 percent, giving them still certainly a bad and perverse incentive, but not as bad. And at least in California, the burden is on the government to try to prove that you did something wrong, unlike in Texas where the burden is on the property owner.</p><p>STOSSEL: And the Institute says the best states for protecting property -- Maine, North Dakota, Vermont.</p><p>Let's move on to eminent domain, another property issue. Texas passed -- after Kelo, took this woman's house, Texas passed a constitutional amendment saying you can't do that. Texas should be good.</p><p>BULLOCK: That's right. Texas does have much better eminent domain law than they originally did. The legislature passed some laws after the wake of Kelo, but they made a bunch of exemptions in the law, including exemption for the Cowboys Stadium where the government there took over 100 pieces of property to build the monolith to the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Ironically enough now, California is better about eminent domain, not because of their laws, but because California is broke. And one of the things that the state did in order to try to improve their finances is to abolish redevelopment agencies throughout the state. And those were the main abusers of eminent domain.</p><p>So this is an instance where the fiscal crisis in California has actually led to something that better protects property owners.</p><p>STOSSEL: By de-power -- by defunding the government bullies, they steal fewer people's property.</p><p>BULLOCK: That's exactly right. Ironically enough.</p><p>STOSSEL: Licensing rules. This is what it takes to start a business. In Texas, shampooers have to get a license?</p><p>BULLOCK: Texas is one of five states that require shampooers to be licensed. They have to spend over $100 a year on a license. They have to pass two exams, something that you and I and probably most of the audience here successfully did this morning, you have to pass exams in Texas in order to become a licensed shampooer. So that's ridiculous and there's no justification for it.</p><p>STOSSEL: To coach sports, you have to be a licensed teacher?</p><p>BULLOCK: Texas one of the few states that require that as well. You have to go to college for four years in order to coach any sport in Texas. Texas takes -- Texans take their sports very seriously. This is just a barrier to entry into a legitimate occupation.</p><p>STOSSEL: Commercial fishermen have to pay almost $5,000 in fees. But bad as Texas is, California, in licensing, is worse.</p><p>BULLOCK: California is worse. California has very draconian occupational licensing laws, but Texas is 17th in the nation in their burdensome occupational licensing laws. So it's certainly better than California, but there is a lot of room for improvement in Texas when it comes to licensing.</p><p>STOSSEL: Thank you, Scott Bullock. At least we found some things where California does OK. And coming up, one more thing we should be very grateful to California for.</p><p>STOSSEL: Thank you, California. America needs you. We need you the way we needed the Soviet Union, as a model of failure, to warn us what happens if we listen to those who say government does it better.</p><p>The USSR died about 20 years ago. Many of you forgot its horrors. You young people may not even know them. That's why I'm grateful that we have not just California, but Illinois and Connecticut to remind us of what power-mad politicians do.</p><p>OK. That's not fair, American states aren't murderous dictatorships. And, another difference, if you live in a big government state, you can move, vote with your feet. I did.</p><p>I grew up in Illinois. It was a nice state, except in the winter. But gradually its politicians gave away its future. They increased pay and pensions to government workers to the point that soon Illinois won't have money for much of anything else.</p><p>I moved to New York City, which is no political paradise either, but what could I do? This is where the big TV news jobs were, and still are. And at least New York's promises to unions may not bankrupt us too soon.</p><p>And I could move again. I would still be stuck with federal law, but it's an advantage to live in a country that has 50 states. Each can be a laboratory of democracy. If one gets it right, I can move there.</p><p>A group called the Free State Project invites you to move to New Hampshire to help create liberty in our lifetime. It's too early to see how that one works out.</p><p>But I'm glad that we have states so I don't have to leave my country to escape its worst laws. In Europe, I would. French actor Gerard Depardieu just moved to Belgium to escape France's proposed 75 percent tax on rich people.</p><p>Years ago high taxes in Britain drove David Bowie to move to Switzerland, and Rod Stewart to Los Angeles. Wait, that's in California, I wonder if he's now going to move back. Oh, he has. In 2010 he moved his family back to England, though he doesn't claim taxes were the reason.</p><p>Americans who want to escape high taxes can move to one of these states: Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. All have no state income tax. And, surprise, those states create more jobs.</p><p>It's no surprise, actually. Without an income tax, they were forced to limit the growth of their governments, so they did. Every state has schools, social service programs, prisons, those states find a way to fund those for less. Then they reap benefits.</p><p>Last decade those nine states gained population from other states. They increased jobs by 4.9 percent; jobs in the rest of the states declined by 2.6 percent. Competition between neighboring states also deters state politicians from indulging in all their whims.</p><p>New Hampshire's lack of an income tax has kept Vermont's politicians from going completely crazy. The existence of Arizona and Nevada nearby deter California's legislators from going crazy.</p><p>Well, actually, they still go crazy, despite so many people moving from California to Nevada and Arizona.

But the dark cloud of that conflict has one silver lining: good technical workers are no longer so hard to find.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chen, who manages two \u00adfactories that make wooden frames for sofas and tables in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, has not had to lay off any of his 600 staff despite the blow to his business. He was fortunate to have a mostly independent supply chain, but still had to scale down the workforce in the smaller \u00adfactory and move them to the bigger facility to save costs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In late October, he hired two experienced sample makers laid off by other factories. Their salary demands were \"not too high\", \u00adbecause there were few other jobs to be had.</p><p/><p>However, not everyone is fortunate and capable enough to spread their risk between different baskets.</p><p/><p>\"If between half and 70 per cent of one's business comes from the US market, then it's hard to survive,\" Chen said. \"I estimate that small manufacturers with fewer than 200 employees will \u00addisappear after January.\"</p><p/><p>That is when American tariffs on US$200 billion worth of \u00adimports, including furniture, were initiallyexpected to rise to 25 per cent from an initial 10 per cent rate levied in September. But after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, met on December 1, the tariff increase was put on hold until March while Washington and Beijing continue trade negotiations.</p><p/><p>The trade war has created an extra, unexpected burden for \u00adBeijing: to maintain enough jobs as the economy slows. This is \u00adparticularly true, given the extra hardship they face, for private \u00adsector firms, which account for about 80 per cent of all jobs and 90 per cent of new jobs, according to government data.</p><p/><p>Last year, China was the largest exporter of furniture to the United States, shipping US$11.3 billion worth. The tariffs have had a chilling effect on the 6,000-plus furniture manufacturers, most of which are privately owned, and brought down the number of employees in the industry to about 1.1 million at the end of October, the lowest figure in three years, \u00adaccording to official data.</p><p/><p>The top leadership knows well the importance of having enough jobs. In the statement that \u00adfollowed the latest meeting of the policymaking Politburo this month, stabilising employment was mentioned first, before efforts to manage finance, trade and market expectations.</p><p/><p>On the surface, the job market seems well under control. The \u00adofficial survey-basedunemployment rate released by the \u00adNational Bureau of Statistics \u00adremained unchanged at 4.9 per cent in September and October before falling slightly to 4.8 per cent last month, while the average jobless rate in 31 major cites was even lower, at 4.7 per cent in \u00adNovember - compared with the global average of 5.7 per cent \u00adreported by the International \u00adLabour Organisation.</p><p/><p>According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social \u00adSecurity, the government created more than 12 million new jobs in urban areas during the first 10 month of this year, achieving its annual target two months early.</p><p/><p>But the overall numbers hid a stark difference in the available supply of labour between small and large firms. For private enterprises with a workforce of less than 100, job supply fell below demand in the third quarter, whereas large firms offered an average of 2.87 jobs for every applicant.</p><p/><p>Using data from April to \u00adSeptember from recruitment website 51jobs, Song Xuetao, an economist at Tianfeng Securities, found that about 2 million vacancies disappeared over the six months and recruitment by private firms with 50 to 500 staff fell more sharply than for state-owned enterprises.</p><p/><p>\"Under the current economy, small and micro firms contribute 80 per cent of all jobs, around 70 per cent of technological innovation, more than 60 per cent of [gross domestic product] and more than 50 per cent of tax revenues,\" said Dong Dezhi, an analyst at Guoxin Securities. \"Turning around the businesses of small and medium [sized]enterprisesto help job creation is where we can make a breakthrough to stabilise the job market.\"</p><p/><p>Beijing has become restless as the trade war continues. In mid-November, the State Council drafted a policy paper containing proposals ranging from refunding the unemployment insurance contributions of companies that do not lay off staff to giving subsidies to jobless 16-to-24-year-olds. Local governments were ordered to draft their own proposals by this month.</p><p/><p>Beijing also called for local governments to increase financial support for entrepreneurs and small private enterprises - the main driver of urban employment in China - by offering government-guaranteed loans of 150,000 to 3 million yuan (HK$3.4 million).</p><p/><p>The government is also encouraging laid-off workers to set up their own small businesses. Migrant workers in particular are being given subsidies, tax breaks and other financial incentives to return home and start their own companies.</p><p/><p>Since the early 2000s, almost all new jobs in China have been created in cities. The labour market is facing challenges from two ends: industrial consolidation and automation reduce the job supply, while a shrinking workforce, rising labour costs and declining job market participation - driven down mainly by women leaving the labour force - all contribute to depressing the demand for jobs.</p><p/><p>But thanks to a surge in service jobs, particularly at small companies, urban employment growth has remained relatively stable even as the economy has slowed</p><p/><p>\"Both basic and advanced services are contributing to this [jobs] growth, but it's the basic services industries that have been the stronger growth driver in most \u00adrecent years,\" read a recent report from the Conference Board, a New York-based research firm.</p><p/><p>\"They have become the catch basin for the lower-skilled \u00adsegment of the workforce, absorbing a large share of less skilled workers, presumably transitioning from legacy sectors. Without the continued job growth from micro-enterprises, urban employment would in fact be \u00adcontracting.\"</p><p/><p>The question is: can Beijing help small service providers keep creating jobs? Some recent figures are of concern. The employment sub-index in theNovember \u00adCaixinPurchasing Managers' \u00adIndex for the service sector, which mainly covers small private firms, showed that the workforce in the service industry grew mildly in the past two months but could not offset downsizing in the manufacturing sector.</p><p/><p>A monthly survey from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business gauging more than 300 alumni - mostly executives at private companies - indicated that their plans to recruit staff had plunged over the past two months to the worst level in six years.</p><p/><p>In the export sector, hiring demand fell by more than half in the third quarter, according to the China Institute for Employment Research at Renmin University of China in Beijing, which works with job hunting site Zhaopin to produce a quarterly report.</p><p/><p>The supply of new jobs declined even more in coastal cities such as Ningbo and Suzhou, which rely heavily on international trade.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, job postings in the internet and IT sector, which had been fertile ground for well-paid service jobs, fell by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier.</p><p/><p>A senior executive at an internet firm of about 1,000 employees, who preferred not to be identified, said she had raised performance targets to improve productivity, even though she had not frozen headcounts or laid off staff. She noted that many of the jobseekers knocking on her door came from the peer-to-peer lending industry, in which hundreds of platforms have collapsed since July after the government tightened regulations.</p><p/><p>In October, reports of big tech firms such as Huawei, Tencent and Alibaba - which owns the Post - freezing recruitment shocked the public. The companies later denied the reports, but some smaller tech firms are scaling back operations.</p><p/><p>Juanpi.com, an e-commerce platform, has been demanding employees work overtime since last year. Video platform \u00adKuaishou recently stopped hiring through headhunters, according to a recruiter source. Meituan \u00adDianping, a Hong Kong-listed online platform that generates most of its revenue from food delivery, this year reported about 250 job cuts - 0.5 per cent of its workforce.</p><p/><p>\"Salary is a priority, but many candidates for tech start-ups care a lot about job stability at the \u00admoment,\" said Eva Li, a Beijing-based headhunter who helps tech companies find engineers.</p><p/><p>For now, the transition from industrial (secondary) jobs to service sector (tertiary) ones appears smooth, partly because a strong economy over the past few years has created many entry-level, low-skilled jobs - such as in package or food delivery. But boosting entrepreneurship to offset demographic challenges requires consistent government support, which is easier said than done, according to Gao Yuan, an economist from the Conference Board.</p><p/><p>\"As growth continues to slow, it will become increasingly difficult for the government to maintain the balancing act between upholding employment stability and advancing structural \u00adreforms,\" Gao said.</p><p/><p>One risk factor for employment stability is the rise in worker protests in service industries, according to China Labour Bulletin (CLB), a Hong Kong-based non-governmental organisation that tracks labour unrest.</p><p/><p>Of 1,444 incidents recorded during the first 10 months of this year, 238 were in retail and 224 in transport, which is dominated by online services such as ride-sharing giant Didi and Meituan \u00adDianping.</p><p/><p>\"One indirect effect of the slowdown in manufacturing that may, in the coming months, be exacerbated by the Sino-US trade war is the funnelling of laid-off factory workers into low-paid, insecure and often dangerous jobs in emerging service industries. It is these industries that are now \u00adincreasingly the focus of worker protests in China,\" CLB warned.</p><p/><p>\"As these new businesses absorb more and more of the \u00adworkforce laid off from the manufacturing sector, we would expect to see a greater number of strikes and protests over low pay, lack of benefits, long working hours and lack of job security.\"</p><p/><p>China's private sector, the driving force behind the country's economic miracle of the last 40 years, is struggling amid the trade war with the United States and the government's campaign to reduce national debt. This report by Sidney Leng is the fourth in a series detailing the challenges that private companies face and outlining Beijing's attempts to address them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-8f9382de-e70e-11e8-bfde-9434090d4df7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V27-8ST1-DYRW-R2G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 South China Morning Post Ltd.

The legal challenge will look at how this artificial intelligence[2] program affects immigration policy decisions, which the campaigners say is a racially biased and unlawful system. The challenge is being brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and a human rights group called Foxglove. </p><p>The two organisations are seeking a judicial review to find out what the algorithm is and what it is used for. Foxglove formed in 2015 as an organisation to stand up to big tech companies and governments that use digital services that harm or mistreat the general public. It is made up of lawyers, tech experts and communications specialists and takes its name from a European wildflower (digitalis sp) that can both harm and cure. The Home office has declined a request to explain how the software works, according to Foxglove's operational director Martha Dark. She said that it is \"hiding behind an immigration exemption in the Freedom of Information Act\".\"Remember Theresa May's racist migration policy[3] that put 'Go Home' vans on our streets and gave us the Windrush scandal - if you thought it was history, think again,\" Dark wrote on a fundraising page[4]. \"The hostile environment continues. And it is now going digital. \"We've discovered a secret technology that basically works as a digital hostile environment. We need your help to expose it - and to take the Home Office to court.\" According to Foxglove, the Home Office is using a \"secretive algorithm\", described as a digital \"streaming tool\", to sift visa applications. The algorithm scans applications and directs them into a fast lane, denoted by the colour green, a slow lane which is yellow, or a \"full digital pat-down\" which is red. \"They've given a shadowy, computer-driven process the power to affect someone's chances of getting a visa,\" Dark said. \"And as best as we can tell, the machine is using problematic and biased criteria[5], like nationality, to choose which 'stream' you get in. People from rich white countries get Speedy Boarding; poorer people of colour get pushed to the back of the queue.\" The campaigners say the algorithm may be discriminating on the basis of crude characteristics like nationality or age, rather than assessing applicants fairly, on the merits. IT Pro contacted the Home Office which said the tool \"complies fully with the relevant legislation under the Equalities Act 2010\". \"We have always used processes that enable UK Visas and Immigration to allocate cases in an efficient way,\" a Home Office spokesperson said. \"The streaming tool is only used to allocate applications, not to decide them.\" Gracie Bradley, Liberty policy and campaigns manager, said that decisions which impact people's rights should be made by people and not machines. \"It's vital immigration decisions are fully transparent[6] so people can understand and challenge them - opaque, unaccountable algorithms make that impossible,\" she told IT Pro. \"It's especially concerning this tool appears to stream people based on nationality - a recipe for discriminatory decision-making[7].\" [ 1]: <url

The theatre chain operates both AMC and Carmike in the US as well as Odeon cinemas in the UK.</p><p>AMC is currently valued at around $475m, while Amazon is worth $1.22 trillion. As Harrington says, the price of buying AMC would be practically \"nothing\".</p><p>\"Cinemas are obviously going to take a massive hit from the pandemic but at the same time you're going to have all these streaming services that are largely unaffected,\" he says.</p><p>\"Amazon is probably better off as a result of the coronavirus, elsewhere Netflix had an amazing quarter last quarter and the next is going to be even better. Basically the only place you can release a film right now is direct to the consumer digitally.\"</p><p>                     A new role for cinema                   </p><p>Like many industries, the pandemic is likely to cause widespread change in cinemas.</p><p>Boutique picture houses have been on the rise for some time looking to push the idea of cinema going as an \"experience\".</p><p>According to Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, pursuing such a model may be crucial to their revival.</p><p>\"Cinemas kind of have to go for a more premium experience,\" he says. \"Now that's going to be problematic in the short-term because first and foremost they will need to spend quite a bit of money on it but more importantly with higher unemployment there are going to be fewer people able to afford it.\"</p><p>Hewson says that regulators will watch any such deal such as Amazon's proposed move for AMC.</p><p>\"Regulators might have a concern about having big tech dominate large wholesale industries,\" he says.</p><p>However, it appears that big tech companies have already proliferated much of the film industry.</p><p>                     Streaming giants move in                   </p><p>Netflix struck an enormous production deal with Shepperton Studios in 2019 to set up a permanent production base. Reed Hastings' giant enterprise is also pushing to acquire the famous Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, an undoubtedly symbolic acquisition.</p><p>Elsewhere, Disney - the king of the cinematic box office - has made impressive inroads into the streaming world as well, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2020/03/13/isolation-movies-ever-sane-tom-hanks-leading-example/\">breaking 50 million subscribers in months</url>.</p><p>At a time when projectors are switched off, movie makers may be forced into striking new deals rapidly. MGM is waiting to push out the latest James Bond film <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2020/03/13/isolation-movies-ever-sane-tom-hanks-leading-example/\">No Time to Die</url>, which had been slated for release in early April. The production release has been pushed to November in the hope of gaining a proper run at box office.</p><p>Elsewhere, films that skip the big screen will be allowed to contend for Oscars this year, the Academy said in a significant rule change forced by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Debate has raged in recent years over Oscar contenders produced by streaming giants such as Netflix, including last year's The Irishman and 2018's Roma.</p><p>Until now, the films have been shown at theaters for brief windows before moving online, in order to remain eligible.</p><p>If streaming giants have their way, the academy's rules will remain long after the pandemic is over. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-63064004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YY9-Y0M1-F021-61PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 21, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasing turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&amp;T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers.</p><p>The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers \u2014 in the media industry and beyond \u2014 will be permitted in the years to come.</p><p>\u201cThis court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,\u201d said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. \u201cThis case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.\u201d</p><p>The Justice Department\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/business/dealbook/att-time-warner.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Business%20Day&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article\">move to block the deal</url> in November took Wall Street and the entertainment industry by surprise. Many executives and lawyers thought President Trump\u2019s administration would usher in a hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the deal on the campaign trail.</p><p>Instead, the Justice Department, under its antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, moved aggressively, demanding the sale of major parts of the businesses before a deal could go through. AT&amp;T responded by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/business/att-antitrust-witness-delrahim.html\">suggesting that Mr. Delrahim\u2019s decision was politically motivated</url> and not based on established antitrust law.</p><p>In recent weeks, though, the judge overseeing the case, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/content/senior-judge-richard-j-leon\">Richard Leon</url> of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, has rejected       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/att-time-warner-antitrust.html\">moves by AT&amp;T to inject</url> politics into the arguments.</p><p>Unless the two sides settle \u2014 and there have been no signs of that happening \u2014 the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the country\u2019s video future. Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&amp;T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand over the course of several weeks \u2014 and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry.</p><p>The Justice Department argues that the merged company\u2019s combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry. It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls \u201cmust-watch\u201d programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.</p><p>The government\u2019s case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&amp;T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming \u2014 the same combination that AT&amp;T is seeking \u2014 would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows. That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses.</p><p>Judge Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBC Universal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast\u2019s holdings.</p><p>\u201cEither important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,\u201d the Justice Department said in pretrial filings with the court. \u201cOr it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.\u201d</p><p>AT&amp;T scoffs at the government\u2019s predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government\u2019s theory that it would withhold content, AT&amp;T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.</p><p>Leading AT&amp;T\u2019s defense is Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles-based lawyer with a long track record in high-profile cases but not someone who is considered an antitrust expert. Two decades ago, he <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/05/us/civil-jury-finds-simpson-liable-in-pair-of-killings.html\">won a wrongful death case against O. J. Simpson</url> on behalf of the family of Ron Goldman. In 2006, he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/25/business/25cnd-enron.html\">lost a case defending Jeffrey Skilling</url>, the chief executive of Enron, of fraud and conspiracy.</p><p>Mr. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&amp;T says that Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems. Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos.</p><p>AT&amp;T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&amp;T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.</p><p>\u201cThe new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,\u201d AT&amp;T said in its pretrial brief.</p><p>The merger is opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and many consumer groups, who say that AT&amp;T\u2019s control of more than 100 million mobile phone subscriptions gives it unparalleled power. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don\u2019t own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say.</p><p>Streaming competition is the \u201cbest hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,\u201d said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.</p><p>Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government\u2019s intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies.</p><p>\u201cThe government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham &amp; Company.</p><p>AT&amp;T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Mr. Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Judge Leon rejected those demands, and AT&amp;T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference \u2014 which it described as \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 from the case.</p><p>But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration.</p><p>The decision to block a merger between companies that don\u2019t directly compete is rare. Mr. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anticompetitive behavior in such deals \u2014 getting companies to promise they\u2019ll be on their best behavior \u2014 is not effective.</p><p>That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS\u2019s $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna \u2014 as well as proposed media deals like Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting\u2019s purchase of Tribune Media. Wall Street analysts expect the results of the trial will determine if more telecom and entertainment companies will pursue ambitious vertical mergers.</p><p>\u201cThis could direct the future path of the industry,\u201d said Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at Georgetown University Law School. \u201cIf it is permitted, vertical integration will continue.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO:

The way the tech companies are building and increasing their size is just pricing people out. Families who have been here for generations can't afford to be here any more. They're being pushed off into rural areas - anywhere from an hour to two and a half hours away.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JT Faraji is a 43-year-old artist who lives with his family in East Palo Alto, the northern California city on the edge of Silicon Valley. Just a stone's throw away, Facebook's global headquarters is his most visible neighbour, and he is also close to a big new Amazon office. He has lived in the area all his life and talks volubly about fascinating aspects of East Palo Alto's history - like the period in the 1960s when black activists set up a high school and college, and there was even talk of renaming the city Nairobi: \"There are a lot of minorities here: Hispanics, blacks, Pacific Islanders,\" he says. \"But those people are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">not really represented in the workforce in technology</url>. So the way that northern California is going to look in not too long is going to be very ... undiverse.\"</p><p>In 2017, as part of a local grassroots group called the Real Community Coalition, Faraji began to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">put pressure on Facebook</url> to - among other things - address concerns about housing and hire more local people. The coalition protested, organised vigils and eventually sat down with people from the company to discuss what was happening to their area. \"What mostly came out of that was a lot of hot air, pushing back,\" says Faraji. \"Basically stalling and stalling and stalling.\"</p><p>Facebook has a local hiring programme, but Faraji says its focus on people in their 20s has cut out most of East Palo Alto's community. (In response to inquiries from the Guardian, Facebook acknowledged its work on local employment with a social enterprise called Year Up, which is dedicated to 18 to 24-year-olds, but also mentioned \"community job fairs\", efforts to connect \"local residents directly to Facebook recruiters\", and workshops on \"resume writing and interviewing skills\"). In late 2016, the company had also co-founded what it called the Catalyst Housing Fund, and contributed around $20m (\u00a315.3m), though Faraji says he has seen no signs of the money being spent; Facebook says that two and a half years after the fund was established, there are now plans for 261 new affordable housing units, but that \"timing of project completion depends on the city's remaining approval processes for the projects\".</p><p>The Real Community Coalition has now fallen from view - partly, he says, because of the effects of Facebook donating to the very non-profit groups that have traditionally fought for local people: \"They are usually the first line of defence, at least in our community: organisations that are trying to combat gentrification or fight for affordable housing or what have you. But now, some don't want to bite the hand that feeds them. And then there's just a massive population turnover that's been happening in the last two years.\"</p><p>Like a lot of what he says, the words are full of a deep sadness. \"It's hard to fight for people who are leaving, and no longer here.\"</p><p>The rest of the world is now starting to understand what the residents of East Palo Alto - and indeed, a huge chunk of northern California - have known for years: that big tech has not just colonised the online realm: it has an increasingly visible presence in the physical world. Leaving aside Amazon's globally ubiquitous fulfilment centres, they, Facebook and Google now have huge premises - \"hubs\", \"campuses\", old-fashioned offices - in cities across the planet, with even more to come.</p><p>The change may have come too late for some of the people of East Palo Alto, but in the past two years or so, something has shifted. Now, as they are planned, proposed and built, these developments are increasingly being contested by coalitions of activists who follow each other's campaigns and draw on a growing pool of knowledge and experience.</p><p>Because new big tech projects often arrive in areas beyond city centres, where property is comparatively cheap and many people from ethnic minorities have made their home, the campaigns against them are often led by people of colour. A big issue is the often cosy relationship between companies and politicians, who regularly do their best to push things along by sweetening planning agreements with tax breaks and generous grants. The issues proliferate: from the private takeover of public space, through basic questions of local democracy, to issues around work and pay. As cities endlessly expand and the power of tech corporations grows, if you want a sense of the future of grassroots politics, this is a very good place to look.</p><p>The forces opposing big tech recently won a key victory in the New York borough of Queens, where Amazon's plans to locate a huge chunk of the corporate office project it calls HQ2 in Long Island City - where 25% of the population is African American and 40% Hispanic or Latino - were so fiercely contested <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">that the company beat a hasty retreat</url>. In the midst of a somewhat absurd competition between US cities to attract Amazon to their locality, proposals had included       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">a package of tax breaks and grants secretly negotiated</url> by the New York state governor Andrew Cuomo and the city's mayor Bill de Blasio       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">that totalled nearly $3bn</url>. It also raised the link between Amazon and the US's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency</url> (Ice). The agency uses Amazon's cloud computing services, and Amazon has tried to persuade its officials to use the company's face recognition software: a huge issue among many of the communities often on the receiving end of Ice's cruelties.</p><p>But perhaps the key focus for campaigners - who include local congresswoman <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</url> - was urban gentrification, and what activists call \"displacement\": the way big corporate developments usually lead to local people being forced out of the places they call home. The Amazon development was centred on 25,000 jobs that the company said would be paid an average salary of $150,000: many locals saw the prospect of a huge influx of white, wealthy outsiders, and loudly opposed it.</p><p>A big voice in the campaign is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Maritza Silva-Farrell</url>, the executive director of the Alliance for A Greater New York (Align), a grassroots organisation addressing issues of inequality and the environment. When we speak, she is in Seattle, meeting politicians in Amazon's home city in the company of activists from Nashville, where Amazon is committed to a new \"centre of excellence\" that will employ around 5,000 people. She says she has also regularly been in touch with people in Spain and Germany, where Amazon workers staged strikes about employment conditions last year: \"We always speak about this campaign as a global campaign, because Amazon isn't a local corporation.\"</p><p>Was she surprised that her side won? \"I've never run a campaign that only took four months,\" she says. \"The announcement came out in November and Amazon was out of the city by February. I'm hoping it signals to other corporations that they can't come into town and say: 'We want this, and this, and this - and we'll create some jobs, but we'll tell you how many later.' You should come, and talk to our community, and see what the needs of the community are, and have a real plan of investment.\"</p><p>Silva-Farrell is now having conversations with campaigners in and around Arlington, Virginia, where Amazon has plans to open <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">what has ended up as the sole HQ2 complex</url>, on much the same scale as what it proposed for Queens. Its location is very close to Washington DC; the finished development will feature huge apartment blocks, a 49,000 sq ft cinema and \"a 23-storey luxury apartment complex with a private Whole Foods [supermarket] entrance\". The development will be named National Landing, though it sits amid places that already exist: Pentagon City, Crystal City, and Potomac Yard - where, as in Queens, rising rents and impossible living costs are already highly charged issues.</p><p>Every aspect of the Virginia story echoes what happened in New York. Amazon will receive \"performance-based incentives\" totalling around $750m (\u00a3575m) from the state authorities if its plans come to fruition. With Arlington County's hotel tax revenue expected to rise with Amazon's arrival, the company will also get up to 15% of a local tax on hotels if it meets certain goals for how much space its new offices fill. In case anyone thought this wasn't quite generous enough, two weeks ago, county authorities in Arlington also approved a package of \"pay for performance\" grants to Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">that could total $23m</url>.</p><p>The meeting where this happened was addressed by activists from a local coalition called For Us Not Amazon, whose leaders say that among the biggest issues they face is people's lack of awareness about Amazon's plans. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Danny Cendejas</url> is an organiser with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">La ColectiVA</url>, a grassroots organisation working among Virginia's Hispanic and Latino communities. What often hits him, he says, is an engagement gap made worse by the failure of both Amazon and the relevant local authorities to open up to people how their decisions will directly affect them - it is grimly symbolic, he says, that \"on the county board's website, if you go to the link in Spanish and search 'Amazon', there's not a single hit that comes up\".</p><p>Like the Queens campaigners, Cendejas is appalled by Amazon's links to Ice and its work. Local officials and politicians, he says, ought to \"publicly call on Amazon to end collaboration with that. They should be willing to be courageous and call on Amazon to do that, if Amazon want to be good neighbours.\"</p><p>The other subject he talks about is the fragile state of communities threatened by rising rents and property prices. \"The issue is here already,\" he says. \"In this past year alone, from the conversations I've been having with people, there's been an increase of around $200 [a month] in rent. For folks who are working paycheck to paycheck, that's a huge difference.</p><p>\"At least five of the families I've been working with over the last six months have had to leave the area because of the cost of living. Amazon would exacerbate that, particularly as there have been no guarantees that people could carry on living where they live.\" The least that should happen, he says, is that the proposed giveaways to Amazon from public funds could be taken back, and invested \"in affordable housing, to be anti-displacement. That's an obvious idea.\"</p><p>When I contact Amazon for its take on both its pull-out from Queens and opposition to its plans for Virginia, the company does not respond. Cendejas, by contrast, is very vocal about the threads that connect both stories. \"The Queens win was a win for all communities of colour, and all low-income communities and all immigrant communities across the country. We celebrated with them. The concerns that people in Queens had were the same concerns we have here. And they're not being addressed.\"</p><p>Resistance to big tech is not only gaining momentum in the US. In November 2016, Google announced that it was going to open a new \"campus\" in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Kreuzberg</url> area of Berlin. Aimed at providing a space in which employees could mentor new tech startups, it was to occupy 3,000 sq ft in a disused electricity substation, located in the heart of one of the city's most renowned neighbourhoods.</p><p>In the days of the cold war, Kreuzberg became a byword for West Berlin's Turkish population and bohemian subcultures: it was the one-time stamping ground of David Bowie and Nick Cave, and attracted thousands of punks and hippies avoiding West German national service. Twenty-seven years after the fall of the Berlin wall, it had become a noticeably more affluent area, but still retained enough of its old identity to convince Google it was a perfect place to be.</p><p>In response to the company's announcement, the city authorities seemed exultant: \"Today is a good day for Berlin,\" said the city's mayor, Michael Muller. But the fact that Kreuzberg had held on to an enduring idea of its outsider status <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">eventually proved to be Google's undoing</url>, thanks to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">a loose coalition of local activists</url> who were set on keeping it out. One of its elements was a group of techies elegantly named Fuck Off Google. Another was a neighbourhood organisation called       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Bizim Kiez</url>, meaning \"our quarter\", whose activists had first come together to save a Turkish shop. A third was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">GloReiche</url> (a play on the German word for \"glorious\"), another neighbourhood collective that had recently worked to keep a bakery open.</p><p>One of GloReiche's prime movers is Stefan Klein, a self-employed media law specialist who has lived in Kreuzberg for a decade: \"We thought Google would be a tough opponent,\" he says. \"Everybody loves Google, everybody uses Google, Google is free, it has great products, and so on and so on. We thought: 'It will be difficult to tell people why we think this is a bad idea.'\"</p><p>Very quickly, though, opinion began to turn. In the past five years, rents in Kreuzberg are reckoned to have gone up 30% - and there was widespread fear that Google's arrival would push them even higher. The fact that the new campus was intended to develop startups suggested to many Kreuzbergers that it would essentially amount to a gentrification factory, sending out swarms of new tech businesses to eventually take over the neighbourhood. And as Klein explains, there was also a fear of what the company's arrival would mean for deep issues about the area's infrastructure, alongside concerns about the opportunities that would arise for the company to harvest an ocean of information about people's lives on the basis of what was planned in Toronto (more of that below): \"Wherever Google goes,\" he says, \"they take over. They offer public services like transportation, or even controlling traffic lights - everything. For free, they say. But it's never for free: they always want data. That's the point.\"</p><p>Throughout their campaign, the Kreuzberg activists were in contact with grassroots anti-Google campaigners in Toronto and the company's home city of San Francisco: comparing notes, pooling research and keeping in touch with each other's activities. And after months of street protest, meetings, and door-to-door canvassing, in late October 2018, Google announced that it was pulling its plans: it would retain its lease on the property in question, but for the next five years, the space would be used by two social enterprises.</p><p>The company will not be directly quoted on its plans, but a Google spokesperson says he is confident the new arrangement will be \"something for longer term\". Klein remains sceptical: \"I think they're hoping that we're asleep, and we're not fighting any more, and they can move in easily,\" he says. \"We're doing more actions again in May - telling people what is happening. Because they've heard it from the press, most people think: 'Oh, they've won, everything is fine.'\"</p><p>He suddenly sounds worried. \"We don't think so.\"</p><p>In Toronto, perhaps the most jaw-dropping story to date about big tech and the future of cities is rapidly taking shape. The city's waterfront is reckoned to be the largest area of undeveloped real estate in North America - which, under the supervision of a public body called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Waterfront Toronto</url>, may soon be transformed. The company in charge will be       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Sidewalk Labs</url>, an offshoot of Google that \"imagines, designs, tests and builds urban innovations to help cities meet their biggest challenges\".</p><p>Reflecting ideas being developed across the world, what they have planned is a \"smart city\", at the cutting-edge of just about everything. If it comes to pass, its basis will be 17,000 units of housing, 40% of which would be dedicated to \"lower- and middle-income families\". Just about all its buildings will be based on the use of wood. There are plans for prototype <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">\"raincoats\"</url> that would cover open space and thereby regulate the climate. Some streets will be \"dynamic\", so their use - by pedestrians, bikes, or cars - could change throughout the day.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the whole thing will be based on the use of huge amounts of data generated by its residents as they go about their daily lives. Sidewalk Labs says people's privacy will be protected by the fact that anyone using data will have to sign up to a \"responsible data impact assessment\" and that the ownership of data will rest with an \"independent civic data trust\", but to many people, these inevitably sound like opaque, abstract ideas. </p><p>Waterfront Toronto says it has \"made a clear, public commitment to the protection of public privacy\" and that it will abide by a \"privacy by design\" standard developed by Dr Ann Cavoukian, a leading Canadian privacy expert. But along with another adviser to the project, Cavoukian has now pulled out of the project because of privacy concerns: \"I imagined us creating a smart city of privacy, as opposed to a smart city of surveillance,\" she says.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs' arrival in Toronto was formally announced in October 2017, when the-then executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, Eric Schmidt, shared a stage in the city with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. In the past, said Schmidt, he and his colleagues had thought \"about all the things we could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge,\" before he laughed, and added: \"That's not how it works, for all sorts of good reasons.\" With his usual breezy enthusiasm, Trudeau said the development would be a \"testbed for new technologies... that will help us build cleaner, smarter, greener cities.\" Eighteen months on, polls say <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">55% of Toronto's residents support the plan</url>.</p><p>Opposition to it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">has only just started to cohere</url> - chiefly in the form of a new campaign group called       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Block Sidewalk</url>. One of its key voices is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">Bianca Wylie</url>, whose expertise lies in technology and public engagement. \"No one even asked for this thing,\" she says: \"The people of Toronto didn't want a smart city or a smart neighbourhood - and now we're having the wrong conversation. It's all, 'How do we pull this off?' Not, 'Do we even want it?' That's the slide that happens.\"</p><p>Wylie can talk about the data and surveillance aspects of what Sidewalk Labs seems to have planned, much of which remain unclear. But she puts more emphasis on the fact that the authorities in Toronto seem to have moved into talking about the details of the project before anyone has thought through the much more basic stuff, about how to create the right legal and regulatory framework for such a mind-boggling vision: \"We don't have policies and laws to manage something like this,\" she says. \"That's such a fundamental part of the problem. In a democracy, you're supposed to get your policies and laws in order first. Now, you've got the vendor at the table, influencing all these things.\"</p><p>At first, it looked like the Sidewalk Labs smart city would cover around 12 acres. But last month, leaked documents reported in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\">the Toronto Star</url> revealed plans for the redevelopment of the waterfront to actually cover 350 acres (and house as many as 75,000 additional people), and that Google would take a portion of property taxes, development fees and tax revenue generated by increased property values. This, says Wylie, finally catalysed hostility to the whole plan: \"If all these things had been identified at the beginning,\" she says, \"a lot more people would have sat up. That's why [the way] they have been allowed to operate has been so fundamentally anti-democratic. If they had come out and said, 'We want to finance transit infrastructure, we want a cut of development fees, we want to get in on municipal revenue', you would have a lot of people organising, But that only came out because of a document leak.\"</p><p>Towards the end of our conversation, Wylie mentions one more remarkable thing - the fact that what is planned for Toronto is unprecedented, in every conceivable way: \"The fascinating thing about this project is, Sidewalk Labs has no r\u00e9sum\u00e9. They haven't done anything. Usually when you get awarded contracts like this, you've got 10 or 15 years of experience. But these guys have nothing.\"</p><p>Back in East Palo Alto, as well as expanding its existing HQ, Facebook has just taken another step towards plans for a new development called Willow Village, which will include a huge office complex, shops, hotels and a town square, and employment for more than 8,000 people. There will also be housing, but only 225 out of 1500 units will be set aside for \"low-income households and seniors\".</p><p>\"They are going to do some major, major expansion,\" says Faraji. \"And when they do, I suspect the rest of the people that look like me and have been here for a long time - the ones who are renting, anyway - are going to be gone. I just don't see how people are going to be able to afford to be here any more.\"</p><p>I wonder: does he have any advice for people fighting big tech elsewhere?</p><p>\"Come together as a community. Do not allow your leaders to accept money for their organisations from tech companies. That's what happened here. If you're not together, it will be an uphill battle.\"</p><p>There is only one question left. Does he think he'll stay, even as Facebook endlessly expands?</p><p>What he says next cuts straight to the simplest kind of resistance: just staying put, and remaining defiant: \"Oh, I'm not going anywhere.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52779570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT2-1191-F021-60DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3568\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

For the U.S. government, its pursuit of new regulations marks a heightened effort to ensure that emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, don't fall into the hands of countries or actors that might pose a national security threat. The official request for public comment, published in the Federal Register, asks whether a long list of AI tools should be subject to stricter export-control rules. </p><p>The Trump administration's potential targets include image-recognition software, ultrafast quantum computers, advanced computer chips, self-driving cars and robots. Companies that make those products and services, for instance, might have to obtain licenses before selling them to foreign governments or partnering with some researchers in certain countries. The document itself is only an initial notice of rules to come, and the Commerce Department, which is leading the effort, is still deciding how to proceed. But its broad wording, along with the White House's long-running, high-stakes trade rift with Beijing, left some tech experts fearful that it could result in greater market barriers for companies doing business in China. They also worry that any rule could adversely affect U.S. investment and research in AI. \"If you think about the range of products this potentially implicates, that's massive. This is either the opening of a big negotiation with the industry and the public, or a bit of a cry for help in scoping these regulations,\" said David Edelman, the director of the Project on Technology, the Economy, &amp; National Security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Commerce Department explicitly said it hopes to protect national security without \"hampering the ability of the U.S. commercial sector to keep pace with international advances.\" The rules come at the request of Congress, which authorized them as part of a recently passed defense bill. A spokeswoman for the agency did not respond to a request seeking comment. Spokespeople for Apple, Google and IBM also did not respond to requests, and Amazon declined to comment. In its proposal, the Trump administration said it is focused \"at a minimum\" on countries already subject to a U.S. arms embargo, a category that includes China. The potential limits on AI research and exports reflect a growing apprehension with Beijing's investment in that industry. In December 2017, for example, the White House's official National Security Strategy warned that \"risks to U.S. national security will grow as competitors integrate information derived from personal and commercial sources with intelligence collection and data analytic capabilities based on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\" What the Trump administration is \"trying to control is the flow of know-how or research or development that enables\" high-tech capabilities, said Melissa Duffy, an export-control expert and partner at the law firm Dechert LLP. Some in the tech industry worry the regulations could widen an existing trade rift between Washington and Beijing. Many executives at big tech companies have bristled at White House-backed tariffs on China, fearing that Beijing's retaliation could result in higher costs for them - or higher prices on components for their products.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN62130558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSX-13S1-JC8S-D1WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The FTC charged Lord &amp; Taylor with deceiving the public, settling the case by prohibiting the company from \"misrepresenting that paid ads are from an independent source,\" but didn't levy a monetary fine. Note that since 2019, ads on Instagram include a clear disclosure that highlights that an update is \"Sponsored. Paid partnership with [brand]\", and seem to meet all necessary disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>Disguised ads are illegal, Chopra said: Disguised paid promotions often reach a wider audience, including people who might not be able to discern the commercial nature of such content, Chopra said, and added that advertisers, in turn, successfully target specific ads to specific people by generating more data based on engagement, which fuels their \"surveillance-based advertising businesses\". \"When companies launder advertising by paying an influencer to pretend that their endorsement or review is untainted by a financial relationship, this is illegal payola,\" he added.</p><p>* Chopra said that \"fake accounts, fake likes, fake followers, and fake reviews are now polluting the digital economy, making it difficult for families and small businesses looking for truthful information,\" and urged the FTC to \"stop fraud from festering\".</p><p>FTC called for a public consultation on the Enforcement Guides: Commissioner Chopra's statement came after the FTC voted 5-0 to seek public comments and a regulatory review of the Endorsement Guides, which requires influencers to disclose sponsored posts. By means of the public consultation, the agency wants to find, among other things:</p><p>* Whether the practices addressed by the Guides are prevalent in the marketplace and whether the Guides are effective at addressing those practices</p><p>* Whether consumers have benefitted from the Guides and what impact, if any, they have had on the flow of truthful information to consumers</p><p>* Whether changes in technology or the economy require changes to the Guides</p><p>* How well advertisers and endorsers are disclosing unexpected material connections in social media</p><p>* Whether children are capable of understanding disclosures of material connections and how those disclosures might affect children</p><p>What are the current norms to address disguised advertising? The Enforcement Guide, among other things, states that when there is a connection between an endorser and a seller of an advertised product that could affect the credibility of the endorsement, the connection must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. However, the Guide was last updated in 2009, and according to the example cited by Commissioner Chopra in his statement, it seems to have done little in deterring companies and influencers from disguising sponsored content. In a series of tweets, he said that \"we may need new rules for tech platforms and for companies that pay influencers to promote products\".</p><p>FTC's scrutiny of big tech companies is increasing: This development comes after we reported yesterday that the FTC ordered Alphabet (including Google), Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple \"to provide information about prior acquisitions not reported to the antitrust agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act\". These companies will have to provide information such as the terms, scope, structure, and purpose of such transactions made between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0051697174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6G-F1B1-JB5M-W4JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

giving people a right to seek compensation in the case of a breach - and be compelled to publish data on cyber bullying complaints they have received and acted on.</p><p>But DIGI, the industry body representing Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and other tech companies in Australia, resisted the push for tougher regulations saying the current laws were adequate.</p><p>\"We understand the desire for greater transparency about the work the industry does to keep our community safe,\" DIGI's managing director Nicole Buskiewicz said.</p><p>\"However, we are concerned that the Senate committee has acted against expert advice offered by the anti-bullying experts, legal organisations and police agencies who testified that the current legislative framework is sufficient to deal with cyber bullying from a regulatory perspective.\"</p><p>Ms Buskiewicz said the industry was committed to investing in prevention of bullying and harmful behaviour on its platforms.</p><p>The findings on the need to prevent cyber bullying come as Facebook weathers a global storm over its handling of users' data, with multiple investigations established across the world in response to allegations the data science firm Cambridge Analytica harvested users' personal information without permission.</p><p>The scandal has fuelled a #DeleteFacebook movement and wiped tens of billions of dollars off the social media behemoth's market value.</p><p>Law firm Maurice Blackburn said tougher regulation was needed because social media companies were not being held to account for bullying on their platforms.</p><p>\"Imposing a duty of care that has real consequences we believe can make a difference to these big tech companies playing an urgent and long overdue role in minimising bullying and inappropriate behaviour on their social media platforms,\" Maurice Blackburn employment law principal Josh Bornstein said.</p><p>Government senators disagreed with the recommendations for tougher regulation and penalties, saying social media companies were aware of the risks of cyber bullying to their business.</p><p>Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said there was \"no silver bullet\" when it came to cyber bullying but, \"as far as I'm concerned, all options are on the table when it comes to doing whatever we can to stamp out cyber bullying\".</p><p>Senator Fifield said many of the committee's concerns were already addressed by the powers of the eSafety commissioner and existing criminal laws.</p><p>The eSafety commissioner has the power to issue fines of up to $18,000 for every day that flagged content is not removed.</p><p>In their submissions to the inquiry, the Attorney-General's Department and Law Council of Australia said the existing Criminal Code adequately dealt with cyber bullying at a federal level.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520014741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S09-VXX1-JBJ7-N28W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><timeReceived>07:44 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Trump needs to engage - but what policies is he likely to formulate? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Related:  Sessions, Flynn and Pompeo: who are the potential Trump cabinet picks?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google's </nameText></person>parent company Alphabet, said last week that the industry is in for a big change. \"[Republicans] have a traditional set of doctrinal issues which are now being challenged by the new president and I don't think we know [how that will play out]. The top five most valued companies in America today are Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. If the 'all-R' team is very focused on big business, there's five big businesses right there.\" </p><p>                   Trump's technology team?                   </p><p>The first big indicator of his position on technology came from the appointment of PayPal billionaire <person><nameText>Peter Thiel </nameText></person>to his transition team. In Democrat-heavy California and Silicon Valley, Thiel was an anomaly in his support for Trump, even ploughing another $1.25m to the campaign shortly after Trump boasted about sexually assaulting women. </p><p>Trump's likely appointment of Jeffrey Eisenach as head of the regulator the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is another clear indicator. Eisenach, who served on transition teams for both <person><nameText>Ronald Reagan </nameText></person>in 1980 and George W Bush in 2000, is a vocal proponent of scaling back the powers of the FCC. He is also expected to push for reversal of the hard-fought 2015 net neutrality rules, which stops internet providers prioritizing more profitable or preferred services. </p><p>Apple and big tech (but mostly Apple)                   </p><p>The Cupertino-based company is a favourite target of Trump. In February 2016 he argued that the company should be forced to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by the San Bernardino killer.</p><p>\"First of all, Apple ought to give the security number [pin number] for that phone, OK?,\" he said at a rally in South Carolina on 19 February. \"What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give the security number. How do you like it? I just thought of that. Boycott Apple.\"</p><p>Trump also picked out Apple as an example of an American company that had moved its manufacturing overseas. \"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" he said in Virginia on 18 January.</p><p>Trump did not acknowledge that building Apple's computers, tablets and smartphones in the US may actually increase the cost of the end-products. An analysis by the MIT Technology Review estimated that the price of an iPhone 6S Plus would rise by between $30 to $100 per unit, depending how much of the manufacturing Apple was required to do in the US. Much of the extra cost would come from having to ship components into the country, rather than a difference in labor costs.</p><p>It was Googlethat came under fire when he spoke in Wisconsin on 28 September, for supposedly \" suppressing \" bad news about opponent Hillary Clinton. \"A new post-debate poll that just came out, the Googlepoll, has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide - and that's despite the fact that Googlesearch engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton,\" he said. The claim was based on a viral video that claimed to show how Google's search tool did not autocomplete the term \" Hillary body count \", but which was later debunked. </p><p>                   China                   </p><p>While Hillary Clinton was the main villain in the Trump campaign narrative, China came a close second, with Trump often questioning the US relationship with its second biggest trading partner. China is the manufacturing engine that drives the technology and consumer electronics sectors, with \"advanced technology products\" accounting for $103bn of all US imports from China in 2016 so far. </p><p>\"If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs,\" he told a crowd in Pennsylvania on 28 June. \"President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened US industry. His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45% and his tariff to shield America's semiconductor industry was 100%.\"</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>administration attempted trade tariffs on China, in 2009 applying 25-35% on tire imports. The initiative eventually failed because other low-cost trading partners filled the gap. China has already warned that it would respond aggressively to any attempt at levy high tariffs on Chinese goods coming into the US.</p><p> Related:  China threatens to cut sales of iPhones and US cars if 'naive' Trump pursues trade war</p><p>Some insiders think that tariffs may have positive effects, if Trump's administration was able to enforce them. Robert Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank, says the US is suffering from huge Chinese government subsidies to its domestic technology companies.</p><p>                     Chinese government subsidies of up to $160bn are helping Chinese companies build up their semiconductor industry by buying up American and European semiconductor companies at huge premiums to market prices. \"[China] has ramped up its efforts to do indigenous innovation with a set of policies and practices that are hurting US firms and US jobs. It has continued unabated and grown,\" said Atkinson, who also co-chairs a White House policy group on China.</p><p>                   Immigration                   </p><p>Technology companies have been lobbying for decades to increase the number of hlB visas, which allow skilled workers to work temporarily in the US, but have been met with stiff opposition. The Forward.us coalition, which includes Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, wanted to make the 2016 election a \"referendum on immigration reform\", explaining how they battle for a small number of global technology specialists. With Trump, that mission seems likely to get harder.</p><p>\"The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,\" Trump said in a statement on 3 March. \"I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices... I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\"</p><p>Schmidt expressed hope that Trump might be convinced by technology companies once he takes office. \"What do each and every one of those companies need? High-value, high-quality, high levels of education immigration. Every one of them is powered completely by those policies, which have been stuck for 20 years,\" he said. \"We bring these incredibly intelligent people into our country, we have the best educational system by far at the college and graduate school level, we kick them out after we give them these incredibly expensive degrees - which we help subsidize - and then they go an create competitors to our companies.\"</p><p>                   Corporate tax reform                   </p><p>Apple is dealing with a complex problem in Ireland, where the European Commission is seeking \" recovery of illegal state aid \" for alleged unpaid taxes of up to (EURO)13bn, plus interest. It is standard for global businesses to exploit loopholes that allow them to register profits in countries with lower corporate tax rates, though that means the profits (and taxes that go with them) don't come back to the US. The US government has already said it would like that tax revenue back, and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>says he has ways of making it happen. </p><p>\"Under my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the US, we will put a 35% tariff on those products,\" he said in Ohio on 27 October. \"As part of our plan to bring back American jobs, we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35% down to 15%.\" </p><p>Trump is more likely to cut corporate tax to between 20 to 25%, Atkinson says. </p><p>                   Terrorism                   </p><p>The radicalisation of people online, and its relationship to terrorist attacks, became a campaign issue for Trump.</p><p> Related:  Silicon Valley investors call for California to secede from the US after Trump win</p><p>\"We're losing a lot of people because of the internet and we have to do something. We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas closing that internet up in some way,\" Trump said on 7 December in South Carolina. \"Somebody will say - oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. These are foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We've got to do something with the internet because they are recruiting by the thousands.\"</p><p>Microsoft's chief legal officer Brad Smith re-asserted the need for government and the tech sector to collaborate, balancing privacy with public safety. </p><p>\"We've not only advocated for clearer and more modern US laws, but have filed lawsuits four times in the past three years against the current administration, standing up for what we believe are the vital rights of people both here and abroad,\" he wrote after the election. \"As we've won the cases we've brought, we've been reminded of one of this country's greatest strengths, its strong Constitution, independent judiciary, and the overarching rule of law.\" </p><p>                   Data privacy and surveillance                   </p><p>Trump brought up cybersecurity many times, often referring to it as \"cyber\", very much emphasizing his priority of increasing the security of government systems.</p><p>\"To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cybersecurity experts to comprehensively review all of our cybersecurity systems and technology,\" he promised on 3 October, speaking to veterans in Virginia. \"This will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.\"</p><p>Civil rights organisations have been quick to seize on the potential impact of Trump's policies on personal privacy. Neema Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Trump should \"categorically reject proposals to mandate encryption backdoors and supports reforming surveillance programs that have violated the rights of millions of Americans\".</p><p>That, however, is unlikely.</p><p>Given that so many in the technology industry either publicly or privately backed Trump's rival Hillary Clinton in the election, there is some concern that Trump might try to \"punish\" Silicon Valley. </p><p>\"He has a lot of people criticizing him and if he spent his whole time getting back at people, he wouldn't get anything done,\" said Atkinson. \"Trump is going to need the tech sector. You can't make America great again if you don't have a great tech industry.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-46276529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M6C-34R1-JCJY-G3H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1943\"/><timeReceived>12:16 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

But that pales in comparison to the declines sustained by the Chinese markets over the same period, as a confluence of factors has driven Chinese stocks to their lowest levels in years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before a sudden rally on Oct. 19, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index had been down almost 11 percent over the previous 10 trading days, and down about 25 percent year-to-date. The recent downturn sent the Shanghai Composite, which was already the weakest major global benchmark by performance in 2018, to its lowest since 2014.</p><p>Stocks turned positive on Oct. 19, after multiple Chinese regulators urged investors to remain calm. The loudest of them was Vice Premier Liu He, a Politburo member and the top economic adviser to Chinese communist leader Xi Jinping.</p><p>That snapped a string of four straight losing days for the Shanghai Composite, which rose by 64 points, or 2.6 percent, by the close. The index closed down 2.1 percent for the week.</p><p>Liu sought to calm investors by touching on several topics. He downplayed the impact of the continuing U.S.-China trade war by announcing that the two countries \"are now in contact with each other,\" according to a report by Xinhua, the Chinese state-owned media. Regarding collapsing equities, \"the corrections and sell-offs on the stock market are creating good investment opportunities for the longterm and healthy development of the stock market,\" he said.</p><p>Liu also implored banks to support privately owned companies of all sizes, to \"roll out precise and effective measures to help them.\"</p><p>Liu's statements came out moments before the release of more bad news. The National Bureau of Statistics posted official data that showed the GDP grew in the third quarter at only 6.5 percent, the slowest quarterly growth rate since the last financial crisis.</p><p>Echoing Liu, other regulators also came out to support the Chinese economy, including central bank governor Yi Gang, insurance and banking regulatory chief Guo snuqing, and securities regulator Liu Shiyu. In addition, the China Banking Regulatory Commission unveiled new draft guidance to give banks greater leeway to invest in the country's stock market, reversing a recent trend of tighter risk management.</p><p>A Perfect Storm</p><p>The events of Oct. 19 were a well-coordinated effort by several regulators to stop the stock market bleeding. But will the good vibes last more than one trading session?</p><p>The selloff in Chinese equities has been propelled by several factors. Major drivers include the trade war with Washington, negative sentiment regarding big tech stocks (which isn't exclusive to the Chinese markets), concerns over Chinese consumer spending, and currency weaknesses. Unfortunately, none of these catalysts are about to subside anytime soon.</p><p>One of the topics receiving less coverage has been the underlying weakness among Chinese technology giants.</p><p>While Tencent, at one point, could seemingly do no wrong, the mobile and gaming giant has struggled recently. The company has been caught up in a broader global downturn of technology stocks. Chinese regulation on gaming has also had a negative effect; Tencent recently reported its first quarterly profit decline in almost 13 years.</p><p>Gaming has been Tencent's bread and butter. But its growth has been hampered by Beijing's decision last month to restrict approving new video games, limit the number of new game releases, and crack down on the amount of time children are allowed to play games. Last month, Tencent announced a divisional restructuring to increase focus on cloud computing and services toward business and corporate clients.</p><p>The tumbling domestic markets have also propelled the Chinese yuan towards the key threshold of 7 yuan per U.S. dollar, a level not seen over the past 10 years. China's domestic problems could send the yuan lower and draw renewed criticism from the United States-a weaker yuan alleviates impact of the trade war by making Chinese exports cheaper.</p><p>\"So far, we think the tariffs' impact will more or less be offset by the fall in the renminbi. We'll see a bit of an increasing headwind next year, as tariffs come up. The economy is slowing, but mainly due to domestic factors,\" economist Chang Liu of Capital Economics told CNBC on Oct. 18.</p><p>The Worst Is Yet to Come</p><p>Amazingly, the brunt of the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war on China nasn t yet been reflected in economic data.</p><p>\"There hasn't been any real impact from the trade war yet,\" Andrew Polk, from the Beijingbased consultancy Trivium, told the Financial Times. \"There's always another round of tariffs coming that traders want to front-run.\"</p><p>Through the first nine months of 2018, Chinese exports have actually increased more than 14 percent compared to 2017, which is partially helped by the fact that the Chinese currency has declined against the dollar during the same period.</p><p>China's economic growth could slow at an accelerated pace as more U.S. tariffs take effect early next year. Any attempt to stimulate economic growth could risk undoing recent efforts in promoting financial responsibility.

But that pales in comparison to the declines sustained by the Chinese markets over the same period, as a confluence of factors has driven Chinese stocks to their lowest levels in years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before a sudden rally on Oct. 19, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index had been down almost 11 percent over the previous 10 trading days, and down about 25 percent year-to-date. The recent downturn sent the Shanghai Composite, which was already the weakest major global benchmark by performance in 2018, to its lowest since 2014.</p><p>Stocks turned positive on Oct. 19, after multiple Chinese regulators urged investors to remain calm. The loudest of them was Vice Premier Liu He, a Politburo member and the top economic adviser to Chinese communist leader Xi Jinping.</p><p>That snapped a string of four straight losing days for the Shanghai Composite, which rose by 64 points, or 2.6 percent, by the close. The index closed down 2.1 percent for the week.</p><p>Liu sought to calm investors by touching on several topics. He downplayed the impact of the continuing U.S.-China trade war by announcing that the two countries \"are now in contact with each other,\" according to a report by Xinhua, the Chinese state-owned media. Regarding collapsing equities, \"the corrections and sell-offs on the stock market are creating good investment opportunities for the longterm and healthy development of the stock market,\" he said.</p><p>Liu also implored banks to support privately owned companies of all sizes, to \"roll out precise and effective measures to help them.\"</p><p>Liu's statements came out moments before the release of more bad news. The National Bureau of Statistics posted official data that showed the GDP grew in the third quarter at only 6.5 percent, the slowest quarterly growth rate since the last financial crisis.</p><p>Echoing Liu, other regulators also came out to support the Chinese economy, including central bank governor Yi Gang, insurance and banking regulatory chief Guo snuqing, and securities regulator Liu Shiyu. In addition, the China Banking Regulatory Commission unveiled new draft guidance to give banks greater leeway to invest in the country's stock market, reversing a recent trend of tighter risk management.</p><p>A Perfect Storm</p><p>The events of Oct. 19 were a well-coordinated effort by several regulators to stop the stock market bleeding. But will the good vibes last more than one trading session?</p><p>The selloff in Chinese equities has been propelled by several factors. Major drivers include the trade war with Washington, negative sentiment regarding big tech stocks (which isn't exclusive to the Chinese markets), concerns over Chinese consumer spending, and currency weaknesses. Unfortunately, none of these catalysts are about to subside anytime soon.</p><p>One of the topics receiving less coverage has been the underlying weakness among Chinese technology giants.</p><p>While Tencent, at one point, could seemingly do no wrong, the mobile and gaming giant has struggled recently. The company has been caught up in a broader global downturn of technology stocks. Chinese regulation on gaming has also had a negative effect; Tencent recently reported its first quarterly profit decline in almost 13 years.</p><p>Gaming has been Tencent's bread and butter. But its growth has been hampered by Beijing's decision last month to restrict approving new video games, limit the number of new game releases, and crack down on the amount of time children are allowed to play games. Last month, Tencent announced a divisional restructuring to increase focus on cloud computing and services toward business and corporate clients.</p><p>The tumbling domestic markets have also propelled the Chinese yuan towards the key threshold of 7 yuan per U.S. dollar, a level not seen over the past 10 years. China's domestic problems could send the yuan lower and draw renewed criticism from the United States-a weaker yuan alleviates impact of the trade war by making Chinese exports cheaper.</p><p>\"So far, we think the tariffs' impact will more or less be offset by the fall in the renminbi. We'll see a bit of an increasing headwind next year, as tariffs come up. The economy is slowing, but mainly due to domestic factors,\" economist Chang Liu of Capital Economics told CNBC on Oct. 18.</p><p>The Worst Is Yet to Come</p><p>Amazingly, the brunt of the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war on China nasn t yet been reflected in economic data.</p><p>\"There hasn't been any real impact from the trade war yet,\" Andrew Polk, from the Beijingbased consultancy Trivium, told the Financial Times. \"There's always another round of tariffs coming that traders want to front-run.\"</p><p>Through the first nine months of 2018, Chinese exports have actually increased more than 14 percent compared to 2017, which is partially helped by the fact that the Chinese currency has declined against the dollar during the same period.</p><p>China's economic growth could slow at an accelerated pace as more U.S. tariffs take effect early next year. Any attempt to stimulate economic growth could risk undoing recent efforts in promoting financial responsibility. Beijing also faces an uphill battle in its trade war with the United States and rising U.S. interest rates.</p><p>Another wildcard for Chinese stock markets is the risk for margin calls, which will make any stock selloff go from bad to worse. Bloomberg estimates that more than $600 billion of Chinese shares are being pledged as collateral for loans, a level that is 11 percent of the country's total market capitalization.</p><p>These aren't individual investors who borrow on margin, but companies who used their restricted stock as collateral for leverage.</p><p>\"At least 144 Chinese companies have more than half their shares pledged, often the result of founders using their stakes to raise cash,\" according to data from Bloomberg, which noted that almost half-60 companieshave seen their stocks tumble by more than 50 percent this year.</p><p>A falling market will force companies to sell their pledged shares, further exacerbating any selloff.</p><p>Some of the policy changes introduced last week readied the country's banks and investment companies to support a wide range of publicly traded companies. Policymakers are no doubt concerned about the potential for a further downward spiral of the stock market.</p><p>But investors could soon realize that rescuing Chinese markets will require more than rhetoric.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2126793620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK2-N3M1-JC85-J0N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1070\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 300</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 22, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>WeChat</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Banking Regulatory Commission</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Financial Times</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Beijing China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Yi Gang</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Xi Jinping</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Liu He</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Regulation of financial institutions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Investments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tariffs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economic growth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock exchanges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Banking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock prices</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 518210</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 519130</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 926150</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 511110</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

While the merits of exporting U.S. law through trade agreements may be questionable, the importance of this protection is not \u2014 on both foreign and domestic fronts.</p><p><br/>The law the agreement is effectively exporting is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Its significance cannot be overstated. The law states that a user of an interactive computer service such as Facebook or YouTube cannot hold the platform liable for the content other users post.<br/>Legislators included this protection to address a quirk of tort law that developed in the courts: If a platform moderates any user content, it would have constructive knowledge of that content and thus be liable for all user content that was potentially defamatory. As a result, platforms would either have to remove any potentially controversial posts to avoid possible lawsuits or not moderate at all. Under either approach, legitimate speech would suffer.<br/>By clarifying that platforms are not the publisher or speaker of user-generated content, the law allows platforms to moderate user content that serves to harass or stifle the speech of others while giving them the flexibility to leave up potentially controversial but legitimate posts without fear that they will be sued.<br/>Including this language in the USMCA, then, is not only good for the economy, but also vital to protecting user speech on these platforms. If platforms find that they may be liable for offensive content in foreign jurisdictions, they may be forced to remove the content from their platform entirely. Indeed, just as China can manipulate American basketball players\u2019 speech through pressure on the National Basketball Association, foreign governments can exert pressure on internet platforms to remove speech they don\u2019t like. Intermediary liability protections in trade agreements add a layer of protection against foreign government jawboning.<br/>Despite the importance of these protections, fears about Big Tech here at home still drive many to question their wisdom. Unfortunately, most criticisms rely on misunderstandings of the statute and the internet ecosystem.<br/>First, some conservatives argue that Section 230\u2019s liability protection is predicated on a platform being neutral, citing the legislative findings in the statute. Yet these findings, which are not binding law, only state that platforms offer a forum for a \u201ctrue diversity of political discourse.\u201d<br/>Of course, this was true then and remains true today. Social media, facilitated by liability protection, has driven the expansion of a variety of political positions and perspectives that may have otherwise been stifled by their lack of mainstream appeal. But nowhere does the law state that platforms must be neutral. Doing so would run counter to the goal of the statute: allowing platforms to moderate the content based on market and consumer interests rather than political pressure from Washington.<br/>Second, the law isn\u2019t a gift to or a sweet deal for Big Tech. The protections in Section 230 apply to any service that allows users to post and share content. Whether it be an innovative service like Wikipedia or a small startup trying to compete with Big Tech, or even a traditional news outlet that allows users to comment on their stories, everyone in the online ecosystem benefits from and relies on the protections Section 230 provides. Indeed, many nascent and smaller companies would not survive the significant litigation costs that Section 230 protects them from. As the regulatory costs tend to be felt more deeply by smaller startups and competitors of Big Tech, removing Section 230 protection would only bury small platforms with the tort liability regimes of the 1990s and further entrench the dominant firms into their current market positions.<br/>Finally, it is important to remember this isn\u2019t a political issue. In fact, there is actually widespread bipartisan agreement on the importance of strong intermediary liability protections. In July, for example, a coalition of civil society organizations and experts who study the regulation of user-generated content sent a letter to lawmakers outlining the general principles that should govern liability for user-generated content. The letter encouraged lawmakers to make sure any amendments to the law held users, not platforms, primarily responsible for the content they create and to avoid discouraging platforms from moderating content.<br/>Including strong intermediary liability protections in the USMCA is a tremendous win for users. Moving forward, we shouldn\u2019t let fears about Big Tech ruin what made the internet what it is today.<br/>The post Strong Intermediary Liability Protections in the USMCA are a Big Win for Americans appeared first on R Street.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-84632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS9-3PK1-JBJN-M3M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 17, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In 2018, they weathered more rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve, the increased capital provisions of IFRS 9, and the protectionist zeal of President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the most part, they enjoy impressive efficiency ratios, Tier 1 capital buffers and consistently rising returns on equity. Japan is the notable exception, as its banks struggle with the impact of ultralow interest rates on margins and an inauspicious demographic mix crimps demand for retail loans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like their counterparts elsewhere, however, Asia's banking CEOs know they face a digital revolution that requires them to execute a scalable innovation-based business strategy in an evermore cutthroat regional banking ecosystem if they are to maintain solid growth in return on equity. They have been investing heavily in digitization, bringing them to the brink of some critical decisions: whether to be a first mover or a fast follower, how to apply new technology to legacy systems in a cost-efficient manner, and how to address the growing threat of data theft and cyber fraud.</p><p>In doing so, they may have some advantages over their global rivals. \"Asian banks for the most part emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis, with higher levels of capital versus their Western peers, and have been less distracted by risk and regulation,\" says Jan Bellens, sector leader for Banking &amp; Capital Markets at EY in Singapore. \"Hence, they have been able to embrace digitization and innovation more comprehensively, helped by an open mindset among regional regulators. In 2018, the region's banks demonstrated they are increasingly able to leverage data and meet the challenges of a demanding customer base, Bellens adds, \"while at the same time collaborating with fintech and big tech.\"</p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"208\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Afghanistan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">AIB</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Armenia</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Ardshin Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Australia</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Westpac</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Azerbaijan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">PASHA Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bangladesh</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The City Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brunei Darussalam</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Baiduri Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cambodia</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ABA Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ICBC</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Georgia</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">TBC Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hong Kong</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The Bank of East Asia</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">India</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">State Bank of India</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Indonesia</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Bank Mandiri</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Japan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SMBC</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kazakhstan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Forte Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kyrgyzstan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Optima Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macau</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ICBC Macau</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Malaysia</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Public Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mongolia</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Khan Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Myanmar</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">CB Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nepal</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Rastrija Banija</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New Zealand</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ASB Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pakistan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Meezan Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Philippines</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">BDO Unibank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Singapore</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">DBS Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">South Korea</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">KEB Hana Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sri Lanka</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Commercial Bank of Ceylon</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taiwan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Cathay United</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thailand</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Bangkok Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uzbekistan</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Asia Alliance Bank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vietnam</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MSB</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>The award for overall Best Bank in Asia-Pacific goes to Singapore-based powerhouse <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OCBC</emphasis>, Southeast Asia's second-largest bank. With an overwhelming 87% of financial transactions in Singapore completed digitally, it's no surprise that OCBC is centering its business plan on digital transformation. The bank has earned a reputation for strategic collaboration with fintech and ecosystem partners; some 95% of its new customers in the city-state are digital. The OCBC OneWealth app, using an OpenAPI platform, enables third parties to integrate OCBC products and services; and Emma, an AI-powered chatbot, answers home-loan queries. The bank even uses facial-recognition technology in some transactions.</p><p>OCBC has territorial ambitions, as well. Last June, it launched its Greater Bay Area strategy in China with a S$ 200 million investment over five years. OCBC aims to derive S$ 1 billion in annual profit from the project by 2023, accounting for 70% of its Chinese revenue. The bank already has 100 branches across the Greater Bay area, which includes Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, and has an established network across the Asia-Pacific region, from Australia in the east to Myanmar in the west.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</emphasis>, the country's largest commercial lender and world's biggest lender by assets, delivered 4.1% profit growth last year (US$ 44.26 billion), besting 2017's 2.85% profit growth. Notably, the bank achieved gains of 6.5% and 6.2% in business revenue and total assets, respectively. It was also something of an achievement given the country's slower GDP growth, softer local bourses and fears that an intensifying trade war with the US could precipitate a full-blown debt crisis.</p><p>Like its peers among the Chinese megabank, ICBC benefited last year from a regulatory crackdown on the ultra-aggressive lending practices of the shadow banking industry, reducing competitive pressure on China's established banking giants. Margins for the big Chinese institutions were aided in 2018 by an accommodative liquidity stance from the central bank. ICBC's net interest margin came in at 2.3%, an increase of 8 basis points over 2017. Non-performing loans declined 3 basis points to 1.52%, the eighth consecutive quarterly drop, and delivered via the disposal of Rmb226.5 billion non-performing loans.</p><p>Promisingly, ICBC's investment in digital banking appears to be delivering cost reductions; the bank's cost-to-income ratio declined by more than 1% to 25.7%.</p><p>Singapore's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DBS Bank</emphasis> clocked its 50th year of operations by pulling in record earnings in 2018 to mark its Golden Jubilee year. Total income hit S$ 13.2 billion while net profit rose 28% to S$ 5.63 billion for a healthy 12.1% ROE-a return last seen as long ago as 2007-and the bank increased it dividend over the previous year by 29%.</p><p>The bank's mission statement is rooted firmly in sustainability, from financing renewables, originating and distributing Green and social bonds, championing gender diversity and supporting social enterprises.</p><p>DBS enjoys some of the highest credit ratings for any bank globally (AA-/Aa1 from S&amp;P/Moody's) and weathered a challenging year thanks to interest rate increases that improved NIM together with the full integration of its acquisition of ANZ's wealth management and retail banking divisions.</p><p>The bank's digital transformation continues apace, with 82% of the bank's open systems Cloud-ready and a structure in place in which business and technology teams are co-drivers of 35 \"platforms.\" This is already paying off in terms of productivity, with the bank enjoying a reduction in its cost to in-come ratio to 44% in 2018.</p><p>In Japan, the ultralow interest rate policy that has prevailed since the introduction of Abenomics in an effort to reflate the economy continued to mark a less-than-auspicious landscape for its banking industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMBC</emphasis> increased consolidated profit by \u00a560.3 in fiscal 2017 thanks to a strong performance by its Re-tail Business Unit and solid profit generation from its credit card and overseas business.</p><p>This was an impressive performance amid the gloom which has begun to intensify in a banking indus-try where a belief in the terminal decline of Japanese banks' earning power has gripped the industry's CEOs.</p><p>Credit costs improved \u00a570.2 billion year-on-year thanks to the reversal of costs from provisions made in the past from key corporate customers. In the meantime SMBC enjoyed \u00a563.9 billion from gains in stock holdings.</p><p>In fiscal 2017, ROE came in at a respectable plus 8.8% while the bank hit its overhead ratio target of 60.9%, thanks in large part to prudent cost control, and realised a 9.5% CET1 ratio, despite the tight-ened international regulatory accounting environment.</p><p>The bank has a strong commitment to ESG, having issued the first Green bonds to emerge from Japan's financial sector, and offers a range of ESG-compliant products, including ECO loans offered to certified SMEs.</p><p>Banking in Australia faced multiple headwinds in 2018, including: the delayed impact of the bank levy on the country's largest institutions introduced the prior year; the effects on customer sentiment of the findings of a Royal Commission investigation into misconduct in the industry; and a slowdown in system loan and deposit growth.</p><p>In Australia, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Westpac</emphasis> produced cash earnings totaling just over A $ 8 billion in 2018, more or less flat year-on-year, with loan growth up 4% and customer deposits up 6%. Against this somewhat meager performance were bright spots, including a strengthening balance sheet with ordinary equity up 6%, strong credit quality, and improving funding and liquidity ratios. ROE for 2018 came in at 13%, down from 13.8% in 2017 but still besting the 11.3% average achieved by US banks last year, and net interest margin improved by 2 basis points to 2.11%.</p><p>Westpac continues to make strides in digital innovation. Last year, it enabled check deposit by mobile phone and payments by digital assistant Siri while gradually reducing the use of paper-based systems. In New Zealand <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ASB Bank</emphasis> offers a broad range of financial services including business, retail and rural banking. Against the backdrop of a thriving New Zealand economy, the bank grew deposits and lending and managed to return a decent 15% return on average equity in 2018 via a 10% increase in net post-tax profit. its loan delinquency rates were low.</p><p>India's Mumbai-headquartered <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">State Bank of India</emphasis> continues to reap the rewards of its status as In-dia's largest commercial bank in terms of assets, deposits, branches, number of customers and em-ployees. The bank is driven by its \"Reform, Perform and Transform\" mission statement, with this statement most fully realised in the bank's ongoing digital transformation.</p><p>A digital highlight in 2018 was the introduction of an integrated omni-channel digital platform YONO, India's first fully digital service platform designed to facilitate banking and lifestyle needs via a B2C marketplace.</p><p>Meanwhile the bank continues to grasp the nettle of stressed assets under the Insolvency and Bank-ruptcy Code, while deposits grew steadily by 4.7% in 2018, led by a near 8% growth in savings bank deposits. The bank is the largest home loan lender in India, with around 32% of the market.</p><p>Pakistan's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Meezan Bank</emphasis> posted sparkling results in 2018, growing its deposit base by over 18% and its loan book by 22%, while for the first time its trade business exceeded Rs1 trillion. In 2018, Meezan worked with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Karandaaz Pakistan, a nonprofit that promotes access to finance for SMEs, to enhance its penetration in the SME and commercial sectors. Meezan enjoyed a 1.29% ratio of non-performing loans in 2018, one of the country's lowest, and enjoyed heady 59% growth in fee-based income.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">City Bank Bangladesh</emphasis> has transformed itself since inception in 1983 from a somewhat traditional banking enterprise into a multi-faceted technology-driven lender. It operates out of 130 branches, marketing its brand via the slogan \"More banking. Less Bank.\" The bank has enjoyed a consistent growth rate in deposits and loans in recent years and has been at the forefront of Bangladesh's export-driven economic growth.</p><p>Sri Lanka's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial Bank of Ceylon</emphasis> bested its competitors in 2018, pulling in Rs13.8 billion after tax for a 34.37% jump in operating income in a year when gross income surpassed Rs100 billion for the first time. Interest income swelled by 17.4% and net interest margin widened to 4% from 3.62%, well ahead of its regional peers.</p><p>\"We recorded impressive growth in all key areas in 2018,\" CEO S. Renganathan tells <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Global Finance</emphasis>, \"despite the challenges encountered by way of increased taxation and higher levels of non-performing loans, resulting in increased provisions for impairment charges arising from IFRS 9 implementation.\"</p><p>In South Korea, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEB Hana Bank</emphasis>, which was created from the merger of Korea Exchange Bank and Hana Bank in 2015, has since earned a reputation as a digital innovator and a lender able to leverage its global brand presence. KEB Hana has a robust balance sheet, enjoying a 16.5% Tier 1 CAR while posting a 10.05% ROE in 2018. KEB aims to align its digital innovation ambitions with a sustainability initiative, using data analysis to price bonds and loans for financing or refinancing of projects with clear environmental and social benefits, especially for SMEs. Areas of interest include affordable housing, clean transportation, renewable energy, financial inclusion and green buildings.</p><p>Indonesia's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bank Mandiri</emphasis> was created in 1999 out of the merger of four banks under a government restructuring effort necessitated by the Asian financial crisis. Twenty years later, it is actively engaged in reducing its non-performing loans, having shrunk its NPL ratio to 2.8% at the end of 2018 from 3.5% a year earlier. The improvement in asset quality combined with consistently rising operating income to prompt a ratings upgrade this year, underlining the bank's recent positive trajectory. Net income rose a healthy 14.4% ROE in 2018, to Rp25 billion.</p><p>In Malaysia, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Public Bank</emphasis> managed a healthy 14.7% ROE in 2018, the highest in the domestic industry, while enjoying the lowest cost-to-income ratio (33%) and the highest earnings-per-share growth (144.2%) in Malaysian banking. Impaired loans were low at 0.5%, again the lowest among Public's peer group, where impaired loans range from 0.8% (at Hong Leong Bank) to 3.1% (at CIMB).</p><p>Last year, Public consolidated its leading position in consumer banking, retail commercial lending to SMEs, and its private unit trust business. Its domestic loan portfolio is dominated by residential property financing; this segment grew 8.1% in 2018.</p><p>Thailand's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bangkok Bank</emphasis> turned in a solid performance in 2018, cementing its reputation as one of Southeast Asia's leading commercial institutions. Against a still sluggish economy, the bank delivered 7.9% income growth and a profit increase of 7.2% for ROE of 8.7%. Bangkok Bank has the largest international network among Thai banks, covering 32 locations as far afield as the US and UK and including a presence in nine out of 10 ASEAN countries.</p><p>In the Philippines, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BDO Unibank</emphasis> topped its peer group last year in several categories. Its loan portfolio expanded by 17.3% while deposits grew 12.2%. BDO registers a low-cost current account/savings account (CASA) ratio of 70%, one of the highest in the Philippines, which means it enjoys one the lowest funding costs among its peers. BDO also earned its place in the ESG stakes last year by issuing a US$ 150 million green bond to finance climate-smart projects in the Philippines.</p><p>Hong Kong's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bank of East Asia</emphasis> last year revamped its BEA mobile phone app, which utilises big data analysis of customer footprints to provide tailored suggestions and services and includes the i-Planner which integrates banking with lifestyle options.</p><p>The bank has earned a reputation in Hong Kong for leading the pack in terms of fintech; it has adopted a \"mobile-first\" approach, via which its aims to synchronise its entire suite of services according to a mobile template. It is on the cusp of major advances in the area of open APIs.</p><p>In Vietnam, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MSB</emphasis>, formerly Maritime Bank, grew its assets substantially in 2018, by 24% over the previous year, while the stability of the bank's balance sheet was clearly demonstrated by a rise in owner's equity at the end of the year. Earnings grew over the period by an eye-opening 700%, thanks to a 43% rise in net fee income, allowing for a 0.9% increase in ROE for the period, to 6.36%.</p><p>The bank focused its business model on SMEs in 2018 and this afforded a rise in corporate lending by 37%, with more than 4,000 new customers added over the period. MSB opened seven new branches in 2018 and now has 270 branches in 47 provinces in Vietnam.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CB Bank</emphasis> is Myanmar's fastest growing bank and is comfortably placed to take advantage of the company's integration into the global economy. Last year, it rolled out CB Pay, a mobile banking app with wallet features that allow customers to access their accounts from any location and open new accounts online. CB's digital ambitions go beyond banking, however; the next round of CB Pay, CB Pay API, will connect to multiple apps and platforms such as online food delivery services, e-commerce, travel, and ticketing apps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ICBC Macau</emphasis> is the largest locally registered bank in the former Portuguese colony, with US$ 38.5 billion in assets, 19 branches, and three subsidiaries. ICBC sits front and center of China's One Belt One Road (OBOR) infrastructure development initiative and is a crucial lender to Macau's Five-Year Development Plan. Last year, ICBC Macau signed an MOU with the local government aiming to embed Macau and the Portuguese-speaking countries within OBOR.</p><p>The bank provides comprehensive corporate-banking and traditional investment-banking services, including syndicated lending, project and trade finance, and commercial loans. One of its key financial undertakings in the project finance arena has been to fund the construction of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which authorities bill as the world's longest sea crossing and longest open-sea fixed link.</p><p>Brunei's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Baiduri Bank</emphasis> is known within the region for innovation and consistent delivery of strong results, and is regarded as Brunei's leader in financial services. Baiduri offers customers an enhanced internet banking service as well as the Personal i-Banking app, both accessible anywhere in the world. Baiduri's balance sheet strengthened in 2018 as it posted a 14% gain in Tier 1 capital alongside a 7% growth in assets; net profits surged 33%.</p><p>In Taiwan, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cathay United Bank</emphasis> is building on its strong onshore franchise to expand overseas, principally in China. Parent Cathay Financial Holdings is Taiwan's largest financial conglomerate, with assets totaling US$ 304 billion, and its subsidiaries in insurance and asset management claim one in every two Taiwanese as its customer. Pretax ROE for Cathay United in 2018 was 13% while the offshore subsidiaries delivered an impressive 46%.</p><p>In Kyrgystan, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Optima Bank</emphasis> leads the sector, claiming 14% of banking system assets, a well-capitalized balance sheet, a diversified credit and deposit portfolio, and a geographical spread across the country. In operation for 25 years, Optima has worked closely with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to expand access to funding for Kyrgystan's SMEs.</p><p>Mongolia's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Khan Bank</emphasis>-born from the recapitalisation of the failing AgBank 20 years ago-is the country's largest commercial bank and provides banking services to an estimated 80% of Mongolia's families. Just over a year ago, the bank borrowed US$ 120 million under the syndicate direction of the Dutch development bank FMO to be devoted to SME lending within Mongolia.</p><p>In Kazakhstan, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ForteBank</emphasis> was modestly impacted by IFRS 9 accounting regulations, taking a Kzt13.4 billion charge on loans and contingent liabilities. Net income powered ahead, however, rising to 2Kzt8.6 billion last year from Kzt18.5 billion in 2017 while foreign exchange revenue jumped to Kzt8.8 billion from Kzt5.9 billion, the cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.3% from 53.3%, and ROE pushed up to 10.3% from 7%.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Asia Alliance Bank</emphasis> in Uzbekistan grew its total assets by 28% in 2018, with net loans increasing 42% and customer deposits growing by 32% for the review period. Non-performing loans increased for the period by 33%, albeit to a relatively manageable 3.2%. The bank offers a full range of traditional and modern banking services and operates via 9 branches, 15 mini-banks and 14 cash desks.</p><p>Armenia's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ardshin Bank</emphasis> has been in operation in the country for over 15 years and now boasts 64 branches from which it operates in the corporate and retail lending space.

Those could kick in if a special congressional committee fails to agree on $1.2 trillion in U.S. budget cuts by Nov. 23. Then there's the nation's 9.1% unemployment rate. Fewer jobs mean less demand for elective surgery and procedures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite all the uncertainty, medical software makers including Athenahealth, Cerner and Quality Systems have seen solid sales and earnings growth this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All sell software and services to hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The stocks all staged relatively mild pullbacks vs. the market's recent correction, which helped lift the Computer Software-Medical group to a solid top 20 ranking among the 197 industries tracked by IBD.</p><p>Why is the medical software group trending up when some health segments are so sickly?</p><p>Hospitals and doctors are projected to hike spending on information technology, especially electronic medical/health record systems. That's because more than $27 billion in federal economic stimulus funds has been set aside for hospitals, clinics and others under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (Hitech).</p><p>No matter what happens with ObamaCare or Medicare cuts, Hitech spending is forecast to continue.</p><p>To qualify for the funds, hospitals and physician groups must switch from paper medical records to digital systems. And health care providers must hit the Hitech Act's \"meaningful use\" targets for providing patient data in electronic form to the government.</p><p>The aim is to ease health care costs through more accurate, more efficient medical records.</p><p>The funding for the upgrades to digital record-keeping is helping get hospitals and doctors' groups off their duff and into the 21 st century, says Morgan Keegan analyst Jamie Stockton.</p><p>\"If you go into a doctor's office right now, walk up to the registration desk and look up, there's something like 4,000 manila folders on the shelves,\" Stockton said.</p><p>The major theme in the industry right now is hospitals and physician practices transitioning from paper-based medical records to electronic health record (EHR) technology, he says: \"The government is bankrolling a lot of this, incentivizing health care providers to get software installed, in order to get better-quality (patient treatment) data.\"</p><p>1. Business</p><p>Beyond hospitals and physician groups, medical software makers also sell to clinics, outpatient care settings, surgery centers and long-term care facilities. Revenue comes from software licenses, subscription fees, and installation and training services.</p><p>Most hospitals converted their financial and administrative functions to software long ago. Now the process is taking hold on the clinical side, which involves patient care information, such as medication usage, checkup history and test results.</p><p>Athenahealth focuses on selling Web-based revenue management software to small and midsize physician groups. Computer Programs &amp; Systems sells both financial and clinical data software to small and midsize hospitals.</p><p>Cerner, the biggest medical software firm, sells a broad range of EMR/EHR systems.</p><p>The market is highly fragmented, with some 5,000 hospitals and 600,000 physician groups.</p><p>Medical software firms need large sales teams to canvass those markets and develop customer relationships. Because many hospitals make buying decisions by committee, the sales process can be slow.</p><p>One plus for established providers is that hospital IT systems tend to be arcane and complex, making them difficult to remove and replace. Once a sale is made, hospitals often stick with their same software providers.</p><p>Doctors and hospitals are generally low-margin service providers with tight IT budgets. Hospitals often invest in revenue-producing medical equipment such as CT scanners, rather than buy software that improves workflow.</p><p>However, the average hospital stands to garner $5 million in funding through the Hitech Act. Physician groups are likely to average around $50,000, analysts say.</p><p>Medical software firms have responded by releasing new products compliant with Hitech regulations. The programs also help hospitals and doctors document \"meaningful use\" of new EMR/EHR systems.</p><p>The systems automate the recording of patient data in daily activities, and they deliver required information to government health agencies. They also help hospitals track, for example, how many patients are smokers or overweight.</p><p>UBS analyst Stephen Shankman says medical software firms have stepped up hiring in order to provide implementation and training services when hospital or doctor groups buy new EMR/EHR systems. He says more companies are providing consulting type services related to Hitech Act provisions.</p><p>** Name of the game: Medical software firms are focused on helping clients qualify for Hitech funds by hitting meaningful use targets, says Shankman.</p><p>\"There are three stages to meaningful use and at each one, there are hurdles for hospitals in order to qualify for incentive payments,\" he said. \"Getting their EHR clients implemented and using the systems in meaningful-use fashion in order to qualify is what it's all about right now.\"</p><p>2. Market</p><p>Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which seeded Hitech programs, in February 2009. Hitech money began flowing to hospitals early this year.</p><p>Many hospitals and doctor groups have already teamed with IT suppliers for the first stage of implementing new EHR systems, says George Hill, a Citigroup analyst.</p><p>It's no longer a \"green-field opportunity\" for medical software firms, Hill says, because first-stage hospital contracts have been doled out. He adds that it's key for the medical software business to get a greater share of hospital spending as they move to stages two and three of meaningful-use requirements, which take effect in 2013 and 2015.</p><p>The EMR/EHR market will grow to $3.79 billion in 2015, up from $2.26 billion in 2010, says market research firm IDC Health Insights. Hospitals will account for 80% of spending on EMR/EHR systems, it says.</p><p>While such outlays are rising, hospitals have slowed spending on revenue cycle management (RCM) software that handles customer billing, processing insurance claims, patient scheduling and other back-office functions.</p><p>In addition, hospitals have been buying large physician groups in order to increase their flow of patient referrals. As a result, hospitals exert a growing influence over which software physicians use, says Charles Rhyee, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co.</p><p>\"Hospitals are becoming bigger decision-makers in terms of not only what they purchase but also what doctors buy around them,\" he said. \"They're deciding what the doctors affiliated with them will use.\"</p><p>Medical software makers are, in turn, working to increase their marketing reach through partnerships.</p><p>In August, computer maker Dell said it would sell software from Quality Systems' subsidiary, NextGen Healthcare Information Systems. Cardinal Health, a distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, sells Allscripts' software to doctor offices.</p><p>3. Climate</p><p>Competition and takeover activity is heating up in the medical IT market.</p><p>The RCM software is getting crowded, with MedAssets facing tougher competition from rivals McKesson, Accretive Health and privately held Epic, among others, says Hill.</p><p>Other privately held operators, including Greenway Medical Technologies and eClinicalWorks, as well as the divisions of larger players such as General Electric also compete in some software areas.</p><p>Other major tech players could make deals to position themselves for Hitech-related revenue growth, some analysts say.</p><p>The industry went through a rash of consolidation between 2000 and 2005: Siemens bought Shared Medical Systems, GE acquired IDX Systems, IBM purchased Healthlink and Accenture acquired the North American health practice of consulting firm Capgemini.</p><p>But analysts say some health care acquisitions made by big tech firms have not turned out well, dimming the outlook for more deals.</p><p>But one possible area of merger activity hinges on the growing influence of hospitals over physicians when it comes to buying decisions. That trend could favor companies that offer both hospital and physician office software platforms, says Morgan Keegan's Stockton.</p><p>\"Allscripts' merger with Eclipsys last year was directly driven by that trend,\" he said.</p><p>Allscripts, which catered to the physician market, bought Eclipsys for its strong base of hospital customers.</p><p>Quality Systems, with roots in dental group practices, has been expanded into serving doctors' offices and hospitals since 2008. In August, it announced it would acquire CQI Solutions. In April, it inked a deal for IntraNexus.</p><p>4. Technology</p><p>Upgrading to Hitech-compliant technology is a priority for the nation's hospitals, says a survey by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).</p><p>One of the fastest-growing categories: computer-based physician order entry (CPOE) software. The programs digitally record what lab tests, radiology exams and medications patients may require in emergency departments or what physical therapy they might need when released from hospitals, says Judy Hanover, an analyst at IDC Health Insights. By keeping better tabs on drug allergies, for example, the order entry systems should cut down on medical errors in hospitals.</p><p>Cerner aims to be a leader in CPOE systems but Epic Systems, GE Healthcare, McKesson and others have also targeted the area, says Hanover.</p><p>While back-office, financial RCM systems are a mature market, HIMSS says hospitals and doctors will increase purchases of next-generation systems that provide online patient registration, self-scheduling and insurance eligibility verification.</p><p>5. Outlook</p><p>Expectations have been running high for many companies in the group since Congress approved the Hitech Act. And a JPMorgan survey of hospital chief financial officers says that only two out of 25 CFOs cited IT as an area of possible budget cuts, even if Congress pares back Medicare spending.</p><p>But costs have been climbing among medical software firms as they hire more salespeople and training consultants.</p><p>With double-digit profit growth estimates the norm for many companies in the group, the big question is how many of them can deliver improved margins, earnings surprises and upward revisions.</p><p>** Upside: Insurance companies may step in and provide incentives for hospitals and doctors to upgrade software once federal stimulus funding eventually winds down.</p><p>** Risks: As hospitals and doctor groups upgrade to electronic record systems, patient privacy remains a central concern.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-3706924</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53PH-V5F1-DYTD-933B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

The Western world, especially since 2009, seems to have forgotten how to expand its economy at any reasonable speed. The rest of the world is making up for this, with Africa in particular beginning to rival the explosive growth rates that Asia achieved in the previous two decades. But most of this is catch-up growth, caused by adopting the innovations already in use in the West.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By contrast, the forces of complacency and stagnation sometimes seem to be winning in Europe, America and Japan. Fredrik Erixon and Bjorn Weigel, in their book, The Innovation Illusion: How So Little is Created by So Many Working So Hard, argue that the existential challenge of today's capitalism is to break the habit of both companies' and governments' reluctance to encourage innovation, despite their words.</p><p>Schumpeter's \"perennial gale of creative destruction\" has been replaced by the gentle breezes of rent-seeking. Corporate managerialism is gradually squeezing the life out of enterprise as big companies in cosy cahoots with big government increasingly dominate the scene. Their bosses shy away from uncertainty, and instead make their companies increasingly bureaucratic. Econ\u00adomists such as Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon have likewise argued that we are no longer inventing things that really change the world, like toilets and cars, but increasingly playing with trivia like social media.</p><p/><p>One immediate effect of the COVID-19 virus was to shut down the world economy. As it spread through Europe and other continents in March, governments took the tough decision to lock down their populations, telling all but essential workers to stay at home. The impact has been devastating, but it is worth reflecting on how much worse it would have been 20 years before, when videoconference calls to grandchildren were not an option for most people, online meetings were impossible and online shopping barely existed. The existence of broadband made the lockdown far more productive for some than it would have been before, and probably caused many people to rethink their commuting habits. </p><p>In this way the pandemic should surely unleash a torrent of innovation. It looks like it has tipped a critical mass of the population into videoconferencing for the first time, introducing many of us to systems like Zoom, Teams, Facetime and Skype. </p><p>Virtually productive</p><p>Maybe it is naive, but I hope I can attend literary festivals all over the world to publicise this book without slogging through airports, security checks, hotel lobbies and time zones. Surely, too, working from home will be much more common and less stigmatised after the pandemic fades, as will virtual visits to the doctor and other professionals. </p><p>Already in some countries workers are demanding more rights to work from home. Productivity in the healthcare, accounting and legal sectors can surely begin to accelerate, instead of stagnating, if tele-meeting innovations are permitted to help here. There has been a surge of free data sharing to help researchers, too, and the opening up of access to scientific papers. The profiteering oligopolies of scientific publishing will surely not be the same after this. Lack of free access to the research that we all pay for has long been a scandal.</p><p>The demise of cash has probably been accelerated, as has the decline of high-street retailing in favour of online. Some social events like videoconferenced dinners - invented during the lockdown for friends to see each other - will fade away again as we go back to real parties, but not the family chats among those living far from parents or grandparents.</p><p>Digital innovation has medical uses, too. The ability to trace the movements of people by their smartphones, and thus track down contacts with infected people, was widely used in countries such as South Korea and will be key to managing the disease everywhere.</p><p> This technology is already being made even more effective, safer and more confidential. For example, smartphones will exchange encrypted but meaningless messages that leave a trail of anonymised data revealing when two people came close to each other, one of whom was infected. Thus you could be warned that you should self-isolate by your phone without anybody in government or a big tech firm knowing your name or your habits. Contact tracing need not lead us into the clammy embrace of Big Brother. It's not saying no that is the problem, it's saying yes slowly. </p><p/><p>These few bright spots notwithstanding, there will be terrible economic damage to be repaired when the pandemic ends. A deep recession is inevitable. Unemployment will greatly increase, inflation will rocket, many people's debts will become unsustainable, trade protectionism will spread.</p><p>These shocks will undoubtedly hit the poor the hardest, ruining many lives. And it is here that the world must learn the main lesson of this book. Prosperity comes from innovation, innovation comes from the freedom to experiment and try new things, and freedom relies upon sensible regulation that is permissive, encouraging and quick to give decisions.</p><p>Tripped up by red tape</p><p>By far the surest way to rediscover rapid economic growth and help the poorest will be to study the regulatory delays and hurdles that were swept aside to encourage innovators in medical devices and therapies during the pandemic, then see whether such reforms could be made permanent and applied to other parts of the economy, too. Again and again during the crisis I have spoken to entrepreneurs and scientists frustrated at the unnecessary delays introduced by bureaucratic procedures. Ten days to finalise a contract for the government to purchase diagnostic tests, for example. The lack of urgency displayed by administrators, consultants and legal negotiators, especially in the public sector, is a problem in a crisis but it should have been a problem all along.</p><p> Whether it is approving a new medical device or building a new airport runway, the process of decision-making has become lethargic to the point of paralysis and encrusted with the requirement to reward legions of unelected \"consultees\" for their leisurely attention. The problem for entrepreneurs, watching their capital dwindle as they try to bring an innovation to market, is not so much that regulators say no, but that they take an age to say yes. If we are to return to prosperity after the virus, that has to change.</p><p>Politicians should go further and rethink their incentives for innovation more generally so that we are never again caught out with too little innovation having happened in a crucial field of human endeavour. One option is to expand the use of prizes, to replace reliance on grants and patents. The famous Longitude Prize was a \u00a320,000 prize offered in 1714 for the first person to solve the problem of accurately measuring one's longitude at sea within 30 minutes, announced after the failure of expert navigators and astronomers to crack the problem.</p><p/><p> It eventually elicited a solution from such an unexpected direction - accurate and robust clocks made by a humble clockmaker - that the authorities were reluctant to grant it for many years, to John Harrison's fury. A modern Longitude Prize, offering \u00a38m to a point-of-care diagnostic device to prevent the overprescribing of antibiotics, was set up in 2014 and remains unclaimed.</p><p>Similar serendipity happens today. One study of the online problem-sharing forum known as Innocentive, where individuals, companies and organisations can post details of problems that are baffling them and offer rewards for crowd-sourced solutions, found that \"the further the focal problem was from the solvers' field of expertise, the more likely they were to solve it\". Just like John Harrison. Innocentive has attracted 400,000 contributors from 190 countries and awarded more than $20m to successful solutions.</p><p>Eyes on the prize</p><p> In March, economist Tyler Cowen announced a series of modest prizes to reward innovations in social distancing, online worship, easier ways to work from home and treatments for COVID-19. Prizes, he says, are ideal \"when you don't know who is likely to make the breakthrough, you value the final output more than the process, there is an urgency to solutions (talent development is too slow), success is relatively easy to define, and efforts and investments are likely to be undercompensated\".</p><p>Yet such a list applies to almost all fields of human endeavour, not just this pandemic. Why don't we do more with prizes? </p><p/><p> Nobel-winning economist Michael Kremer came up with a concept that would finetune prizes as incentives to innovate, called the Advance Market Commitment. After all, there is no point in giving a prize to a company that invents a vaccine if the firm pockets the reward but then decides not to produce the vaccine because it cannot recoup the costs of doing so. In 2007 the Gates Foundation committed $1.5bn to a prize fund to find a vaccine for pneumococcus bacteria for use in developing countries. Such a vaccine would be of most use to people who could not afford to pay for it, so no pharmaceutical company could make money from inventing it, however long the patent. </p><p>But rather than a single lump-sum prize, the companies were invited to bid for 10-year contracts to develop and manufacture the vaccine. The prizemoney effectively topped up the sum received by the pharmaceutical firm for every vaccine sold. The result of the auction was three good vaccines, costing $2 per dose, which have been given to 150 million children, saving 700,000 lives.</p><p>Governments could also consider buying out patents to free up innovation. Anton Howes, of the Royal Society of Arts in London, argues that such buyouts have worked well in the past. The French government bought out Louis Daguerre's patent for photography in 1839 and made it freely available to all, unleashing a burst of creative innovation. The recent expiry of 3D printing patents has led to a burst of innovative activity, which could have come a decade sooner if the patents had been bought out. In 1998 Kremer came up with a way of valuing patents so they can be bought out at the right price, using auctions: a bunch of different patents are auctioned for private sale, without the bidders knowing which the government intends to buy.</p><p/><p>The government steps in at the price discovered by the auction. If it did so rarely, then the private bidders need not be unduly discouraged from taking part. Howes argues: \"As we look to fight coronavirus and any future pandemics, we should perhaps consider which patents - for antivirals, vaccines, ventilators, and other hygienic equipment - might be bought out in order to remove ... innovation bottlenecks.\"</p><p>I ended my book in a mood of unaccustomed pessimism, lamenting the innovation famine that seems to have gradually developed, courtesy of complacent big companies, bureaucratic big governments and neophobic big protest groups.

The Western world, especially since 2009, seems to have forgotten how to expand its economy at any reasonable speed. The rest of the world is making up for this, with Africa in particular beginning to rival the explosive growth rates that Asia achieved in the previous two decades. But most of this is catch-up growth, caused by adopting the innovations already in use in the West.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By contrast, the forces of complacency and stagnation sometimes seem to be winning in Europe, America and Japan. Fredrik Erixon and Bjorn Weigel, in their book, The Innovation Illusion: How So Little is Created by So Many Working So Hard, argue that the existential challenge of today's capitalism is to break the habit of both companies' and governments' reluctance to encourage innovation, despite their words.</p><p>Schumpeter's \"perennial gale of creative destruction\" has been replaced by the gentle breezes of rent-seeking. Corporate managerialism is gradually squeezing the life out of enterprise as big companies in cosy cahoots with big government increasingly dominate the scene. Their bosses shy away from uncertainty, and instead make their companies increasingly bureaucratic. Econ-omists such as Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon have likewise argued that we are no longer inventing things that really change the world, like toilets and cars, but increasingly playing with trivia like social media.</p><p>One immediate effect of the COVID-19 virus was to shut down the world economy. As it spread through Europe and other continents in March, governments took the tough decision to lock down their populations, telling all but essential workers to stay at home. The impact has been devastating, but it is worth reflecting on how much worse it would have been 20 years before, when videoconference calls to grandchildren were not an option for most people, online meetings were impossible and online shopping barely existed. The existence of broadband made the lockdown far more productive for some than it would have been before, and probably caused many people to rethink their commuting habits.</p><p>In this way the pandemic should surely unleash a torrent of innovation. It looks like it has tipped a critical mass of the population into videoconferencing for the first time, introducing many of us to systems like Zoom, Teams, Facetime and Skype.</p><p>Virtually productive Maybe it is naive, but I hope I can attend literary festivals all over the world to publicise this book without slogging through airports, security checks, hotel lobbies and time zones. Surely, too, working from home will be much more common and less stigmatised after the pandemic fades, as will virtual visits to the doctor and other professionals.</p><p>Already in some countries workers are demanding more rights to work from home. Productivity in the healthcare, accounting and legal sectors can surely begin to accelerate, instead of stagnating, if tele-meeting innovations are permitted to help here. There has been a surge of free data sharing to help researchers, too, and the opening up of access to scientific papers. The profiteering oligopolies of scientific publishing will surely not be the same after this. Lack of free access to the research that we all pay for has long been a scandal.</p><p>The demise of cash has probably been accelerated, as has the decline of high-street retailing in favour of online. Some social events like videoconferenced dinners - invented during the lockdown for friends to see each other - will fade away again as we go back to real parties, but not the family chats among those living far from parents or grandparents.</p><p>Digital innovation has medical uses, too. The ability to trace the movements of people by their smartphones, and thus track down contacts with infected people, was widely used in countries such as South Korea and will be key to managing the disease everywhere.</p><p>This technology is already being made even more effective, safer and more confidential. For example, smartphones will exchange encrypted but meaningless messages that leave a trail of anonymised data revealing when two people came close to each other, one of whom was infected. Thus you could be warned that you should self-isolate by your phone without anybody in government or a big tech firm knowing your name or your habits. Contact tracing need not lead us into the clammy embrace of Big Brother. It's not saying no that is the problem, it's saying yes slowly.</p><p>These few bright spots notwithstanding, there will be terrible economic damage to be repaired when the pandemic ends. A deep recession is inevitable. Unemployment will greatly increase, inflation will rocket, many people's debts will become unsustainable, trade protectionism will spread.</p><p>These shocks will undoubtedly hit the poor the hardest, ruining many lives. And it is here that the world must learn the main lesson of this book. Prosperity comes from innovation, innovation comes from the freedom to experiment and try new things, and freedom relies upon sensible regulation that is permissive, encouraging and quick to give decisions.</p><p>Tripped up by red tape By far the surest way to rediscover rapid economic growth and help the poorest will be to study the regulatory delays and hurdles that were swept aside to encourage innovators in medical devices and therapies during the pandemic, then see whether such reforms could be made permanent and applied to other parts of the economy, too. Again and again during the crisis I have spoken to entrepreneurs and scientists frustrated at the unnecessary delays introduced by bureaucratic procedures. Ten days to finalise a contract for the government to purchase diagnostic tests, for example. The lack of urgency displayed by administrators, consultants and legal negotiators, especially in the public sector, is a problem in a crisis but it should have been a problem all along.</p><p>Whether it is approving a new medical device or building a new airport runway, the process of decision-making has become lethargic to the point of paralysis and encrusted with the requirement to reward legions of unelected \"consultees\" for their leisurely attention. The problem for entrepreneurs, watching their capital dwindle as they try to bring an innovation to market, is not so much that regulators say no, but that they take an age to say yes. If we are to return to prosperity after the virus, that has to change.</p><p>Politicians should go further and rethink their incentives for innovation more generally so that we are never again caught out with too little innovation having happened in a crucial field of human endeavour. One option is to expand the use of prizes, to replace reliance on grants and patents. The famous Longitude Prize was a \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a320,000 prize offered in 1714 for the first person to solve the problem of accurately measuring one's longitude at sea within 30 minutes, announced after the failure of expert navigators and astronomers to crack the problem.</p><p>It eventually elicited a solution from such an unexpected direction - accurate and robust clocks made by a humble clockmaker - that the authorities were reluctant to grant it for many years, to John Harrison's fury. A modern Longitude Prize, offering \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a38m to a point-of-care diagnostic device to prevent the overprescribing of antibiotics, was set up in 2014 and remains unclaimed.</p><p>Similar serendipity happens today. One study of the online problem-sharing forum known as Innocentive, where individuals, companies and organisations can post details of problems that are baffling them and offer rewards for crowd-sourced solutions, found that \"the further the focal problem was from the solvers' field of expertise, the more likely they were to solve it\". Just like John Harrison. Innocentive has attracted 400,000 contributors from 190 countries and awarded more than $20m to successful solutions.</p><p>Eyes on the prize In March, economist Tyler Cowen announced a series of modest prizes to reward innovations in social distancing, online worship, easier ways to work from home and treatments for COVID-19. Prizes, he says, are ideal \"when you don't know who is likely to make the breakthrough, you value the final output more than the process, there is an urgency to solutions (talent development is too slow), success is relatively easy to define, and efforts and investments are likely to be undercompensated\".</p><p>Yet such a list applies to almost all fields of human endeavour, not just this pandemic. Why don't we do more with prizes?</p><p>Nobel-winning economist Michael Kremer came up with a concept that would finetune prizes as incentives to innovate, called the Advance Market Commitment. After all, there is no point in giving a prize to a company that invents a vaccine if the firm pockets the reward but then decides not to produce the vaccine because it cannot recoup the costs of doing so. In 2007 the Gates Foundation committed $1.5bn to a prize fund to find a vaccine for pneumococcus bacteria for use in developing countries. Such a vaccine would be of most use to people who could not afford to pay for it, so no pharmaceutical company could make money from inventing it, however long the patent.</p><p>But rather than a single lump-sum prize, the companies were invited to bid for 10-year contracts to develop and manufacture the vaccine. The prizemoney effectively topped up the sum received by the pharmaceutical firm for every vaccine sold. The result of the auction was three good vaccines, costing $2 per dose, which have been given to 150 million children, saving 700,000 lives.</p><p>Governments could also consider buying out patents to free up innovation. Anton Howes, of the Royal Society of Arts in London, argues that such buyouts have worked well in the past. The French government bought out Louis Daguerre's patent for photography in 1839 and made it freely available to all, unleashing a burst of creative innovation. The recent expiry of 3D printing patents has led to a burst of innovative activity, which could have come a decade sooner if the patents had been bought out. In 1998 Kremer came up with a way of valuing patents so they can be bought out at the right price, using auctions: a bunch of different patents are auctioned for private sale, without the bidders knowing which the government intends to buy.</p><p>The government steps in at the price discovered by the auction. If it did so rarely, then the private bidders need not be unduly discouraged from taking part. Howes argues: \"As we look to fight coronavirus and any future pandemics, we should perhaps consider which patents - for antivirals, vaccines, ventilators, and other hygienic equipment - might be bought out in order to remove \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 innovation bottlenecks.\" I ended my book in a mood of unaccustomed pessimism, lamenting the innovation famine that seems to have gradually developed, courtesy of complacent big companies, bureaucratic big governments and neophobic big protest groups. With some exceptions, mostly in the digital world, the innovation engine is sputtering and society is not seeing as many new products and services of value as it needs. COVID-19 has driven home that message in emphatic fashion. It is time to let innovation work.

All refugees awaiting resettlement are barred from entering the country for 120 days and Syrian refugees have been barred indefinitely.<br/>Originally this ban also included permanent residents of the U.S., or green-card holders, though the Department of Homeland Security advised that permanent residents be omitted from the order.<br/>The order has received much backlash around the country and even around the world as travelers who had previously been issued visas were detained at airports.<br/>Several big tech companies - including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google - have expressed their discontent with the order and have filed a joint court brief opposing the immigration ban.<br/>The brief is a show of support of a lawsuit filed last Monday by Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, which asked that key provisions of the executive order be declared unconstitutional.<br/>The travel ban was lifted when a temporary restraining order was granted Friday by U.S. District Judge James Robart.<br/>The case made its way Tuesday in front of a three-judge federal appeals panel in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which will determine whether the temporary restraining order should stay in place while the case proceeds.<br/>According to an article in the New York Times, a ruling did not come down Tuesday, but is expected to come later this week.<br/>In response to this executive order, Gannon University international students have expressed concern, according to Carol Knoble, director for Global Support and Student Engagement at the university.<br/>\"[The students] are really, really nervous,\" Knoble said. \"Most of our international students really do believe this is about being Muslim more than it is about anything else.\"<br/>Knoble said that one of the reasons why Gannon's international student population is so worried is because of the use of the word terrorist when talking about national security, though no immigrants from the seven listed countries have ever perpetrated attacks on the United States.<br/>\"It raises a lot of questions for them,\" Knoble said. \"They're very concerned.\"<br/>Brenon Joseph, a senior student from the U.S. Virgin Islands, said that he thinks it's interesting that the specified countries were chosen.<br/>\"It's intriguing that the banned countries have had no terrorist attacks in America,\" he said. \"There are other countries affecting us and if Trump wanted to protect America, then he would focus on domestic issues such as crime rates in our cities and school shootings.\"<br/>Prakash Subba, a sophomore Gannon student, echoed Knoble's assertion that students feel the ban is about being Muslim.<br/>\"[Students] already feel insecure here away from their families and homes,\" he said. \"Completely banning people is racist and discrimination. Not all Muslims are terrorists.<br/>\"America is supposed to be welcoming. Trump should think about the people affected by the war they have nothing to do with. They want to come here to have a life.\"<br/>Knoble said that students have told her very personal stories about their experiences, such as a student whose wife has been working for a year to come to America, but now isn't sure if she will be able to use her visa to come, and students who are graduating in May who don't know if their parents will be able to attend their graduation.<br/>\"They can't go home and that's terrifying,\" Knoble said. \"These are things that are very real to them.\"<br/>Tejita Rajbhandari, a freshman international management major from Nepal, said that she won't be able to visit her family over break anymore because of this ban.<br/>\"I was ordering my [plane] ticket, but suddenly I heard the news of a ban and I had to tell my parents,\" Rajbhandari said. \"It was heartbreaking for me and my parents are worried and told me not to come because they're afraid I wouldn't be able to come back.\"<br/>Grishma Dangol, a freshman\u00a0international management major from Nepal, said that she empathizes with other international students because she knows how it feels to leave home.<br/>\"If we plan to return home, we fear we won't be able to enter back,\" Dangol said. \"I know how my parents would feel in an airport if they were detained and they are more scared than me.\"<br/>Dangol also said that she worries while she's here at school because her parents are concerned about what will happen with her education if she can't come back or if they can't come visit her.<br/>Knoble also said that she has had students come into her office and tell her that they feel like they should just leave now. She said that their thought process is \"If I'm not safe in the U.S., then why am I here?\"<br/>Knoble also said that in general, the parents don't call because many of them don't speak English, but students tell her that their families are terrified and really nervous about them being in a different country.<br/>\"It's really hard for [students] to understand why they aren't being treated as individuals,\" she said. \"Just like we separate the government from the people, they do the same to us. They recognize that most Americans are not our president or not our government and yet they get lumped into all of this.\"<br/>Knoble said that they want students to stay informed and not believe everything they hear.<br/>\"One of the things our students ask from us is for accurate information,\" she said. \"We need to know what's really happening and what's a rumor. I think helping people with information is key.\"<br/>Puja Dhaduk, a sophomore, said that she also thinks a lack of correct information also contributes to the confusion.<br/>\"I feel like people who talk about the immigration and refugee bans have ideas that stem from ignorance,\" she said. \"When people hear about Trump on the news, they don't know about what's going on in our country or the facts about what Trump is doing.\"<br/>Knoble also pointed out that not a lot of people realize how much of a vetting process already happens for immigrants to the United States.<br/>\"Even in the fall at airports, our students from certain countries were harassed and targeted,\" she said. \"Their phones and computers were being taken because they wanted to see who they were talking to on social media.<br/>\"Some students said over the summer when they got their visa interviews, they were asked questions like 'who do you know in ISIS?' And these are 18-year-olds thinking 'I'm going to school in America. Why are you asking me this?' So they've already felt the stress way before this ever happened. I don't think a lot of people realize that there has been tension building.\"<br/>Knoble also said that she thinks the executive order is a bit deceptive to people who might not be otherwise educated about the immigration laws already in place.<br/>\"The whole point [of the order] was the thought that 'we need policies in place.

Well, we've already been vetting people.\"<br/>She said that most international students have been planning to come to America for a year, if not two and that they've provided so many documents to prove they are who they say they are and that they're sincere about going to school.<br/>\"They have to go through so much to get here, so to say that there's no process or that no one has screened these people is really misleading,\" she said.<br/>Knoble said that she thinks that more conversation and intentional interactions will take place on campus to bring domestic and international students together, but not as a reaction to the ban, rather because that's the direction that we are heading.<br/>\"We have a new strategic plan out and global initiative and interaction is a part of that,\" Knoble said.<br/>\"I think the whole campus is focused on integrating international students, getting American students to interact with them and building the bridges between them.<br/>\"We recognize that everybody needs global skills.\"<br/>Knoble said that while there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding this issue, the main focus for Gannon is the students.<br/>\"On an individual basis, our goal is taking care of our students,\" she said.<br/>\"We don't have a lot of influence over policies, but we have the ability to interpret for the campus what they mean.\"</p><p>SAMANTHA GRISWOLD<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:griswold002@knights.gannon.edu\">griswold002@knights.gannon.edu</email></p><p>ALEXANDRIA BROWN<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:brown298@knights.gannon.edu\">brown298@knights.gannon.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-2761363</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MTW-5GF1-JBSN-305T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Gannon Knight: Gannon University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 8, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It has also sent increasing numbers overseas, especially to London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a recent survey by corporate law firm Nixon Peabody found that may be changing.</p><p>Interviews with 100 executives from recent new issues yielded plenty of complaints about Sarbanes-Oxley; three-quarters said it was too restrictive.</p><p>But more than 80% of them said the current U.S. market is favorable for IPOs, and only about 20% expect IPO deals to decline going forward.</p><p>That shows in the greater number and size of deals that have come out in the last 18 months. U.S. IPO dollar volume rose almost 26% last year, and volume to date in 2007 has nearly matched the $33.9 billion raised in all of 2005.</p><p>Nixon Peabody's article also notes that while the AIM remains popular, it has certain drawbacks for small U.S.-based companies trying to plan for future growth. Only 5% of the surveyed companies had chosen to list there, compared with 32% on the Nasdaq.</p><p>James Chapman is a Silicon Valley-based partner at Nixon Peabody who specializes in corporate transactions and venture capital. He recently spoke with IBD about the survey's findings and his own experience with the IPO market.</p><p>IBD: What kinds of changes have you seen in your work on these kinds of deals?</p><p>Chapman: I think with Sarbanes-Oxley and the big impetus on corporate governance and the like, the bar for a company to go public has been raised. The good news is that more companies are able to jump over the bar.</p><p>IBD: Why is that?</p><p>Chapman: The informal standards on what it takes to go public are becoming more known and absorbed by companies on that track -- the financial results and the profitability and the like.</p><p>IBD: So when Sarbanes-Oxley was first passed, were some companies intimidated out of going public that shouldn't have been?</p><p>Chapman: I know that's the case. I was at an investor conference about two years ago in the natural resources area. All of the companies that were there had elected not to go public in the U.S. and had either (gone to) the AIM or the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p><p>They were intimidated, either rightly or wrongly, by Sarbanes-Oxley and the extra cost it put on them.</p><p>IBD: The survey mentioned that some CEOs said there were new revisions to Sarbanes-Oxley that made things easier. What specifically were they referring to?</p><p>Chapman: What I think they're referring to is the fact that Sarbanes-Oxley has been out in the mainstream for approximately five years, (and) people have become more comfortable with it.</p><p>When Sarbanes-Oxley came out the relationship between the companies and the auditing firms really was strained. That has changed back to more of a normal level where you can ask your auditor questions and they can help you.</p><p>The SEC came out with a release a while ago which helped the auditing firms on how to better deal with their clients and what their role was. It's things like that: People have gotten more used to it, and interpretations have been out so people are more comfortable.</p><p>IBD: You work in Silicon Valley, and there have been a lot of tech IPOs coming out lately and doing well. Compared with the last big tech IPO boom in the late '90 s, are you seeing many differences now that there's a different environment?</p><p>Chapman: The quality of the companies is a lot better. The companies that are going public are more ready to do so. That means they tend -- generally speaking -- to be profitable or on their way to profitability, have better infrastructure, they've been around longer, (have) more seasoned management, better business plans. Those are the differences between now and eight, nine years ago.</p><p>IBD: I was also interested in the part of the survey that discussed some of the downsides of going on the AIM. Among other things, it mentioned that companies that go public there are considered private by U.S. regulators. Can you explain a little more about that?</p><p>Chapman: The sale of securities on AIM, from a United States law perspective, is considered a private placement. So you get all the restrictions that go along with a private placement. This happens to fall under Regulation S, which covers private placements that you do overseas, and so from a U.S. company's perspective that really limits what you can do.</p><p>IBD: In what ways?</p><p>Chapman: One of the real advantages of being a public company is that you have shares that you can use for currency to do acquisitions and grow more dramatically. If you're public on AIM, that doesn't help you in the U.S. as far as using your stock for currency.</p><p>IBD: The survey also said that tech companies that go public on the AIM don't do as well as on the Nasdaq. Does that have to do with the AIM itself or the quality of the companies that go public there, or both?</p><p>Chapman: Probably some of both. I think one of the big challenges with AIM is the apparent lack of liquidity. It's kind of a quasi-public market. If you're a public company and you can't get liquidity, that can be a real challenge.</p><p>IBD: The survey also mentioned that it can trigger new regulations if a company on AIM has enough follow-on offerings and secondary trading.</p><p>Chapman: If you're trading on AIM and you hit a certain threshold, then you're required to become a reporting company in the United States and comply with all the requirements. Including Sarbanes-Oxley, which people are trying to escape by going to AIM in the first place.</p><p>So part of the challenge is that in the event you're very successful on AIM, it triggers reporting requirements in the U.S. It's an odd irony.</p><p>IBD: When the CEOs were asked about the outlook for the U.S. IPO market, they seemed fairly optimistic. Do you share that optimism?</p><p>Chapman: I do, mainly because I heard exactly the same thing from investment bankers in that area.

privacy scandal, more and more users are flocking from the platform.\u00a0</p><p>A new survey of 1,000 American Facebook users found that 9% deleted their account due to privacy concerns in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, according to a study from tech research firm\u00a0 Techpinions.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Scroll down for video\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, 17% said they deleted the Facebook app from their phone, while 11% deleted it from other devices.</p><p>What's more, about 59% of respondents said they would not be willing to pay for an ad-free version of Facebook like the firm's executives have suggested in recent days.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>'[Facebook CEO] <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>went on the record to say that thus far the #deletefacebook meme did not have much impact,' Techpinions analyst Carolina Milanesi wrote in the study.</p><p>'...These numbers might not worry Facebook too much, but there are less drastic steps users are taking that should be worrying, as they directly impact Facebook's business model'.\u00a0</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>answered questions from legislators in a pair of high-stress hearings on Capitol Hill this week.\u00a0</p><p>So far, he has claimed that there's been no major drop off in users since the Cambridge Analytica scandal first erupted.\u00a0</p><p>Last month, it was revealed that data from 87 million users' was harvested with their knowledge from the platform and shared with political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign.</p><p>The techpinions study reveals that many Facebook users feel that their privacy has been exploited on the site and are now taking action.\u00a0</p><p>Approximately 35% of respondents said they're using Facebook less in the wake of the privacy scandal.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And 21% of those surveyed said they plan to use Facebook 'much less' in the future.\u00a0</p><p>As Milanesi points out, these numbers should matter to Facebook, because if fewer people are logging into the site, that could threaten their business model.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The study also showed that it's not just the media or industry experts who are paying attention to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\u00a0</p><p>Roughly 40% of respondents said they were 'very aware' of the scandal, while men seemed to be more aware of it than women.</p><p>The survey showed that user trust in Facebook is waning, while 28% of users revealed that they never trusted Facebook to begin with.\u00a0</p><p>When asked what it would take to regain their trust, users said they wanted to gain a better understanding of the personal data Facebook had collected and shared from them.\u00a0</p><p>They also want to have more power to control what kinds of personal data is being shared with third parties like advertisers and researchers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>'It seems to me that what users are asking for is more transparency rather than more tools to manage their settings, which makes a lot of sense,' Milanesi explained in the study.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The results come as a separate survey, conducted by SurveyMonkey and Recode, revealed that Facebook is now the least-trusted major tech company.\u00a0</p><p>Approximately 56% of Americans say they trust Facebook the least with handling their personal information out of all big tech firms, the study found.\u00a0</p><p>Survey respondents were given the option to choose from Facebook, Google, Uber, Twitter, Snap, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Lyft, Tesla and Netflix, Recode said.</p><p>During <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony, many legislators raised doubts that the average Facebook user actually understands how their personal data is collected and shared on and off the website.\u00a0</p><p>In turn, many said that users are unsure how to manage their information and change their privacy settings, making <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>solution of introducing more 'tools' a moot point.\u00a0</p><p>'<person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>response was that things are not as complicated as they seem, Facebook users know that what they share can be used by Facebook,' Milanesi explained.\u00a0</p><p>'Unfortunately, it is not as simple as that as the ramifications of how the data users share is used is quite complicated and even if you understand the Facebook business model, you would be hard pushed to know how far your data goes,' she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Even <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>admitted that his own personal data was shared with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>The Facebook founder made the admission on his second day appearing before the US Congress over the data scandal.</p><p>Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, reading questions from her constituents at a hearing of the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, asked <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>whether his data was 'included in the data sold to the malicious third parties'.</p><p>With a slight hesitation, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>replied: 'Yes.'</p><p>Representatives have grilled <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>on a wide range of issues around privacy, surveillance, censorship and politics, regularly asking for yes or no answers which the Facebook founder struggled to provide.</p><p>Representative Eshoo called Facebook's terms and conditions around privacy a 'minefield' and repeatedly asked Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>whether he was 'aware of other data mishandlings which have not been disclosed'.</p><p>In response, he initially said no, but reiterated Facebook's new investigation into other third-party 'vampire apps' on the platform was seeking to discover if there had been any other cases of misuse.</p><p>On the topic of Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>admitted it would be difficult to completely eradicate such behaviour for 'as long as Russia employs people for the activity'.\u00a0</p><p>'It's an arms race and I think we're making ground,' he said.</p><p>Politicians in the US and UK are weighing up the possibility of legislation to regulate large technology companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter which are accused of failing to regulate themselves.</p><p>In his opening statement committee chair Greg Walden quoted the company's early motto to 'move fast and break things', asking whether the company had 'moved too fast and broken too many things'.</p><p>Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said that he believes regulation of his industry is 'inevitable'.</p><p>He also told Senators on Tuesday, his first day before Congress, that Facebook will have AI tools to automatically flag and remove hate speech before it appears

Other cities included San Diego, Seattle and Portland, Ore. </p><p>But economic-development studies are highly subjective and often use different criteria. </p><p>\"You get what you pay for,\" said Bud Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic Development at the University of North Texas. \"And there's no such thing as an unbiased study. Everyone who commissions a study has an agenda.\" </p><p>Sizing up strategy </p><p>A similar study commissioned two years ago by the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce -- as Central Texas business leaders re-evaluated their economic-development strategy -- reached different conclusions while using some of the same criteria. </p><p>The Austin-sponsored study pitted Central Texas against Raleigh-Durham, Seattle, Phoenix and Denver but did not include Silicon Valley. Criteria included commuting times, office rent prices, number of child care workers per capita and junior-college enrollments. </p><p>It said Austin was very competitive in overall education but needed improvement in traffic congestion and public transit; business costs and regulation; and the number of students getting degrees from community colleges. </p><p>The Silicon Valley study said Austin ranked lower than peer cities on health insurance coverage and math scores on standardized tests by eighth-graders. It ranked No. 2 in housing affordability, electricity costs and state tax rates. </p><p>Warning for region </p><p>The Silicon Valley study is meant to serve as a warning for the region, said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. </p><p>The region remains the undisputed technology capital of the country and probably will remain home to cutting-edge companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Google Inc. for a long time. </p><p>But when comparing business conditions in the four-county region with those in the other tech-centric parts of the country, Silicon Valley loses on every measure, according to the study. Its housing costs, traffic congestion costs and electricity costs are the highest or almost the highest of any region. Its eighth-grade math scores are the lowest, and the percentage of its population with health insurance is among the lowest, according to the study. </p><p>\"We hope this will be a reality check for the public\" in Silicon Valley, Guardino said. \"It's not just China or India or places that have slave labor that are hurting us. We're getting our clocks cleaned by other states.\" </p><p>Dave Porter, head of economic development for the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, said at least two Silicon Valley companies are considering expansions in Austin but he declined to name them. </p><p>\"There's going to continue to be a bleeding out of all of California\" because of high costs, Porter said. </p><p>Still the epicenter </p><p>But Silicon Valley remains the epicenter of technology innovation, and its entrepreneurs still attract more venture capital funding by far than anyplace else in the country. </p><p>\"It's still unlike any place in the world,\" said Daniel Kae, research director for Austin-based consulting firm Angelou- Economics Inc. \"The next big thing will still come out of Silicon Valley.\" </p><p>But \"as that innovation matures, it will continue to relocate to other parts of the world,\" he said. And if it involves manufacturing, Silicon Valley \"is just not even on the map anymore\" because of high costs. </p><p>Carl Everett, a former executive at Intel Corp. and Dell Inc. who splits his time between Austin and Palo Alto, Calif., isn't betting against Silicon Valley. </p><p>\"I've been watching (Silicon Valley) for almost 30 years now, and I will say everyone who has predicted its demise has been wrong,\" said Everett, who now works as an adviser to startups for Silicon Valley venture capital firmAccel Partners. </p><p>He acknowledges that many tech companies do not even consider Silicon Valley for manufacturing anymore. But one company with which he is involved, semiconductor equipment maker FormFactor Inc., chose the region for its manufacturing because it made the most sense for its customer, despite higher operating costs. </p><p>Housing costs </p><p>Few in Silicon Valley can argue that housing costs are not a problem. In a survey of 114 local CEOs that accompanied the Silicon Valley study, respondents unanimously said housing was the biggest issue that the region faces. The median home price is about $724,000, compared with $169,740 in Austin. </p><p>\"The biggest challenge we face here is the ability to continue to recruit the best and the brightest,\" said John Ambroseo, CEO of Santa Clara, Calif.-based laser maker Coherent Inc.</p><p>\"It's OK to come here for three or four years and slum it as a young person,\" Ambroseo said. \"But then you're faced with life choices -- whether to get married, have kids, buy a house.\" </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bkeefe@coxnews.com\">bkeefe@coxnews.com</email></p><p>(box) </p><p>Austin came in sixth and Silicon Valley last in a new study comparing business and quality-of-life issues in eight U.S. tech hubs. Commissioned by a Silicon Valley civic group, the study compares unemployment rates, housing affordability, traffic, electricity costs, tax rates, education and health insurance coverage. </p><p>(photo caption)   </p><p>RALEIGH-DURHAM-CHAPEL HILL, N.C., Rank: 1  </p><p>Pluses: Cheap housing and state taxes, little traffic </p><p>Minuses: Electricity costs, percentage uninsured </p><p>FAIRFAX COUNTY/NORTHERN VIRGINIA, Rank: 2   </p><p>Plus: Eighth-grade math scores </p><p>Minuses: Traffic, housing costs </p><p>BOSTON, Rank: 3 (tie)  </p><p>Pluses: Math scores, percentage uninsured </p><p>Minuses: State taxes, housing and electricity costs </p><p>SEATTLE, Rank: 3 (tie)   </p><p>Pluses: State taxes, percentage uninsured </p><p>Minus: Unemployment rate </p><p>PORTLAND, ORE., Rank: 5   </p><p>Pluses: Electricity and housing costs </p><p>Minuses: Unemployment rate, state taxes, traffic </p><p>AUSTIN, Rank: 6   </p><p>Pluses: Affordable housing, electricity, state taxes </p><p>Minuses: Percentage uninsured, math scores </p><p>SAN DIEGO, Rank: 7   </p><p>Minuses: Housing and electricity costs, traffic,  </p><p>state taxes </p><p>SILICON VALLEY, Rank: 8   </p><p>Minuses: Traffic, housing and electricity costs, eighth-grade math scores, percentage uninsured </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4H46-TBF0-TWK1-B300-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTIN-0501034149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTIN2005</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1193\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Austin American Statesman</copyright><publicationName>Austin American-Statesman (Texas)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>September 16, 2005 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CGMN</classCode><className>CENTER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LAW</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>HPQ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;

Meanwhile, 59 percent believe that the industry is 'Regulated about the right amount.'Although most Americans do not believe that the tech industry needs more regulations, most people believe that companies need to address the consequences of their policies.The study found that 56 percent of Americans at least somewhat agreed with the statement: 'In order to (re)build trust as good corporate citizens who do what's right for consumers, technology companies need to take more action to address the consequences of their policies, practices and products.' </p><p>Thirty-one percent of American participants neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement, while only 13 percent disagreed.Although most Americans do believe that Big Tech companies need to 'take more action,' respondents did, overall, express a fair amount of trust in the same companies. 67 percent of participants said that they at least somewhat trust Big Tech companies.Those who do want more regulations for Big Tech may get their wish soon.

Meanwhile, 59 percent believe that the industry is 'Regulated about the right amount.'Although most Americans do not believe that the tech industry needs more regulations, most people believe that companies need to address the consequences of their policies.The study found that 56 percent of Americans at least somewhat agreed with the statement: 'In order to (re)build trust as good corporate citizens who do what's right for consumers, technology companies need to take more action to address the consequences of their policies, practices and products.' </p><p>Thirty-one percent of American participants neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement, while only 13 percent disagreed.Although most Americans do believe that Big Tech companies need to 'take more action,' respondents did, overall, express a fair amount of trust in the same companies. 67 percent of participants said that they at least somewhat trust Big Tech companies.Those who do want more regulations for Big Tech may get their wish soon. Sens. Roger Wicker (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently introduced legislation[2] to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

FleishmanHillard, a St. Louis-based marketing agency and public relations firm, ...</p><p>It\u2019s no secret that Americans have a complicated relationship with Big Tech, and a recent study from FleishmanHillard highlights just how complicated this relationship can be.   FleishmanHillard, a St. Louis-based marketing agency and public relations firm, found that \u201cconsumers want the technology sector to take a long hard look at its policies and practices.\u201d     According to the study, one-third of Americans want more regulations on Big Tech. Meanwhile, 59 percent believe that the industry is \u201cRegulated about the right amount.\u201d    Although most Americans do not believe that the tech industry needs more regulations, most people believe that companies need to address the consequences of their policies.     The study found that 56 percent of Americans at least somewhat agreed with the statement: \u201cIn order to (re)build trust as good corporate citizens who do what\u2019s right for consumers, technology companies need to take more action to address the consequences of their policies, practices and products.\u201d Thirty-one percent of American participants neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement, while only 13 percent disagreed.     Although most Americans do believe that Big Tech companies need to \u201ctake more action,\u201d respondents did, overall, express a fair amount of trust in the same companies. 67 percent of participants said that they at least somewhat trust Big Tech companies.    Those who do want more regulations for Big Tech may get their wish soon. Sens. Roger Wicker (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently introduced legislation to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Federal Trade Commission is preparing a possible antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, and Google testified before the Senate in an antitrust hearing on September 15.     Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322 and  submit a comment on the petition filed by the Department of Commerce regarding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives. If you have been censored, contact us at the Media Research Center contact form , and help us hold Big Tech accountable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43100204634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VW-HMG1-JCSC-J36B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"426\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewsBusters</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 17, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There were a bunch of provisions in it,\u201d CSIS economic researcher Grace Dewi told The Jakarta Post.</p><p>In the meeting, the stakeholders reached a consensus that the digital economy was an integral part of the economy and should be supported as its value was expected to reach US$130 billion by 2020.</p><p>However, despite its rising popularity, the e-commerce industry was in the early stages of development, AIC managing director Jeff Paine said.</p><p>\u201cI think that the challenge is that the industry is still very nascent; you just don\u2019t want to do anything that will disrupt the growth engine that the e-commerce is on,\u201d he said.</p><p>The AIC claims that the government\u2019s plan to issue a ministerial decree to regulate OTT companies by the end of the year will impede the growth of the digital industry because of unclear provisions, including the basic scope and definition of OTT firms.</p><p>\u201cThe draft regulation as it is written now contains a lot of ambiguities. The definition of OTT covers basically everything on the internet,\u201d Paine said.</p><p>Even so, some industry players were concerned with the government\u2019s requirement of OTT players to have a permanent establishment (BUT) in Indonesia, something they saw as burdensome because of their existing presence in more than 200 countries, he said.</p><p>The government has taken firm measures toward OTT content providers that do not comply with the country\u2019s regulations, holding them accountable to their tax obligations and ability to provide improved data protection and customer services.</p><p>Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara reiterated several times that it was important to level the playing field between local and foreign content providers in regard to their tax obligations.</p><p>Beyond Indonesia, tax authorities in many other countries and jurisdictions constantly seek new measures to tax the online giants. The European Union, for instance, has pushed ahead with its strategies and tax rules to force big tech firms, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, to meet their tax obligations.</p><p>A report made by EU lawmakers responsible for a corporate tax reform recently revealed that its member states lost 5.4 billion euros in tax revenues from Google and Facebook between 2013 and 2015, as quoted by Reuters.</p><p>Apart from taxation issues, the Indonesian government required Facebook Inc. messaging service WhatsApp to remove obscene content in the form of GIF images after Rudiantara threatened to block its service in the country.</p><p>Rudiantara has also threatened to block services from the world\u2019s biggest social media providers, namely Google and Twitter, if they do not adhere to the government\u2019s request to block pornographic content.</p><p>He made the move based on Indonesia\u2019s bargaining position, which he perceived as strong given the country\u2019s population of 260 million, a huge market that might be impossible for tech giants to ignore.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Jakarta Post (Indonesia)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-61518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-VM81-F17J-S1JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 22, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

A recent investigation[2], conducted by Mijente, revealed the US government has at least 29 active contracts with the company worth approximately $1.5 billion. This covers Palantir's work with all four branches of the military, Border Patrol, ICE, and Homeland Security, but it doesn't even touch on the hundreds of contracts it has with local law enforcement throughout the country. </p><p>All in all the company's valued at over $20 billion[3]. Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire responsible for PayPal, current Facebook board member, and the co-founder of Palantir, is a vocal Conservative and prominent Trump supporter. He was the President's seventh largest[4] campaign donor in 2016 and remains a staunch ally. But it wasn't President Trump who brought Palantir into the country's fold, that distinguishment belongs to President Barrack Obama.Trump's simply elevated the company to the kind of status that's traditionally been reserved for big players such as Raytheon and Boeing. The result's been a match made in Conservative heaven. Using AI designed for the military, Palantir's managed to take wartime technology and implement it at scale across the entire US police industrial complex, causing a complete shift in how law enforcement treats citizen privacy. This concept was described perfectly by Pacific Standard's Jacqui Shine in a 2017 article[5]: Commentators who refer to a 'police-industrial complex' are usually describing the militarization of police agencies: the steady adoption, which escalated after September 11, 2001, of military technologies and strategies for domestic law enforcement purposes. But in market terms, there is also a distinct police-industrial complex, in which public-private relationships between law enforcement agencies and a wide variety of for-profit corporations have come to shape our society's very conceptions of policing and our priorities for justice. Today, Donald Trump's party-line nationalism is what directs the US surveillance state. But surveillance isn't a Republican or Democrat technology: it's an anti-freedom one. It's a Pandora's Box that will remain long after the current controlling party is gone, and we have big tech to thank. According to the Mijente report:We could not 20 years ago have envisioned a world in which immigration agents could scour national databases to build sophisticated profiles of us and pinpoint our locations for arrest, or in which border patrol agents could man all-seeing surveillance towers to fully monitor the frontier with Mexico, immediately spotting anyone walking in the desert. If we are not careful, we will not know what we will be fighting in 20 years. We must understand, document, and oppose these dangerous partnerships today.Trump andThiel have created a profit-machine based on disguising mass-surveillance as 'data analytics.' These tools can't predict crime or terrorism[6], as they're purported to by Palantir. And they certainly can't use algorithms to magically predict where an undocumented immigrant is likely to be \u2014 they're not mere administrative tools designed to help manage investigations for overwhelmed agents, they're illegal, unconstitutional surveillance portals[7]. In order to understand just how much information Palantir has on you, here's a list of just some of the public and private databases that Palantir has access to per a Vicereport[8]:On top of this, Palantir has access to classified military data, facial recognition cameras across the country and at the borders, and the complete trust and cooperation of the Federal government and hundreds of local law enforcement agencies. It's a surveillance machine[9] capable of tracking anyone and everyone. And the company's now deeply embedded within the US government. Its contracts will outlast Trump's presidency even if he serves a second term. Those who currently sit silently - or cheer[10] - as the government uses mass surveillance and dragnet policing to round up and incarcerate undocumented immigrants should consider how easy it'll be to turn this technology on citizens.

But don\u2019t let that fool you: Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft are still on their way to dominating the future.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the last two years, lawmakers and the public around the globe have been awakened to fears about the expanding powers of the largest technology companies, particularly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/technology/techs-frightful-5-will-dominate-digital-life-for-foreseeable-future.html\">the ones I\u2019ve called the Frightful Five</url>: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, the most valuable companies on the American markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In different ways, the companies have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/technology/tech-companies-social-responsibility.html\">conceded some of these fears</url> and have vowed to address them. Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d for their contributions to society \u2014 these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation.</p><p>Yet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed \u201ctechlash\u201d: It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giants\u2019 financial performance. Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors. Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/technology/amazon-earnings.html\">reported a record profit</url>. Microsoft and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Street\u2019s projections. On Tuesday,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/technology/apple-earnings-report.html\">so did Apple</url>; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion.</p><p>Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?</p><p>In a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook\u2019s stock now \u201cmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\u201d</p><p>Together the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren\u2019t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.</p><p>Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.</p><p>Software really is eating the world</p><p>Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.</p><p>Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.</p><p>Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.</p><p>For rival retailers, Amazon\u2019s new profitability constitutes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/7/26/17619420/amazon-amzn-earnings-q2-aws-advertising-profits-growth\">a kind of nightmare scenario</url>. By shuttling profits from software into its retail business, Amazon can keep expanding its store at a breakneck pace.</p><p>\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just Amazon that\u2019s profiting under the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen\u2019s thesis that \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/\">software is eating the world</url>.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s surging earnings were       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/technology/microsoft-earnings-cloud-computing.html\">also driven by its cloud business</url>, while Apple\u2019s software services \u2014 things like sales of apps, music subscriptions, cloud storage and Apple Pay \u2014 are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/5/3/15523268/apple-services-business-revenue-growth\">the fastest-growing part of its business</url>.</p><p>Regulatory pressure isn\u2019t having a huge impact</p><p>The European Union recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/google-eu-android-fine.html\">fined Google $5.1 billion</url> for abusing its mobile software monopoly, which followed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html\">a $2.7 billion fine last year</url> for abuse of its search monopoly. (Google is appealing both decisions.) Apple agreed last year to pay nearly $16 billion in back taxes to the European Union over its cozy tax deal with Ireland. (The funds will be held in escrow while Ireland appeals the decision; Apple has disputed any wrongdoing.) Facebook, which has been hauled before lawmakers in Europe and the United States for its role in politics, faces threats of increased regulation and possible fines for mishandling private data.</p><p>But Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.</p><p>There is also the possibility that regulatory zeal will abate. Google watchers say it\u2019s notable that President Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1019932691339399168\">tweeted criticism</url> of the European Union\u2019s fine against Google, suggesting, perhaps, that American regulators won\u2019t take up a similar case. (Of course, it is hard these days to really know how much to read into a presidential tweet.)</p><p>Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201d</p><p>The Five still have a lot more ways to make money</p><p>Finally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.</p><p>And that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.</p><p>\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201d</p><p>In other words: Get used to the Five. They\u2019re not going anywhere.</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com\">farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com</email>; Twitter: @fmanjoo. </p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Doug Chayka FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p><h>Related Articles</h><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/technology/apple-earnings-report.html\">Apple Could Soon Be Worth $1 Trillion as Profits Pour In</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/technology/tech-companies-facebook-twitter-responsibility.html\">Tech Companies Like Facebook and Twitter Are Drawing Lines.

But don't let that fool you: Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft are still on their way to dominating the future.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the last two years, lawmakers and the public around the globe have been awakened to fears about the expanding powers of the largest technology companies, particularly the ones I've called the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, the most valuable companies on the American markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In different ways, the companies have conceded some of these fears and have vowed to address them. Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting \"moral responsibility\" for their contributions to society - these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation.</p><p>Yet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed \"techlash\": It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giants' financial performance. Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors. Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings, reported a record profit. Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Street's projections. On Tuesday, so did Apple; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion.</p><p>Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?</p><p>In a strange way, the social network's troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That's because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.</p><p>\"This is one of the most profitable business models I've ever seen, and that really hasn't changed,\" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook's stock now \"may be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\"</p><p>Together the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren't having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.</p><p>Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.</p><p>Software really is eating the world</p><p>Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon's sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.</p><p>Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they've reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That's only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.</p><p>Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon's servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon's site.</p><p>For rival retailers, Amazon's new profitability constitutes a kind of nightmare scenario. By shuttling profits from software into its retail business, Amazon can keep expanding its store at a breakneck pace.</p><p>\"These high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin - and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\" said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p><p>But it's not just Amazon that's profiting under the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's thesis that \"software is eating the world.\" Microsoft's surging earnings were also driven by its cloud business, while Apple's software services - things like sales of apps, music subscriptions, cloud storage and Apple Pay - are the fastest-growing part of its business.</p><p>Regulatory pressure isn't having a huge impact</p><p>The European Union recently fined Google $5.1 billion for abusing its mobile software monopoly, which followed a $2.7 billion fine last year for abuse of its search monopoly. (Google is appealing both decisions.) Apple agreed last year to pay nearly $16 billion in back taxes to the European Union over its cozy tax deal with Ireland. (The funds will be held in escrow while Ireland appeals the decision; Apple has disputed any wrongdoing.) Facebook, which has been hauled before lawmakers in Europe and the United States for its role in politics, faces threats of increased regulation and possible fines for mishandling private data.</p><p>But Big Tech's earnings so far don't show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe's new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook's user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.</p><p>There is also the possibility that regulatory zeal will abate. Google watchers say it's notable that President Trump tweeted criticism of the European Union's fine against Google, suggesting, perhaps, that American regulators won't take up a similar case. (Of course, it is hard these days to really know how much to read into a presidential tweet.)</p><p>Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon's growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook - which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government's help.</p><p>\"There's been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\" Mr. Mahaney said. \"Now it's going to be a triopoly - but if you were worried about the duopoly, you're probably saying, 'Couldn't the third company have been someone besides Amazon?'\"</p><p>The Five still have a lot more ways to make money</p><p>Finally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \"green fields\" - the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties - Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them - are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there's a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.</p><p>And that's just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.</p><p>\"The one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\" Mr. Squali said. \"They see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they're not afraid to destroy something that's working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\"</p><p>In other words: Get used to the Five. They're not going anywhere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com\">farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com</email>; Twitter: @fmanjoo.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006033725</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXT-YSD1-DYR7-C1WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 1, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

News that will challenge everything you thought you knew about the story. Yesterday, we showed you the terrifying extent to which Vladimir Putin's sinister tendrils have encircled the American body politic, crushing the very life from this republic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russian agents are so intent on undermining our democracy, they've taken to promoting our own Bill of Rights back to us. The Second Amendment specifically.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we'll admit, we are not exactly sure how that's bad. But Adam Schiff has assured us that it is. And because Schiff is a prominent member of Congress and often appears on cable news, we believe him.</p><p>Now, tonight, we've learned that the foreign subversion goes even deeper than that. The Russian conspiracy is so subtle, so crafty, such a bewildering Slavic hall of mirrors that the people warning us about Russia are, in fact, key players in the Russian conspiracy. The leaders of the witch-hunt are witches.</p><p>Sound impossible? Listen to this. Last year, the director of national intelligence released the definitive report on Russia propaganda efforts in this country. The main focus of that report was the Russian cable channel \"RT America\", which is funded and controlled by the Putin government.</p><p>In the words of our intelligence community, RT engages in \"anti-US messaging likely aimed at undermining viewers trust in US democratic procedures.\"</p><p>Our government considers \"RT\" so dangerous that the channel has been forced to register as a foreign agent. \"RT\" employees who fail to register could face prison time. No outlet in this country has ever been forced to do that. \"RT\" is a sinister place. Everybody says so.</p><p>So, who would go on a channel like that, one whose sole agenda is to discredit and destroy the American experiment? Well, none other than Adam Bennett Schiff of Burbank, California. You know him as Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, the man leading the charge against Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine.</p><p>And yet, Adam Schiff was part of that machine. Seriously. Here's an actual screenshot. Just so you know, we're not making this up. Though his office refused to confirm it tonight, we can assure you that that is indeed Adam Schiff, the one and only.</p><p>In our appearance that our producers reviewed - Adam Schiff's appearance, Schiff seemed to promote conspiracy theories about the US government, suggesting that the men and women who lay down their live to keep us safe may be twisting information for their own purposes.</p><p>Here's a quote. \"We only see what the intelligence community wants us to see.\" Adam Schiff said that on \"Russian Television\". There must've been applause in the Kremlin when he did.</p><p>But Schiff isn't alone. Congressman Jim Hines of Connecticut also appeared on Vladimir Putin's cable channel. In one appearance, Himes said this about our men in uniform and their civilian leaders. \"The invasion of Iraq, I would argue, the great American foreign policy mistake of the century.\" Well, in the background, you could almost hear Vladimir Putin cackling with glee.</p><p>So, here you have two prominent members of Congress voluntarily appearing on a foreign propaganda outlet in order to undermine confidence in America's core institutions. As they might put it, doing the bidding of a hostile foreign power.</p><p>Tokyo Rose went to prison for that. Now, we are not suggesting prison at this point. That's a decision a new special counsel and federal grand juries will have to make after an appropriately extensive and independent investigation into all of this. That could take years. Not that justice has a timetable.</p><p>In the meantime, Schiff and Hines must recuse themselves immediately from any role in the Russia investigation, including appearances on \"MSNBC's\" primetime lineup.</p><p>We assume the special counsel will also take up the mysterious and troubling case of the non-existent nude photographs, a story just broken by \"The Daily Mail\" hours ago.</p><p>Last year, Adam Schiff conducted a phone call with Russian pranksters, who promised him compromising photographs of Donald Trump with a Russian model. Schiff's office claims the congressman wasn't fooled by the prank. The call's transcript suggests otherwise.</p><p>Schiff continued that conversation for more than 8 minutes and appeared to be taking notes during it. After the call, Schiff's office contacted somebody they believed was Ukrainian politician, seeking to set up a meeting at a foreign embassy where they could obtain those documents.</p><p>Huh! Let's see. Setting up meetings with foreign operatives seeking politically damaging information about a political opponent? We thought that was treason. Adam Schiff told us it was.</p><p>Congressman Mark Pocan is a colleague of Mr. Schiff's. He's a Democrat representing the State of Wisconsin and he joins us tonight. Mr. Pocan, thanks for coming on.</p><p>REP. MARK POCAN (D), WISCONSIN: Glad to be here, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, the intelligence community - our intelligence community described \"RT\" as a key component of the Russian propaganda machine. And here you have one of the leaders, one of the grand inquisitors in the Russia investigation appearing on it, willfully being used by the Russian government to propagandize our people, to undermine our democracy, to hack our way of life.</p><p>Why should he not recuse himself immediately from the investigation on the basis of that?</p><p>POCAN: I assume from the whole intro you were doing that as tongue-in- cheek because, clearly, as you know, politicians are on many, many networks. And I don't think he was, as you are trying to describe, saying that \"RT\" is trying to undermine American democracy in doing something.</p><p>I got the point - I get the point. I think we all get the point.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm just using the standards that everyone in Washington is using at \"The Washington Post\" and leaders of your party are using.</p><p>If you have contact with the Russian government, and particularly if you willingly participate in Russian propaganda efforts -</p><p>POCAN: Tucker, you don't honestly believe that someone being on a network doing an appearance - and for all you know, it could've been on sugar content and food.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it was on American intelligence gathering. I watched it today. So, he's going on Vladimir Putin's propaganda, what to talk about, American intelligence gathering. Does that bother you?</p><p>POCAN: Tucker, you're comparing that to what we know ultimately happened. There were people who set up meetings in the Trump family with Russians in order to get information and you are trying to compare that to \"RT\". I just don't know if it was very effective.</p><p>CARLSON: We know for a fact that Adam Schiff did exactly that last year.</p><p>POCAN: Are you honestly - if I go on Fox Network, therefore I'm tainted by Fox Network forever?</p><p>CARLSON: And by the way - look -</p><p>POCAN: That wouldn't make a lot of sense, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: My only point is this is total McCarthyite witch-hunt, as you know. And the attorney general recused himself because he shook the hand of the Russian ambassador. The whole thing is a joke.</p><p>But we might as well, if we are going to use these standards, keep to them.</p><p>POCAN: Tucker, what I will agree about a joke is, I think, this memo that Devin Nunes, after being forced to recuse himself from the investigation after doing, like, small town community theater, where remember the one night he got out of the car and went to the White House to get info. The next day, \"I've got info\" and he gave it to the White House?</p><p>The fact that he then directed this memo, which now we all know there is nothing in that, I think that is far more substantive than you're making a tongue-in-cheek point about that one.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not here to defend Devin Nunes. I do think it raises important questions for all American citizens about what the criteria are, the government choosing to spy on Americans. And they are clearly quite low. And that bothers me.</p><p>POCAN: Tucker, where we might find some agreement is, I along with many Republicans and Democrats had problems when we reauthorized FISA because we want to keep it tighter, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Nobody should have voted for it.</p><p>POCAN: I just think some of the people now who are trying to use the memo should have also been around there if they knew it at that time, why did they allow the reauthorization of FISA to happen.</p><p>So, again, it just shows again one more reason why that memo is such a joke.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm with you on that. It doesn't necessarily discredit the memo, but it's a real question.</p><p>I'm going to ask you about an actual story just broken in \"The Daily Mail\" that shows that Adam Schiff had a phone call with two comedians who he believed were Russian and they offered him photographs of Donald Trump with a Russian model.</p><p>He says he thought - he knew it was a prank. That's clearly a lie because he dispatched a member of his committee staff, Rheanne Wirkkala - makes 100 grand a year; we checked, she works there - and she emailed them and said this. \"I understand Mr. Schiff had a productive meeting. Would you like to make some material available to Mr. Schiff through your embassy?\".</p><p>Then, again, she said, \"Let me know the best way to pick up these materials from your embassy in Washington.\" And she emailed back the next day. \"Do you know when we might be able to meet your colleagues at the Ukrainian embassy here in Washington to pick up the materials?\"</p><p>How is that not Adam Schiff's' office coordinating with foreign agents to get damaging material on a political opponent? Isn't that exactly what Trump is being accused of?</p><p>POCAN: Not even close. But I think you should bring Adam in and ask him that.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he's too cowardly to come on the show. He accused me of working for Putin and then would never come on again.</p><p>But I just want to ask you, how is that - how is that OK?</p><p>POCAN: It's significantly different. So, first of all, this is one of the issues - I got PolitiFacted on - no one likes to be PolitiFacted in case you're wrong. I was PolitiFacted on that meeting that they had at Trump Tower with the Russian individual. And I got I think a mostly true because I said they came in the back door and we couldn't verify that they came in the back door. It could have been a side door and a window.</p><p>CARLSON: We've talked about that before.</p><p>POCAN: But it's a completely different situation. Are you actually equating the two?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm actually simply asking a very straightforward question.</p><p>POCAN: Yes, yes. I mean, are you equating the two? Because I don't.</p><p>CARLSON: It doesn't even matter how it compares to anything else. On its own terms, is it all right for the ranking member, Democratic member of the intel committee to set up a meeting -</p><p>POCAN: I think you need to have him to see, so he can explain if it was - what I believe I saw in your intro was that he said it was a comedian.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no. We have the emails from his staff.</p><p>POCAN: Then he would be a great guest to try to book on it. But I can't talk about it in an interview that I wasn't -</p><p>CARLSON: You can't talk about something someone else did? But you can talk about what Donald Trump Jr. did. He's not here.</p><p>POCAN: You are equating it to a meeting that's very well-publicized that we know about now.</p><p>CARLSON: We learned about this today.</p><p>POCAN: Yes. We learned today and the other one we've known for quite a long -</p><p>CARLSON: We have irrefutable evidence he was trying to get information from a foreign government - it's right here! Let's put it on the screen again.</p><p>POCAN: If the best we have is \"RT\" and a Russian comedian, is that really the best?</p><p>CARLSON: No! The best we have is a member of the intel committee staff right there, Rheanne Wirkkala -</p><p>POCAN: Tucker, I expect better.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm actually dead serious.</p><p>POCAN: This is kind of like local communicators. Devin Nunes could do this.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no. I'm serious.</p><p>POCAN: I'm surprised that you are. I have a lot more respect for you.</p><p>CARLSON: You are not going to engage, are you?</p><p>POCAN: It's kind of ridiculous. It really is.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, it is? It's just a joke?</p><p>POCAN: So far, what you're putting up today is - seriously, when you had the intro as I watched it on sitting next to you, I thought it was tongue- in-cheek just to kind of prove a point.</p><p>CARLSON: The first part was. The Democratic Party has lost its mind and it is conducting a McCarthyite witch hunt.</p><p>POCAN: It is the president who said members of Congress who didn't applaud are committing treason.</p><p>CARLSON: I hated that. I hated that. I'm not here to defend Trump. I'm here to defend the basic civil liberties I grew up with.</p><p>POCAN: And I think you and I probably have some agreement on the FISA -</p><p>CARLSON: Why don't you get on this one and we can talk about it later because it's interesting.</p><p>POCAN: I will take a look and I'll read it.</p><p>CARLSON: Appreciate it.</p><p>Spats over Russia are distracting from the real issue of the Nunes menu, the possibility that intelligence services are spying on you and other American citizens without real restrictions.</p><p>Sharyl Attkisson host Sinclair's \"Full Measure\" has herself said that she's the target of government surveillance and she joins us tonight. Sharyl, thanks a lot for coming on. You spent years on this question with basically no support from your colleagues in the media or relatively little.</p><p>Are you surprised by the posture in the press which is, it is wrong to want to know more about who the government is spying on?</p><p>ATTKISSON: Well, I'm not because, as I've written in the last couple of years and spoken to, I think the press in general, while there are still many good reporters doing independent reporting, it's getting harder.</p><p>We have invited some of the propagandists into our newsrooms, we allow them to dictate the talking points and messages du jour. And it's getting more difficult, I think, to find sort of down the middle, unbiased reporting.</p><p>CARLSON: But shouldn't the default position of a journalist be more information rather than less? So, when we learned last week of the possibility that the US government spied on a US citizen on the basis of pretty flaky information, was it weird to see reporters stand up and say, tell us no more! We don't want to know! In fact, you are unpatriotic if you want to know more.</p><p>ATTKISSON: I've never seen anything like it. in fact, I commented that I've never, in my lifetime, seen open government groups and journalists so uncurious and begging not to be told about alleged or supposed violations of citizens' rights.</p><p>And this leads into a much larger picture, I think, of surveillance abuses that have occurred over the past 10, 20 years involving citizens, politicians and journalists.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean, just to do the opposite of putting our fears to rest, this is not as uncommon as we hope it is, is it?</p><p>ATTKISSON: I think not. Long before Trump announced running for president, I had intel sources, contacts, who I'm still in touch with, who have said that for a long time there has been presentation of bad evidence to the FISA court to justify warrants, that there has been sort of a reverse engineering when political figures want to target people illegally.</p><p>They find someone in their orbit that they can target and then capture them incidentally and then accidentally capture their data and unmask them acting surprised that that's who it was when that's the target that they intended to capture all along.</p><p>Tucker: It's totally wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, you are one of the first to call attention to this kind of thing and we're grateful for that. Thank you.</p><p>ATTKISSON: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: David Garrow is a historian. He's written excessively on the FBI in a number of different books. In a piece for today's \"Wall Street Journal\", he says that some members of Congress, including some Democrats, think we are reverting to the J. Edgar Hoover era in the treatment of the FBI. David Garrow joins us tonight.</p><p>David, thanks for coming on. We searched -</p><p>David Garrow, Author and Historian: Good to talk to you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: - for the last three days for the last honest liberal who will stay consistent to liberal values of openness and commitment to civil liberties. Give us some perspective here. When you hear people say the FBI would never do that, you are attacking our guardians by asking that question. Is there some historical precedent for this, would you say?</p><p>GARROW: I'm very worried, Tucker, at how people are giving up their principles, their civil liberty principles because of the intensity of their partisan hatred for President Trump.</p><p>As you know, I'm a liberal Democrat.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GARROW: But what we've got here is Democrats forgetting the history of the FBI and taking up these anti-civil liberty stances defending the FBI simply because of how intensely opposed they are to President Trump.</p><p>The FBI does not have a good pedigree on electronic surveillance practices. And everything I'm aware of as a liberal Democrat is that the bureau has been really deceptive with the foreign intelligence court in applying for this extended electronic surveillance of Carter Page, the volunteer Trump advisor.</p><p>Liberals and progressives should oppose the FBI's behavior targeting Mr. Page.</p><p>CARLSON: Just on civil liberties grounds, having nothing to do with the larger investigation or their like or dislike for Trump, but an American citizen is having his civil liberties violated, liberals should care, right?</p><p>GARROW: And based primarily or extensively, it appears, on the dodgy Christopher Steele dossier. I think we both know - again, I'm a liberal Democrat - the Steele dossier is c-r-a-p. It's BS.</p><p>The FBI relied upon that in going to federal judges to surveil an American citizen. That's offensive to me as a progressive democrat.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. David Garrow, author of the definitive biography of the last president Barack Obama. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>GARROW: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: An NFL player is dead thanks to the criminal behavior of a twice- deported illegal immigrant. Will it make Congressional Democrats reconsider, and some Republicans, their support for de facto open borders. One of them joins us next. We'll find out. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: NFL player Edwin Jackson of the Indianapolis Colts appears to be the most high-profile recent victim of crime by someone here illegally. Jackson was killed when his ridesharing vehicle was alleged hit by Manuel Orrego-Savala, a twice deported Guatemalan immigrant who was apparently driving drunk without a driver's license.</p><p>There was no reason for this man to be in the country, save that our country's politicians are steadfastly determined to let him stay. A recent chart by \"Axios\" hints at why. Democrats are dominant in districts that have a high immigrant population. Democrats know the math. They know they've alienated middle America, which does not vote for them anymore. And so, immigration is central to their future victories. They cannot win without it.</p><p>Congressman Pramila Jayapal is a Democrat representing Seattle, Washington and she joins us tonight. Congresswoman, thanks for coming on.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D), WASHINGTON: Happy to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you recently said of the Trump immigration proposal that it targets \"people of color\" and it advances his hate-filled agenda. So, I guess I'm willing to believe that. But the proposal would give amnesty and then citizenship to about 2 million immigrants here illegally, almost all of them people of color. How is that white supremacy?</p><p>JAYAPAL: Well, let me just start by saying what he's proposing, which, first of all, Trump is the person who actually made 1.8 million people deportable because until he came along and rescinded DACA, those folks were all here with legal status, working, contributing billions of dollar to our economy.</p><p>But then, he said, OK, I'm going to take this group of young people hostage. And, Tucker, across the country, about 90 percent of Americans believe there should be a permanent solution for these young people, for these Dreamers.</p><p>And he said, I'm going to hold them hostage. And the ransom is going to be an ever-moving target, but the latest target is we are going to cut legal immigration by 22 million, we are going to have to get rid of the diversity visa. We are going to need to get $25 billion on the border.</p><p>So, all of a sudden, 1.8 million immigrants that he made deportable are now being traded for essentially ending legal immigration as we know it.</p><p>CARLSON: So, let me just say - by the way, we are getting breaking news that federal immigration charges have just been filed against the driver, apparently drunk in the case that we referenced coming into the segment.</p><p>Let me just be clear, though, for most of American history, we have not had a million legal immigrants coming into this country every year. That has not been the rule for our history at all. Not even close to it.</p><p>And so, if the cuts you just referred to were to become law, we get back to the 1990s level of legal immigration. Does that suggest that Bill Clinton was a white the supremacist too?</p><p>JAYAPAL: No. This really is about - the cornerstone of our country's immigration policy has always been family-based immigration. If you come to this country, you can be here with your kids.</p><p>And the Republican Party used to be a party of family values. I don't know that anybody's claiming that today. But the reality is immigration is all about making sure that we continue to have people here who can do the work we need to do, have done - who contribute to the diversity of the country, who contribute their skills.</p><p>And across the board, we've had -</p><p>CARLSON: That sounds reasonable. Then, why not judge people on those bases? So, the majority of our legal immigrants come because they're related to someone here. We don't look for the most talented people in this or that field, for the majority.</p><p>We say, do you have a relative who lives here? You would never hire your congressional staff on that basis. You wouldn't say, oh, I'm going to take your cousin because he's your cousin.</p><p>JAYAPAL: That's a faulty premise because you are assuming that they don't bring anything other than being a relative of a family.</p><p>CARLSON: No. I'm just saying we don't have - no, no, no. Look, I think it's great when families are unified. I'm very pro-family.</p><p>But when you're trying to make the country as impressive as you possibly can, why wouldn't you choose the most impressive possible people -</p><p>JAYAPAL: Because we are bringing the most impressive people. If you look at technology companies, the enormous number of people who are immigrants who have started those technology companies, small businesses, same thing.</p><p>You look at any field of science, research -</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not arguing against immigrants. I'm merely saying, why not get the most impressive ones. You're saying we're required or racists to give citizenship to people who snuck in in here and their parents and their sibling and possibly their grandparents and uncles too or else we're racists. So, that's a hostage situation.</p><p>JAYAPAL: But that's just not true. I mean, what you said is not true because we don't allow grandparents into this country. We don't allow cousins to come in and be sponsored. No, we don't. We don't have any categories along that.</p><p>If you listen to your show, to people on Fox News, to Donald Trump -</p><p>CARLSON: OK, so you're not saying -</p><p>JAYAPAL: Hold on, Tucker. Let me just finish my point. If you listen to just what's going on, you would think that this family immigration system is somehow out of control. It's not. It took me 17 years to become a US Citizen.</p><p>By the time, I could become a US citizen, my parents were already very elderly and it would've taken another -</p><p>CARLSON: So, let me just ask you, does this standard apply to any other country? So, you met with Prime Minister Modi of India. Would you say to him, you need to let every person who sneaks in from Pakistan become a voting citizen immediately or else you're racist.</p><p>JAYAPAL: That's just not what we are talking about. We are talking about - no, it's not.</p><p>CARLSON: You're saying people who snuck in have to be given citizenship.</p><p>JAYAPAL: No, what I'm saying is we need to have an immigration system that actually recognizes the needs of our economy, the needs of our communities.</p><p>CARLSON: Is there any other country that should have these standards applied to it.</p><p>JAYAPAL: There are lots of countries.</p><p>CARLSON: Any one?</p><p>JAYAPAL: Well, you look at Canada. They have a very substantial family- based immigration system. They allow a lot of refugees and immigrants in. And there are different systems all over the world.</p><p>CARLSON: Congresswoman, I'm sorry, we're out of time. Just give you one more sentence.</p><p>JAYAPAL: I will quote Lindsey Graham to you, Republican senator, America is an idea and we can't cut legal immigration.</p><p>CARLSON: American is an idea? No. America is actual people. It's not a theory. I live here. I'm American. I'm not an idea. I am a person.</p><p>JAYAPAL: I think the idea of who we are and what we bring with our diversity and people all over the country, all over the world -</p><p>CARLSON: That's a decision Americans can make. I appreciate it, congresswoman, for you coming on. Thank you.</p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hillary Clinton's worldwide excuses tour just made a stop at Georgetown. Her latest explanation is so awesome. Miss it at your peril.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Many of you who've read my book about what happened know that, I think, that misogyny and sexism was part of that campaign. It was one of the contributing factors. And some of it was old-fashioned sexism and a refusal to accept the equality of women and certainly the equality of women's leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, even though the majority of married women voted for Trump, all women lost when Hillary did. That, of course, was Hillary Clinton in Georgetown University just yesterday blaming sexism for her 2016 defeat, which apparently is still top of mind.</p><p>The remarks come just days after she was denounced for tolerating sexual harassment on her very own campaign team. Blaming people is Hillary Clinton's primary public pastime for the past year. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: The use of my email account was turned into the biggest scandal since lord knows when.</p><p>I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28th and Russia and WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me, but got scared off.</p><p>If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake.</p><p>There's all these stories about guys over in Macedonia who are running these fake new sites.</p><p>He certainly interfered in our election. And it was clearly interfered to hurt me and to help my opponent.</p><p>There was voter suppression. People trying to prevent other Americans from being able to vote.</p><p>I also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption I was going to win.</p><p>I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party.</p><p>Look, I take responsibility for every decision I make, but that's not why I lost.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: it's possible it's easier to find public appearances by Hillary Clinton that don't involve blaming everyone in every place from Manhattan to Macedonia. We haven't found one yet.</p><p>Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us tonight. Nothing makes me feel more sympathetic to Hillary Clinton, Brit, than appearances like this because I think this is someone who has no one in her life who can pull her back and tell her how she's coming off to other people.</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Tucker, she reminds me of other prominent people I've known who have made a terrible mistake, had a big failure, run into trouble.</p><p>And they have a very hard time, some of them, owning up to it and admitting that they were involved in a colossal failure and they are to blame because when you think about her failure here, her failure to win this particular election, she was up against Donald Trump, a man who's favorable ratings were deep underwater throughout virtually the entire campaign, the electoral college math appeared to favor her overwhelmingly, the polls all said she was leading and it didn't seem possible she could lose, and yet she did.</p><p>That is a very, very hard thing to face up to. And I think she is doing her best to find a way to look at this and a way to frame it that makes it appear that she really wasn't all to blame.</p><p>And otherwise, I don't know what she'd do if she didn't have this crutch she has developed of all sorts of other reasons.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, not to turn this into a Bible study or anything, and you've lived a long time, and don't you think it's true that when you accept blame for things, when you realize your failures are your fault, it's liberating. It's good for you. You feel better when you do that.</p><p>HUME: Yes. I agree with that. Every now and again, I will get asked to make a graduation speech and my message is always the same to young people. Own your mistakes. Admit them, first of all, to yourself and then to anyone else that might be involved.</p><p>And it is liberating. And the peculiar fact of it is that, contrary to how it might feel to you, it almost always ends up making people think better of you than less.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HUME: But I think in her case, the burden of this is so great and the burden of acknowledging that, in any end, it was really up to her to get out and win the election and she failed to do so against a candidate who looked like he couldn't possibly win. So, here we are.</p><p>I will also say, by the way, Tucker, with regard to those most recent remarks, the ones she made yesterday, I don't think it's the case that America isn't ready for a female leadership and for a woman president.</p><p>They were just - the country turned out not to be ready for this woman to be president.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>HUME: Remember, she turned out not to be, as she refuses to admit, a very effective candidate and she comes with tremendous baggage, which she's always been hesitant to recognize as well, going back to her days in Arkansas and right through her husband's presidency and beyond.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, the obvious lesson in last election is America's pretty open minded. Certainly, open-minded enough to elect the right woman, I would say.</p><p>Brit, thank you very much. It's great to see you.</p><p>HUME: You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Big tech companies know almost everything about you, but they want to know more. We will show you Google's plans to spy on your children - for real - next.</p><p>CARLSON: We've been telling you for months now about the growing power of the big tech companies whose brand of surveillance capitalism has come to shape our politics and culture, in ways many people don't perceive.</p><p>Tonight, we want to give you a very specific example of that. It's both a look into the near future and a terrifying illustration of the control these companies seek over our daily lives.</p><p>We recently reviewed several patents filed by Google. As we describe them, ask yourself if you are comfortable giving this much power to unelected technocrats you have never met.</p><p>In the first patent filed in September 2016, Google envisions how it could send you personalized advertising based on what a camera observes in your home.</p><p>In the illustration that Google submitted to the federal government, the patent office, a camera in your bedroom sees a \"Godfather\" novel on your nightstand next to your bed and uses that to steer you to watching the movie.</p><p>If you think that's creepy, prepare yourself because it gets a lot creepier. In another patent application from September 2016, Google imagines how it could take control of your parenting, your relationship with your children.</p><p>Google's Smart Home system could detect children in your liquor cabinet, for example, or in their parent's bedroom infer that \"mischief is occurring and deliver a verbal warning.\"</p><p>In another example, Google imagines a hypothetical child called Benjamin. Google's cameras would be watching Benjamin at all times carefully. They could see if he's playing outside or using electronics.</p><p>Presumably, they'll also try to use that information to sell him things at some point because that's the whole point of Google. The same patent also discusses how the Smart Home could coach families on \"areas of improvement.\"</p><p>For example, if a family doesn't spend enough time together, eating together, in Google's estimation, Google might scold them and suggest that they set a goal of eating more often together. That is Google's description, not ours, by the way.</p><p>We contacted Google for a comment on this and the company. And we're assuming it was a person and not a robot, replied this way. \"We file patent applications on a variety of ideas that our employees come up with. Some of those idea later mature into real products or services. Some don't.\"</p><p>In other words, don't worry. We are not spying on you. Yet. We just have the patent for it.</p><p>Of course, tech is also dangerous because it's deeply addictive. In fact, more than anything, it's deeply addictive. Now, a group of early Google and Facebook employees are teaming up to check the companies they helped create.</p><p>Tristan Harris is a former Google employee. He heads up this new group, the Center for Humane Technology. Jim Steyer is the founder of Common Sense Media, which advocates for children. And they join us tonight. Thank you, both, for coming tonight.</p><p>You described these products as addictive. What do you mean by that?</p><p>TRISTAN HARRIS, FORMER GOOGLE DESIGNER: Well, what most people don't realize, they see addiction and they think it's happening by accident. We are addicted to lots of things.</p><p>We worried about our kids in the 1970s, they were addicted to gossiping on the telephone. What this misses is that, today, behind the other side of the screen when you're using it, there is 100 engineers whose entire job, not because they are evil, but their jobs is to figure out how do I keep you coming back to the product.</p><p>So, YouTube wants to autoplay the next video. Snapchat wants to put the number of days in a row, in something called a streak, next to every single person in your kid's contacts. They say, if you've got 30 friends, they say, here is the number days in a row you've sent a message to each friend.</p><p>And it keeps each of them hooked, because the business model, so long as it's advertising, is how do I hold on to your attention because the entire stock price is one-to-one linked with how much attention I get. And that's the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: So, we know, Jim, screen time has huge consequences.</p><p>JIM STEYER, CEO, COMMON SENSE: Huge consequences.</p><p>CARLSON: And it hurts children.</p><p>STEYER: Correct. It can.</p><p>CARLSON: It can. And there are a lot of disturbing metrics about kids and young adults are doing and some of them are linked to tech use. So, why has there been no public recognition of this? No widespread -</p><p>STEYER: It's interesting because I run Common Sense, the biggest kids' media group in the country. It has taken time.</p><p>I think part of it is we've got so excited about the incredible technological innovations that Silicon Valley brought us. And they are amazing.</p><p>We are not anti-tech. Tristan worked at Google. We are not anti-tech at all. Common Sense helps you find the good stuff.</p><p>But there has, clearly, been no regulation whatsoever. There's not even at the - no real discussion. And I think what's happening - you are a dad just like I am. My kids are starting to go, I'm not sure I really want this in my life all the time. I don't want this constantly pinging me or wanting me to come there.</p><p>Tristan told you what addiction is, but 60 percent of kids in the United States believe they are addicted to their cell phones. That's a really big deal.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you worked in them. Are they aware? They must be aware. You're saying they design this to be addictive. Do they have moral qualms about this?</p><p>HARRIS: Actually, in 2013, I created a presentation. It was the first Google memo - the second one got really famous - saying we have a moral responsibility as Google because, no matter what we do, we'll bump our elbow and a billion people's attention goes that way or you bump your elbow and a billion people's attention goes that way.</p><p>So, how do you ethically steer 2 billion people, actually, their thoughts, when they look at a smartphone or a feed? Because from the moment we wake up in the morning to the 150 times we check per day, it's like it's never been easier to see as a kid. You wake up. You check your phone and you see photo after photo of your friends having fun without you. Is that how we want to ethically care for all these millions and millions of kids?</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think, Jim, that there are enough people at these companies who can see clearly enough to pull back from this a little bit?</p><p>STEYER: The key is at the top. Here's the deal. Tristan is a whistleblower. This is the cigarette case all over again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>STEYER: We were just with a group of his engineering colleagues who had come forward and say, enough is enough. We've got to tell you this was unintentional. So, the key is the leadership at the top.</p><p>I should tell you this is a major challenge now to the people at the very top of the key tech companies in the United States. What values do you have? Is it just about how much money you can make and how much attention - how much the arms race of attention you could win, so you can monetize it by selling ads? Or are there other values?</p><p>And by the way, this is not a partisan issue, by the way. Everybody as a parents knows this all across the country.</p><p>CARLSON: And it's kind of wrecking the society. And I think we all feel that way.</p><p>STEYER: How do you hold them accountable?</p><p>CARLSON: I couldn't be rooting for you guys more. Really Godspeed. I hope you come back anytime.</p><p>STEYER: We will.</p><p>CARLSON: Please do. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS: Good to see you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: We've got another exclusive report on Google coming tomorrow. Pretty shocking actually. We're going to show you in detail how the company is tracking you without your knowledge. We tested it today.</p><p>#MeToo is coming to junk food. Pepsi CEO just speculated on ways that Doritos could be more family friendly. Is it time for some feminist chips? We will meet a feminist chip eater next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, we're not even allowed to have separate bathrooms for men and women anymore, but now we may have separate snack foods. In an interview, the CEO of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi suggested that Doritos could be more female friendly.</p><p>The female-friendly version would have a softer crunch and less cheesy residue on the fingers. Well, the comments sparked a backlash on social media, as everything does, which forced Pepsi to clarify today that there are no plans for women-specific Doritos.</p><p>Cathy Areu is breathing a sigh of relief. She's founding publisher of \"Catalina Magazine\" and, of course, spirit guide to the dark recesses of the left. Cathy, it's great to see you tonight.</p><p>CATHY AREU, FOUNDING PUBLISHER, \"CATALINA MAGAZINE\": Thanks. Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I'm trying to parse - (INAUDIBLE) thinking about what's upsetting about ladies-specific Doritos? And my only conclusion would be they suggest that there is some inherent difference between men and women, which I think is illegal now? Right?</p><p>AREU: No, what's upsetting is they were saying that women are different than men in the way that they eat, that women would like to crunch and they would like to lick their fingers when they Doritos, but they don't because women don't feel comfortable in society doing these things.</p><p>So, for Doritos, to even think that way, to think we do not want to crunch in public, they want to silent us, that's completely wrong. They are trying to silence women by not letting them crunch in public.</p><p>CARLSON: No, that's right. Keep the crunch. So, what's your saying is that vulgarity and rudeness are feminist victories. So, if a woman took her Cheeto paste and rubbed it through her hair or belched at the table, those would be feminist victories, right?</p><p>AREU: A feminist victory would be women allowed to do what men do with their Doritos. So, if men are licking their fingers and women should be allowed to do so as well. And the CEO was saying that women don't do those things. Don't feel comfortable doing those things, but want to do those things and to allow them to enjoy their Doritos, they were going to create lady-friendly Doritos.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you think - but just to be totally clear - it's a good thing, it's a victory for the feminist ideal when women are as repulsive as men are. Would you dip tobacco ever? Do you think throwing a dip of Copenhagen - do you think, a man does this, I'm doing this?</p><p>AREU: Why do you get to be gross and we can't be gross? So, it is a victory when women can be equal to men in any way. So, yes, in the 1700s, women couldn't walk on the grass because it was seen as dirty, but men could walk on the grass. So, it's the same concept. You can lick your fingers, but we can't? So, why do we have to be so pure and clean in society.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, I'm not imposing my values on anyone. I'm just wondering where these rules come from.</p><p>AREU: Men.</p><p>CARLSON: I suspect, as I often suspect when you and I talk, that a lot of these rules are actually formulated and enforced by women, just a guess, having lived here for 48 years. But do you think there's any truth in that?</p><p>AREU: It's men. Men are running things, aren't they? Aren't men still considered the majority, even though men are the majority in numbers in the country? Men are the majority, women are the minority. And the majority makes up the rules.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>AREU: And since -</p><p>CARLSON: But what if women were actually the majority, which they are, would they change the calculation?</p><p>AREU: Women are the majority. Unfortunately, still making $0.77 to every white man's dollar.</p><p>CARLSON: And even if that statistic were totally untrue? Before we get into more fake statistics -</p><p>AREU: - from the Department of Labor, that's not true.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, yes. OK. But let me ask you this. Do female-specific products always bother you? Does it bother you that bras are for sale? Those are mostly bought by women? Does that feel like a slap in the face to women or eye shadow?</p><p>AREU: No. Products that women need - no, there's nothing wrong with those products, but there's no need to make a chip that doesn't let us dirty our fingers. That's what this product is saying.</p><p>But men buy eye shadow. It's OK. It's 2018. Men are buying the same products that women are buying.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Does it bother you that women's razors are pink?</p><p>AREU: Well, women's razors can be blue as well.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Last question. When you are having dinner out with friends, whatever, non-determined gender, doesn't matter. Do you ever think to yourself, I'm going to be disgusting? I'm going to eat with my hands. I'm going to drink the soup from the bowl just as a way to express your liberation as a woman? Do you ever do that?</p><p>AREU: If you can do that and get away with it, but, unfortunately, women, we're just not there yet. And Doritos and PepsiCo doesn't think we're there yet. So, we're not allowed to be disgusting.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you ever fold your pizza by putting a finger in the middle like a roll your own cigarette and kind of fold it and just eat it like that? Have you ever Big Mac in fewer than three bites?</p><p>AREU: Yes. If I want to be equal and treated equally, I think I will start doing that in public.</p><p>CARLSON: You're a feminist, Cathy Areu! I love that about you. Thank you for coming on tonight.</p><p>AREU: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau just did some mansplaining about sexism to a woman! It's getting weird in Canada! Details next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau isn't just a case of nepotism gone wild, though. Of course, he is. Before using his father's name to take power, Trudeau was a drama teacher and apparently still can't resist the urge to lecture people.</p><p>During a recent town hall, Trudeau interrupted a woman and corrected her for using the sinister sexist word mankind.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maternal love is the love that's going to change the future of mankind.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: We like to say peoplekind, not necessarily mankind. It's more inclusive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There we go. Exactly. Yes, thank you. We can all learn from each other.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We can all learn from each other. Of course, Trudeau can't win in this modern world PC that he helped create. Feminists have already denounced him for mansplaining. Of course, the revolution always eats itself. That's the good part.</p><p>That's about it for us tonight. Tune in every night at 8:00 to the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and essentially groupthink, which in profound supply these days. DVR it if you haven't already.</p><p>Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity is next. Hey, Sean.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The company is introducing its latest compact product, the Sublue MixPro, which has two propellers to pull you along underwater while you take marine life photos and videos[2]. The Los Angeles company will show off the MixPro next week at CES 2020, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas. </p><p>The idea is to turn your undersea dive or swim into an adventure. The latest Sublue high-performance underwater motor system can pull you along at 1.8 meters per second. Above: Sublue MixPro can pull you at 1.8 meters per second.

It also has a colorful LED display that shows power consumption, speed model, and low battery warning. Most importantly for underwater selfies, the MixPro has a waterproof phone case mount so users can easily record moments while diving or swimming. The MixPro can take you to a depth of 40 meters (131 feet). It weighs 4.5 pounds, and it can recharge its batteries in two hours. It is designed for people 8 years old and up. Above: Sublue MixPro has a waterproof smartphone case built in. Image Credit: SublueIn previous product announcements, Sublue promoted the Seabow, a one-handed scooter for deep sea divers (revealed last year at CES); the WhiteShark Mix, an underwater scooter with a dual-motor; and the Swii, an electric kickboard great for little swimmers getting the hang of the water. Sublue estimates it has 65% of the underwater scooter market globally, a new part of the recreational mobility space. The company makes underwater scooters and drones that have enabled everyday consumers to explore underwater worlds in a new way. Sublue has 190 patents.

While most other companies have been squeezed by this crisis, the so-called 'FANMAG' stocks - Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Netflix (US:NFLX), Microsoft (US:MSFT), Amazon (US:AMZN) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - have reasserted their dominance across the likes of e-commerce, streaming and video conferencing. Yet these technology titans are not content to stop there. Increasingly stepping onto rival turf, one particular battleground is emerging - subscriptions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     Another bite of the Apple</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there was an iPhone-shaped elephant in the room at Apple's recent virtual product event, there were still some notable developments. It introduced a new bundled subscription service - called 'Apple One' - that combines its offerings across music, TV and gaming, among other things. Split across three tiers - one for individuals, another for families and a 'premier' package - users can pay between \u00a315 and \u00a330 a month to access Apple's digital services, saving money versus paying for them individually. Apple is hoping this 'one-stop-shop' approach can entangle more people in its web.</p><p>The move is part of a wider strategy to reduce dependence on the iPhone - Apple's flagship handset accounted for 55 per cent of net sales in 2019. As the smartphone market becomes increasingly saturated and consumers hold onto their phones for longer, iPhone sales are plateauing. So, Apple has been shifting to digital services to future proof its business. Beyond the initial sale of a piece of hardware, it can generate additional recurring revenue from this installed base by upselling subscriptions for the things users can do on their devices. As Tien Tzuo, chief executive of subscription software company Zuora says: \"Apple gets to have it both ways: sell the hardware for tons of mark-up, and then layer on the service revenue.\"</p><p>Revenue from services has been rapidly increasing, climbing 16 per cent in 2019 to $46bn. Twice as profitable as hardware, services enjoy a gross margin of 64 per cent versus 32 per cent for physical product sales. </p><p>But services is a competitive space - Apple TV, alone, contends with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, to name but a few. Amid a dizzying number of choices, there is the risk of 'subscription fatigue'. Research from Barclaycard Payments indicates that two-thirds of UK homes are signed up to a regular subscription service, with an average of seven contracts per household. Individually, we spend around \u00a346 each month on subscriptions, with entertainment platforms proving most popular. During a recession, consumers may curtail their number of subscriptions, although a bundle that is considered more value for money could prove more resilient.</p><p>Swedish streaming giant Spotify (US:SPOT) is certainly worried Apple One will cannibalise its subscribers, accusing Apple of \"using its dominant position and unfair practices to disadvantage competitors and deprive consumers by favouring its own services.\" There could potentially be another antitrust investigation on the way.</p><p>How regulators will react remains unclear, but the move has pleased analysts who have long been clamouring for Apple to set up a Prime-like bundle. As customer 'stickiness' increases, analysts at Morgan Stanley argue that Apple should be \"valued like a technology or consumer platform, rather than a more cyclical hardware company\". That could go some way to justifying its lofty valuation - the shares are currently trading at 29 times consensus 2021 earnings.</p><p>                     Survival of the fittest                   </p><p>Within the premium tier of Apple One is the new 'Fitness+' service that is set to launch later this year. Offering virtual workouts, it syncs with Apple's smart watch, allowing users to track their performance in real-time. The service is emblematic of Apple's push into health and wellness-related spaces - chief executive Tim Cook told CNBC last year that his company's \"greatest contribution to mankind\" will be in healthcare. It is a timely release amid the boom in home workouts sparked by Covid-19. Analysts at investment bank Needham estimate the pandemic has accelerated the shift to home gym set-ups by three to five years.</p><p>                     Peloton (US:PTON) has been a big beneficiary of that trend, swinging into the black for the first time. The company had been aiming to be profitable on an adjusted cash profit basis by 2023 but generated $118m of cash profits in the year to 30 June. This came as it sold more bikes and treadmills and more than doubled the number of 'connected fitness' subscribers - those who use its hardware - to 1.1m. Peloton ultimately hopes to reach 100m subscribers, although the timeline is unclear.</p><p>The emergence of Fitness+ could give it reason to sweat. Apple's service is cheaper at \u00a39.99 a month versus \u00a312.99 for Peloton's basic digital membership, and Apple can promote Fitness+ to its huge customer base. In addition, users could find Apple's offering more accessible - many of its workouts require little to no equipment, whereas Peloton is more based around a bike or treadmill, ideally one it has supplied. While it recently lowered the entry-level price of its equipment, the cheapest bike would still set you back \u00a31,750.</p><p>In public, Peloton does not seem intimidated. Chief executive John Foley says Apple's move is \"a legitimization of fitness content.\" Some argue Peloton's provision on hardware gives it an edge. \"While the Fitness+ software design will be superior to Peloton's, Peloton's bread and butter, a $39 monthly All-Access Membership, is still in good shape as they have the hardware-software integration advantage,\" says Gene Munster, managing partner of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. But further trouble could be ahead. Rival Echelon Fitness recently caused a stir when it said it had developed an \"Amazon-exclusive connected bike\" - a claim Amazon has since refuted. But it speaks to the fact that another Big Tech player could easily enter the market and spoil Peloton's party.</p><p>                     Upping the tempo                   </p><p>While a 'Prime bike' remains elusive, Amazon is making waves elsewhere as its Music service introduces podcasts in the US, UK, Germany and Japan. It has some catching up to do with leaders Apple and Spotify - Amazon will start off with 70,000 titles versus Apple's catalogue of over 1m shows and Spotify's 1.5m . But Amazon has deep pockets and has lined up exclusive new original content from high profile names such as actor Will Smith. It is tapping into over 55m existing Music subscribers and is looking to harness its smart home speakers - the Echo has a 53 per cent share of the US market.</p><p>Amazon already owns podcast platform Audible, but combined with this latest effort, it could thwart Spotify's designs on the podcast market, driving up the cost to acquire new subscribers. Currently, around a fifth of Spotify's 299m monthly active users listen to podcasts, with the rest using the platform for music. But music record labels are the gatekeepers of content and high royalty costs mean Spotify's gross margin is only 25 per cent.</p><p>Podcasts have traditionally been hard to monetise. There are low barriers to entry and distribution has typically relied on 'RSS feeds' which allow the same podcasts to appear across multiple apps. In effect, that means that something like Apple Podcasts behaves more like a directory rather than a Netflix-style platform for exclusive content. In terms of generating revenue, advertisers commit less spending when they do not have much information on who the audience is.</p><p>Apple has thus far been happy to act as a benevolent hub, but Spotify is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to become the sole distribution platform for an array of podcasts. It acquired sports and pop culture podcast creator The Ringer earlier this year for (EURO)170m and secured an exclusive partnership with the Obamas.</p><p>Amazon is wise to the fact that exclusive podcasts offer a potential data goldmine as adverts can be tailored to who is listening, what they listening to and for how long. Much like Apple, its subscription services can further ensnare consumers within its ecosystem.</p><p>                     A gaming showdown                    </p><p>Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Sony (JP:6758) have been locked in a perpetual battle over who can produce the best games console and accompanying games. Typically, users have spent hundreds of pounds on their latest devices and then paid upwards of \u00a340 for new titles that they wish to play. But gaming is now increasingly following in the footsteps of other entertainment media. Subscriptions are gaining traction, and this would allow revenue to keep flowing in the lull when there is no new console or blockbuster title.</p><p>Microsoft introduced its 'Game Pass' in 2017, but it really took off this year amid the Covid-19 surge in gaming. Game Pass allows users to access a library of games - including brand new releases - for a monthly fee and has seen its subscribers surge by 50 per cent since April to 15m. With that in mind, Game Pass has been placed front and centre of the launch of the latest Xbox, due to come to the market later this year. Rather than an upfront payment, gamers will be able to subscribe to a package that includes the console and a Game Pass through a 24-month contract. The Game Pass offering will also be bolstered by the recent deal struck to purchase ZeniMax Media - owner of publisher Bethesda Softworks - for $7.5bn. Sony has typically edged Microsoft on the content front, but with this acquisition, Microsoft is sending the message that it is taking the games just as seriously as the console. It will be able to put Bethesda's future titles on Game Pass as soon as they're released and restrict competitors' access to these games.</p><p>While Microsoft is moving ever closer to the reality of a 'Netflix of gaming', Sony has been more resistant. It has introduced a disc-less version of the PlayStation 5 that will only play digitally downloaded games, but it does not plan to follow Microsoft's subscription route. Currently, 'PlayStation Now' subscribers can access older games on their PS4, but they still have to pay to play the newest releases. Jim Ryan, chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment told trade publication gamesindustry.biz: \"We are not going to go down the road of putting new releases titles into a subscription model. These games cost many millions of dollars, well over $100 million, to develop. We just don't see that as sustainable.\"</p><p>Still, Mr Ryan has hinted that the PS5 could be Sony's last amid the shift to cloud gaming - this means games are played purely online using an android device and compatible controller. Asked by the Financial Times whether there would be a PS6, he replied: \"The truth is, I don't know and nobody does know.\" November's showdown could therefore mark the beginning of the end of the console wars. </p><p>Unlike their fledgling competitors, Big Tech will find it much easier to wade into new territory and build up subscription services as they can mobilise an already established customer base and use the cash flow from their profitable operations to invest in growth. Amazon's shift into podcasting is not a gamechanger, but is an additional feather in its cap. For Apple, this could conceivably be the starting point that sees consumers ultimately subscribe to Apple as a whole - an 'Apple-as-a-service' model that bundles together its hardware and software, keeping users in its orbit long-term.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-66207255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X1-FNT1-DY4H-K08C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1939\"/><timeReceived>12:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Even the United Nations (UN) agrees that it is more of a right than a luxury. However, in Africa, billions of people are either unreached, have low-quality Internet, or cannot afford it .    This can be linked to several systemic issues across the continent, but several stakeholders can agree that a first step would be to deepen Internet infrastructure . Subsea Internet cables from the likes of Seacom, Glo, MTN, MainOne, and a host of others are the major backbone of such a move.    In May 2020, Facebook announced that it was planning to build a 37,000km subsea Internet cable worth $1 billion . While this seems like good news, there\u2019s just one small thing; from 2000 to date, at least 19 submarine Internet cables have been connected to Africa.   What are subsea Internet cables?   Subsea cables carry telecommunication signals across the continents of the world, connecting countries to international Internet exchanges.        \u201cThe subsea cables are like the fibre cables laid on the land except that they have other materials protecting them as they have to stay underwater for life/long time,\u201d Simon* a top telecom executive explains.   Why are subsea Internet cables important?   Subsea cables help users access the Internet at high speeds. Your service provider connects to one or more of these cables which, in turn, offer you access to the Internet.    \u201cSubsea cables deliver Internet capacity and reliability and underpin the further growth of 4G, 5G, and fixed broadband access for countries,\u201d says Ifeanyi Akosionu, Business Director, Technology, Media and Telecoms (TMT) for Verrakki.    Damage to these cables can cause network disruptions , and you will either have significantly lower connectivity speeds or your network will be offline.   How does the value get to the user?   As Simon explains, service providers buy access to these cables at wholesale prices, and in turn, they retail it to end-users. Usually, the subsea cables connected to other continents give you access to their content.    However, the rise of local Internet exchanges \u2014 a physical location where content providers and Internet service providers connect \u2014 has made sure your requests for content do not go overseas.   Will more subsea cables bring faster Internet?   Having just subsea cables does not translate to faster Internet capacity. Service providers might only have to pay less to connect due to increased competition. Ideally, this should reduce the cost of data for end-users, but this is not always the case .    According to Akosionu, ample international capacity is good if countries have the required infrastructure to leverage. This will be through networks that take the capacity at the country\u2019s borders to every state and town.        There is a gap  A glut of Internet cables in Africa. Source: Many Possibilities   Akosionu\u2019s statement points out the gap between Internet cable capacity at Africa\u2019s borders and its states and towns. On closer inspection, this gap is massive.    According to data from Many Possibilities , the West and East African coasts each have cables with Internet capacity of at least 100 Tbps. By the end of 2021, the number could double.    In comparison, according to 2019 data from cable.co.uk , apart from Madagascar, no African country has an average Internet speed of up to 10 Mbps. Madagascar enjoys the benefits of a submarine cable that gives it an average of 22 Mbps, which is why it has a global ranking of 33.    However, other African countries are not so lucky. To reflect the gap in numbers, out of an available 100 million Mbps (100 Tbps) on the East and West coasts, African countries use just 10 Mbps on average.    Most of these countries rely on wireless 2G/3G networks, while a few have access to 4G networks that are usually slower than global standards.    While major cities like Lagos, Nairobi, and Cape Town can boast of decent network speeds, rural areas are either still unreached or underserved.    Funke Opeke, CEO of MainOne cable company, reveals that ten years after its launch, the MainOne cable (10 terabits) only operates at 10% capacity.   The importance of the last mile   Going past the sea level, for Africa to reap the full benefits of its Internet capacities, there have to be significant investments in fibre optic cables to reach the last mile.    Akosionu states that historically, base transceiver stations (telecom masts) achieved connections with the coaxial cables, but recent innovations have incorporated fibre optic cable connections using fibre-to-the-antenna (FTTA) technology.    According to him, as more people get connected to the Internet, and with 5G on the horizon , the case for such fibre network connections becomes stronger.    However, for most African countries, Internet infrastructure remains a big problem. This is usually the result of unfriendly business terrains, dominant monopolies, or multi-layered regulatory hurdles.    The result? Several locations still don\u2019t have access to the Internet , and for several others, the quality is subpar.   The possible threat of big tech      With the likes of Facebook planning to build a subsea Internet cable to add 180 Tbps to Africa\u2019s current capacity, one has to ask where it will all fit in?    A report by Analysys Mason named \u201c THE IMPACT OF FACEBOOK\u2019S CONNECTIVITY INITIATIVES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA \u201d(PDF) stated that Facebook\u2019s initiatives would generate up to $50 billion for Africa.    However, it is not clear how much Facebook is investing to deepen Internet infrastructure to the last mile.    Akosionu states that moves by the likes of Google and Facebook are the result of large volumes of data traffic on their platforms. For him, these deployments aim to hedge against insufficient cable capacity at agreeable commercial rates and provide route diversity, amongst other factors.    Akosionu affirms that the gap between terrestrial fibre networks and Internet cables needs to be closed for Africans to enjoy improved Internet at reduced costs.    Opeke further asks why Facebook is adding to an existing glut and not making use of what exists to deepen terrestrial infrastructure in Africa?    \u201cWe have hundreds of terabits offshore, but we struggle to get one terabit around Nigeria,\u201d she explains.    Opeke points to the fact that over-the-top services offered by tech giants have slowly eroded telcos\u2019 voice revenues over the years.    Despite the supposed growth in data traffic, voice has remained the cash cow and declines in voice revenues have not been offset by growth in data revenues.    \u201cIf the profit margins of telcos become gradually eroded, what happens to them? Given the presence of Google or Facebook, what happens if they lose the incentive to build last-mile infrastructure?\u201d    Though Facebook is looking to partner with telcos, it is not clear how telcos will benefit considering the operational and regulatory hurdles they will have to face while deploying these infrastructures.    Barring a few states in Nigeria , for example, high fees are charged before telcos are granted permission to lay fibre-optic cables. Until recently, Telkom SA in South Africa enjoyed a monopoly on broadband.    Apparently, a lot of work needs to be done to connect Africa to the Internet at affordable rates for its citizens. It would, therefore, be interesting to see how big tech\u2019s Interest in Africa plays out.

Dr Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng in Singapore, discusses the possibilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Major themes in 2019 that will drive the ASEAN's markets and outlook include the US-China trade war; rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve and tightening global monetary conditions; and a wild card including global attacks on digital companies. Upsides could come from a trade peace deal between the two major trading powers, or a pause in the Fed's rate hike cycle. We see some chance of a ceasefire on tariffs, but the trade spat will continue broadening to non-tariff barriers, for example on export controls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The US-China trade war is disrupting global and electronics supply chains, which are centred on China with extensive links to Northeast Asia, Singapore and Malaysia. Disruption to trade may intensify in early 2019 if this tariff dispute escalates, tipping manufacturing into a contraction.</p><p>For the ASEAN, exports to China and US account for about 14 per cent and 11 per cent of total exports, respectively, their two largest markets. Most models show that the ASEAN will benefit over the longer-term from diversion, but the region's net gains are far smaller than China's loss from the trade war. Trade disruption is first order, in terms of the magnitude of impact on growth. Trade and investment diversion is second order.</p><p>Companies need time to shift their production arrangements and set up new plants to optimise against higher American and Chinese tariffs. Companies will increasingly adopt a more flexible production network, for example a so-called China+1 strategy, to circumvent higher US tariffs. The existing China-centred supply chain network will gradually break up and become more dispersed across Asia.</p><p>This stand-off will divert trade and investment via third countries, including the ASEAN, to circumvent the high tariff walls. Some ASEAN member states, particularly Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia, may benefit as multinational companies and Chinese investors build new plants and expand capacity. A recent American Chamber of Commerce survey showed that 18.5 per cent of around 420 US companies in China plan to relocate their manufacturing facilities to the ASEAN. Industries in consumer products, industrial, technology and telecoms hardware, automotives, and chemicals have indicated interest in the ASEAN region.</p><p>For the last few months we have already seen early signs of foreign investment picking up in this region. Vietnam appears to be capturing the lion's share of the shifting supply chains and is often cited as a production alternative to its northern neighbour.</p><p>Recent pushes for greater free trade pacts, including the recent Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), may give some ASEAN members an advantage to attract foreign direct investment and benefit from the shifts in the supply chain. The CPTPP will give countries greater access to large markets, such as Japan, Canada and Australia. The China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Agreement (RCEP) is still under negotiation but may be concluded in 2019, which will also support the supply chain shift towards the ASEAN.</p><p>Deflationary and rate hike pressures</p><p>The US-China trade war may be inflationary for the Americans because of higher tariffs, but will be deflationary for third countries. First, the Chinese yuan depreciation will reduce the prices of Chinese-made goods. Imports from there account for about 20 per cent of ASEAN total imports.</p><p>Second, the dispute will divert excess supply to third countries. For example, Indonesia and Vietnam are accusing China of dumping steel, while India is accusing them of dumping solar panels. Thailand is importing and benefiting from plunging US soybean prices.</p><p>A large proportion of the ASEAN's consumer goods are from China. For example, more than half of Indonesia's imports of household washing machines and seats are from China, both of which are subject to higher US tariffs. China's tariff hikes on US agricultural products, such as soybean and fruits, may also result in higher ASEAN imports and lower US prices.</p><p>Generally speaking, the ASEAN as a whole will face tighter global financial conditions, with the Fed expected to continue with its rate hike cycle. Our view is that the Fed is on track to normalise and hike three more times in 2019, even in the face of slowing US growth, but instigate a pause by late 2019 and in 2020. A possible Fed pause in late 2019 is bullish for an emerging Asia.</p><p>Most ASEAN central banks started tightening and normalising policy rates in 2018, with the exception of Thailand and Vietnam. This coming year, we think 'current account deficit' countries will be under more pressure to tighten than 'current account surplus' countries, such as Vietnam. We expect the deficit countries, Indonesia and the Philippines, to continue tightening but at a more modest pace compared to 2018, to manage currency pressures as the Fed tightens. We are pencilling in a token Bank of Thailand rate hike to contain financial stability risks from overly-low policy rates. We expect both Singapore and Malaysia to remain on hold next year, as growth falls below potential and inflation eases. Vietnam's policy rates are also likely to remain the same.</p><p>Tighter focus on tech firms</p><p>A notable wild card in 2019 is the intensifying global backlash against giant tech firms. Issues such as data privacy, tax evasion, cyber-security and a US-China tech war is triggering a regulatory and tax wave. Tech titans such as Google and Facebook have been slapped with huge fines for anti-trust and data breaches. Investments in the US and Europe from Chinese tech firms are facing greater scrutiny and vetting. Many countries, including ASEAN members, are looking to tax e-commerce, focusing on the big tech players.</p><p>All across the ASEAN, tightening regulations are being introduced. Indonesia is introducing e-commerce rules in 2019, in which online merchants may be required to disclose their audited financial reports and foreign players may have to incorporate local entities for tax purposes. In 2018, Vietnam also drafted a cybersecurity law that requires internet companies such as Facebook and Google to store Vietnamese-based user data on servers within the country.</p><p>Similarly, Malaysia introduced a digital tax on services in its 2019 budget. Imported business-to-business online services will be taxed. Foreign service providers of software, music, video and digital advertising will be required to register with customs and remit the Services Tax.</p><p>Overall, amid the backdrop of volatile global conditions, our investment strategy team is upbeat about Vietnam, which is structurally positive on growth potential, particularly infrastructure spending. Vietnam is also likely to a great beneficiary of the changing regional supply chain, and its market is set to open up further over the following year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VIETNG-VIETNAMNGAZ0401201900011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VIETNG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P9-1Y11-F00C-64C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Vietnam News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Vietnam News Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18602\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002GH5</classCode><className>MALAYAN BANKING BHD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0008PCP</classCode><className>TRADE &amp;

I'm not a big fan of \"activist\" shareholders like him. In fact, I think the old nickname of \"corporate pirates\" was more accurate. But the letter that Elliott Management, Singer's investment firm, sent last week to AT&amp;T;'s board of directors couldn't be more true.</p><p><br/>The telecoms group that organized a controversial and ill-advised merger with Time Warner last year is a naive and poorly managed company, large enough to accumulate a $190 billion debt but not sufficiently big enough to fend off the top predators of the big tech groups that are ready for lunch.<br/>I predict that one day it will be a case study on how corporate arrogance destroyed a great deal of value. It is also an indicator of where technology, media and the market in general can be directed.<br/>It's hard to argue with Singer's math. Elliott, who owns a 3,200 mdd stake in AT&amp;T;, says the company not only failed to keep pace with the overall market, but actually underperformed more than 150 percentage points\" over the past decade. It is not good, especially at a time when most companies are going up.<br/>Still, that alone wouldn't make me cheer on the activist's involvement. Companies can perform lower for many reasons, including investing in their future. It's a shame that markets too often penalize a company for developing its business rather than giving money back to shareholders.<br/>But that's not the case with AT&amp;T;. Over the past 10 years, he has tried to buy growth, awkwardly, with a series of costly M&amp;A; deals. These include a failed attempt to buy T-Mobile, buying DirecTV at the peak of the traditional TV market and, more recently, Time Warner. Elliott correctly points out that this made AT&amp;T; \"an outlier in terms of its M&amp;A; strategy\u2014 most companies today no longer seek to build conglomerates.\"<br/>Too many of those who do try to compete with the absolute weight of the platform technology giants, without a coherent strategy. This is particularly true at the intersection of technology and media. Google's YouTube has one billion users. Apple and Facebook together spend billions of dollars on video content. Amazon and Netflix move to the premium space, once occupied only by HBO, Time Warner's innovative cable network. And the merger of AT&amp;T; scares off top talent, such as Richard Plepler, the former head of HBO, and other top executives, who could certainly see that the content wasn't going to be king in the new organization.<br/>This is not a work of morality about pampered creatives who resist accountants. It's a cultural problem. After AT&amp;T; completed its acquisition of DirecTV, the entire management team of that company also left. The result is a corporation that is bigger but certainly not better. I suspect AT&amp;T; will struggle to invest in high-quality content and 5G - the high-speed network that should ultimately be your daily bread - while paying off your huge amount of debt. That will be particularly true if interest rates start to rise.<br/>In a nutshell: the scale in this last stage of the overleveraged market is developed as a strategy. Being the greatest can help, but it can also hurt. Silicon Valley content could become less profitable if recession leads to market slowdownAdvertising. Uber fires hundreds of people and warns that it can no longer grow without worrying about profits.<br/>Regardless of their size, the companies that will be the winners will be those that are profitable. This may seem obvious, but it hasn't been for the past decade, as easy money took the edge away from investors' senses. Now, they're waking up and they want to see results. The skepticism about WeWork's next initial public offering is a good example. For every dollar the company earns, it spends two, math works better on private ledgers than in public markets.<br/>This all sounds like Singer's move on AT&amp;T;. Activists are often the canaries in the coal mine for large and enduring market trends. When Carl Icahn demanded a few years ago that Apple return billions of dollars in cash to investors, he indicated a more general shift towards corporate share buybacks and dividend payments at record levels.<br/>Elliott's letter could mark a similar turning point. The growth of passive investment in entire markets hides a wide divergence in corporate value within sectors. I think they will now see activists start circling like sharks around fat corporate seals in the telecommunications, media and utility sectors that have evidently tried to buy growth.<br/>Meanwhile, their competitors from large technology groups are already surrounded by regulators. Last week, California passed a new law aimed at forcing many firms to treat workers as employees, which would be a huge blow to the costs of companies like Uber. Attorneys general in 50 states and US territories launched an antitrust investigation into Google's dominance in search and advertising, while NY leads an investigation into Facebook's monopoly power. And in Europe, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a longtime stone in the shoe of Silicon Valley, received a broader mandate that includes digital politics.<br/>3,200 mdd share<br/>The American fund Elliott Management, a well-known activist fund, announced on September 9 that it won a $3.2 billion stake in the telecoms giant AT&amp;T;, whose securities rose strongly (up to 4.8 percent) on the Stock Exchange New York after the news broke.<br/><br/>Trump celebrates movement<br/>AT&amp;T; is one of America's leading telecom groups and last year expanded its empire with a merger with Time Warner that includes film and television businesses, including the HBO and CNN networks. President Donald Trump tweeted via Twitter that an activist investor has entered AT&amp;T; and trusted it to end the \"fake news\" that he believes is coming out of CNN.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8575386</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2N-MDD1-DY1R-B0RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DEWA</classCode><className>ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

Okay, I've been trying to interest you in this for eleven years now  'I think we should buy Amazon and Tesla because everyone is using Amazon and everyone wants a Tesla.'  Those statements might be true, baby girl, but if most people already know that, then the prices of Amazon and Tesla stock will already reflect it. People in the market are smart and fast. </p><p>Amazon and Tesla are already up thousands of percentage points for years and years now.  'Then how do you make money investing in the stock market?'  Two ways - the first way is to buy what you believe to be good stocks and hold them for a really long time. The good ones will go up enough so that the bad ones don't hurt much. And the bad ones have a chance to eventually become good as the people who run the companies figure out what they need to fix. That's how Warren Buffett, the best investor ever, has done it. It's simple, but it's not easy.  'What's the second way?'  The second way is harder to do. You have to figure out something before everyone else does, or find something that everyone is getting wrong about a company. For example, when a company is going through a difficult time, its price falls because other investors give up on it or assume a problem will last forever. If you figure out that the problem can be solved, you have an opportunity to invest.  'What do you mean by 'Problem'?'  When Facebook first came public, the stock got cut in half because investors didn't think they would be able to move their users from the desktop to a mobile app on their phones. But they built a great mobile app and they also bought Instagram, which was even better. If you bought it while everyone else was worried, you made ten times your money.  'So we should buy Facebook then?'  Well, that's the hard part. By now, the stock has gone from 18 to 180 per share because everyone now agrees that their mobile apps are great. You don't want everyone to agree with you, because then the opportunity is low.  'So what's something that we can disagree with people about?'  That's the even harder part. Everyone seems to believe right now that all the retail stores in the mall and on main street are going to close because of shopping on the internet.  'They already are closing, everyone is right!'  Well, the small number of people who disagree might make some money if that turns out to be not true, or if something else happens in the future that we can't imagine today.  'This is hard.'  That's why everyone isn't rich. Because it's hard.  ***  Jim Grant said 'Successful investing is having everyone agree with you..later.' It's a brilliant one-liner containing the essence of investing (value investing, I suppose) within a very small amount of syllables.  Howard Marks refers to this as second-level thinking:  First level - Amazon is kicking ass. Second level - Everyone knows Amazon is kicking ass. The stock is already priced as though they're going to own a double-digit chunk of the total US economy and succeed in every business they get into.  But to take it a step further, it's even more complex than that. Because in that second level, there is another calculation to be made, and it involves degrees. There's no formula for this calculation nor is there an agreed-upon set of inputs by which to run it. It's a guess. Is the near-universal agreement that Amazon is great under- or over-pricing the extent of this greatness?  No way to know. No way to even figure out how to know. And that'sbeforeall of our personal biases and baggage enter into the equation!  I've left this last bit out for these conversations with my daughter. I'm going to need maximum enthusiasm at this stage in her education.

Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  After years of not paying much attention, regulators and legislators in Washington from both parties appear very interested in curbing Big Tech's influence. They'll have plenty of people offering opinions on what they should do, as our colleagues Jack Nicas and Karen Weise reported. Karen and Jack went deep into the many, many other industries ready to complain about Big Tech, from retailers to musicians.</p><p>  So what have big tech companies like Google done to upset so many people? Take your pick.</p><p>  A noodle restaurant in Harlem complains that Google shows ads for food-delivery apps on the company's listing in search results that hurt its business. The delivery services charge the restaurant a fee, cutting into already thin profit margins. Other small businesses have lodged similar complaints.</p><p>  Big tech companies like the software giant Oracle, on the other hand, say Google competes unfairly in the advertising business, where it is dominant. It's important to note that the two have been involved for years in an intellectual property fight, with billions of dollars at stake.</p><p>  On Tuesday, a House subcommittee began hearings on potential antitrust enforcement of Big Tech. It could be years before something concrete comes out of these actions, but it is increasingly clear that some of tech's giants face years of headaches from government scrutiny.</p><p>  More tech trouble in China</p><p>  The tech Cold War between the United States and China keeps getting further and further away from any d\u00c3\u00a9tente.</p><p>  Our colleague Kate Conger reported that the Chinese government had summoned major international tech companies -- including Microsoft, Dell and Samsung -- into meetings to deliver a message: There would be consequences if they complied with the Trump administration's recent ban on sales of key technologies to Chinese companies.</p><p>  It appeared to be the latest in an escalating series of tit-for-tat moves. The back-and-forth is also unfolding at the corporate level, with Chinese and American companies lashing out at each other.</p><p>  An example surfaced midweek when it was revealed that Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that is being hurt by the Trump administration's ban, had demanded that Verizon, the American carrier giant, pay licensing fees on hundreds of patents that Huawei owns. The demand was unusual, since in the past Huawei rarely moved to capitalize on its intellectual property.</p><p>  But in today's acrimonious tech environment, along with the trade war being waged by the United States and China, there seems to be an anything-goes mentality.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The war on drug sales online is beginning to resemble the war on drugs in the physical world. Nathaniel Popper, who has been writing about the dark web for years, looked at how online drug sales continue to prosper, despite repeated law enforcement crackdowns.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 How does someone become radicalized on YouTube? Kevin Roose took a disturbing journey down the rabbit hole with a young man whose search for answers to his problems led him to very dark places on the video service.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The phones and online activity of protesters in Hong Kong were targeted. Paul Mozur and Alexandra Stevenson explained how the authorities brought aggressive enforcement from mainland China to the city.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''Death comes for all of us, but Silicon Valley has, until recently, not come for death.'' Nellie Bowles looked at a new arboreal trend in death.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Don't count on that merger between Sprint and T-Mobile just yet. Attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia sued to stop the $26 billion deal, Tiffany Hsu and Matthew Goldstein reported.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The scooter wars live on. Bird bought rival Scoot for $70 million, The Wall Street Journal reported, in a move that could bring Bird back to San Francisco, which kicked out the company last year.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Salesforce is still making big acquisitions. The cloud-computing company announced plans to buy Tableau Software for $15.3 billion, Don Clark wrote.</p><p>  Jamie Condliffe will be back to write the newsletter on June 21.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

ethics, say MPs - and prosecuted if they flout it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a damning report, the parliamentary committee on culture has blasted social media firms for \"failing in the duty of care\" they owe their users.</p><p>They launched an extraordinary attack on Facebook - accusing the Silicon Valley firm of trying to frustrate their investigations.</p><p>And they accused<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/5909484/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-data-breach-invite-uk-mps/\">Mark Zuckerberg of showing \"contempt\" for MPs by refusing to give evidence to them</url>.</p><p>It comes as Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright is heading to the US this week to hold talks with tech bosses - but admitted Mr Zuckerberg has still not said if he will meet him.</p><p>In a new report into fake news, MPs warned: \"Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a 'platform' and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites.\"</p><p>There is a growing clamour for a legal <url

14 year-old schoolgirl killed herself after viewing self-harm images on Instagram.</p><p>Mr Wright lashed tech giants for failing to protect their young users and warned he is considering new laws to make bosses at the firms face criminal charges.</p><p>And he vowed to get tough in his talks with Google, Facebook, Snapchat in the US this week, warning them: \"We will consider all possible options for penalties.\"</p><p>In their damning report, the culture committee said social media giants are being used to spread fake news by hostile states like Russia.</p><p>And they demanded that electoral law is overhauled to stop people's data being misused.</p><p>Tory MP Damian Collin, chairman of the committee, said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day.</p><p>\"Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.</p><p>\"These are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address.\"</p><p>He warned that the age of self-regulation \"must come to an end\".</p><p>He said: \"The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.\"</p><p>                     If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or visit <url

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].Summer Fields Investments commentary[2] for the second quarter ended June 2020, discussing that we might have moved to a new bull market.   Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] Dear Friends,We Might Have Moved To A New Bull MarketThe last client-wide letter sent was titled 'Bear Market Playbook', and logically,I feel obliged to provide a market update, becausewe might have moved from the fastest bear market[4] in history, to a possibly new bull market. It is not simple to pinpoint exactly where we are now in the market cycle. </p><p>Ed Yardeni, a respected analyst, mused recently that because of the speed of the bear market and ensuing recovery, the March lows may not have been a real bear market, but merely an extreme 'correction', and we might still be in the prior bull market. The fact that prior market leadership (Big Tech) is still leading the market supports this view. Some pundits think that we are due for a pullback here, and some actually predict poor equity returns for the next decade. Other economists believe that we are now in a new bull market, in the early stages of a new economicrecovery. Play Video[5]Both Jeffrey Gundlach and Ray Dalio, amongother financial analysts and pundits,have predicted that in the coming decade, the S&amp;#38;P 500 will provide low returns. I recentlyattended an excellent presentation online about the energy sector by Warren Pies, a Ned Davis Research analyst in the energy sector. The setup to his talk, in my view, was important. He discussed that because bond yields and interest rates are currently so low, it effects the intrinsic current view, and thus valuations, of the entire market. Applying a bond term to equities, the market currently looks at some stocks as 'long/high duration' instruments, and some stocks as 'short duration' instruments. This view becomes moreexaggeratedas interest rates creep lower and lower. Duration is a measure of sensitivity of a bond's or fixed incomeportfolio's price to changes in interest rates. In general, the higher the duration, the more a bond's price will drop as interest rates rise (and the greater the interest rate risk). As a general rule, for every 1% change in interest rates (increase or decrease), a bond's price will change approximately 1% in the opposite direction, for every year of duration. It has been easy to see that the market consistently shows short term thinking in extrapolating current events and conditions far into the future. We have seen this often, as it is part of the human condition. When we feel good, we sometimes think it will always feel this way. When the moodturns less pleasant, it sometimes seems it will always feel this way. In that way, it appears that the market has been lulledinto a feeling that interest rates will always be this low or lower. Indeed, we have experienced an almost 4 decade bull market in bonds (where yields have gone lower and lower). That trend has been getting more and more stretched and that shows itself in many different areas of the economy.A Look At Apple's EarningsIn order to see how this plays out in the real world, let's look at Apple[6], Inc as an example. As I have discussed in prior annual letters, I bought Apple when it was trading for around 10-11 times earnings in 2012-2013, for a dividend yield of around 2.4%, and an earnings yield (EPS/share price) of 10%, which was an outstanding bargain at the time. I initiated aposition after itannounced its first dividend, and I added to it relativelyaggressively as it fell 40% in the following year. At the time, the market was scared that it was a 'one trick pony' with revenues primarily coming from the iPhone, which was still nascent, and the iPod, which was diminishing in importance. It is worth noting that the ten yeartreasury yield was over 2% in 2012-2013, and the 30 year treasury yield was well over 3%. Currently, Apple trades at 35 times earnings, yields a 0.7% dividend, and has an earnings yield of 2.65%. The ten year treasury currently yields 0.63%, and the 30 year treasury yields 1.35%. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-1.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-1.png</url> We can see how as the ten year treasury yield falls through 2019 into 2020, Apple starts going parabolic. The divergence continues as the yield sinks lower. The Federal Reserve, in order to save the economy in March, aggressively injected liquidity in the markets and bought bonds in order to stabilize current financial paradigms. This caused rates to fall to extremely low levels as more bonds were purchased. This has contributed to increasingly warped valuations on already popular stocks. I do like this idea, which others in the financial community have echoed as well, that as bond yields have descended lower and lower, it has spurred investment in companies that could be considered longer/higher duration growth plays. The caveat, of course, is whether some of these companies can really sustain growth rates that the market is pricing in long term. The market often overestimates the growth trajectory of companies. The other caveat is, what happens if rates go higher? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-2.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-2.png</url> Some would call Apple's recent move a parabolic mania; others would say it represents a shift from hardware to services, which is higher margin - some would say it's a bit of both. In early June, we did have a taste of what would happen when rates rise. Many stores reopened in early June, and the 'reopening trade' came on. Many of our more value oriented positions mightily outperformed during this short time period, until concerns about the worsening of the virus and delayed reopening, as well as other economic concerns, came to fore, which caused yields to retreat again as more economic easingoccurred. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-3.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-3.png</url> First week of June ten yeartreasury bond yield spike - 'Reopening trade' As an aside, Ned Davis' conclusion about the energy markets was that there will probably be a recovery when demand recovers. My thoughts on that are, if energy is currentlyviewed as a short duration asset, it should recover stronger than usual as the real economy recovers and demand improves. Energy has been the worst performing sector since Covid, primarily due to demand reductions especially around jet fuel, industrial uses, and other such areas. But it could end up being the best performing sector when things turn. Going back to where we are in the economic cycle, if we are indeed at the tail end of a bull market, it makes sense to think that it might be a risky time in some sectors now.Increased retail participation is a known qualification for a possible market bubble, and with people cooped up at home with no sports betting and little else to do, they have jumped into the markets in exceptional volumes since the pandemic began. The data shows record numbers of new brokerage accounts opened this past year. Furthermore, as we can see, glamour stocks and glamour sectors got even hotter since the lockdowns. Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Chewy, Shopify, Etsy, and many other 'glamour' stocks are trading at extremely high multiples. Some, like Tesla, appear to not have multiples at all - most of their very slim profits come from selling regulatory credits, and they do not as of yet appear to be structurally profitable. Tesla has been promising 'Full Self Driving[7]' for 5 years, and has been taking customers'money for the service for some time already, but the service as named doesn't fully exist yetThe Different Market ManiasWe have successfully identified several manias in the past - The cannabis sector blew up, and then crashed - Tilray stock reached$176 per share a few years ago; now it is $6.64 per share. Some crypto-related stocks also bubbled up, and have since crashed (it remains to be seen what happens with crypto itself). This is a naturaloccurrencein markets, made even more possible through large monetary easing by the Fed. There are, of course, real andfundamental reasons some of these stocks are going up. E-commerce usage has gone up a lot due to quarantines, and the pandemic has indeed accelerated a lot of existing technological trends. Also, the fact is, FANG have shown themselves to be extremely cash rich, robust, and capable businesses (regulatory overhang aside). Even Tesla could have a large future buying base in younger fans who will grow up to view the car as a status symbol. However, the market constantly overshoots and undershoots. These dynamics are compounded by the rise in passive investing, which allows money to be funneled into large percentages of stock in the index, and for now that looks like the big getting bigger. This is reminiscent of 1999, as desired tech stocks went up much higher than normal, because of high insider ownership, where much of the float was locked up, and incremental investment pushed stock prices much higher than normal. Qualcomm, for instance, which many of us own, went from $3 per share to $87 per share from 1998-1999. Everyoneknew their technology would be ubiquitous and crucial in future technology applications. However, the market was a bit premature in predicting proper growth rates and accurate valuation, and overshot. The share price of Qualcomm went down to $13 in 2002, and did not exceed the prior highs of 1999 until 20 years later. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-4.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-4.png</url> We can see a lot of excitement in Yahoo's share price in 1999, leading up to its inclusion in the S&amp;#38;P500 index Another symptom of bubble behavior is the large number of SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) we are seeing listing on the public markets these days. SPACs are 'pre-revenue', meaning they are completely unproven entities. Investors are committing capital to these vehicles without even seeing any financial statements or evidence that they are even a business at all. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-5.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-5.png</url> Very smart people have tried to take advantage of bubbles over the years and have failed -Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most influential mathematicians of all time, lost a lot of money on the South Sea Bubble in the 1700s. The graphic aboutmonetary expansion shown in the 'Bear Market Playbook' letter was very revealing, and I am so happy and grateful that I incorporated that research into my macro views. As we know, the Fed has pumped more money[8] than the economy lost from missing economic activity in the past months, causing excess liquidity to slosh around in the markets. They have clearlyexpressedthe desire to let the economy 'run hot' and even exceed their desired benchmark of 2% inflation in order tocompensate for the lack of inflation in the past decade. This is probablydone on purpose in order to help inflate our way out of the large debt we have incurred, similar to after World War 2, when rates remained low but inflation was very high. This ended up reducing US debt. When this inflationary turn might occur is very hard to predict. But many experts that I admire and respect, and even some I don't, seem to be converging on this idea that the next decade might be moreinflationary than the market expects - notnecessarily 1930\u2032sWeimarGermany-style hyperinflation, but even a more normalized rate, and ensuing possible rate hikes, would be more than the market expects. Japan has had rates lower for longer, and themarket may imagine a similar dynamic for the US - but Japan is different in that their economy is not as large and diversified as the United States', and their demographics skew older with less of a young labor force than ours. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-6.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-6.png</url> A very sensible catalyst to real-economy growth would be an eventual infrastructure stimulus, which would probably come next year, whether the Red Team or the Blue Team wins the upcoming election in November.The Dollar Losing Its StrengthFurthermore, with the dollar going lower due to the US debt added, commodities now have room to go higher (there is typically an inverse relationship between dollar/commodity strength, for a number of various reasons). Commodity bull markets in the past have been led by precious metals - and we have just seen that recently in a powerful move up in gold[9] and silver[10]. Again, the timing is very hard to call, especially as 'passive investing' takes more and more share of the global market (passive investing just means that people pay money to Vanguard and Blackrock to pay any price for a bundle of stocks, and when they redeem, to sell for any price) and fund flowscontinue to expand market valuations, in my opinion somewhat irrationally. We can't exactly know when those dynamics will end and when momentum wanes and market leadership changes. 1999 is a decentcomparison for some areas of the market today, especially in some SaaS (software as a service) stocks where the competition is crowded, but companies are valued as being the next possible winner in the space. But another comparison some savvy investors use to the current market environment, where only a number of stocks are beingenthusiastically bought by the markets, is the 'Nifty Fifty' group of stocks in the 1960s. The 'Nifty Fifty' were stocks which had very bright futures and that was recognized by the markets, and were recognized as 'must-haves' at any price. People consistently bid the prices of these stocks higher and higher over the years. Many of them are companies we own now, such as Disney, McDonald's, and Coca Cola. Vitaliy Katsenelson, a value investor and fund manager, recently pointed out that just like people currently claim that tech companies deserve higher multiples because of less capital intensity and more intangible value on the balance sheet, so too, companies like McDonald's were also considered 'asset-lite'businesses back then, due tohow they franchise most of their establishments out to others who take on a lot of the financialresponsibility. After being awarded higher and higher share prices, ultimately during the next bear market in the early 1970s, they fell. Hard. From their highs, Coca Cola fell 69%, McDonald's fell 72%, and Disney fell 87% (!). It took the Nifty Fifty over a decade to surpass their prior highs. Most of them remained excellent companies, and even provided very good long term returns. But overpaying for them ended up being painful for a long stretch. Valuationmatters over the long run. Another obvious comparison betweencurrent market conditions and the Nifty Fifty is, these high flyers' valuations werealso crushed by higher than expected inflation, whichoccurred due to energy prices going a lot higher in a short period of time. We may be entering a similar environment down the line, as due to Covid-19[11], there has been reduced energy investment and capital expenditures. This could result in shortages, and prices would need to go back up in order to justify furtherinvestment in the sector. Energy is currently a despised sector, now fallen to around 2.8% of the S&amp;#38;P 500, from over 10% of it in the past. When that changes, we could see a reversion. The Fed wants inflation, energy will probably be undersupplied down the line, rates may go up, infrastructure stimulus will probably beimplemented to pass the baton from central bankfinancialstimulus to fiscal stimulus, and we could end up with a regime change in the market - one which favors value, cyclicals, financials, industrials and energy.Portfolio ActivityI would now like to share with you some of what we are doing now, all of that said. We trimmed a little bit of our retail exposure, as a nod to how E-Commerce has rapidly advanced from 17% or so of total retail sales, to possibly as much as over 30% of sales. While this leaves theremaining60-70% of US retail sales transacted in brick and mortar stores, there will be some shriveling at the margins and I reduced some of our exposure. I am still bullish (positive) on the survivors and consolidators, as people still love to get out and shop. We also have been buying some solar energy indices as an energy and election hedge. There are very few dividend paying solar energy companies, and they will probably end up growing through more investment in the space. Solar provided only 2% of US energy in 2019. If they get to 8%, that is two doublings. Of course, renewables are lower margin businesses, but regulatory demands will probably boost investment and usage. We can enjoy some of that in the coming decade. This past decade, the solar index went exactly nowhere. Completely dead money for a decade. Poor execution, Chinese oversupply, and other factors caused this. However, moreconsolidation and regulatory subsidy in the space will probably improve profitability, not to mention some decoupling from China that is taking place which may reduce oversupply and increase profitability in some of the domestic players. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-7.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-7.png</url> The ten year total return in this solar energy index has been -29%, a negative return for the decade. This could change in the next decade. We have also been selectively adding commodity producers, small and moderate positions, in the areas of agriculture and even metals and mining. They are trading at very depressed levels, and if we are indeed going into a commodity bull market eventually, these should do very well and pay us dividends to boot. You will notice I also initiated a rare position solely intended for capital gains. It is an insurer called Brighthouse Financial. It is trading at a mere fraction of its book value. If rates go higher, it should go higher as well. I wanted to end with a quote from an investor who had been through 1999. He recently wrote (1): 'If you remember 1999/2000, if you didn't own the bubble stocks, you actually did really well throughout the 2000-2002 bear market. It is very possible that this will happen again. Many of the frothy names can have large declines, maybe the S&amp;#38;P 500 index[12] even goes down 50% or more, and people who didn't own the most expensive stocks might actually still do well. So, don't let people scare you out of the market with this talk of market P/E's. If you are happy with what you own and how they are valued, hold on and things should be fine (like it was in 1999/2000). ' However, the following graphic was recently shared by my friend Dividend Growth Investor on his Twitter account, and could serve as a more positive counterpoint to the gloomier scenario above. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-8.jpg\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-8.jpg</url> We could actually be in the early stages of a new secular bull market, which goes to show you that the best strategy is probably to keep investing in attractively valued companies that have good corporate cultures for the long run Lastly, I wanted to share some very good news. Interactive Brokers enabled us to flip a switch and change to their 'Lite' version, which eliminates all trading fees, andespecially those peskyminimum monthly commissions for accounts under $100k. I am pleased to announce that there are NO trading fees, and NO MORE monthlyminimum commissions from Interactive Brokers. I am thrilled about that. That is the update for now. I wanted to give some context, historical and otherwise, on this very interesting market we are currently involved in. I will write much more detail in the next annual update published in early 2021. Since Covid, value type stocks have suffered one of their worst drawdowns compared to growth/glamour in a long, long, long time. However, that is usually the time to hold tight, and even add more value, as many seasoned investors have seen this before, and anticipate a reversion to the mean down the line. Value tends to perform best over long periods of time, but sometimes, investors must deal with long drawdowns. It makes sense that in this once-in-a-century pandemic, the market may be scared that things have changed forever. Reality, though, is usually more nuanced. By staying as disciplined and consistent as we can, we will hopefully be set up to enjoy the value premium when it finally returns, collecting and reinvesting our dividends on the way. Thank you as always for your continued business.

It is not simple to pinpoint exactly where we are now in the market cycle. Ed Yardeni, a respected analyst, mused recently that because of the speed of the bear market and ensuing recovery, the March lows may not have been a real bear market, but merely an extreme \"correction\", and we might still be in the prior bull market. The fact that prior market leadership (Big Tech) is still leading the market supports this view. Some pundits think that we are due for a pullback here, and some actually predict poor equity returns for the next decade. Other economists believe that we are now in a new bull market, in the early stages of a new economicrecovery. [embedded content] Both Jeffrey Gundlach and Ray Dalio, amongother financial analysts and pundits,have predicted that in the coming decade, the S&amp;#38;P 500 will provide low returns. I recentlyattended an excellent presentation online about the energy sector by Warren Pies, a Ned Davis Research analyst in the energy sector. The setup to his talk, in my view, was important. He discussed that because bond yields and interest rates are currently so low, it effects the intrinsic current view, and thus valuations, of the entire market. Applying a bond term to equities, the market currently looks at some stocks as \"long/high duration\" instruments, and some stocks as \"short duration\" instruments. This view becomes moreexaggeratedas interest rates creep lower and lower. Duration is a measure of sensitivity of a bond's or fixed incomeportfolio's price to changes in interest rates. In general, the higher the duration, the more a bond's price will drop as interest rates rise (and the greater the interest rate risk). As a general rule, for every 1% change in interest rates (increase or decrease), a bond's price will change approximately 1% in the opposite direction, for every year of duration. It has been easy to see that the market consistently shows short term thinking in extrapolating current events and conditions far into the future. We have seen this often, as it is part of the human condition. When we feel good, we sometimes think it will always feel this way. When the moodturns less pleasant, it sometimes seems it will always feel this way. In that way, it appears that the market has been lulledinto a feeling that interest rates will always be this low or lower. Indeed, we have experienced an almost 4 decade bull market in bonds (where yields have gone lower and lower). That trend has been getting more and more stretched and that shows itself in many different areas of the economy.A Look At Apple's EarningsIn order to see how this plays out in the real world, let's look at Apple[5], Inc as an example. As I have discussed in prior annual letters, I bought Apple when it was trading for around 10-11 times earnings in 2012-2013, for a dividend yield of around 2.4%, and an earnings yield (EPS/share price) of 10%, which was an outstanding bargain at the time. I initiated aposition after itannounced its first dividend, and I added to it relativelyaggressively as it fell 40% in the following year. At the time, the market was scared that it was a \"one trick pony\" with revenues primarily coming from the iPhone, which was still nascent, and the iPod, which was diminishing in importance. It is worth noting that the ten yeartreasury yield was over 2% in 2012-2013, and the 30 year treasury yield was well over 3%. Currently, Apple trades at 35 times earnings, yields a 0.7% dividend, and has an earnings yield of 2.65%. The ten year treasury currently yields 0.63%, and the 30 year treasury yields 1.35%. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-1.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-1.png</url> We can see how as the ten year treasury yield falls through 2019 into 2020, Apple starts going parabolic. The divergence continues as the yield sinks lower. The Federal Reserve, in order to save the economy in March, aggressively injected liquidity in the markets and bought bonds in order to stabilize current financial paradigms. This caused rates to fall to extremely low levels as more bonds were purchased. This has contributed to increasingly warped valuations on already popular stocks. I do like this idea, which others in the financial community have echoed as well, that as bond yields have descended lower and lower, it has spurred investment in companies that could be considered longer/higher duration growth plays. The caveat, of course, is whether some of these companies can really sustain growth rates that the market is pricing in long term. The market often overestimates the growth trajectory of companies. The other caveat is, what happens if rates go higher? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-2.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-2.png</url> Some would call Apple's recent move a parabolic mania; others would say it represents a shift from hardware to services, which is higher margin - some would say it's a bit of both. In early June, we did have a taste of what would happen when rates rise. Many stores reopened in early June, and the \"reopening trade\" came on. Many of our more value oriented positions mightily outperformed during this short time period, until concerns about the worsening of the virus and delayed reopening, as well as other economic concerns, came to fore, which caused yields to retreat again as more economic easingoccurred. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-3.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-3.png</url> First week of June ten yeartreasury bond yield spike - \"Reopening trade\" As an aside, Ned Davis' conclusion about the energy markets was that there will probably be a recovery when demand recovers. My thoughts on that are, if energy is currentlyviewed as a short duration asset, it should recover stronger than usual as the real economy recovers and demand improves. Energy has been the worst performing sector since Covid, primarily due to demand reductions especially around jet fuel, industrial uses, and other such areas. But it could end up being the best performing sector when things turn. Going back to where we are in the economic cycle, if we are indeed at the tail end of a bull market, it makes sense to think that it might be a risky time in some sectors now.Increased retail participation is a known qualification for a possible market bubble, and with people cooped up at home with no sports betting and little else to do, they have jumped into the markets in exceptional volumes since the pandemic began. The data shows record numbers of new brokerage accounts opened this past year. Furthermore, as we can see, glamour stocks and glamour sectors got even hotter since the lockdowns. Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Chewy, Shopify, Etsy, and many other \"glamour\" stocks are trading at extremely high multiples. Some, like Tesla, appear to not have multiples at all - most of their very slim profits come from selling regulatory credits, and they do not as of yet appear to be structurally profitable. Tesla has been promising \"Full Self Driving[6]\" for 5 years, and has been taking customers'money for the service for some time already, but the service as named doesn't fully exist yetThe Different Market ManiasWe have successfully identified several manias in the past - The cannabis sector blew up, and then crashed - Tilray stock reached$176 per share a few years ago; now it is $6.64 per share. Some crypto-related stocks also bubbled up, and have since crashed (it remains to be seen what happens with crypto itself). This is a naturaloccurrencein markets, made even more possible through large monetary easing by the Fed. There are, of course, real andfundamental reasons some of these stocks are going up. E-commerce usage has gone up a lot due to quarantines, and the pandemic has indeed accelerated a lot of existing technological trends. Also, the fact is, FANG have shown themselves to be extremely cash rich, robust, and capable businesses (regulatory overhang aside). Even Tesla could have a large future buying base in younger fans who will grow up to view the car as a status symbol. However, the market constantly overshoots and undershoots. These dynamics are compounded by the rise in passive investing, which allows money to be funneled into large percentages of stock in the index, and for now that looks like the big getting bigger. This is reminiscent of 1999, as desired tech stocks went up much higher than normal, because of high insider ownership, where much of the float was locked up, and incremental investment pushed stock prices much higher than normal. Qualcomm, for instance, which many of us own, went from $3 per share to $87 per share from 1998-1999. Everyoneknew their technology would be ubiquitous and crucial in future technology applications. However, the market was a bit premature in predicting proper growth rates and accurate valuation, and overshot. The share price of Qualcomm went down to $13 in 2002, and did not exceed the prior highs of 1999 until 20 years later. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-4.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-4.png</url> We can see a lot of excitement in Yahoo's share price in 1999, leading up to its inclusion in the S&amp;#38;P500 index Another symptom of bubble behavior is the large number of SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) we are seeing listing on the public markets these days. SPACs are \"pre-revenue\", meaning they are completely unproven entities. Investors are committing capital to these vehicles without even seeing any financial statements or evidence that they are even a business at all. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-5.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-5.png</url> Very smart people have tried to take advantage of bubbles over the years and have failed -Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most influential mathematicians of all time, lost a lot of money on the South Sea Bubble in the 1700s. The graphic aboutmonetary expansion shown in the \"Bear Market Playbook\" letter was very revealing, and I am so happy and grateful that I incorporated that research into my macro views. As we know, the Fed has pumped more money[7] than the economy lost from missing economic activity in the past months, causing excess liquidity to slosh around in the markets. They have clearlyexpressedthe desire to let the economy \"run hot\" and even exceed their desired benchmark of 2% inflation in order tocompensate for the lack of inflation in the past decade. This is probablydone on purpose in order to help inflate our way out of the large debt we have incurred, similar to after World War 2, when rates remained low but inflation was very high. This ended up reducing US debt. When this inflationary turn might occur is very hard to predict. But many experts that I admire and respect, and even some I don't, seem to be converging on this idea that the next decade might be moreinflationary than the market expects - notnecessarily 1930'sWeimarGermany-style hyperinflation, but even a more normalized rate, and ensuing possible rate hikes, would be more than the market expects. Japan has had rates lower for longer, and themarket may imagine a similar dynamic for the US - but Japan is different in that their economy is not as large and diversified as the United States', and their demographics skew older with less of a young labor force than ours. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-6.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-6.png</url> A very sensible catalyst to real-economy growth would be an eventual infrastructure stimulus, which would probably come next year, whether the Red Team or the Blue Team wins the upcoming election in November.The Dollar Losing Its StrengthFurthermore, with the dollar going lower due to the US debt added, commodities now have room to go higher (there is typically an inverse relationship between dollar/commodity strength, for a number of various reasons). Commodity bull markets in the past have been led by precious metals - and we have just seen that recently in a powerful move up in gold[8] and silver[9]. Again, the timing is very hard to call, especially as \"passive investing\" takes more and more share of the global market (passive investing just means that people pay money to Vanguard and Blackrock to pay any price for a bundle of stocks, and when they redeem, to sell for any price) and fund flowscontinue to expand market valuations, in my opinion somewhat irrationally. We can't exactly know when those dynamics will end and when momentum wanes and market leadership changes. 1999 is a decentcomparison for some areas of the market today, especially in some SaaS (software as a service) stocks where the competition is crowded, but companies are valued as being the next possible winner in the space. But another comparison some savvy investors use to the current market environment, where only a number of stocks are beingenthusiastically bought by the markets, is the \"Nifty Fifty\" group of stocks in the 1960s. The \"Nifty Fifty\" were stocks which had very bright futures and that was recognized by the markets, and were recognized as \"must-haves\" at any price. People consistently bid the prices of these stocks higher and higher over the years. Many of them are companies we own now, such as Disney, McDonald's, and Coca Cola. Vitaliy Katsenelson, a value investor and fund manager, recently pointed out that just like people currently claim that tech companies deserve higher multiples because of less capital intensity and more intangible value on the balance sheet, so too, companies like McDonald's were also considered \"asset-lite\"businesses back then, due tohow they franchise most of their establishments out to others who take on a lot of the financialresponsibility. After being awarded higher and higher share prices, ultimately during the next bear market in the early 1970s, they fell. Hard. From their highs, Coca Cola fell 69%, McDonald's fell 72%, and Disney fell 87% (!). It took the Nifty Fifty over a decade to surpass their prior highs. Most of them remained excellent companies, and even provided very good long term returns. But overpaying for them ended up being painful for a long stretch. Valuationmatters over the long run. Another obvious comparison betweencurrent market conditions and the Nifty Fifty is, these high flyers' valuations werealso crushed by higher than expected inflation, whichoccurred due to energy prices going a lot higher in a short period of time. We may be entering a similar environment down the line, as due to Covid-19[10], there has been reduced energy investment and capital expenditures. This could result in shortages, and prices would need to go back up in order to justify furtherinvestment in the sector. Energy is currently a despised sector, now fallen to around 2.8% of the S&amp;#38;P 500, from over 10% of it in the past. When that changes, we could see a reversion. The Fed wants inflation, energy will probably be undersupplied down the line, rates may go up, infrastructure stimulus will probably beimplemented to pass the baton from central bankfinancialstimulus to fiscal stimulus, and we could end up with a regime change in the market - one which favors value, cyclicals, financials, industrials and energy.Portfolio ActivityI would now like to share with you some of what we are doing now, all of that said. We trimmed a little bit of our retail exposure, as a nod to how E-Commerce has rapidly advanced from 17% or so of total retail sales, to possibly as much as over 30% of sales. While this leaves theremaining60-70% of US retail sales transacted in brick and mortar stores, there will be some shriveling at the margins and I reduced some of our exposure. I am still bullish (positive) on the survivors and consolidators, as people still love to get out and shop. We also have been buying some solar energy indices as an energy and election hedge. There are very few dividend paying solar energy companies, and they will probably end up growing through more investment in the space. Solar provided only 2% of US energy in 2019. If they get to 8%, that is two doublings. Of course, renewables are lower margin businesses, but regulatory demands will probably boost investment and usage. We can enjoy some of that in the coming decade. This past decade, the solar index went exactly nowhere. Completely dead money for a decade. Poor execution, Chinese oversupply, and other factors caused this. However, moreconsolidation and regulatory subsidy in the space will probably improve profitability, not to mention some decoupling from China that is taking place which may reduce oversupply and increase profitability in some of the domestic players. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-7.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-7.png</url> The ten year total return in this solar energy index has been -29%, a negative return for the decade. This could change in the next decade. We have also been selectively adding commodity producers, small and moderate positions, in the areas of agriculture and even metals and mining. They are trading at very depressed levels, and if we are indeed going into a commodity bull market eventually, these should do very well and pay us dividends to boot. You will notice I also initiated a rare position solely intended for capital gains. It is an insurer called Brighthouse Financial. It is trading at a mere fraction of its book value. If rates go higher, it should go higher as well. I wanted to end with a quote from an investor who had been through 1999. He recently wrote (1): \"...If you remember 1999/2000, if you didn't own the bubble stocks, you actually did really well throughout the 2000-2002 bear market. It is very possible that this will happen again. Many of the frothy names can have large declines, maybe the S&amp;#38;P 500 index[11] even goes down 50% or more, and people who didn't own the most expensive stocks might actually still do well. So, don't let people scare you out of the market with this talk of market P/E's. If you are happy with what you own and how they are valued, hold on and things should be fine (like it was in 1999/2000). \" However, the following graphic was recently shared by my friend Dividend Growth Investor on his Twitter account, and could serve as a more positive counterpoint to the gloomier scenario above. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-8.jpg\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Summer-Fields-Investments-8.jpg</url> We could actually be in the early stages of a new secular bull market, which goes to show you that the best strategy is probably to keep investing in attractively valued companies that have good corporate cultures for the long run Lastly, I wanted to share some very good news. Interactive Brokers enabled us to flip a switch and change to their \"Lite\" version, which eliminates all trading fees, andespecially those peskyminimum monthly commissions for accounts under $100k. I am pleased to announce that there are NO trading fees, and NO MORE monthlyminimum commissions from Interactive Brokers. I am thrilled about that. That is the update for now. I wanted to give some context, historical and otherwise, on this very interesting market we are currently involved in. I will write much more detail in the next annual update published in early 2021. Since Covid, value type stocks have suffered one of their worst drawdowns compared to growth/glamour in a long, long, long time. However, that is usually the time to hold tight, and even add more value, as many seasoned investors have seen this before, and anticipate a reversion to the mean down the line. Value tends to perform best over long periods of time, but sometimes, investors must deal with long drawdowns. It makes sense that in this once-in-a-century pandemic, the market may be scared that things have changed forever. Reality, though, is usually more nuanced. By staying as disciplined and consistent as we can, we will hopefully be set up to enjoy the value premium when it finally returns, collecting and reinvesting our dividends on the way. Thank you as always for your continued business.

She was desperate to get to the service in Pennsylvania. But her United flight out of O'Hare International Airport in Chicago had been delayed once -- a mechanical problem, the pilot had said. Now it looked like the replacement plane might be canceled, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tears streamed down the woman's face as she appealed to Nendick, a United customer-service representative who had spent two decades trying to solve passengers' problems.</p><p>Hoping to plead the woman's case, Nendick poked her head into the cockpit. The captain turned around and asked, \"Who's going to kiss me first? This flight is canceled.\"</p><p>Fixing the smug pilot with a glare, she sputtered, \"You go out and tell the woman who is going to miss her sister's funeral how happy you are.\"</p><p>She couldn't prove it, but Nendick was convinced that he was firing another volley in a widening battle between the pilots and United management.</p><p>Turning to leave, she said, \"I don't care what your situation is. You don't have the right to affect the lives of other people like that.\"</p><p>It was a snapshot of the summer from hell, the nightmarish season in 2000 when a work slowdown by United pilots cascaded through the nation's air-transport system.</p><p>Although passengers took the brunt of the disruption, the pilots' intended target was United Chief Executive Officer James Goodwin. They were furious over his push to buy rival US Airways, a merger that held out certain strategic advantages for United but great peril for its labor relations.</p><p>This latest case of corporate whiplash was the most egregious example yet, as each new CEO ushered in different, often incompatible, plans for the carrier.</p><p>The parade of CEOs also piled up resentment among the carrier's workers. \"While all these big shots are leaving with millions, we're left with the (labor) concessions,\" said Joe Szymusiak, a longtime United baggage handler at O'Hare. \"It's our duty to make up for management's mistakes.\"</p><p>Goodwin's zeal for the US Airways deal would set in motion a chain of events that propelled his airline toward bankruptcy court.</p><p>But no one could have predicted that outcome as Goodwin and US Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf stepped into the Michigan Room at the O'Hare Hilton at 10 a.m. on Oct. 11, 1999.</p><p>Both airlines were making money, but United clearly was in a better financial and strategic position. US Airways was being squeezed between the biggest carriers and low-cost airlines such as Southwest.</p><p>Wolf, who had run United a decade earlier, pitched Goodwin on the idea that had prompted the meeting -- Wolf's airline joining the Star Alliance, United's elite partnership with mostly foreign carriers that allowed customers to fly on multiple airlines with a single reservation.</p><p>Goodwin let Wolf finish. Then he made a pitch of his own: What would Wolf think of United acquiring US Airways?</p><p>United coveted the rival's routes along the East Coast. But Wolf's airline had more to gain.</p><p>Keeping the straightest face he could, Wolf told his one-time executive underling: \"I'd be happy to discuss it with you down the road. But really I am here to talk about the Star Alliance.\"</p><p>In truth, Wolf was elated. Who cares about the Star Alliance, he thought to himself.</p><p>Goodwin's good-old-boy manner and internal relationships mattered a lot. Under United's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the pilots and machinists' unions had veto power over major decisions -- most important, who ran the place.</p><p>To the casual observer, the United Airlines that Goodwin took over was robust. Beneath that veneer of success, though, United was deeply troubled. Already, its earnings were starting to slip, as the financial advantages and improvements in morale bestowed on the airline by its novel ESOP were being frittered away.</p><p>With its San Francisco hub, United had exploited the Silicon Valley technology boom to attract droves of customers willing to buy premium-priced tickets. The resulting gush of revenue covered up inefficiencies and miscues big and small.</p><p>When the dot-com bubble burst, United took one of the heaviest hits in the industry. According to Goodwin, the carrier at the time derived more than 40 percent of its revenue from traffic in, out of or through California.</p><p>Most of all, United was suffering from the fallout of an audacious but failed experiment to save the carrier money while giving its employees a louder voice in how it was run. Instead of improving teamwork and morale, the ESOP had left labor relations more venomous.</p><p>In the face of festering discontent over the state of employee ownership, Goodwin seemed the perfect remedy for restoring trust.But the same open and easygoing nature that helped Goodwin get the CEO job also was a cause of concern for some of his top lieutenants. They were so uneasy about his negotiating skills that they coached him before he went into key sessions.</p><p>They were especially worried in early 2000 when Goodwin was meeting with the formidable Wolf to craft the US Airways acquisition, which faced skeptical federal regulators.</p><p>Whatever you do, Goodwin's advisers say they told him, don't take their maintenance facilities. And don't pay too much.</p><p>But Goodwin came out of the meetings with little from his ex-boss, according to some of his top executives, and agreed to a price tag of $11.6 billion, which many observers considered excessive. \"Wolf would just beat him down,\" recalled one former United executive.</p><p>In a recent interview, Goodwin pointed out that the merger terms were arrived at with input from his entire leadership team. \"Ninety-nine percent of the negotiations were done by others,\" he said. \"At that price, the economics were good at that time. Everybody can always second-guess who outnegotiated who.\"</p><p>US Airways always had held a strong attraction for United executives.</p><p>Their routes fit together almost seamlessly. Where United is strong in the Midwest and on the West Coast, US Airways flies hundreds of short trips daily up and down the East Coast, where more than a third of the country's population lives.</p><p>Goodwin fretted that if United didn't buy US Airways, American would -- not an unreasonable fear given that American had talked with the smaller carrier about such a deal in 1995.</p><p>Although John Peterpaul, a longtime machinists' union leader Peterpaul supported the merger, there was considerable labor opposition, and under the ESOP, the unions would have to sign off on the acquisition.</p><p>The last thing United's pilots wanted were 5,000 of their US Airways peers competing with them for plum assignments.</p><p>Besides, the pilots already were chafing at more than a year of unproductive contract negotiations with United management.</p><p>Much more than usual was riding on this round of talks between the airline and the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association.</p><p>The airline's experiment with employee ownership was coming to a crossroads. The distribution of stock to pilots and other union employees would stop in April 2000. And pay would \"snap back\" to 1994 levels, thanks to an agreement struck with workers in 1997.</p><p>Pilots let it be known that they would be looking for hefty raises to compensate for years of swapping wages for stock.</p><p>But the dot-com boom that had contributed so much to United's profits was reaching its peak, and it was about to collapse. Only in January 2001, when big tech companies started telling United they were cutting back on travel, did Goodwin recognize the airline's premium business was imploding.</p><p>Goodwin's main focus remained completing the deal with US Airways. In May 2000, he did.</p><p>Standing side-by-side in the art deco elegance of Manhattan's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, he and Wolf announced the merger proposal they had succeeded in keeping hush-hush.</p><p>All the attention focused on the merger gave the pilots enormous leverage. They lashed out with a show of militancy unseen at United since the strike of 1985.</p><p>As the crucial summer travel season approached, the pilots began to work \"by the book,\" in effect an undeclared work slowdown.</p><p>United and other major airlines routinely assume a certain amount of voluntary pilot overtime when building a schedule, even though pilots have the contractual right to refuse to work extra hours.</p><p>In early 2000, United management assembled an especially busy summer schedule. Such a tight timetable made them particularly dependent on pilot cooperation.</p><p>When it became clear that a new contract was not in the offing, many pilots refused to work overtime. Others simply refused to take off, citing purported safety problems and other issues.</p><p>If this was a war, the pilots had found the enemy's soft spot.</p><p>But in sabotaging the schedule, they also were creating innocent victims: their customers. In doing so, they were abandoning their role as stewards of an employee-owned airline, undermining the financial health of their own company.</p><p>For many longtime customers who stuck with United because of its unmatched route network and schedule of flights, the summer of 2000 marked the point at which eroding service finally became intolerable.</p><p>The pilots had left Goodwin and the board with no simple way out.</p><p>Coupled with unusually stormy weather in the Midwest, the pilots' actions led to the cancellation of thousands of flights, delaying thousands more. The airline's on-time performance for much of the summer was below 50 percent, by far the worst in the industry.</p><p>To this day, however, pilots' union leaders blame the summer chaos on an aggressive schedule and weather, while downplaying any pilot culpability.</p><p>By some accounting, fewer than 1 in 10 pilots participated in the slowdown. Yet even that amount caused lasting damage. \"Clearly, we shouldn't have slowed down because we lost our high-yield customers,\" said Wright George, a recently retired United captain. \"We trained them that they could fly Southwest.\"</p><p>On the morning of Aug. 26, the pilots' negotiators, Goodwin and his top lieutenants met at the O'Hare Hilton. Goodwin read a brief statement agreeing to settle the contract, pending a vote of rank-and-file pilots.</p><p>The deal translated into huge pay increases -- 21.5 percent immediately for pilots on narrow-bodied planes and 28.7 percent for those flying wide-bodies, plus 4 percent annually over the life of the four-year deal. A senior United 747-400 captain went from making about $200,000 to $257,000.</p><p>So it was no surprise when United pilots voted 7,663 to 366 in favor of the contract, which vaulted them at least 10 percent ahead of their peers at American and Delta.</p><p>The combined price of the disrupted summer and Goodwin's capitulation to pilots was punishingly high for United.</p><p>The carrier blamed its pilots for costing it 1 million passengers in August alone. United carried 7.22 million passengers that month, down from 8.29 million in August 1999.</p><p>United's financial numbers plummeted in the third quarter of 2000. For the first time since 1995, it reported a loss.</p><p>Goodwin and union leaders like Dubinsky thought that other airlines would follow United's lead in setting new pay scales, and United wouldn't be hurt in the long run.</p><p>By the time that United finished settling wages, its total labor costs jumped to 48.5 percent of total operating revenue in 2001 from 38 percent in 1999.</p><p>Summer was over, but the hell continued, even as temperatures cooled. The airline's mechanics, who also had made major pay concessions under the 1994 employee ownership deal, demanded no less a raise than the pilots had received. Convinced that the mechanics would follow the pilot slowdown with one of their own, managers moved to head off such action.</p><p>Management's relations with the mechanics hit a new low when the company sued the union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, seeking $66 million in damages. Goodwin's team wasn't going to risk another work slowdown that would further infuriate passengers.</p><p>United's merger plans weren't going well. Although the summer slowdown led to frosty relations on Capitol Hill, the merger fell flat for another reason. Trustbusters at the Justice Department had determined that combining United and US Airways would reduce competition, raise fares and hurt consumers.</p><p>Just hours after the antitrust division and a dozen state attorneys general vowed in July 2001 to file suit to block the deal, the airlines terminated their pact.</p><p>The price tag for the debacle: a $50 million breakup fee paid to US Airways, but much more in wasted resources and a chain reaction of employee demands and talks that ended only with the events of Sept. 11, 2001.</p><p>The contract negotiations that had seemed so pressing just hours before were now the least of United's concerns.</p><p>- Greg Burns, Susan Chandler and Andrew Zajac contributed to this report.

She was desperate to get to the service in Pennsylvania. But her United flight out of O'Hare International Airport had been delayed once--a mechanical problem, the pilot had said. Now it looked like the replacement plane might be canceled too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tears streamed down the woman's face as she appealed to Nendick, a United customer service rep who had spent two decades trying to solve passengers' problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hoping to plead the woman's case, Nendick poked her head into the cockpit. The captain turned around and asked, \"Who's going to kiss me first? This flight is canceled.\"</p><p>Fixing the smug pilot with a glare, she sputtered, \"You go out and tell the woman who is going to miss her sister's funeral how happy you are.\"</p><p>She couldn't prove it, but Nendick was convinced he was firing another volley in a widening battle between the pilots and United management.</p><p>Turning to leave, she added, \"I don't care what your situation is. You don't have the right to affect the lives of other people like that.\"</p><p>It was a snapshot of the summer from hell, the nightmarish season in 2000 when a work slowdown by United pilots cascaded through the nation's air transport system.</p><p>Although passengers took the brunt of the disruption, the pilots' intended target was Chief Executive James Goodwin. They were furious over his push to buy rival US Airways, a merger that held out certain strategic advantages for United but great peril for its labor relations.</p><p>This latest case of corporate whiplash was the most egregious example yet, as each new CEO ushered in different, often incompatible, plans for the carrier.</p><p>Over the last two decades, while its toughest competitors steered a steadier course under consistent leadership, United lurched from travel conglomerate to global megacarrier to warm-and-fuzzy model of employee empowerment. Amid all the shifts in strategy, United lost sight of its reason for being--getting customers from here to there with minimal hassle.</p><p>The parade of CEOs also piled up resentment among the carrier's workers. \"While all these big shots are leaving with millions, we're left with the [labor] concessions,\" said Joe Szymusiak, a longtime United baggage handler at O'Hare. \"It's our duty to make up for management's mistakes.\"</p><p>Goodwin's zeal for the US Airways deal would set in motion a chain of events that propelled his airline toward bankruptcy court.</p><p>But no one could have predicted that outcome as Goodwin and US Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf stepped into the Michigan Room at the O'Hare Hilton at 10 a.m. on Oct. 11, 1999.</p><p>Both airlines were making money, but United clearly was in a better financial and strategic position. US Airways was being s...ueezed between the biggest carriers and low-cost airlines such as Southwest.</p><p>The setting for their meeting was austere, a windowless room just big enough for a table and several red-leather-backed chairs. Tucked behind a nondescript glass door just off the Hilton's lower-level concourse, the room was chosen for convenience, not secrecy, though both CEOs wanted to keep their discussions ...uiet.</p><p>They had come to talk business but could have been playing poker as they sat down at the circular table.</p><p>Wolf, who had run United a decade earlier, pitched Goodwin on the idea that had prompted the meeting--Wolf's airline joining the Star Alliance, United's elite partnership with mostly foreign carriers that allowed customers to fly on multiple airlines with a single reservation.</p><p>Goodwin let Wolf finish. Then he made a pitch of his own: What would Wolf think of United ac...uiring US Airways?</p><p>United coveted the rival's routes along the East Coast. But Wolf's airline had more to gain.</p><p>Keeping the straightest face he could, Wolf told his one-time executive underling: \"I'd be happy to discuss it with you down the road. But really I am here to talk about the Star Alliance.\"</p><p>In truth, Wolf was elated. Who cares about the Star Alliance, he thought to himself.</p><p>When Goodwin took over United in mid-1999, he seemed a safe choice. A down-to-earth bear of a man, he had spent 32 of his 54 years at United, joining the company straight out of Salem College in his native West Virginia.</p><p>\"I never envisioned that I would be asked to do that job, nor did I run for office,\" he said.</p><p>Although few knew him on Wall Street or Capitol Hill, Goodwin was popular within United, where he had run several departments. When the 6-foot-5-inch executive ambled through maintenance bays in San Francisco, mechanics would shout out, \"Hey, Jimmy! How you doing?\"</p><p>John Peterpaul, a longtime machinists union leader who joined the United board when the employee stock ownership plan was adopted in 1994, remembers how Goodwin would go to the local union committeeman's office at the maintenance base in San Francisco. He'd knock on the door, poke his head in and say, \"All right, fellas, where are you going to screw me today?\" Peterpaul recalled.</p><p>Goodwin and workers would sit down and have coffee together. \"He'd listen to them bitch and complain,\" said Peterpaul.</p><p>The good-old-boy manner and internal relationships mattered a lot. Under United's ESOP, the pilots and machinists unions had veto power over major decisions--most important, who ran the place.</p><p>To the casual observer, the United Airlines that Goodwin took over was robust. The carrier had the most comprehensive route network of any airline on the globe. It was the world's largest airline, with the biggest operations at O'Hare, the world's busiest airport for decades. It had earned profits every ...uarter since the end of 1995, and its stock traded comfortably in the $60 area.</p><p>Beneath that veneer of success, though, United was deeply troubled. Already, its earnings were starting to slip, as the financial advantages and improvements in morale bestowed on the airline by its novel ESOP were being frittered away.</p><p>With its San Francisco hub, United had exploited the Silicon Valley technology boom to attract droves of customers willing to buy premium-priced tickets. The resulting gush of revenue covered up inefficiencies and miscues big and small.</p><p>When the dot-com bubble burst, United took one of the heaviest hits in the industry. According to Goodwin, the carrier at the time derived more than 40 percent of its revenue from traffic in, out or through California.</p><p>Most of all, United was suffering from the fallout of an audacious but failed experiment to save the carrier money while giving its employees a louder voice in how it was run. Instead of improving teamwork and morale, the ESOP had left labor relations more venomous than ever.</p><p>In the face of festering discontent over the state of employee ownership, Goodwin seemed the perfect remedy for restoring trust. As Peterpaul put it, \"We figured he could hold it together and get production out of these people.\"</p><p>But the same open and easygoing nature that helped Goodwin get the CEO job also was a cause of concern for some of his top lieutenants. They were so uneasy about his negotiating skills that they coached him before he went into key sessions.</p><p>They were especially worried in early 2000 when Goodwin was meeting with the formidable Wolf to craft the US Airways ac...uisition, which faced skeptical federal regulators.</p><p>Whatever you do, Goodwin's advisers say they told him, don't take their maintenance facilities. And don't pay too much.</p><p>But Goodwin came out of the meetings with little from his ex-boss, according to some of his top executives, and agreed to a price tag of $11.6 billion, which many observers considered excessive. \"Wolf would just beat him down,\" recalled one former United executive.</p><p>In a recent interview, Goodwin pointed out that the merger terms were arrived at with input from his entire leadership team. \"Ninety-nine percent of the negotiations were done by others,\" he said. \"At that price, the economics were good at that time. Everybody can always second-guess who outnegotiated who.\"</p><p>US Airways always had held a strong attraction for United executives.</p><p>Their routes fit together almost seamlessly. Where United is strong in the Midwest and on the West Coast, US Airways flies hundreds of short trips daily up and down the East Coast, where more than a third of the country's population lives.</p><p>The Southeast was filled with growing technology, manufacturing and financial firms in places such as Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Charlotte that needed closer ties to lucrative markets in Asia. These were precisely the elite business travelers United most coveted, but they were flying Delta or American overseas.</p><p>Furthermore, the airline industry was consolidating, and United wanted to prevent its competitors from cobbling together a route network that could rival its own. American and Delta, the No. 2 and 3 carriers, respectively, bought regional airlines in early 1999.</p><p>Goodwin fretted that if United didn't buy US Airways, American would--not an unreasonable fear given that American had talked with the smaller carrier about such a deal in 1995.</p><p>Although Peterpaul supported the merger, there was considerable labor opposition, and under the ESOP the unions would have to sign off on the ac...uisition.</p><p>Selling United's 10,000 pilots on the US Airways deal would have been difficult under the best of circumstances. The last thing United's pilots wanted were 5,000 of their US Airways peers competing with them for plum assignments.</p><p>Besides, the pilots already were chafing at more than a year of unproductive contract negotiations with United management.</p><p>Much more than usual was riding on this round of talks between the airline and the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association.</p><p>The airline's experiment with employee ownership was coming to a crossroads. The distribution of stock to pilots and other union employees would stop in April 2000. And pay would \"snap back\" to 1994 levels, thanks to an agreement struck with workers in 1997.</p><p>Pilots let it be known that they would be looking for hefty raises to compensate for years of swapping wages for stock.</p><p>If there were any doubts about their mood, the election of Rick Dubinsky as union chairman in the fall of that year should have clarified them. Since he last led the union in 1991, Dubinsky had played no formal role in pilot politics, although he was a well-known supporter of employee control of the airline.</p><p>By 1999, the years of Dubinsky's fighting with management and his fellow pilots had taken their toll, and he carried serious political baggage. Dubinsky ticked off his own liabilities in a December 2000 report to the United board: \"I am viewed by many as radical. I had organized and led the 1985 pilot strike. I was given the nickname 'Mad Dog' by the senior management then in power.\"</p><p>When Dubinsky was elected again, the message couldn't have been clearer: Labor-management relations at United were in deep trouble, and pilots were determined to extract raises that would vault them ahead of counterparts at other airlines.</p><p>In late January 2000, Dubinsky met with Goodwin in his office at world head...uarters in Elk Grove Township. The union chief took a piece of paper and started scribbling.</p><p>\"Here's where you're going to end up, Jim,\" Dubinsky told him, drawing a graph with an ascending line, underscoring 21 percent. \"I'll settle for this.\"</p><p>Goodwin made a counteroffer. Dubinsky rejected it, and the April 12 renewal date of the pilot's contract came and went. Under previous CEO Gerald Greenwald, the unions had obtained automatic back pay no matter how long contract negotiations dragged on, so the pilots had little incentive to move ...uickly.</p><p>Dubinsky promised hard-nosed tactics. Goodwin recalls that Dubinsky in one meeting repeated his oft-stated philosophy of negotiations. \"We don't want to kill the golden goose,\" he said. \"We just want to choke it by the neck until it gives us every last egg.\"</p><p>With United \"awash in cash,\" in Dubinsky's words, he figured the goose had plenty of eggs to spare.</p><p>But the dot-com boom that had contributed so much to United's profits was reaching its peak, and it was about to collapse. Like a lot of other companies, United didn't see it coming.</p><p>When United's numbers declined in 2000, Goodwin's team chalked it up to pilot service disruptions, bad weather and competition within the industry. The falloff in high-tech business customers was just one drop in a rainstorm.</p><p>Only in January 2001, when big tech companies started telling United they were cutting back on travel, did Goodwin recognize the airline's premium business was imploding.</p><p>Goodwin's main focus remained completing the deal with US Airways. In May 2000, he did.</p><p>Standing side-by-side in the art deco elegance of Manhattan's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, he and Wolf announced the merger proposal they had succeeded in keeping hush-hush.</p><p>But as they basked in the limelight during the blockbuster announcement, both executives understood the deal could fly only if they overcame the deep-seated antitrust concerns of federal regulators. Winning approval for the merger became United's top priority.</p><p>All the attention focused on the merger gave the pilots enormous leverage. They lashed out with a show of militancy unseen at United since the strike of 1985.</p><p>As the crucial summer travel season approached, the pilots began to work \"by the book,\" in effect an undeclared work slowdown.</p><p>A flight schedule is a delicate thing, easily knocked out of kilter by the complex interdependence of crews, planes and weather. The sheer scale of United's operation--roughly 2,000 flights a day--made it particularly vulnerable.</p><p>The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport provides one example. United operates 21 flights a day there, though the airport is not one of the carrier's so-called domiciles, where crew and aircraft are permanently based.</p><p>So a plane outbound from Minneapolis to Chicago might arrive from one city, its crew of flight attendants from a second city and the pilot and co-pilot from a third city. Bad weather or other delays at any of those three locations can knock the outbound flight off schedule. In turn, that delay creates other delays at the destination city.</p><p>United and other major airlines routinely assume a certain amount of voluntary pilot overtime when building a schedule, even though pilots have the contractual right to refuse to work extra hours.</p><p>In early 2000, United management, eager to pump up revenues, assembled an especially busy summer schedule. Such a tight timetable made them particularly dependent on pilot cooperation.</p><p>When it became clear that a new contract was not in the offing, many pilots refused to work overtime. Others simply refused to take off, citing purported safety problems and other issues.</p><p>If this was a war, the pilots had found the enemy's soft spot.</p><p>But in sabotaging the schedule, they also were creating innocent victims: their customers. In doing so, they were abandoning their role as stewards of an employee-owned airline, undermining the financial health of their own company.</p><p>Successful airlines sell certainty. Now, with the slowdown grinding down operations, United was providing only uncertainty.</p><p>For many longtime customers who stuck with United because of its unmatched route network and schedule of flights, the summer of 2000 marked the point at which eroding service finally became intolerable.</p><p>Paul Baron, then president of a Quaker Oats division, flew United about 50 times a year, even as he put up with a decline in morale and performance.</p><p>His tolerance ran out on a Friday night in late summer at the Salt Lake City Airport. Baron, of Wilmette, had been booked on a flight slated to leave for O'Hare about 6 p.m. It was canceled, but Baron was assured he could board the next flight to Chicago.</p><p>About 9 p.m., the connecting plane landed. \"We'll turn it around, and it'll be all ready for you,\" he recalled the gate agent announcing.</p><p>But not long after came another announcement: \"The crew has put in too many hours. They can't fly the plane. You're going to have to stay overnight in Salt Lake City.\"</p><p>Throughout that summer, United pilots often invoked their contract right to turn down overtime flying. But Baron figured the airline's flight managers shared the blame for not tracking crew hours and anticipating the disruption.</p><p>\"I'm sure they could have known three or four hours before and made arrangements for another crew,\" he said, \"instead of having us all sit there.\"</p><p>Fortunately for Baron, now retired, there was an alternative for his family: \"We switched over to Delta.\"</p><p>At United's world head...uarters, some executives argued that the only option was to ground the fleet. But Goodwin rejected the idea.</p><p>Another option was suing the pilots. But Goodwin and the carrier's 12-member board chose not to do that either. Having lived through the 1985 pilot strike, Goodwin was loath to declare war again. He wondered if suing the pilots this time would simply provide them with another rallying cry.</p><p>In considering such ...uestions, United directors were like many other boards in supporting the strategic vision of their chief executive.</p><p>Yet in many ways United's governance was highly unusual. Unlike other major companies, two directors represented unions, and the ESOP gave them a substantial voice in deciding who would serve as directors.</p><p>United managed to attract a relatively prestigious group of senior executives to the board, not least, some say, because veteran directors got free lifetime travel benefits on the airline. One director, investment manager Paul Tierney Jr., racked up more than $200,000 worth in 2000 alone.</p><p>The pilots had left Goodwin and the board with no simple way out.</p><p>Coupled with unusually stormy weather in the Midwest, the pilots' actions led to the cancellation of thousands of flights, delaying thousands more. The airline's on-time performance for much of the summer was below 50 percent, by far the worst in the industry.</p><p>Furious customers took it out on frontline workers, especially flight attendants and gate agents. United flight attendant Sandy Alvarez remembers customers screaming in her face over canceled and delayed flights.</p><p>\"The cockpit door was never opened because [the pilots] didn't want to catch the grief,\" she said. \"We were an easy target because we weren't going to fight back. We had to say, 'Thank you and have a nice day.'\"</p><p>Even Alvarez reached her limit, though. \"I finally got to the point where I would point to the cockpit and say, 'Say it to them.\" It was pure hell.\"</p><p>To this day, however, pilots union leaders blame the summer chaos on an overly aggressive schedule and weather, while downplaying any pilot culpability.</p><p>By some accounting, fewer than 1 in 10 pilots participated in the slowdown. Yet even that amount caused lasting damage. \"Clearly, we shouldn't have slowed down, because we lost our high-yield customers,\" said Wright George, a recently retired United captain. \"We trained them that they could fly Southwest.\"</p><p>With politicians joining passengers in the criticism of United, pressure mounted on Goodwin to end the agony and reach a deal with the pilots. Belatedly, United managers moved with urgency to settle the pilots' contract.</p><p>On the morning of Aug. 26, the pilots' negotiators, Goodwin and his top lieutenants met at the O'Hare Hilton. Goodwin read a brief statement agreeing to settle the contract, pending a vote of rank-and-file pilots.</p><p>The deal translated into huge pay hikes--21.5 percent immediately for pilots on narrow-bodied planes and 28.7 percent for those flying wide-bodies, plus 4 percent annually over the life of the four-year deal. A senior United 747-400 captain went from making about $200,000 to $257,000.</p><p>Dubinsky called the proposal \"nothing less than a grand slam home run for United's pilots.\" If the members approved it, he added, \"Santa Claus [will be] arriving a little early this year.\"</p><p>So it was no surprise when United pilots voted 7,663 to 366 in favor of the contract, which vaulted them at least 10 percent ahead of their peers at American and Delta.</p><p>Goodwin tried to put the best face he could on the contract. In a Sept. 7, 2000, letter to the United board, he said the agreement was 20 percent higher than the company wanted to spend, \"but we feel, on balance, it is fair to both sides.\"</p><p>The combined price of the disrupted summer and Goodwin's capitulation to pilots was punishingly high for United.</p><p>As travelers shunned the carrier, American, Northwest and Delta posted increases in passenger traffic.</p><p>The carrier blamed its pilots for costing it 1 million passengers in August alone. United carried 7.22 million passengers that month, down from 8.29 million in August 1999.</p><p>United's financial numbers plummeted in the third ...uarter of 2000. For the first time since 1995, it reported a loss.</p><p>Over at rival American Airlines, operating earnings soared 51 percent in the third ...uarter, courtesy of an influx of alienated passengers from United.</p><p>Goodwin and union leaders like Dubinsky believed that other airlines would follow United's lead in setting new pay scales, and United wouldn't be hurt in the long run.</p><p>Only nine months later, pilots at Delta signed a more generous deal--a reflection of the leapfrog pattern of airline labor contracts, one of the factors driving the airline industry's recurring financial troubles.</p><p>United was generous even with employees who had no leverage. Non-union salaried workers, such as supervisors and managers, were given double-digit raises. Goodwin rationalized that these employees needed the boost to be paid competitively.</p><p>By the time United finished settling wages, its overall labor costs jumped to 48.5 percent of total operating revenue in 2001 from 38 percent in 1999.</p><p>Summer was over, but the hell continued even as temperatures cooled.</p><p>The airline's mechanics, who also had made major pay concessions under the 1994 employee ownership deal, demanded no less a raise than the pilots had received.</p><p>Convinced the mechanics would follow the pilot slowdown with one of their own, managers moved to head off any such action.</p><p>Sig Mueller, a no-nonsense United maintenance manager transferred to O'Hare from San Francisco, issued an \"urgent notice\" for November 2000, declaring an \"operational emergency\" because so many flights were being canceled after mechanics took planes out of service for repairs.</p><p>\"An employee who refuses an overtime assignment or fails to report for an assignment is subject to discharge,\" he announced.</p><p>The actual number of mechanics fired was relatively small, but it had a chilling effect on those who remained. Feeling threatened for simply doing their jobs, the mechanics accused their bosses of insisting they \"pencil whip\"--sign off on repairs that aren't made.</p><p>In effect, they were accusing managers of endangering passenger safety in the name of blocking another slowdown. United rejected the accusation, insisting that safety was never undermined, and the company's admirable safety record remained intact during that period.</p><p>Still, the mutual distrust led to a costly game that hearkened back to the worst days of labor-management feuding before the ESOP.</p><p>Ken Thiede, a longtime machinists union leader, described how the game worked. At O'Hare, for instance, a mechanic supervisor would angrily demand that his crew ...uickly finish a repair on a section of a plane.</p><p>The crew might tell the supervisor that the plane was in such dire shape that it was going to be what they call a \"hangar ...ueen\"--sitting around for at least a couple days before it was fixed.</p><p>Flight operations would cancel the flight, only to find out 10 minutes later that the pieces fit together after all.</p><p>\"Is it right for a manager to come out and verbally abuse the workers? No. Is it right for the workers to screw the manager around by goofing up the operation? No,\" Thiede said. But \"human nature being what it is, an unhappy worker is not a productive worker.\"</p><p>Management's relations with the mechanics hit a new low when the company sued the union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, seeking $66 million in damages. Goodwin's team had had it. They weren't going to risk another work slowdown that would further infuriate passengers.</p><p>Nasty relations had come to define life at United even workers were turning on each other.</p><p>In Stuart Cohen's 16 years at United, from customer service at O'Hare to a job in Phoenix doing everything from loading bags to dumping aircraft lavatories, he had seen workplace tension before.</p><p>But the fallout from the pilots' slowdown made those animosities seem tame.</p><p>One day in Phoenix, Cohen was working in The Pit--baggage handler-speak for the cargo hold of a plane--when a pilot strode up with his luggage.</p><p>After the pilot walked away, a baggage handler made a point of climbing into the pit and stashing the pilot's bags behind the customers' luggage.</p><p>\"So when the plane got to the final destination, guess whose bag would be the last to get off?\" Cohen said. \"It was a way for them to get back for that summer from hell.\"</p><p>As if to underscore United's troubles, the distracted carrier soon lost bragging rights as the world's largest airline. The announcement of its plans to ac...uire US Airways had set off a scramble among the competition to match its expansion.</p><p>In April 2001, American cinched its purchase of a bankrupt TWA, overtaking United to become the world's No. 1 carrier.</p><p>United's own merger plans weren't going nearly as well. Although the summer slowdown led to frosty relations on Capitol Hill, the merger fell flat for another reason. Trustbusters at the Justice Department had determined that combining United and US Airways would reduce competition, raise fares and hurt consumers.</p><p>Just hours after the antitrust division and a dozen state attorneys general vowed in July 2001 to file suit to block the deal, the airlines terminated their pact.</p><p>The price tag for the debacle: a $50 million breakup fee paid to US Airways, but much more in wasted resources and a chain reaction of employee demands.</p><p>The carrier's machinists still were insisting on the same industry-leading raises that United had given its pilots. Twenty-one months after starting contract talks, negotiators for United and its 30,000 ramp and customer service workers gathered in Washington, where the National Mediation Board had called the two sides in hopes of concluding an agreement.</p><p>Their talks went through the day and night of Sept. 10 and into the wee hours of the 11th. Finally, at 4:30 in the morning, the negotiators agreed to grab a little sleep and return the following afternoon.</p><p>At about 10 a.m., Randy Canale, the machinists' lead negotiator, awoke to the sound of someone banging on the door of his room at the Capital Hilton, about two blocks from the White House.</p><p>\"You need to turn on the television,\" he was told.</p><p>Canale did so, then opened the drapes and looked out the window to see the morning's unfolding chaos: all sirens and soldiers. In the distance, he could see smoke rising from the Pentagon.</p><p>Like the rest of the nation, Canale didn't know what was coming next on this bright morning when terrorists used United and American planes to attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.</p><p>The contract negotiations that had seemed so pressing just hours before were now the least of United's concerns.</p><p>This series was reported by Tribune staff reporters Greg Burns, Susan Chandler, Flynn McRoberts and Andrew Zajac, and written by McRoberts.Copyright 2003provided by Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business NewsCopyright 2003provided by Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News4410</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">B&amp;ISEL-3883032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">3883032 B&amp;I</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FCS-MXR0-01CT-H15H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">210549</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2003 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>\u00a0Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News</publicationName><aggregationName>Business and Industry</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>July 15, 2003</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Regional Newspaper</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fulltext</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00093RS</classCode><className>U S AIRWAYS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00022SO</classCode><className>UNITED AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>UNITED AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>US AIRWAYS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>Airline</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Travel &amp;

She was desperate to get to the service in Pennsylvania. But her United flight out of O'Hare International Airport had been delayed once--a mechanical problem, the pilot had said. Now it looked like the replacement plane might be canceled too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">    Tears streamed down the woman's face as she appealed to Nendick, a United customer service rep who had spent two decades trying to solve passengers' problems.</p><p>Hoping to plead the woman's case, Nendick poked her head into the cockpit. The captain turned around and asked, \"Who's going to kiss me first? This flight is canceled.\"</p><p>Fixing the smug pilot with a glare, she sputtered, \"You go out and tell the woman who is going to miss her sister's funeral how happy you are.\"</p><p>She couldn't prove it, but Nendick was convinced he was firing another volley in a widening battle between the pilots and United management.</p><p>Turning to leave, she added, \"I don't care what your situation is. You don't have the right to affect the lives of other people like that.\"</p><p>It was a snapshot of the summer from hell, the nightmarish season in 2000 when a work slowdown by United pilots cascaded through the nation's air transport system.</p><p>Although passengers took the brunt of the disruption, the pilots' intended target was Chief Executive James Goodwin. They were furious over his push to buy rival US Airways, a merger that held out certain strategic advantages for United but great peril for its labor relations.</p><p>This latest case of corporate whiplash was the most egregious example yet, as each new CEO ushered in different, often incompatible, plans for the carrier.</p><p>Over the last two decades, while its toughest competitors steered a steadier course under consistent leadership, United lurched from travel conglomerate to global megacarrier to warm-and-fuzzy model of employee empowerment. Amid all the shifts in strategy, United lost sight of its reason for being--getting customers from here to there with minimal hassle.</p><p>The parade of CEOs also piled up resentment among the carrier's workers. \"While all these big shots are leaving with millions, we're left with the [labor] concessions,\" said Joe Szymusiak, a longtime United baggage handler at O'Hare. \"It's our duty to make up for management's mistakes.\"</p><p>Goodwin's zeal for the US Airwaysdeal would set in motion a chain of events that propelled his airline toward bankruptcy court.</p><p>But no one could have predicted that outcome as Goodwin and US AirwaysChairman Stephen Wolf stepped into the Michigan Room at the O'Hare Hilton at 10 a.m. on Oct. 11, 1999.</p><p>Both airlines were making money, but United clearly was in a better financial and strategic position. US Airwayswas being squeezed between the biggest carriers and low-cost airlines such as Southwest.</p><p>The setting for their meeting was austere, a windowless room just big enough for a table and several red-leather-backed chairs. Tucked behind a nondescript glass door just off the Hilton's lower-level concourse, the room was chosen for convenience, not secrecy, though both CEOs wanted to keep their discussions quiet.</p><p>They had come to talk business but could have been playing poker as they sat down at the circular table.</p><p>Wolf, who had run United a decade earlier, pitched Goodwin on the idea that had prompted the meeting--Wolf's airline joining the Star Alliance, United's elite partnership with mostly foreign carriers that allowed customers to fly on multiple airlines with a single reservation.</p><p>Goodwin let Wolf finish. Then he made a pitch of his own: What would Wolf think of United acquiring US Airways?</p><p>United coveted the rival's routes along the East Coast. But Wolf's airline had more to gain.</p><p>Keeping the straightest face he could, Wolf told his one-time executive underling: \"I'd be happy to discuss it with you down the road. But really I am here to talk about the Star Alliance.\"</p><p>In truth, Wolf was elated. Who cares about the Star Alliance, he thought to himself.</p><p>Chance of a lifetime</p><p>When Goodwin took over United in mid-1999, he seemed a safe choice. A down-to-earth bear of a man, he had spent 32 of his 54 years at United, joining the company straight out of Salem College in his native West Virginia.</p><p>\"I never envisioned that I would be asked to do that job, nor did I run for office,\" he said.</p><p>Although few knew him on Wall Street or Capitol Hill, Goodwin was popular within United, where he had run several departments. When the 6-foot-5-inch executive ambled through maintenance bays in San Francisco, mechanics would shout out, \"Hey, Jimmy! How you doing?\"</p><p>John Peterpaul, a longtime machinists union leader who joined the United board when the employee stock ownership plan was adopted in 1994, remembers how Goodwin would go to the local union committeeman's office at the maintenance base in San Francisco. He'd knock on the door, poke his head in and say, \"All right, fellas, where are you going to screw me today?\" Peterpaul recalled.</p><p>Goodwin and workers would sit down and have coffee together. \"He'd listen to them bitch and complain,\" said Peterpaul.</p><p>The good-old-boy manner and internal relationships mattered a lot. Under United's ESOP, the pilots and machinists unions had veto power over major decisions--most important, who ran the place.</p><p>To the casual observer, the United Airlines that Goodwin took over was robust. The carrier had the most comprehensive route network of any airline on the globe. It was the world's largest airline, with the biggest operations at O'Hare, the world's busiest airport for decades. It had earned profits every quarter since the end of 1995, and its stock traded comfortably in the $60 area.</p><p>Beneath that veneer of success, though, United was deeply troubled. Already, its earnings were starting to slip, as the financial advantages and improvements in morale bestowed on the airline by its novel ESOP were being frittered away.</p><p>With its San Francisco hub, United had exploited the Silicon Valley technology boom to attract droves of customers willing to buy premium-priced tickets. The resulting gush of revenue covered up inefficiencies and miscues big and small.</p><p>When the dot-com bubble burst, United took one of the heaviest hits in the industry. According to Goodwin, the carrier at the time derived more than 40 percent of its revenue from traffic in, out or through California.</p><p>Most of all, United was suffering from the fallout of an audacious but failed experiment to save the carrier money while giving its employees a louder voice in how it was run. Instead of improving teamwork and morale, the ESOP had left labor relations more venomous than ever.</p><p>In the face of festering discontent over the state of employee ownership, Goodwin seemed the perfect remedy for restoring trust. As Peterpaul put it, \"We figured he could hold it together and get production out of these people.\"</p><p>But the same open and easygoing nature that helped Goodwin get the CEO job also was a cause of concern for some of his top lieutenants. They were so uneasy about his negotiating skills that they coached him before he went into key sessions.</p><p>They were especially worried in early 2000 when Goodwin was meeting with the formidable Wolf to craft the US Airwaysacquisition, which faced skeptical federal regulators.</p><p>Whatever you do, Goodwin's advisers say they told him, don't take their maintenance facilities. And don't pay too much.</p><p>But Goodwin came out of the meetings with little from his ex-boss, according to some of his top executives, and agreed to a price tag of $11.6 billion, which many observers considered excessive. \"Wolf would just beat him down,\" recalled one former United executive.</p><p>In a recent interview, Goodwin pointed out that the merger terms were arrived at with input from his entire leadership team. \"Ninety-nine percent of the negotiations were done by others,\" he said. \"At that price, the economics were good at that time. Everybody can always second-guess who outnegotiated who.\"</p><p>Tempting company</p><p>US Airwaysalways had held a strong attraction for United executives.</p><p>Their routes fit together almost seamlessly. Where United is strong in the Midwest and on the West Coast, US Airwaysflies hundreds of short trips daily up and down the East Coast, where more than a third of the country's population lives.</p><p>The Southeast was filled with growing technology, manufacturing and financial firms in places such as Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Charlotte that needed closer ties to lucrative markets in Asia. These were precisely the elite business travelers United most coveted, but they were flying Delta or American overseas.</p><p>Furthermore, the airline industry was consolidating, and United wanted to prevent its competitors from cobbling together a route network that could rival its own. American and Delta, the No. 2 and 3 carriers, respectively, bought regional airlines in early 1999.</p><p>Goodwin fretted that if United didn't buy US Airways, American would--not an unreasonable fear given that American had talked with the smaller carrier about such a deal in 1995.</p><p>Although Peterpaul supported the merger, there was considerable labor opposition, and under the ESOP the unions would have to sign off on the acquisition.</p><p>Selling United's 10,000 pilots on the US Airwaysdeal would have been difficult under the best of circumstances. The last thing United's pilots wanted were 5,000 of their US Airwayspeers competing with them for plum assignments.</p><p>Besides, the pilots already were chafing at more than a year of unproductive contract negotiations with United management.</p><p>Much more than usual was riding on this round of talks between the airline and the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association.</p><p>The airline's experiment with employee ownership was coming to a crossroads. The distribution of stock to pilots and other union employees would stop in April 2000. And pay would \"snap back\" to 1994 levels, thanks to an agreement struck with workers in 1997.</p><p>Pilots let it be known that they would be looking for hefty raises to compensate for years of swapping wages for stock.</p><p>If there were any doubts about their mood, the election of Rick Dubinsky as union chairman in the fall of that year should have clarified them. Since he last led the union in 1991, Dubinsky had played no formal role in pilot politics, although he was a well-known supporter of employee control of the airline.</p><p>By 1999, the years of Dubinsky's fighting with management and his fellow pilots had taken their toll, and he carried serious political baggage. Dubinsky ticked off his own liabilities in a December 2000 report to the United board: \"I am viewed by many as radical. I had organized and led the 1985 pilot strike. I was given the nickname `Mad Dog' by the senior management then in power.\"</p><p>When Dubinsky was elected again, the message couldn't have been clearer: Labor-management relations at United were in deep trouble, and pilots were determined to extract raises that would vault them ahead of counterparts at other airlines.</p><p>Choking the goose</p><p>In late January 2000, Dubinsky met with Goodwin in his office at world headquarters in Elk Grove Township. The union chief took a piece of paper and started scribbling.</p><p>\"Here's where you're going to end up, Jim,\" Dubinsky told him, drawing a graph with an ascending line, underscoring 21 percent. \"I'll settle for this.\"</p><p>Goodwin made a counteroffer. Dubinsky rejected it, and the April 12 renewal date of the pilot's contract came and went. Under previous CEO Gerald Greenwald, the unions had obtained automatic back pay no matter how long contract negotiations dragged on, so the pilots had little incentive to move quickly.</p><p>Dubinsky promised hard-nosed tactics. Goodwin recalls that Dubinsky in one meeting repeated his oft-stated philosophy of negotiations. \"We don't want to kill the golden goose,\" he said. \"We just want to choke it by the neck until it gives us every last egg.\"</p><p>With United \"awash in cash,\" in Dubinsky's words, he figured the goose had plenty of eggs to spare.</p><p>But the dot-com boom that had contributed so much to United's profits was reaching its peak, and it was about to collapse. Like a lot of other companies, United didn't see it coming.</p><p>When United's numbers declined in 2000, Goodwin's team chalked it up to pilot service disruptions, bad weather and competition within the industry. The falloff in high-tech business customers was just one drop in a rainstorm.</p><p>Only in January 2001, when big tech companies started telling United they were cutting back on travel, did Goodwin recognize the airline's premium business was imploding.</p><p>Goodwin's main focus remained completing the deal with US Airways. In May 2000, he did.</p><p>Standing side-by-side in the art deco elegance of Manhattan's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, he and Wolf announced the merger proposal they had succeeded in keeping hush-hush.</p><p>But as they basked in the limelight during the blockbuster announcement, both executives understood the deal could fly only if they overcame the deep-seated antitrust concerns of federal regulators. Winning approval for the merger became United's top priority.</p><p>All the attention focused on the merger gave the pilots enormous leverage. They lashed out with a show of militancy unseen at United since the strike of 1985.</p><p>As the crucial summer travel season approached, the pilots began to work \"by the book,\" in effect an undeclared work slowdown.</p><p>A flight schedule is a delicate thing, easily knocked out of kilter by the complex interdependence of crews, planes and weather. The sheer scale of United's operation--roughly 2,000 flights a day--made it particularly vulnerable.</p><p>The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport provides one example. United operates 21 flights a day there, though the airport is not one of the carrier's so-called domiciles, where crew and aircraft are permanently based.</p><p>So a plane outbound from Minneapolis to Chicago might arrive from one city, its crew of flight attendants from a second city and the pilot and co-pilot from a third city. Bad weather or other delays at any of those three locations can knock the outbound flight off schedule. In turn, that delay creates other delays at the destination city.</p><p>United and other major airlines routinely assume a certain amount of voluntary pilot overtime when building a schedule, even though pilots have the contractual right to refuse to work extra hours.</p><p>In early 2000, United management, eager to pump up revenues, assembled an especially busy summer schedule. Such a tight timetable made them particularly dependent on pilot cooperation.</p><p>When it became clear that a new contract was not in the offing, many pilots refused to work overtime. Others simply refused to take off, citing purported safety problems and other issues.</p><p>If this was a war, the pilots had found the enemy's soft spot.</p><p>But in sabotaging the schedule, they also were creating innocent victims: their customers. In doing so, they were abandoning their role as stewards of an employee-owned airline, undermining the financial health of their own company.</p><p>Point of no return</p><p>Successful airlines sell certainty. Now, with the slowdown grinding down operations, United was providing only uncertainty.</p><p>For many longtime customers who stuck with United because of its unmatched route network and schedule of flights, the summer of 2000 marked the point at which eroding service finally became intolerable.</p><p>Paul Baron, then president of a Quaker Oats division, flew United about 50 times a year, even as he put up with a decline in morale and performance.</p><p>His tolerance ran out on a Friday night in late summer at the Salt Lake City Airport. Baron, of Wilmette, had been booked on a flight slated to leave for O'Hare about 6 p.m. It was canceled, but Baron was assured he could board the next flight to Chicago.</p><p>About 9 p.m., the connecting plane landed. \"We'll turn it around, and it'll be all ready for you,\" he recalled the gate agent announcing.</p><p>But not long after came another announcement: \"The crew has put in too many hours. They can't fly the plane. You're going to have to stay overnight in Salt Lake City.\"</p><p>Throughout that summer, United pilots often invoked their contract right to turn down overtime flying. But Baron figured the airline's flight managers shared the blame for not tracking crew hours and anticipating the disruption.</p><p>\"I'm sure they could have known three or four hours before and made arrangements for another crew,\" he said, \"instead of having us all sit there.\"</p><p>Fortunately for Baron, now retired, there was an alternative for his family: \"We switched over to Delta.\"</p><p>At United's world headquarters, some executives argued that the only option was to ground the fleet. But Goodwin rejected the idea.</p><p>Another option was suing the pilots. But Goodwin and the carrier's 12-member board chose not to do that either. Having lived through the 1985 pilot strike, Goodwin was loath to declare war again. He wondered if suing the pilots this time would simply provide them with another rallying cry.</p><p>In considering such questions, United directors were like many other boards in supporting the strategic vision of their chief executive.</p><p>Yet in many ways United's governance was highly unusual. Unlike other major companies, two directors represented unions, and the ESOP gave them a substantial voice in deciding who would serve as directors.</p><p>United managed to attract a relatively prestigious group of senior executives to the board, not least, some say, because veteran directors got free lifetime travel benefits on the airline. One director, investment manager Paul Tierney Jr., racked up more than $200,000 worth in 2000 alone.</p><p>The pilots had left Goodwin and the board with no simple way out.</p><p>Coupled with unusually stormy weather in the Midwest, the pilots' actions led to the cancellation of thousands of flights, delaying thousands more. The airline's on-time performance for much of the summer was below 50 percent, by far the worst in the industry.</p><p>Furious customers took it out on frontline workers, especially flight attendants and gate agents. United flight attendant Sandy Alvarez remembers customers screaming in her face over canceled and delayed flights.</p><p>\"The cockpit door was never opened because [the pilots] didn't want to catch the grief,\" she said. \"We were an easy target because we weren't going to fight back. We had to say, `Thank you and have a nice day.'\"</p><p>Even Alvarez reached her limit, though. \"I finally got to the point where I would point to the cockpit and say, `Say it to them.' It was pure hell.\"</p><p>To this day, however, pilots union leaders blame the summer chaos on an overly aggressive schedule and weather, while downplaying any pilot culpability.</p><p>By some accounting, fewer than 1 in 10 pilots participated in the slowdown. Yet even that amount caused lasting damage. \"Clearly, we shouldn't have slowed down, because we lost our high-yield customers,\" said Wright George, a recently retired United captain. \"We trained them that they could fly Southwest.\"</p><p>With politicians joining passengers in the criticism of United, pressure mounted on Goodwin to end the agony and reach a deal with the pilots. Belatedly, United managers moved with urgency to settle the pilots' contract.</p><p>On the morning of Aug. 26, the pilots' negotiators, Goodwin and his top lieutenants met at the O'Hare Hilton. Goodwin read a brief statement agreeing to settle the contract, pending a vote of rank-and-file pilots.</p><p>The deal translated into huge pay hikes--21.5 percent immediately for pilots on narrow-bodied planes and 28.7 percent for those flying wide-bodies, plus 4 percent annually over the life of the four-year deal. A senior United 747-400 captain went from making about $200,000 to $257,000.</p><p>Dubinsky called the proposal \"nothing less than a grand slam home run for United's pilots.\" If the members approved it, he added, \"Santa Claus [will be] arriving a little early this year.\"</p><p>So it was no surprise when United pilots voted 7,663 to 366 in favor of the contract, which vaulted them at least 10 percent ahead of their peers at American and Delta.</p><p>Goodwin tried to put the best face he could on the contract. In a Sept. 7, 2000, letter to the United board, he said the agreement was 20 percent higher than the company wanted to spend, \"but we feel, on balance, it is fair to both sides.\"</p><p>The combined price of the disrupted summer and Goodwin's capitulation to pilots was punishingly high for United.</p><p>As travelers shunned the carrier, American, Northwest and Delta posted increases in passenger traffic.</p><p>The carrier blamed its pilots for costing it 1 million passengers in August alone. United carried 7.22 million passengers that month, down from 8.29 million in August 1999.</p><p>United's financial numbers plummeted in the third quarter of 2000. For the first time since 1995, it reported a loss.</p><p>Over at rival American Airlines, operating earnings soared 51 percent in the third quarter, courtesy of an influx of alienated passengers from United.</p><p>Goodwin and union leaders like Dubinsky believed that other airlines would follow United's lead in setting new pay scales, and United wouldn't be hurt in the long run.</p><p>Only nine months later, pilots at Delta signed a more generous deal--a reflection of the leapfrog pattern of airline labor contracts, one of the factors driving the airline industry's recurring financial troubles.</p><p>United was generous even with employees who had no leverage. Non-union salaried workers, such as supervisors and managers, were given double-digit raises. Goodwin rationalized that these employees needed the boost to be paid competitively.</p><p>By the time United finished settling wages, its overall labor costs jumped to 48.5 percent of total operating revenue in 2001 from 38 percent in 1999.</p><p>Breaking down</p><p>Summer was over, but the hell continued even as temperatures cooled.</p><p>The airline's mechanics, who also had made major pay concessions under the 1994 employee ownership deal, demanded no less a raise than the pilots had received.</p><p>Convinced the mechanics would follow the pilot slowdown with one of their own, managers moved to head off any such action.</p><p>Sig Mueller, a no-nonsense United maintenance manager transferred to O'Hare from San Francisco, issued an \"urgent notice\" for November 2000, declaring an \"operational emergency\" because so many flights were being canceled after mechanics took planes out of service for repairs.</p><p>\"An employee who refuses an overtime assignment or fails to report for an assignment is subject to discharge,\" he announced.</p><p>The actual number of mechanics fired was relatively small, but it had a chilling effect on those who remained. Feeling threatened for simply doing their jobs, the mechanics accused their bosses of insisting they \"pencil whip\"--sign off on repairs that aren't made.</p><p>In effect, they were accusing managers of endangering passenger safety in the name of blocking another slowdown. United rejected the accusation, insisting that safety was never undermined, and the company's admirable safety record remained intact during that period.</p><p>Still, the mutual distrust led to a costly game that hearkened back to the worst days of labor-management feuding before the ESOP.</p><p>Ken Thiede, a longtime machinists union leader, described how the game worked. At O'Hare, for instance, a mechanic supervisor would angrily demand that his crew quickly finish a repair on a section of a plane.</p><p>The crew might tell the supervisor that the plane was in such dire shape that it was going to be what they call a \"hangar queen\"--sitting around for at least a couple days before it was fixed.</p><p>Flight operations would cancel the flight, only to find out 10 minutes later that the pieces fit together after all.</p><p>\"Is it right for a manager to come out and verbally abuse the workers? No. Is it right for the workers to screw the manager around by goofing up the operation? No,\" Thiede said. But \"human nature being what it is, an unhappy worker is not a productive worker.\"</p><p>Management's relations with the mechanics hit a new low when the company sued the union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, seeking $66 million in damages. Goodwin's team had had it. They weren't going to risk another work slowdown that would further infuriate passengers.</p><p>Worst yet to come</p><p>Nasty relations had come to define life at United; even workers were turning on each other.</p><p>In Stuart Cohen's 16 years at United, from customer service at O'Hare to a job in Phoenix doing everything from loading bags to dumping aircraft lavatories, he had seen workplace tension before.</p><p>But the fallout from the pilots' slowdown made those animosities seem tame.</p><p>One day in Phoenix, Cohen was working in The Pit--baggage handler-speak for the cargo hold of a plane--when a pilot strode up with his luggage.</p><p>After the pilot walked away, a baggage handler made a point of climbing into the pit and stashing the pilot's bags behind the customers' luggage.</p><p>\"So when the plane got to the final destination, guess whose bag would be the last to get off?\" Cohen said. \"It was a way for them to get back for that summer from hell.\"</p><p>As if to underscore United's troubles, the distracted carrier soon lost bragging rights as the world's largest airline. The announcement of its plans to acquire US Airwayshad set off a scramble among the competition to match its expansion.</p><p>In April 2001, American cinched its purchase of a bankrupt TWA, overtaking United to become the world's No. 1 carrier.</p><p>United's own merger plans weren't going nearly as well. Although the summer slowdown led to frosty relations on Capitol Hill, the merger fell flat for another reason. Trustbusters at the Justice Department had determined that combining United and US Airwayswould reduce competition, raise fares and hurt consumers.</p><p>Just hours after the antitrust division and a dozen state attorneys general vowed in July 2001 to file suit to block the deal, the airlines terminated their pact.</p><p>The price tag for the debacle: a $50 million breakup fee paid to US Airways, but much more in wasted resources and a chain reaction of employee demands.</p><p>The carrier's machinists still were insisting on the same industry-leading raises that United had given its pilots. Twenty-one months after starting contract talks, negotiators for United and its 30,000 ramp and customer service workers gathered in Washington, where the National Mediation Board had called the two sides in hopes of concluding an agreement.</p><p>Their talks went through the day and night of Sept. 10 and into the wee hours of the 11th. Finally, at 4:30 in the morning, the negotiators agreed to grab a little sleep and return the following afternoon.</p><p>At about 10 a.m., Randy Canale, the machinists' lead negotiator, awoke to the sound of someone banging on the door of his room at the Capital Hilton, about two blocks from the White House.</p><p>\"You need to turn on the television,\" he was told.</p><p>Canale did so, then opened the drapes and looked out the window to see the morning's unfolding chaos: all sirens and soldiers. In the distance, he could see smoke rising from the Pentagon.</p><p>Like the rest of the nation, Canale didn't know what was coming next on this bright morning when terrorists used United and American planes to attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.</p><p>The contract negotiations that had seemed so pressing just hours before were now the least of United's concerns.</p><p>A look at the series</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Pilot showdown</p><p>The legacy of the pilots' strike in 1985 poisoned relations in the company, setting the stage for years of bitterness with management and other United workers.</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>The ESOP fiasco</p><p>An ambitious employee stock ownership plan put the airline's future in the hands of its employees--for better or worse.</p><p>PART THREE</p><p>Conflicting CEO visions</p><p>A parade of CEOs, each eager to make his mark on the company, sped the airline down the path to bankruptcy.</p><p>PART FOUR: WEDNESDAY</p><p>Chapter 11 and beyond</p><p>Bankruptcy brings more pain for United employees.</p><p>Now in bankruptcy, United is trying to find its niche in the post-9/11 airline industry.</p><p>On chicagotribune.com read more on United's flight to bankruptcy, view video and more photos, and leave questions or comments on the series: chicagotribune.com/united</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO (color): CAMILLA JACOBSEN, UNITED CUSTOMER IN THE SUMMER OF 2000<br/> The exchange student from Denmark became caught in the pilots' work slowdown, as she waited for hours at O'Hare for a connecting flight to Nebraska to join her host family.

Instability at the top has robbed United of a consistent focus on efficient, cost-effective customer service. By comparison, American Airlines has had three CEOs, and Southwest two, during that period.<br/> KEY: Changes in CEO leadership<br/><br/> RICHARD FERRIS<br/> Dec. 1978-June 1987<br/> FOCUS: Building a travel company<br/> Ferris acquired Hertz car rental chain and Hilton International hotels. His strategy alienated pilots, who damaged the airline in a nasty 1985 strike.<br/><br/> FRANK OLSON<br/> June-Dec. 1987<br/> FOCUS: Shedding non-airline assets<br/> The one-time chairman of Hertz, Olson oversaw the sell-off of United's non-airline assets, including the car rental company he formerly ran. He left United to return to Hertz.<br/><br/> STEPHEN WOLF<br/> Dec. 1987-July 1994<br/> FOCUS: Expanding globally<br/> Wolf added international routes and emphasized luxurious service for business travelers. He helped craft the sale of 55 percent of United to its employees for $5 billion in givebacks.<br/><br/> GERALD GREENWALD<br/> July 1994-July 1999<br/> FOCUS: Building labor relations<br/> The choice of union workers to run employee-owned United, Greenwald tried to improve bitter labor relations. He oversaw record profits, but the booming economy masked internal rifts.<br/><br/> JAMES GOODWIN<br/> July 1999-Oct. 2001<br/> FOCUS: Merging with US Airways<br/> Goodwin agreed to huge raises for pilots after a work slowdown in 2000. His deal to buy US Airwaysfell through. His warning that United would \"perish\" without employee sacrifice backfired, costing him his job.<br/><br/> JOHN CREIGHTON<br/> Oct. 2001-Sept. 2002<br/> FOCUS: Surviving after Sept, 11<br/> As interim CEO after Goodwin, Creighton tried in vain to convince employees to accept pay cuts to stabilize the company. During this time, United lost more than $2 billion.<br/><br/><person><nameText>GLENN TILTON</nameText></person><br/> Sept. 2002-present<br/> FOCUS: Rebuilding in bankruptcy<br/> Three months after Tilton took control, United filed for bankruptcy. The airline posted a $1.3 billion loss in the first quarter of 2003 and still has not charted a clear course for post-bankruptcy profitability.<br/><br/> Sources: News reports, UAL Corp. , Securities and Exchange Commission filings.<br/> Chicago Tribune<br/></p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS 13 GRAPHIC</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><correction appended=\"true\"><correctionDescription><bodyText><p>Additional material published July 20, 2003.</p><p>CORRECTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS.</p><p>A graphic that accompanied a Page 1 story Tuesday about United Airlines carried the wrong photograph of former United CEO Frank Olson.
