It shows how the public mood towards social media has shifted \u2014 a few years ago, Disney even considered acquiring Twitter. </p><p>Disney CEO Bob Iger said that \"Hitler would have loved social media\" in an aggressive attack on big tech firms like Facebook and Twitter. Variety is reporting that the high-profile entertainment industry exec spoke out[1] during a speech at an awards dinner hosted by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, lamenting the state of public discourse and laying the blame in part with social media companies. 'Hitler would have loved social media,\" he is reported to have said. \"It's the most powerful marketing tool an extremist could ever hope for because by design social media reflects a narrow world view filtering out anything that challenges our beliefs while constantly validating our convictions and amplifying our deepest fears. \"It creates a false sense that everyone shares the same opinion. Social media allows evil to prey on troubled minds and lost souls and we all know that social news feeds can contain more fiction than fact, propagating vile ideology that has no place in a civil society that values human life.\" Iger's remarks are indicative of how the public mood has turned against big tech companies, and dramatically so. Companies like Facebook were once lauded, but following years of scandals there has been increasing public and regulatory scrutiny of their practices and their impact on society. It's also a significant shift for Iger and Disney's stance on social media. Back in 2017, the chief exec confirmed that Disney had considered buying Twitter[2] \u2014 describing it as a \"a compelling way that we might be able to present and sell the content our company makes to the consumer.\" You can read the full text of Iger's remarks at Variety.[3]Got a tip?Contact this reporter via encrypted messaging app Signal at +1 (650) 636-6268 using a non-work phone, email at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rprice@businessinsider.com\">rprice@businessinsider.com</email>, Telegram or WeChat at robaeprice, or Twitter DM at@robaeprice[4].

All of Disney's domestic parks and resorts, its cruise line business and Disneyland Paris were closed for the entirety of the just-ended period as social-distancing measures and shelter-in-place mandates took effect globally.</p><p>The company also said it plans to debut its live-action \"Mulan\" remake   originally scheduled to open in theaters this spring but postponed multiple times amid COVID-19   as a premium-priced offering on its Disney+ streaming service.</p><p>\"Mulan\" will be available to Disney+ subscribers in most of its markets on Sept. 4. In the U.S., the film will cost Disney+ subscribers an additional $29.99, with retail pricing varying slightly in other markets.</p><p>Fitch Ratings Managing Director Patrice Cucinello called the \"Mulan\" announcement \"somewhat of a surprise departure\" from Disney's previously \"unwavering support\" of the theatrical exhibition model. Cucinello also predicted that the longer the effects of COVID-19 persist, the higher the risk of a \"more permanent structural shift\" for the business models of movie theaters.</p><p>Disney stock closed Aug. 6 trading up roughly 12% from its July 31 close, at $130.85 each.</p><p>Gaming company Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. also saw its shares jump after the company reported solid results in its fiscal first-quarter earnings.</p><p>Take-Two offered a full-year outlook of net revenue between $2.80 billion and $2.90 billion, driven by increased sales volume and player engagement amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal first-quarter revenue for the period ended June 30 was $831.3 million, up from $540.5 million in the prior-year period.</p><p>\"I do think that people have come back to video games and tried video games when they hadn't tried them previously,\" Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said on an earnings call.</p><p>The company's stock closed Aug. 6 trading up 8.12% for the week.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation got a boost after it provided details about its plan to buy TikTok Inc. assets.</p><p>Microsoft said it intends to move forward with plans to acquire the U.S. operations of video-sharing app TikTok, with the goal of completing negotiations with its Chinese parent company Beijing Byte Dance Telecommunications Co. Ltd. by Sept. 15.</p><p>Even though Microsoft faces hurdles from several top lawmakers in Washington who have voiced national security concerns about the acquisition, analysts largely expect the deal to close successfully and are bullish on the tie-up.</p><p>For instance, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives predicted that there is at least a 75% chance the deal will secure approval given that Microsoft has remained largely out of the regulatory spotlight compared to other big tech companies.</p><p>Microsoft closed Aug. 6 trading up 5.53% from its July 31 close.</p><p>Microchip Technology Inc., however, fell after the microcontroller and circuits manufacturer lowered its outlook for the current quarter.</p><p>Microchip's net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $1.31 billion, down just 1% from the prior-year period, but the company's outlook was lowered because sales have fallen for four consecutive quarters.</p><p>CEO Steve Sanghi acknowledged business orders for the June quarter were \"soft\" compared to the March period, \"as our customers and distributors did not have the visibility to place long-term orders.\"</p><p>The company closed Aug. 6 trading down 2.50% for the week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-59800474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K1-S301-JDVW-N0B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Hope you all had a restful end to 2018, because 2019's here and it's hitting the ground running. I guess I should've known that the week before a major healthcare conference[1] would not necessarily be a slow week for news, even with a holiday on a Tuesday to divide up the week. With the full Business Insider healthcare team back online this week, and a mega-merger and $1 billion funding round on the same day[2], there was plenty to keep us busy. </p><p>New to our weekly newsletter? Youcan sign up here[3]. To start, the healthcare and finance teams at BI were all over the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Celgene $74 billion merger news that hit on Thursday. From covering the breaking news of the deal's announcement[4], which made it the largest healthcare deal on record when factoring in debt. To dissecting the reaction investors had to the deal (analysts are skeptical a combination will heal each company's issues[5]). We looked at the \"synergies\" the combined company hopes to achieve by joining forces and what that could mean for employees at the pharma and biotech giants[6]. BMS said it expects to realize $2.5 billion in synergies by 2022, which could mean jobs are on the table[7]. And a tiny boutique bank landed a big role in the massive deal[8]. Finance reporter Alex Morrell has the story on what that bank is all about. And in case you missed it over the holidays, Erin Brodwin[9], as always, has been keeping close tabs on marijuana-related regulations. On the heels of hemp legalization, regulators have fired a 'warning shot' to the $1 billion CBD industry[10]Earlier in December, Trump signed the US Farm Bill into law. It legalizes hemp, a plant that's roughly identical to marijuana and is a key source of the highly touted wellness ingredient CBD. Hours after the law was passed, regulators released a statement emphasizing their power to police CBD retailers, which already make up a roughly $1 billion industry. Analysts called the move a \"warning shot\" to the thousands of cafes and stores selling CBD drinks, snacks, and supplements. Erin also had the story on what Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is up to in health these days. Three words: implantable brain devices.A group of Mark Zuckerberg-funded researchers is testing implantable brain devices as part of a $5 billion quest to end disease[11]Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his pediatrician wife, Priscilla Chan, have sold 29 million Facebook shares to raise $5 billion for an ambitious biomedical-research program called the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). Related to the CZI is the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, which employs top-notch scientists from Stanford University, UC Berkeley, and UC San Francisco. Researchers including a Biohub investigator are studying a wireless implantable brain device, called the \"Wand\" for short, in primates. Published on New Year's Eve, their first study details how the Wand records, stimulates, and disrupts movement in real time. Emma Court[12] took a look at what pharmaceutical drugs investors are keeping an eye on this year that's definitely a good primer for the week (and year) ahead.From the gene therapy that spurred a $9 billion acquisition to a CBD medication for rare types of childhood epilepsy, here are the 12 promising drugs to watch in 2019[13]Investors should keep an eye on 12 key new drugs going into 2019, according to Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. The medications range from a gene therapy that could be a game-changer for a rare disease to a CBD product for rare childhood epilepsy and a fish-based drug that could improve heart health. But new drug launches can be a bumpy time for companies, so buying shares in these drugmakers may not make sense, Yee said. Emma last week also spoke to a Yale researcher who had a warning for those working on cancer immunotherapy.A Yale scientist who pioneered a cutting-edge approach to cancer treatment is warning that the field is going off-course \u2014 and that drug giants could be making it worse[14]A leading Yale scientist whose work helped a cutting-edge approach to cancer called immunotherapy get off the ground is now warning that the field has lost touch with the fundamental science. If current trends continue, \"we are going to see a lot of negative trials in cancer patients,\" the researcher, Dr. Lieping Chen, told Business Insider. Chen is particularly concerned about an approach that large firms like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Boehringer Ingelheim are taking. Yet another pioneering cancer scientist, whose company is focused on this space, said the worries could be unfounded. A new year brings a new crop of price increases to the drug industry as well. Emma ran through the new increases from Allergan, BMS, Biogen, and others, with insight into whether 2019 might be the year we actually see policy changes that curb these increases.Trump may have shamed Pfizer for increasing drug prices, but that isn't stopping drugmakers from doing more of the same[15]Since President Donald Trump called out Pfizer and other drugmakers for prescription drug price increases in July, the issue has largely stalled. Now, though, pharmaceutical companies are implementing new drug price hikes. One expert predicted that the increases could even be larger than usual. Expect to hear a lot more about the cost of drugs this year. Finally, ahead of JPMorgan, I wrapped up some of my reporting from my December trip to Seattle. A big focus of mine that week \u2014 surprise surprise \u2014 was looking at where tech is intersecting with healthcare out there. Here's what I gathered from my conversations with health execs: The hospital in Amazon's backyard has a plan to disrupt itself before being disrupted by big tech companies[16] We got 6 big predictions about how Amazon could disrupt healthcare from execs in the tech giant's backyard[17] Erin, Zach Tracer[18], and I will be out in San Francisco next week, so be sure to say hi if you're out and around Union Square as well! In the meantime, feel free to send tips, party invites, or general words of encouragement to get us through next week to the team at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:healthcare@businessinsider.com\">healthcare@businessinsider.com</email> And as always, you can find me at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lramsey@businessinsider.com\">lramsey@businessinsider.com</email>; - LydiaNOW WATCH: Some animal fathers are impressive parents, like seahorse dads who give birth to 2,000 babies[19]See Also: Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene said their huge merger has about $2.5 billion in 'synergies.'

Futurist Alvin Toffler (1) (1980) conceived the term in his book The Third Wave to refer to the ways in which consumers contribute to the production of services and goods they consume; thus 'pro' as in 'production' as the prefix to a modified experience of consumption. Toffler recognised the rapidly increasing do-it-yourself (DIY) industry in the wake of structural unemployment as well as the development of customised demand in which consumers contribute designs to the manufactured goods they buy. These trends persisted and deepened in the late twentieth-century as consumers increasingly produced their own services, such as checking in at airports and out at retail establishments. A year before the publication of Toffler's book, Michel Foucault spoke on the neoliberal subject at the College de France in his lecture series on neoliberalism, The Birth of Biopolitics; (2) without coining a particular term, and irrespective of his much debated value judgement of neoliberalism (3), he argued that neoliberal life obliterates the usual division between production and consumption because 'the man of consumption ... is a producer. </p><p>he produces his own satisfaction' (Biopolitics, p226). Unlike Toffler's empirically based account of prosumption, Foucault's neoliberal subject is a discursive construction drawn from his reading of neoliberal theorist Gary Becker regarding human capital. (4) Departing from Becker's institutional approach that argues for state investment in formal education to foster human capital available to firms, Foucault argued that people invest in themselves to produce their satisfaction such that neoliberal life is lodged neither in firms nor the state, but rather, in the subject (Biopolitics, p241). Both Foucault and Toffler drew attention to the interface of production and consumption, 'prosumption' as coined by Toffler, but whereas Toffler cast the blurring of conventional spheres in terms of emergent socio-economic trends, Foucault presented it as a matter of subjectivity. (5)</p><p>Both contextual and subjective elements of prosumption warrant critical attention in the new millennium because the dynamics of prosumption have changed to encompass a perverse dimension. (6) Beyond the persistence of DIY and consumer designs in the context of customised demand, digital consumers do not necessarily consume what they have produced--thus a case of dispossessed prosumption by which digital consumers are alienated from the rewards of their role in digital production. (7) Firms covertly collect, aggregate, code, and subsequently transform into algorithms data gleaned from digital subjects' internet activity such as web surfing, online purchases, as well as self-curated activity that can range from self-production on social media to the production of photos and videos for online audiences. (8) All these types of internet activity inform firms about actions to take on the consumer population, thereby shaping digital practices, subjectivities and choice. (9) Ironically, the algorithms firms use to govern digital life are based on the web activity of digital subjects; hence, digital governance is a recursive process. (10) Some consumers are aware of their role in the new corporate profitability and others are not, but all are unpaid for their implicit data 'donations,' giving new meaning to 'wageless life' (11) and underscoring Tiziana Terranova's declaration of 'free labour' in the digital economy. (12)</p><p>Disagreement about dispossessed prosumption in the digital era centres on the im/materiality of users' rewards for data donations. Some argue that irrespective of consciousness of their role in the corporate digital value chain, consumers fairly exchange their data for a service, and further, often find self-enhancement and build communities through their online activity. (13) In contrast, and from a more critical perspective, consumers implicitly have become workers subject to exploitation and alienation from the fruits of their labour as online activity becomes commodified by and for firms. (14) Also from a critical perspective, apparent immaterial rewards from online activity benefit firms by ensuring continued online engagement, sometimes resulting in addiction, which ensures continued profitability, echoing the ways in which tobacco addiction maintained the profits of tobacco firms in the twentieth-century. Irrespective of entertainment or social capital resulting from online activity, digital consumers nonetheless remain materially uncompensated. Some online activity can actually entail quite a bit of work, giving rise to the phrase 'produsers' as usage of platform choice requires work to use, produce, and evaluate information (Platforms and Hyperchoice, p5). From a critical vantage point, and as elaborated below, I suggest that the main problem with the conceptualisation of consumers-as-workers is that it is partial.</p><p>Accepting that digital consumers represent unpaid labour and are dispossessed prosumers, I call attention to conditions of work for digital producers--those who actively seek a wage through online means--and crucially, their relation to digital consumers. I ask in what ways digital producers also are dispossessed prosumers. Work in the digital era requires an expansive view to permit an overarching conceptualisation of the digital regime, which encompasses both consumers and producers. I emphasise commonalities among digital consumers and producers while identifying salient context-specific differences in processes of dispossessed prosumption.</p><p>In the ensuing sections, I argue at the outset that for-profit crowdsourcing (heretofore, 'crowdsourcing') is the principal corporate strategy in the digital era that governs capital-labour relations. (15) I suggest that crowdsourcing, which is recognised in the context of digital production, also pertains to digital consumption, illuminating fundamental objectifying relations of production through which dispossessed prosumption occurs across the so-called production/consumption divide. I use 'producer crowdwork/er' in reference to the overt relation between firms and digital producers who consciously decide to pursue a wage through online means, and 'consumer crowdwork/ er' in reference to the covert relation between firms and digital consumers who may engage with the digital economy consciously or unconsciously. Although producer and consumer crowdworkers share common problems, the processes through which those problems obtain often differ, and therefore require parsing and situating. The following sections pursue both contextual and subjective dimensions of dispossessed prosumption, first regarding how dispossessed prosumption configures uniquely in the digital era among producers, and second, regarding the vulnerability of both producer and consumer crowdworkers to addiction, on which firms capitalise at the base of digital value chains. Digital producers and consumers share conditions that lead to digital addictions, yet the digital value chains that profit from the same problem differ in consumption and production. I close by positioning the arguments I develop relative to modes of digital resistance to date, and then look to the future. An expansive approach to digital work suggests provocative possibilities for coalitional resistance across what has become a dated divide of consumption and production.</p><p>AN EXPANSIVE CONCEPTUALISATION OF CROWDSOURCING</p><p>I argue that digital producers and consumers share common ground by virtue of the capital-labour relation to which they both are subject, and accordingly I reference crowdsourcing, an organisational strategy adopted by firms, as the critical bridge between production and consumption in the digital era. (16) Whereas outsourcing connects firms and enables one firm to access the work of another firm's labour through an inter-firm contract, crowdsourcing for profit enables firms to access workers directly online, or indirectly through firms that broker relations between them and workers in a mode of production that disentangles all firms from employer status. Known generally as a production strategy, crowdsourcing has constructed a new capital-labour relation that signifies the informalisation of work while formal-sector firms shed considerable labour, capital, space, and transportation costs, and crucially, responsibilities to workers. (17) Yet while firms access digital workers seeking wages through online means overtly through platforms, they access data from consumers seeking consumption (of products, services, entertainment) or curated self-production for others' consumption covertly through surveillance and data scraping, without remuneration. Crowdsourcing digital producers and consumers therefore entails different processes, but the overarching strategy is the same, namely to reap rewards based on input from digital subjects while dispossessing them. At this juncture in the global economy, the digital age arguably is just in its infancy, with one foot in crowdsourcing, and another in outsourcing and more generally, flexible production strategies of the post-Fordist era (encompassing, for example, factory work in digital technologies that is slated for automation in the future). (18) I focus below specifically on the contours of crowdsourcing, broadly conceived, in the emergent digital economy.</p><p>While 'crowdsourcing' is a digital organisational strategy embraced by firms, 'crowdwork' refers to the activity as well as subjectivities of digital producers and consumers. At the outset I distinguish producer and consumer crowdwork by the intention of the former to earn a wage through digital means and the lack of such intention among the latter. As elaborated later, some producer crowdworkers find their work entertaining, and others actually become addicted, similar to many consumer crowdworkers, but all producer crowdworkers in any case expect a wage, and all corporate agents involved in transactions with producer crowdworkers understand and organise around this expectation, even if they decline to pay. Indeed, despite expectations, many producer crowdworkers are unpaid. Firms often require low to high-skilled producer crowdworkers to complete unpaid tasks to become eligible for paid tasks. For example, relatively low-skilled online work platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk include many tasks for zero remuneration as 'Turkers' sign on to unpaid tasks to build a task profile so they can take on paid tasks. More skilled digital work on online martketplaces such as Upwork or Freelancer often entails a trial period whereby hopeful workers submit whole project plans for evaluation, which firms can use even if they don't hire applicants; (19) this situation is similar to crowdsourcing in open innovation whereby firms as well as governments send out an electronic call for innovations for online contests, and hopeful contestants compete, often with thousands others, for the winning prizes. (20) In addition to unpaid work for firms, many firms, simply stated, fail to pay (<url normalizedValue=\"https://worldslongestinvoice.com/\">https://worldslongestinvoice.com/</url>), and they can manoeuver such delinquency in the absence of formal employment contracts. As wageless work in the digital era proliferates, outcomes--such as whether income is earned--can be messy and blur the lines between digital production and consumption. Intentions therefore constitute a meaningful difference that connects with differences in the nature of digital value chains relative to producer and consumer crowdsourcing, elaborated later.</p><p>Differences in intentionality also are important because they have consequences, notably in different modes of resistance. As I elaborate in the last section, whereas critical producer crowdworkers have resisted by seeking change in conditions of work, (21) critical consumer crowdworkers have resisted by eliminating their role as implicit workers in the digital value chain and taking steps to preserve their right to privacy. (22) Recognising both digital consumers and producers as crowdworkers despite differences in intentionality, the question remains as to how producer crowdworkers might be cast as prosumers, and further, whether the processes by which they are dispossessed differ from, or are similar to, those that govern their consumer crowdworker counterparts.</p><p>PRODUCER CROWDWORKERS AS DISPOSSESSED PROSUMERS</p><p>Like consumer crowdworkers, producer crowdworkers are materially alienated and become dispossessed through loss of control over the fruits of their labour. In consumer crowdwork, the process unique to the digital era is data capture. In producer crowdwork, alienation and dispossession derive from longstanding processes of disproportionate value capture by firms that characterise capital-labour relations in capitalism at any time. However, I argue that there is a form of dispossession specific to the digital era, namely self-investment in unreimbursed capital costs, which is a unique requirement of crowdsourcing. Producer as well as consumer crowdworkers must self-fund the costs of software and electronic devices to access the internet, in turn to consume in the case of consumers, and to work for a wage in the case of producers on online work platforms marketplaces. In addition, some producer crowdworkers have other capital costs that can be substantial. For example, gig-economy workers, who provide on-the-ground services by way of a platform, self-fund the material basis of their services, such as cars as well as insurance in the case of Uber, and homes in the case of Airbnb. Producer crowdworkers who enter contests as they respond to online calls for innovations from firms or the government must self-invest in the capital costs of the inventions they submit. Dispossession among producer crowdworkers occurs as the costs of self-investment in crowdwork exceed, often considerably, the wage, which can be as little as zero.</p><p>Beyond the short-term, unreimbursed capital costs of producing for firms, medium to high-skilled producer crowdwork in particular incurs long-term investments in education. Whether pursuing traditional postsecondary and graduate education or vocational boot camps for trending jobs such as coding, digital subjects who strive for higher wages in medium to high-skilled work invest their time, money, energy, and their passions in education to realise their dreams of profitably engaging the digital economy. In contexts without a welfare state such as the United States, post-secondary and vocational education are privileges, not rights, which commonly require considerable financial investment that results in long-term debt. Further, financial investments encompass opportunity costs in unpaid training, internship programs, applications that require evidence of qualifications by way of submitting project designs and the like as part of applications, as well as undesirable paid work that an individual might consider a 'stepping stone' to future, more preferable work.</p><p>Desire figures prominently in the sacrifices that accumulate among entrepreneurial subjects scrambling to develop a career that will productively channel the talents in which they have invested. Subjects often fall into a 'passion trap'--trapped by their self-investment and desire in the precarious context of declining opportunities for stable careers. (23) Such efforts often are unrequited and produce an immaterial sense of alienation. Yet entrepreneurial subjects commonly continue to pursue their dreams, which form on the basis of an ethos of 'aspirational consumption,' as wannabe consumer lifestyles anchor the production of the self towards attaining career goals. (24) This situation obtains for those seeking careers both on and offline, although precarious conditions have deepened for producer crowdworkers of the 'cybertariat' (25) in light of the increasing informalisation of work in the digital era. Long-term investments in education among digital wage-seekers are acts of aspirational consumption from which others, notably firms as well as university researchers benefit, commonly leading to mounting debt as digital producers live on hope, self-capitalising through credit. (26) The problems of debt and credit that have been considered germane to neoliberal life pertain fundamentally to dispossessed prosumption among producer crowdworkers. (27)</p><p>Consistent with Foucault's discursive construction of the neoliberal subject, crowdworkers use the capital at one's disposal to become an enterprise of oneself, making use of one's abilities in multiple ways to become 'an abilities machine' to ensure continual productivity and ultimately, satisfaction (Biopolitics, p226, 229). Foucault's argument that people become entrepreneurs of themselves by productively using their disposable capital informs new dynamics, although in the new millennium, DIY producer crowdworkers commonly use credit and sink into debt as aspirational consumers in the absence of disposable income.</p><p>As the precarity wrought of the post-Fordist order deepens in the digital era, producer crowdworkers invest in their chances for economic stability. They become part of what Silvio Lorusso called the 'entreprecariat' whereby digital subjects work as if they own a company but without the paycheck, always engaged in 'the urgency to optimise time, their mind, their body, and their soul to deal with precarious conditions'. (28) Foucault's argument that neoliberalism signals the transformation of social problems into economic opportunity is apt. As Lorusso suggested, the apparent intransigence of precarity results in individuals managing themselves 24/7 while self-marketing through applications, CVs, and cover letters--sealed with hope (The Cybertariat, p65). Whereas workers of previous regimes earned a wage to buy consumer items, producer crowdworkers in the digital era work outside formal workplaces, in the spaces of homes, cars, cafes, even while on public transit, to earn wages that do not necessarily enable basic needs. They self-invest to become what Foucault called 'abilities machines' to work overtime or to work several jobs to patch together a living wage.</p><p>Consumption pertains to basic needs of the everyday as well as hope for a better future, and especially for young crowdworkers, for the opulent and hip lives celebrated and paraded on film, television, streaming logins, and related media. (29) Such crowdworkers may strive to embody a lifestyle to which they aspire, living on credit to self-capitalise, thereby fuelling the finance economy that enables their subjection. This is not to say that workers of previous regimes of work had no aspirations; rather, the point is that aspirational consumption--the potential to consume a lifestyle, even if unlikely--has become integral to digital work among the hopeful due largely to the required self-investment that uniquely characterises crowdwork. In this way, crowdsourcing dispossesses producer crowdworkers of both the control over their prosumption as well as their material and affective investments, commonly unrealised, in their selves.</p><p>INSIDE THE BLACK BOX OF DIGITAL DESIRES AMONG CONSUMER AND PRODUCER CROWDWORKERS</p><p>Desire associated with norms developed in the era of digital social and work relations drive the capitalisation process in the digital economy. The specific corporate strategies that foster addiction capitalise on subjects' desires, which can morph into addiction. (30) At issue, then, is precisely what the norms are that underwrite desire in the digital economy. Bernard Harcourt suggested that digital consumers inexorably desire exposure, even at the expense of privacy, although left unattended is that which drives the need, the desire, for exposure in the first place. (31) I suggest that the objectification of digital consumers and producers alike as 'disparate data points' produces atomisation of both social and work relations in the digital era. (32) This individuation of subjects activates the drive to communicate one's worth, one's value, to as many people as possible, thereby laying fertile ground for capitalisation by firms. By 'atomisation' I refer to the corporate colonisation and commodification of sociality and their subjective effects such as increasing isolation, the siloing of digital subjects who play games by themselves, socialise online, and work alone as formal workplaces become increasingly rare in the era of crowdsourcing.</p><p>The implicit work of consumer crowdworkers that results in firms' profit varies from consumers who simply surf the web to find information and/or purchase goods and services, to those who either work to make selections on choice-infused platforms or work to actively curate their personal data on social media to self-brand and publicise--expose--their views, purchases, activities, families and homes to broadcast who they are, how they live, what they think, and with whom they connect. (33) Physical disconnection from social relations prompts desire for exposure as digital subjects grope for connection and recognition as much as decent material conditions of living.</p><p>Software designers in Silicon Valley's big tech firms create value out of affect by manufacturing addiction. (34) These firms use platforms to attract and distract users' attention, (35) leveraging algorithms to lure consumer crowdworkers equipped with an array of electronic devices to continually click in and check contacts, messages, chats, 'friend' activity, and consumer deals in a way strikingly analogous to drug or junk-food addiction. (36) Whereas fast food and tobacco contain chemicals that make the body crave more, algorithms seduce with implicit rewards--being 'liked' for instance--that nudge subjects of the digital economy to continually augment their social networks, and in the process, view trending items available for purchase. Consumers who have developed awareness of the production process in which they are entangled, even with repulsion, nonetheless often continue their everyday online practices because the practices themselves have become addictive. Daren Brabham's interviews with designers for Threadless, an online t-shirt company that relies on producer crowdworkers both for design and evaluation of t-shirts, offers a glimpse into similar tendencies among producer crowdworkers: over 60 per cent of interviewees commented that designing for online contests was addictive. Why? Because '... even if you don't win, it's a constant motivation to continually put your work out there'. (37) Recognising material drives such as the need for income, the intention to expose oneself and one's work may have as much purchase among producer as among consumer crowdworkers.</p><p>While the prompt to pursue producer crowdwork may derive from desperation for a wage under precarious conditions of living, desire sustains the effort. Accordingly, firms capitalise on those desires. Uber, for example, controls its drivers algorithmically through strategies that entail continual positive and negative feedback via rewards and punishments to nudge drivers to perform as productively as possible. (38) Luke Munn's interviews with Uber drivers revealed that 'The combination of responsive data and real-time messaging ... transforms a dry offer into a gamified mission, harnessing the kind of level-up logic and micro dopamine hits that are well understood in the gaming and gambling industries'. (39) Sam Knight interviewed an Uber driver in London, who commented regarding pick-ups and the inability to know a destination until a passenger is in the car: 'It's like being in the bookies. It is very, very addictive'. (40) Anxious feelings of aloneness in the absence of a formal workplace and fear of wasting time (or what Silvio Lorusso called 'lazy shaming') magnifies the sense of precariousness. (41) Such feelings may help explain how the desire to achieve, to be accountable for one's future, to be continually productive by earning as much as possible can morph into addictive behaviour. One designer who had entered countless online contests commented:</p><p>So you hope you win this one, or perhaps the next, or the one after that. Eventually you do win, and the euphoria of winning fires you up to join even more contests. It's a pathetic cycle of excitement-discouragement-delight-dejection ... the design industry begins to resemble a factory of unpaid skilled labourers, working zealously for the promise of possible reward. (42)</p><p>In light of material and immaterial unrequited self-investment, many low to high-skilled producer crowdworkers struggle to survive, and often cope by working overtime or juggling multiple 'gigs'. Wages from high-end online work can be high, but on the condition that payment is received, and in the case of online contests, on the condition of winning; many online contests for innovations can draw many thousands of contributors across the global economy. (43) In light of the deregulated nature of crowdwork and the absence of worker rights, high-end crowdwork and the lives of many professionals also are precarious.</p><p>Like the precariat, the cybertariat, is internally diverse across classes, and many high-skilled producer crowdworkers often pursue low-skilled opportunities in the absence of alternatives. One Turker commented:</p><p>... around here even McDonald's and Walmart are NOT hiring. I have a degree in accounting and cannot find a real job, so to keep myself off the street I work 60 hours or more a week here on mTurk just to make $150-$200. That is far below minimum wage, but it makes the difference between making my rent and living in a tent. (44)</p><p>The undelivered promise of a stable job following formal training constitutes a formidable subjective frame of reference for many digital subjects as crowdsourcing overlaps with, and is in the process of eclipsing, outsourcing as a principal corporate strategy. The tension between hopeful possibilities and ruthless realities that have deepened in the digital era sheds light on new trajectories of precarious life asjobs become increasingly short-term, insecure, unstable, and moreover, increasingly exploitative in the absence of formal employment contracts and worker rights. Desire may or may not morph into addiction, but the aloneness of digital life combined with deepened precarity amplify the likelihood of such a transformation, on which firms capitalise at the base of their digital value chains.</p><p>DIGITAL VALUE CHAINS AMONG CONSUMER AND PRODUCER CROWDWORKERS</p><p>Needs, desire, and possible addiction are capitalised through digital value chains. With or without consciousness of their role in the digital value chain, consumer crowdworkers publicise their 'personal' value, and firms then subject the data to further rounds of curation that progressively produce value as data are continually re-presented and manipulated through various functions: data scraping, aggregation, coding, and the construction of algorithms that are intended to shape the crowd's purchasing patterns and ensure profit for the firms orchestrating the digital value chain. Firms may incorporate the various functions along the digital value chain internally, although firms increasingly both outsource these functions to other firms and crowdsource individual freelancers. Although Silicon Valley big-tech firms as well as globally active political firms such as Cambridge Analytica receive the main press, wide-ranging firms from small to large engage in data scraping from social media and the internet more generally, either internally or increasingly by both outsourcing and crowdsourcing to oversee the curation of consumer crowdworkers' personal digital data, for profit. A search on the web for 'small business data scraping' turns up numerous advertisements for both data-scraping outsourcing services through firms (e.g. https://www. promptcloud.com/blog/social-media-scraping-for-competitive-intelligence) and crowdsourcing services through independent freelancers (e.g. https:// <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/skill/data-scraping/\">www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/skill/data-scraping/</url>).</p><p>Whereas consumer crowdworkers contribute data subject to a chain of activities that firms both outsource and crowdsource, digitally based producer work is crowdsourced through inter-firm networks. Producer crowdworkers contract either directly with a firm seeking low to high-skilled and even innovative work or, increasingly, indirectly with a third-party, and sometimes a fourth-party mediator in the case of market expansion to least developed places. (45) Like their precursors in the non-digital temporary-help industry, firms that broker relations between producer crowdworkers and firms seeking online services mediate but do not employ. Some online producer crowdworkers select tasks on online work platforms, while others, like gig-economy workers, are matched with clients through on-demand and marketplace platforms. (46) While producer crowdwork informalises work, producer crowdworkers nonetheless sign contracts with mediators that formally subject them to precarious, informal work conditions.</p><p>Although producer crowdworkers explicitly self-enrol in digital work whereas consumer crowdworkers may not, they both nonetheless are subjected to opacity and covert algorithmic manipulation over the course of digital value chains. The term 'algorithmic management' was coined at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to refer to the ways in which algorithms monitor, evaluate and classify producer crowdworkers. (47) In the case of online work platforms, some corporate mediators classify the global 'crowd' hierarchically relative to 'first' and 'third' world regions. (48) In the case of firms like Uber in the gig-economy, firms set prices and algorithmically 'nudge' drivers into overtime. (49) Analogous to covert automated processes well documented in the daily life of digital consumers, (50) such covert surveillance, monitoring, and determination in producer crowdwork likewise renders producer crowdwork precarious and exploitative due not only to asymmetrical power relations, opacity, and low wages, but also to acts of dispossession.</p><p>FRONTIERS OF DIGITAL RESISTANCE</p><p>Despite the daunting contextual and subjective constraints on consumer and producer crowdworkers, dispossessed prosumption in the digital era is far from final as critical, reflexive subjects have forged a new frontier of digital resistance. Beyond traditional protests such as petitions and on-the-ground strikes, critical producer and consumer crowdworkers have strategised to subvert the affordances of the digital infrastructure by configuring them to work for civic society rather than big-tech firms. (51) One specifically digital mode of resistance among producer crowdworkers engaged in both online work and gig economies has entailed the development of platform cooperatives, which aim to eliminate corporate mediation, the mode by which firms access workers. Members of platform cooperatives self-organise, self-market, and self-fund to illuminate democratic principles and maintain autonomy. Consumer crowdworkers--digital subjects not seeking a wage--have developed wide-ranging strategies, including obfuscation and disruption; the development and maintenance of socio-political connections in cyberspace that thwart problems of alienation; the production of metadata to serve counterpublics; and various tactics to achieve and preserve privacy such as the use of free and open-source software (F/OSS) to eliminate their role as implicit workers in the digital value chain while embracing communitarian values. Recently, cooperative platforms that function as non-profit marketplaces have emerged in the health sector (e.g. Midata, Savvy.coop) and financial sector (e.g. Datavest) to enable consumers to maintain control of their personal data while connecting with professionals.</p><p>Although the range of creative strategies among producer and consumer crowdworkers appears continually expansive, remarkably, the strategies aimed at producer and consumer crowdwork have been mutually exclusive, rendering solidarity among producer and consumer crowdworkers remote. As approaches to resistance continue to unfold, conceivably the apparent consumer/producer binary may dissolve beyond sites of prosumption to articulate a distinct frontier of resistance that draws from common ground.</p><p>One impediment to solidarity in the digital era is the unevenness of consumer and producer participation in the digital economy. Producer and consumer crowdworker populations overlap, although at this point in time consumer crowdwork reflects the activity of perhaps billions of people worldwide while producer crowdwork is more in the millions. According to Pew Center surveys in the United States, almost 25 per cent of the adult population sought wages online by November 2016 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pewinternet\">http://www.pewinternet</url>. org/2016/11/17/gig-work-online-selling-and-home-sharing/) while about 70 per cent participated in social media by January of 2017 (http://www. pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/). In the relative infancy of the digital regime of work, it may be a matter of time before crowdworkers recognise and act on the common ground of material and immaterial dispossession wrought of crowdwork, whether implicit or explicit, thereby generating a coalitional movement similar to those that have characterised post-Fordist labour in the global economy. The main goal of a coalition of workers with different sets of concerns is to converge on general principles. (52)</p><p>Although producer and consumer crowdwork differ, as do their intentions regarding income generation, and resistance has followed different paths relative to different concerns--to change conditions of work and to eliminate their position in the digital value chain, respectively--general sensibilities among producer and consumer crowdworkers who resist the constraints of the new regime nonetheless share important similarities. For example, despite differences in intention regarding a wage, platform cooperatives developed among producer and consumer crowdworkers bear similar concerns as those among consumer crowdworkers who develop and sustain the free and opensource software movement (F/OSS): autonomy, preservation of privacy, protection from corporate invasiveness, and embrace of democratic and collaborative principles. Such similarities constitute at least an enabling condition for coalitional action across the traditional consumer/producer divide. The emergence in recent years of 'open cooperatism,' which links commons-based peer production (as in Wikipedia) with entrepreneurs aiming to earn a living wage while producing for the public good is hopeful. (53) Further, the context in which we live is changing rapidly. At this juncture in the digital economy, automation in North America and most of Western Europe lags behind South Korea, Singapore, Germany, and Japan while the rate of growth of automation in China appears highest. (54) Although full automation is unlikely in the near future and automation may create new jobs, firms worldwide increasingly will engage automation as a basic competitive strategy, thereby increasing the rate of worker displacement, especially those with low to medium-level skills. (55) As automation and the rate of worker displacement increase across wide-ranging industries, the relative percentage of people seeking wages through digital means likely will increase, along with a critical consciousness of the problems of dispossessed prosumption they confront as both producer and consumer crowdworkers.</p><p>Little victories have become visible: Uber drivers in California have pressured legislators to change gig-economy contracts to include worker rights regularly associated with 'employment', (56) Amazon increased wages in response to criticism from Bernie Sanders, (57) and critical consumers have prompted a national-scale debate in the United States regarding intrusions of new media into privacy. (58) These welcome developments are, however, works-in-progress and ultimately may fall short of long-term goals as gains are unsystematic across crowdsourcing firms and commonly are accompanied by losses and/or persistent problems. For example, increases in wages among Amazon workers occurred along with elimination of bonuses and stock grants, and many Amazon workers considered themselves to be worse off following the wage increase. (59) Similarly, as Uber placed a cap on the number of hours Uber drivers work to assuage concerns about overtired, overworked drivers, algorithmic management has remained intact to ensure continued overtime work. (60) Resistance that crystallises in new policies nonetheless represents milestones that could be enhanced substantially, and crucially, sustained, with coalitional support.</p><p>Although the value of coalitions among various segments of the marginalised has long been recognised, old conceptual frames that presume a division between consumption and production require revision if digital subjects are to harness the kinship of their consumer and producer crowdwork in an emergent digital regime of work, and accordingly, begin to organise with an understanding of prosumer realities across a dated divide. At this early stage in the new regime of work, possible futures require critical engagement with the spectrum of changes, including fundamental conceptions of labour. Already developments in the digital economy, such as producer crowdwork, have prompted a revision of the concept of employment because working can result neither in a wage nor employment status with associated rights; similarly, digital consumers have become wageless workers without rights, even if some consumers are unaware of their input to corporate profits and others find satisfaction in online self-curation, self-branding, and crucially, connecting with others. An expansive view of crowdsourcing recognises dispossessed prosumption as the basis of the digital regime of work across production and consumption while differentiating context-specific processes to open analysis to critical comparison among workers regarding exploitation, alienation, dispossession, as well as resistance strategies. Beyond contextual factors, subjectivities among consumer as well as producer crowdworkers also are germane because tech firms study and manipulate them to capitalise on them, a crucial element that anchors digital value chains. An expansive framework of the digital regime of work also is suggestive of a potential coalition between digital consumers and producers that might harness the talents and passions among all crowdworkers towards constructing a better future.</p><p>DOI: 10.3898/NEWF:99.03.2019</p><p>Nancy Ettlinger is Professor of Critical Human Geography at Ohio State University.</p><p>Acknowledgement: I thank Alistair Fraser, who read and offered helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.</p><p>(1.)

This article focuses exclusively on crowdsourcing as a corporate strategy to gain profit. Crowdsourcing also is a non-profit activity of federal, and increasingly, local governments to collect information from volunteers, as well as a means by which people can volunteer information for the 'public good', as in the case of Wikipedia. 'Crowdfunding' is a particular type of non-profit activity that crowdsources individuals and organizations for donations to wide-ranging causes.</p><p>(16.) As an organisational strategy, crowdsourcing results in types of wage-earning work (gig work, notably in urban areas, online work platforms, online marketplaces) that may share aspects of the types of work that digital consumers engage. The approach I take towards an expansive view of the digital regime of work targets the stable corporate strategy that subjects all workers, not the specific results of the strategy, which are likely to vary over time.</p><p>(17.)

Google's smart city of the future is in trouble. For the past two years, Sidewalk Labs, Google's sister company under Alphabet, has been in talks with local officials in Toronto to redevelop 12 acres of neglected land along Lake Ontario into what it calls a data-driven 'disruption' of urban life. But as details of the project\u2014dubbed Quayside\u2014have begun to emerge, residents and local officials have expressed alarm about what it might mean for their city and their democracy. The final straw came on June 17 with the surprise release of the Quayside master plan: Amid glossy illustrations of a techie utopia, the stubbornly coy document described a project that had mysteriously grown from the originally agreed-upon 12 acres to a mammoth 800 acres, in which public spaces could be shaped and controlled by a private company, and where data privacy protections for residents would be shaky at best. </p><p>In the plan, Sidewalk Labs also assigned itself the role of lead developer\u2014though it is not a development company\u2014and called upon the city to invest $1.2 billion in public funds to expand its light-rail system to the new development. On August 2, Waterfront Toronto, the public authority that currently owns the Quayside area and had enthusiastically invited Sidewalk Labs in, threatened to pull the plug if these issues remain unresolved by the end of October. But even if Toronto rejects Sidewalk Labs' proposal, the company's plan points to a privately controlled digital future for cities in need of dollars that Big Tech can provide.  FOR ALL ITS UTOPIAN BLUSTER, Quayside is only the latest foray Big Tech has made into the world of urban planning in recent years. In 2016, startup accelerator Y Combinator announced it would begin researching how to create 'the best possible city' with so-called smart technology at its center. Among the questions it planned to ask were 'Can we figure out better zoning laws?' and 'Can we fit all rules for the city in 100 pages of text?' Two years after that, Blockchains, LLC\u2014a company run by cryptocurrency millionaire Jeffrey Berns\u2014bought some 67,000 acres of land in western Nevada to build a futuristic new city with an economy based on\u2014you guessed it\u2014Bitcoin. And in places like Seattle, San Francisco, and very soon, Nashville and Northern Virginia, the tech industry's outsized influence on everything from housing markets to municipal tax codes to transit policy has been undeniable. In 2018, Amazon's HQ2 gambit threw local governments' desperation to attract tech giants into stark relief\u2014giving dramatic new meaning to John Dewey's warning that government may merely be the shadow cast over society by big business. What makes Quayside different is the sheer scope of its plans\u2014and the contempt Sidewalk Labs seems to have for local public institutions. Conceived as a city 'from the internet up,' Sidewalk says Quayside will feature heated bike lanes, underground package delivery, and 'adaptive' traffic lights that prioritize pedestrians. Taking the increasingly ubiquitous[1] 'five-over-one' mid-rise design several steps further, the plan calls for building wooden multistoried buildings zoned for commercial and residential use. At the ground level, adaptable walkways would shift between civic and commercial uses depending on real-time changes in market demands\u2014metrics determined through systemic collection of residents' personal data. To do all this, Sidewalk promises to pump CA$1.3 billion, or $980 million, into the project\u2014big money for any city. The need to expand and enhance public space appears frequently in the master plan, from new parks and plaza designs to those 'adaptable' walkways it touts. But a closer read suggests Sidewalk's definition of 'public' is nothing if not opaque. Instead of being under government control, these spaces would fall under the jurisdiction of something Sidewalk calls the Open Space Alliance (OSA), a public-private partnership that would include government officials, residents, landlords, and tenants. The plan does not specify the scope of the OSA's authority, how it would make decisions, or whether one or another group would hold more sway. It does, however, describe in detail how the OSA's operating budget would be structured, suggesting Sidewalk could enjoy a significant degree of control over the organization. 'The sci-fi isn't just in the gadgets\u2014it's in these fictional authorities they want to create,' says Mariana Valverde, a professor of socio-legal studies at the University of Toronto and member of the Toronto Open Smart Cities Forum, a local watchdog. 'This would only work if it was like a gated community, but they don't want to say that's what they're creating.' It's also unclear what political rights residents may have in those supposedly public spaces. The Canadian constitution guarantees rights of free expression and assembly in public spaces. But spaces that are privately owned come with few, and often no, such guarantees. If, say, workers in a Quayside restaurant go on strike (nearly a third of Canadian workers are unionized), will they have a right to picket on the adaptable walkway? What happens if their demonstration interferes with the OSA's real-time, market-driven plans to convert that walkway into a pop-up farmers market? Who gets final say? Indeed, for all its ambitious language about remaking the modern city, what Sidewalk's master plan reveals most vividly is a serious misunderstanding of how urban planning actually works. 'It's not a plan\u2014it hasn't gone to the city planning department. It's nothing. It's just their ideas and fantasies,' says Valverde. 'Development plans are usually much more specific. It's clear who's doing what. There's no way the City Council would approve this.'  MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, data collection lies at the heart of Sidewalk's plans for Quayside. Nearly all of the 'smart' technologies touted in the company's master plan depend on an Orwellian collection of personal data of all kinds\u2014in both public and private spaces. Through what it calls 'ubiquitous sensing,' Sidewalk aims to make a vast array of public services responsive to residents' needs in real time: traffic lights that analyze traffic patterns; homes that track residents' behavior to reduce heating costs and lower carbon emissions. Sidewalk even envisions a centralized 'identity management system,' which would apparently function much like a government ID, enabling residents to access public goods like transit and health care. Just how much personal data will be open to collection by Sidewalk is hard to say. In its master plan, the company claims that it will harvest only what it calls 'urban data,' a doggedly vague term which the company defines as 'information gathered in the city's physical environment, including the public realm, publicly accessible spaces, and even some private buildings.' Yet elsewhere in the plan, Sidewalk expands this definition to include data collected in private residences, such as 'tenant or building noise, air quality, and energy use.' To allay privacy concerns, Sidewalk insists it would not monetize data and that all collected data would reside in an Urban Data Trust, an independent body composed of Sidewalk, local companies, municipal officials, and Waterfront Toronto. The trust would then set rules for outside companies\u2014like say, Google\u2014attempting to access and monetize the data. Sidewalk says that all such access requests would be made public. Data trusts themselves are nothing new. In Barcelona, the city government has taken a leading role in regulating the collection and use of data through a public trust. Such data are publicly owned, and their use by private companies is tightly controlled. Citizens can even opt themselves out of certain kinds of data collection and control how their data will be shared. But while Sidewalk points to Barcelona as inspiration for its trust, its plans are very different. Barcelona's trust empowers citizens to take control of their data, share them on their terms, and establishes digital sovereignty as a fundamental right. Sidewalk's plan, by contrast, empowers a private company to collect unclear amounts of data with few, if any, concrete checks on its authority. And even if Sidewalk itself does not monetize the data, there's nothing stopping other companies\u2014say, Google\u2014from doing so. As with the Open Space Alliance, it's very difficult to say how the trust will make decisions or whether one group could hold more sway over the others. Sidewalk's original proposal called for a 'civic data trust,' which might have implied some leadership role for the government. But in its current proposal, 'civic data' has been supplanted by 'urban data,' a term with no legal meaning. Whether this shift signaled some change in how the trust would function is anyone's guess. 'The boundaries are not at all clear,' says Andrew Clement, a professor emeritus of public information policy at the University of Toronto and member of the Waterfront Toronto Digital Strategy Advisory Panel. 'Urban data is a problematic mix of private and public information that's being smooshed together in ways that are really murky.' Because of the lack of legal protections for personal data, in Canada as in most other countries, the potential for abuse is high. According to a 2018 report[2] by Ontario's auditor general, Waterfront Toronto failed to consult with any other levels of government before awarding the project to Sidewalk. Ontario lacks the robust policy framework necessary to regulate a project like this, the report warned, and Waterfront made no attempt to address that. In 2018, Ontario's auditor general recommended that the province pass legislation that more adequately protects residents' personal data and privacy before the Waterfront project moves forward.  WATERFRONT TORONTO WAS CREATED with a specific purpose in mind\u2014and it wasn't to build a smart city with Google's sister company. The organization had its origins in Toronto's failed 2008 Olympic bid, with the ultimate goal of revitalizing the city's waterfront in time for the games. The Olympics never made it to Toronto, but the legacy of that bid remains in Waterfront Toronto's bizarre governance structure. Officially a tri-government agency, all of Waterfront's decisions must go through three different levels of government\u2014federal, provincial, and municipal. And unlike other, similar public authorities, Waterfront Toronto is specifically barred from creating subsidiaries, changing local zoning, or borrowing money on its own credit. It even has an expiration date: By law, Waterfront Toronto has a 25-year lifespan, which ends in 2025. Contrast all that with, say, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an agency with independent funding and a wide scope of authority over the parks and transportation infrastructure in the New York metro area\u2014and of course, no expiration date. It was the finite budget in particular that fueled a kind of existential fear within Waterfront in recent years. Having exhausted its CA$1.5 million in seed money, unable to borrow money on its own to revitalize the area, and with the clock ticking on its very existence, the agency began thinking creatively about how to achieve its goals. In March 2017, Waterfront put out a request for proposals[3] (RFP) for an 'innovation and funding partner' to redevelop Quayside. Going well beyond the scope of a typical RFP, Waterfront said its new funding partner would work with the agency to 'create the required governance constructs to stimulate the growth of an urban innovation cluster, including legal frameworks.' Sidewalk Labs, an 'urban innovation organization' founded less than two years prior, jumped at the chance. That October, Waterfront announced Sidewalk had won. The choice of Sidewalk was unusual for a few reasons. For one thing, Sidewalk was a technology company, not a developer, and had no prior experience designing urban spaces. But from the very beginning, Waterfront made it clear that it was looking beyond more traditional funding partners like private developers, and toward technology companies and nonprofits. 'What we are looking for is a partner who for themselves may have done something like this, a demonstration project,' said Waterfront CEO Will Fleissig in April 2017. 'Or may have some technologies they may want to try out, and put their seed capital into it.' Once it found out that Sidewalk was interested, Waterfront went out of its way to give the company a competitive edge. According to a 2018 report[4] by the Ontario auditor general, Waterfront shared information with Sidewalk about the project even before issuing the RFP. This helped Sidewalk develop what was reportedly the most comprehensive bid. Other bidders were not quite so lucky. Waterfront Toronto did not release any of the other bids when Sidewalk was chosen\u2014or even the identities of the other bidders. Typically, Toronto public agencies release details of a bid's three finalists before choosing a winner. Waterfront also kept its preliminary agreement with Sidewalk secret for more than seven months, fueling speculation among city officials and residents. 'Even city councilors couldn't see it. And they're used to seeing everything, especially when it comes to development proposals,' says Valverde. 'That's when I got interested.'  WHILE IT'S TEMPTING TO SEE the Quayside project as a corporate takeover of public space and functions, Waterfront's role, particularly in the scope of its RFP, cannot be diminished. Faced with a shrinking budget and a rapidly approaching deadline, the agency did everything it could to attract a corporate partner willing to invest big money. Waterfront 'basically asked a corporation to act as a government,' says Bianca Wylie, co-founder of Tech Reset Canada, a digital watchdog. Yet as Sidewalk has endeavored to become that investor qua government, its honeymoon with actual local governments has rapidly come to an end. Last year, several high-profile officials announced their resignation from Waterfront's board, citing concerns over privatization, data collection, and Waterfront's inept leadership. 'I imagined us creating a Smart City of Privacy, as opposed to a Smart City of Surveillance,' privacy consultant Ann Cavoukian wrote in her letter of resignation in October. Following the release of Sidewalk's master plan this past June, Cavoukian told[5] Canadian tech outlet BetaKit that little had changed. In August 2018, Waterfront CEO Fleissig himself resigned. That December, Fleissig's successor Michael Nobrega defended[6] Sidewalk's proposed data collection practices and committed to holding the company to high privacy standards. Nobrega also shrugged off allegations of bias in its selection process: 'We want to be crystal clear\u2014our RFP processes are competitive, fair, and follow best practices.' That sympathetic attitude evaporated quickly, however, when Sidewalk released its master plan in June, designating itself the lead developer, expanding the area it is developing to 800 acres, and demanding $1.2 billion of public funds for transit expansion. On June 24, Waterfront Toronto responded by sending Sidewalk Labs an open letter[7] outlining its concerns. Taking care to emphasize that Waterfront had had no part in creating the master plan, the agency reminded Sidewalk that, for any of this to move forward, it would need the approval of both Waterfront and the Toronto City Council. In sharp contrast to the agency's erstwhile boosterism, the letter ended on a decidedly noncommittal note: 'Whether the Quayside project proceeds or not, the conversation we are having is important for all of Toronto.' On August 2, the agency announced[8] it would extend its initial agreement with Sidewalk through March 2020 in order to work through unresolved issues and give the public more time to sift through the master plan. But that extension came with a big caveat: If these issues remain unresolved by the end of October, the project would be dead. In announcing the deadline, Waterfront officials seemed to have no problem imagining a future without Sidewalk. 'If for whatever reason [the project] was not to go ahead,' spokesperson Andrew Tumilty told[9] the Toronto Star, 'we're still committed to exploring how we can solve some of these great urban challenges that Toronto and cities around the world face.' For Valverde, the question is less what happens in Toronto and more what Quayside might mean for the future of urban governance. 'This plan is not necessarily for Toronto. There's so little in it that's actually specific to the city,' she says, adding that Toronto may have been a kind of test run. 'It's possible that the real customer is the rest of the world and other cities more desperate for investment.' Indeed, even with the Toronto plan still on the table, Sidewalk seems to be moving in that direction. On September 3, the company announced[10] a partnership with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan to form something called Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners. Apparently inspired by Sidewalk's work in Toronto, the spin-off company will help cities 'enable sustainable, distributed and intelligent urban infrastructure, creating jobs, improving mobility, and providing more environmentally friendly infrastructure solutions,' in the words of Sidewalk's CEO Dan Doctoroff. Whether such plans move forward in Toronto or anywhere else, what is clear is that the public sector is wholly unprepared for the kinds of disruptions Big Tech is preparing to unleash on urban life. Waterfront Toronto may have been uniquely vulnerable, but any public authority would be, at best, befuddled in the face of one of the largest companies on the planet, bent on reshaping how it functions. From protecting personal data to defending the democratic process, governments at all levels have struggled to respond to a sector with a habit of moving far faster than regulators. And while Big Tech firms like Google are eager to fill that vacuum of power, they seem uninterested in the types of accountability, responsiveness, and transparency that are central to democratic decision-making. If governments in Canada and the United States are unable to get out in front of the changes that Big Tech is proposing, the future of cities may begin to resemble Sidewalk's master plan: stylish, 'smart,' and with little room for the public.

The first is to try to figure out what new entrants from other industries plan to do in healthcare IT. \"I am curious about all these cross-sector and big-tech collaborations are doing now that they have jumped into healthcare,\" he says. \"What is going on with Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan? What is CVS doing? Everyone seems to think it is so easy to jump into healthcare and make a difference. I would be curious about what they are doing that is tangible, not pie in the sky. What should I be aware of to help Penn Medicine advance?\"</p><p>Restuccia also is keeping his eye out for innovations that might make it easier for clinicians to visualize the information they need from the EHR (electronic health record). \"Are there tools out there that are going to help end-users better visualize the data in our EHR in their workflow process?\" he asks. \"It would help in terms of driving optimization and value out of our EHR if they could drill down easily and see data specific to their patient.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will FHIR remain hot this year?</emphasis></p><p>At the last few HIMSS conferences, one of the hottest topics has been HL7 FHIR's potential to solve some nagging interoperability problems. But with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) starting to become a little less novel, will it still be the talk of Orlando?</p><p>\"We won't know until we get there,\" says Wayne Kubick, the nonprofit HL7's chief technology officer, \"but I think the good news is that FHIR has now become an accepted part of the ecosystem,\" and he adds that this is a pivotal moment for FHIR. Why? Because FHIR Release 4 was published at the end of 2018, and that has the first normative content. \"Then no longer can people say it is just a draft for trial use,\" he says. \"That plus the 2019 mandate to make patient-focused APIs (application programming interfaces) available from providers are two pretty big events around FHIR. Will that bring a lot of people to hear about it at HIMSS? I don't know, but I suspect that there will be FHIR in a lot of sessions in different capacities across the conference. FHIR should be part of all the other topics people are presenting on.\"</p><p>Because he used to be CTO of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC), Kubick also is keenly interested in clinical research and will be interested in hearing about mobile digital health advances at HIMSS. \"I think the whole patient engagement and digital health theme is starting to mature with the release of the Apple Health Kit,\" he says. \"That is going to open up an entire range of opportunities for things we didn't think of before. If patients engaged in clinical trials can authorize and share their data, that can help the research space quite a bit.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Innovations in applied machine learning</emphasis></p><p>Executives from the Duke Institute for Health Innovation (DIHI) presented about their work applying machine learning to population health challenges at last year's HIMSS conference in Las Vegas and were asked for their advice about panels this year.</p><p>\"My feedback was that I wanted to hear about more examples of what it actually looks like when you are implementing these things,\" says Mark Sendak, M.D., DIHI's population health and data science lead. \"There are lots of great presentations about work being done in AI and machine learning, but it is harder to find really good use cases with models developed and put to use in local settings. That is something we at Duke have focused on over the last several years. I am excited because HIMSS was very receptive to that feedback and has been very intentional in putting together a panel of organizations doing the hard work of putting infrastructure in place and a team together.\" Sendak will be moderating a panel on Monday, Feb. 11, on \"Healthcare's Innovation Challenge.\"</p><p>Suresh Balu, associate dean for innovation and partnership for the Duke School of Medicine and program director for Dail, said he also is looking forward to hearing about other examples of how machine learning and AI can help with value-based care initiatives. \"It boils down to looking at voluminous amounts of data so we can risk-stratify patients,\" he explains. \"Decisions are made at transitions of care. If you can risk-stratify patients prior to the transition point, you can make sure the care is delivered at the right time to the right person and improves outcomes.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Following interoperability policy changes</emphasis></p><p>Dan Paoletti is CEO of the nonprofit Ohio Health Information Partnership, which manages the CliniSync statewide health information exchange (HIE). His focus at HIMSS will be all things interoperability. First, he is giving a presentation about the Partnership's work titled: \"How to streamline cross-continuum data for greater usability.\" His talk will focus on the journey the Partnership has been on to make all the data available to clinicians through the HIE more user friendly at the bedside. \"We are taking the information coming in about patient, normalizing it, standardizing it and repackaging it in a chronological order and then presenting it back to clinicians in a way they can use it,\" he says.</p><p>Paoletti also is looking forward to learning more about regulatory changes that may impact his organization's stakeholders. There will be new rules around information blocking, TEFCA (the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement) and proposed changes to HIPAA to be discussed. \"We also are looking for additional information on how FHIR and blockchain are being used,\" he adds, \"and APIs are going to be important in interoperability efforts and patient access to data.\"</p><p>He and his team spend weeks carefully orchestrating their schedules for HIMSS. \"The week that I spend there saves me weeks, if not months, of travel and effort,\" he explains, \"so strategically setting up those meetings and identifying the educational sessions we want to go to is crucial. It is like a chess match. We are on the go from 6:30 in the morning until late at night. It is a pretty packed schedule.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A focus on nursing innovation</emphasis></p><p>Something new at HIMSS this year will be a \"NursePitch\" event, the result of a collaboration between the American Nurses Association (ANA) and HIMSS. The inaugural <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shark Tank</emphasis> like event will take place Wednesday, Feb. 13, with monetary, mentorship, recognition and membership prizes.</p><p>\"Nurses are natural innovators, but sometimes they don't see themselves that way,\" says Bonnie Clipper, R.N., the ANA's vice president of innovation. \"We are trying to change that lens and develop business skills in a meaningful way.\"</p><p>Nurse-led teams will pitch their business ideas and demonstrate prototypes, she says. \"You have to do a market assessment, define the problem you are going to solve, show us there is a market willing to pay for it, who the competitors are in the marketplace and why this is better or filling a niche no one else has been able to fill yet,\" she explains. \"The purpose is to cultivate this skill set in nurses.\"</p><p>The first-place prize is $10,000; second place $5,000; and third place $2,500.</p><p>What types of panel sessions will Clipper be interested in attending at HIMSS? \"In the nursing world, the more we can learn about artificial or augmented intelligence the better,\" she says. \"I think that is going to be informing the work we do about care models of the future, so that is high on my list.\"</p><p>Asked about her approach to large conferences such as HIMSS, she says: \"I am a planner. I like to know the themes I want to hit ahead of time and make sure I am in the right place to learn as much as I can.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, Michael Restuccia</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 2, Wayne Kubick</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 3, Dan Paoletti</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 4, Bonnie Clipper, R.N.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HMTECH-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HMTECH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B5-K491-JC8V-400D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">208466</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nelson Publishing, Inc.

And it costs consumers dearly.''</p><p>Digital markets, where Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have replaced oil and gas and telecom firms among the top 10 global companies based on market capitalisation in 2018, also demonstrate the trend.</p><p>''Digitalisation, in particular, has led to winner-take-all dynamics in digital markets. Economies of scale and network effects have led to single dominant firms in e-commerce, online search, online advertising and social networking.</p><p>''This has also given these firms significant control over consumer data, which confers them further market power, raising not only competition-related concerns, but also consumer protection concerns'', Kituyi said.</p><p>While these concerns are compelling competition law and policy makers to find new ways of approaching, policing and addressing the challenges, some believe a long history of competition law has equipped legislators with what they need to tackle competition issues in the digital economy.</p><p>The University of Melbourne's Prof. Caron Beaton-Wells said in her keynote address to the meeting, ''at a global level competition policy goals don't need to change \u2013 they are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in the digital economy. But the toolkit needs to be tweaked and the enforcement needs to be bolder and quicker.''</p><p>The activities of big technology companies are cause for concern for competition law and policy makers, not only because of competition and concentration issues within the technology space, but also their cannibalisation of the offline market too.</p><p>''The United States' and China's technology giants generate 90% of digital revenues. The same companies are penetrating sectors in the non-digital economy, disrupting traditional business models, in areas such as retail trade and financial services'', Beaton-Wells said.</p><p>She added that the digital economy was taking over the offline market as the new engine for the economy: ''But there are economic distress signals: increasing market concentration, declining business dynamism, slowing productivity growth, increasing mark-ups and stagnating wages.''</p><p>There is also little real competition within the industry, dominated by a handful of big companies which buy competing start-ups before they become a real threat, experts said.</p><p>The matter of regulation and enforcement is thus central, the meeting heard.</p><p>Philip Marsden, the deputy chair of the Bank of England's enforcement decision making committee said while \"big tech\" are like babies, \"they live in our house and need to live by our rules\".</p><p>''They're wonderful and life changing, but at the same time exhausting and very demanding. We have to remember that they have a mommy and a daddy. Who's that? That's us, the regulators'', he said.</p><p>''We know what the tech giants want. They want our data and they want to make money off it. Enforcers have to run faster to face digital era challenges. We officials cannot wait for the glacial evolution of the judicial precedent, we have to lead it. It is up to us to ensure Big Tech run competitively in the market race'', Marsden said.</p><p>The importance of international cooperation in combating cross-border anticompetitive practices was emphasized both governments and experts at the meeting.</p><p>Frederic Jenny, OECD competition committee chair, speaking about the rise of the digital economy, said: ''We see the development of a new way to organise the economy which raises the same competition issues in all countries simultaneously. We need stronger cooperation to face those challenges.''</p><p>An acknowledgement of the need for greater international cooperation and coordination saw the adoption of the Draft Guiding Policies and Procedures under Section F of the UN Set on Competition, of which UNCTAD is the custodian.</p><p>These will be submitted for consideration and approval to the eighth United Nations Conference to Review the UN Set of Principles and Rules on Competition in 2020.</p><p>''This is a milestone and paves the way for stronger cooperation between competitions authorities at a global level'', said Teresa Moreira, UNCTAD's head of competition and consumer policies branch.</p><p>Closing the session Beaton-Wells said: ''Competition is not a panacea designed to deal with all of the challenges presented by the technological tsunami. But, as an instrument concerned with the use of economic power, it has a vital role to play in ensuring that we all reap the benefits of the transformative changes taking place in our economies and society.''</p><p>Considering the capacity and resource constraints for competition law enforcement in developing countries, her message for developing countries was to consider regulation as a tool to ensure that digital markets work for their people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSNIG-149720535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSNIG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMB-02V1-JDJN-608W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428555</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News Chronicle.

Or, in many cases, just buying somebody else's promising idea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It's often been difficult to separate the visionaries from the delusional without the benefit of time. The Wright Brothers were crackpots until they weren't. Dick Tracy wrist radios were a long-running gag until they went on sale.</p><p> There's no doubt Facebook is a business power and a good example of disruptive technology. But only time will tell whether it has staying power or eventually slips into being a niche item for a certain generation.</p><p> Apple has amply demonstrated that in the marketplace, you're only as good as your last innovation. And with lots of capital rattling around the financial eco-system, innovation is fetching big dollars.</p><p> This brings me to some potential Vegas angles.</p><p> We've been on the verge of the drone age for a long time now without resolving the fundamental issues of noise, privacy and liability.</p><p> I was reading a piece the other day in which an analyst was suggesting venture capital is now looking beyond drone delivery.</p><p> The next big thing in high-speed delivery, these smart guys were saying, is self-driving delivery vehicles with a robot to do the heavy lifting to the doorstep.</p><p> If true \u2013 and there's usually some credibility if we follow the money \u2013 that's really bad news for Nevada.</p><p> In an instant, we can go from the center of a huge new industry to a place where geeks can fly their toys.</p><p> Unfortunately, the auto-pilot truck/robot future makes too much sense.

Self-regulation died when a drone interfered with an air tanker fighting a fire and when photos of the sunbathing neighbor showed up on the Internet.</p><p> It's way too early to write an obit for commercial drones. They've proven their worth in a wide range of industries \u2013 from policing to engineering, real estate to journalism. But the odds of a drone industry reaching the economic clout once imagined seem to be getting longer. It's scary to think we could look back at drones a decade from now and think what might have been.</p><p> But that's the way disruptive technology works. One minute your hot; the next, you're yesterday's news.</p><p> And with companies' coffers overflowing with idle cash, silly season may well be upon us.</p><p> How else can we make sense of Microsoft paying $26.2 billion for LinkedIn?</p><p> Potentially disruptive changes are all around us.</p><p> Can casino use skill-based gaming to reel in millennials?</p><p> Venture capital has flirted with the social media applications of casino games. Is it too big a leap to think a local gaming equipment manufacturer with a great idea and a need for development cash might find a backer from the world of big tech?</p><p> Of course, not all disruptive changes involve cash. Sometimes the currency is public policy.</p><p> Would state control of 'public lands' trigger an economic boom or an environmental problem? Is an elevated roadway or light rail the best way to move tourists from the airport and keep the city in the lead as a convention destination? Is a global village or a football stadium the highest and best use for the former Riviera site?</p><p> There are no easy answers at any price.

They threatened the status quo and let consumers judge the benefits for themselves. And they succeeded because the U.S. Constitution, legal and regulatory framework gave them the flexibility to compete, grow and innovate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Landmark decisions such as Sony Corporation of America vs. Universal City Studios, Inc. - commonly called the Betamax case - allowed innovators to create technology that allows the free flow of ideas and commerce. Thanks to Betamax, you can record your kids' soccer game, your best friend's wedding or your favorite television program. As long as your recording is for private and \"fair use,\" you are in the clear - no need to fear crippling copyright infringement lawsuits.</p><p>The precedent set by Betamax enabled many innovators to create the services and social and digital platforms we use every day. And the principle behind that precedent - a commitment to ingenuity and liberty - has enabled our nation to lead the globe in innovation.</p><p>Sadly, these principles and precedent are under attack - from both sides of the aisle. The Democrats' midterm party platform includes antitrust policies that appear to target our world-leading American tech firms. And at least one iconic Republican has brought similar arguments: Newt Gingrich, historically supportive of innovation and deregulation, recently compared tech platforms to a \"gigantic utility,\" and called for a crackdown on companies. More, the far-right thought leader Steve Bannon has attacked the big tech companies he views as too liberal.</p><p>This call for the government to cripple or cleave these American crown jewel companies and the suggestion that the services these companies provide be treated like utilities is the financial equivalent of suggesting we give back Alaska to the Russians.</p><p>Plus, the utility analogy just makes no sense.</p><p>First, a utility is usually a monopoly. Because of nature and huge capital investments, most utilities (think electricity, natural gas, water and sewage) are natural monopolies. By contrast, tech companies are fierce competitors with low barriers to entry. You can socialize online on a variety of platforms: Facebook, Google, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Reddit. We shouldn't confuse company success and consumers choosing great services with a natural monopoly.</p><p>Tech companies don't represent a sinister monopoly stomping on consumer choice. In fact, search engines such as Google empower consumers, providing information on varying products and companies. And small businesses can compete globally, thanks to the power of these search engines. And users always have options: You can use TripAdvisor or you can use Yelp; you can pick Instagram or you can pick Snapchat - or both. And as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things evolve, there will be even more ways to search for and share information online.</p><p>History shows that almost every well-meaning attempt to attack successful tech companies will fail or prove unnecessary. Efforts were made against IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Qualcomm - yet each of these companies reinvented themselves and the alleged monopoly was short-lived. The closest arguable success was AT&amp;T, but just a few years afterwards it came back as a nationwide provider.</p><p>Think of the fleeting successful \"monopolies\" in wireless phones: Motorola, Palm, Blackberry, Nokia and now Apple. Each dominated for a time, but the free market is harsh to those complacently relying on a cash cow for too long. And in telecom, the massive capital investment is huge.</p><p>Less so with any software-based internet service. The barriers to entry barely exist, and anyone with a better idea for nominal investment can topple the dominant company of the moment.</p><p>An American government should not crush innovators and stymie the free flow of information. China bans Google, Twitter and Facebook and increasingly restricts Apple. This is not what Americans want. We saw this with Congress' unsuccessful 2012 SOPA/PIPA legislation. When faced with the possibility of limited choice and access online, millions of consumers banded together to speak out against well-intended but ultimately unhelpful rules - showing just how deeply Americans want ingenuity and liberty.</p><p>Hurting tech companies because of their success is an unnecessary attempt on the part of the policymakers at the state and federal level to pick winners and losers rather than letting the market do its work. The European Union frequently takes this approach, adopting aggressive regulatory tactics that stifle innovation.</p><p>This is why few of the world's major tech companies hail from the EU. Other than SoundCloud and Spotify, how many can you name? The EU's hostile regulatory environment makes it nearly impossible for startups to get off the ground, forcing established companies to invest in lawyers rather than research and development and new hires.</p><p>An open and free internet is our nation's greatest strength - and it remains essential for democracy and a competitive market. America's biggest successes have come when government has chosen pro-growth policies that eliminate restrictive and unnecessary rules.</p><p>By giving innovators and entrepreneurs the freedom to succeed, develop new platforms and design new solutions, our country will prosper.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHICO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHICO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R07-S981-F02B-Y1WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279923</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chico Enterprise-Record (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 17, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC00025FU</classCode><className>UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0008CIO</classCode><className>SONY CORP OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000477</classCode><className>DEREGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009G7Z</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

Sophisticated software that can create moving and still counterfeits that are capable of enhancing, or ruining, reputations, brands or individuals is now widely available.</p><p>The emergence of such technologies will spawn hoaxes and character assassinations through doctored audio and video, which threatens to further shake the public's trust in all kinds of media and our leaders. Theoretically, a viral fake video can span the world without being corrected by its victims for hours or days.</p><p>In the United States, Rep.</p><p>Adam Schiff warned of a \"nightmarish\" scenario for the next federal election and said that social media companies must have policies in place to protect users from such manipulations by Russians and others.</p><p>Creating a fake video these days is easy. Footage is scanned, word sounds are isolated and a 3D model of the target's mouth using new words are pasted into the original video. The results are impressive and frightening, as it is creating a world in which anyone can insert false or slanderous words into anyone else's mouth using any video that's available online.</p><p>Such \"synthetic media\" already litters the internet and ranges from computer-generated deepfakes created for amusement, to images misleadingly designed to fool the public. This has been around for some time, but previous technologies largely produced poor-quality fakes. Now, software allows any user to edit the transcript of a video and manipulate everything. Words can be added, deleted or altered.</p><p>This summer, Google launched a tool to crack down on the proliferation of fake photos and videos online. If an image is disputed, Google will add a \"fact-check\" label that links to the complaint. Google has applied \"fact-check\" labels to its search results and YouTube videos for several years. Unfortunately, there is no foolproof means of fact-checking whether these images are fake or not - Google and YouTube rely on complaints.</p><p>If fakes go undetected, the damage can be immediate, destroying careers and companies before the public finds out about the misrepresentation.</p><p>This is a gigantic problem for technology companies, content providers, regulators, politicians, businesses, law enforcement and society in general. Photos and videos are ubiquitous because of the installation of hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras, the pervasive use of cellphones and the plethora of images that are posted online every day. All these can be doctored without detection.</p><p>A few American legislators say they want to start working on fixes to the problem before it's too late. Meanwhile, Pentagon researchers are working on combating malicious fakes, and social media giants like Google are staging contests to come up with software antidotes.</p><p>A fake filter, or authentication process, along with new laws must be created to protect the public, consumers and voters from such fakes.</p><p>Without such safeguards, the future looks more dangerous.</p><p>Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University, told the Brookings Institute recently that, \"In the longer run, I think it will be impossible to distinguish between the real pictures and the fake pictures.\"</p><p>Financial Post Diane Francis' next column will appear on Aug. 11. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Sophisticated software that can create moving and still counterfeits that are capable of enhancing, or ruining, reputations, brands or individuals is now widely available.</p><p>The emergence of such technologies will spawn hoaxes and character assassinations through doctored audio and video, which threatens to further shake the public's trust in all kinds of media and our leaders. Theoretically, a viral fake video can span the world without being corrected by its victims for hours or days.</p><p>In the United States, Rep.</p><p>Adam Schiff warned of a \"nightmarish\" scenario for the next federal election and said that social media companies must have policies in place to protect users from such manipulations by Russians and others.</p><p>Creating a fake video these days is easy. Footage is scanned, word sounds are isolated and a 3D model of the target's mouth using new words are pasted into the original video. The results are impressive and frightening, as it is creating a world in which anyone can insert false or slanderous words into anyone else's mouth using any video that's available online.</p><p>Such \"synthetic media\" already litters the internet and ranges from computer-generated deepfakes created for amusement, to images misleadingly designed to fool the public. This has been around for some time, but previous technologies largely produced poor-quality fakes. Now, software allows any user to edit the transcript of a video and manipulate everything. Words can be added, deleted or altered.</p><p>This summer, Google launched a tool to crack down on the proliferation of fake photos and videos online. If an image is disputed, Google will add a \"fact-check\" label that links to the complaint. Google has applied \"fact-check\" labels to its search results and YouTube videos for several years. Unfortunately, there is no foolproof means of fact-checking whether these images are fake or not - Google and YouTube rely on complaints.</p><p>If fakes go undetected, the damage can be immediate, destroying careers and companies before the public finds out about the misrepresentation.</p><p>This is a gigantic problem for technology companies, content providers, regulators, politicians, businesses, law enforcement and society in general. Photos and videos are ubiquitous because of the installation of hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras, the pervasive use of cellphones and the plethora of images that are posted online every day. All these can be doctored without detection.</p><p>A few American legislators say they want to start working on fixes to the problem before it's too late. Meanwhile, Pentagon researchers are working on combating malicious fakes, and social media giants like Google are staging contests to come up with software antidotes.</p><p>A fake filter, or authentication process, along with new laws must be created to protect the public, consumers and voters from such fakes.</p><p>Without such safeguards, the future looks more dangerous.</p><p>Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University, told the Brookings Institute recently that, \"In the longer run, I think it will be impossible to distinguish between the real pictures and the fake pictures.\"</p><p>Diane Francis' next column will appear on Aug. 11. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Some said the hearing failed to bring to light any real answers to the issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The most notable aspect of the hearing was that hostility to the big tech platforms is bipartisan,\" Doug Melamed, a Stanford University law professor with expertise in antitrust law and intellectual property, told The Epoch Times via email.</p><p>\"Antitrust law has become too narrow and too favorable to defendants,\" Melamed said, adding that he was surprised there wasn't much discussion of alleged wrongdoing by Google in connection with advertising sales.</p><p>Whether court decisions or new legislation are needed poses a complicated question, according to Melamed. One risk of enacting new laws is that it might be \"dominated by a broad populist sentiment and thus go too far toward an unwise restriction of big companies and efficient business practices,\" he said.</p><p>Chad Elder, a partner with expertise on antitrust at Bradley, a national law firm, said that while it's unclear if Congress will take any meaningful action, there does appear to be \"considerable sentiment among both liberals and conservatives that something should be done.\"</p><p>\"Representatives on both sides of the aisle remarked that this was an issue that had unusually high bipartisan support,\" Elder told The Epoch Times.</p><p>\"I think it is unlikely that companies like Amazon or Facebook would be 'broken up' entirely, in part because, despite their faults, they are so popular among their users,\" he added. \"But it is possible that certain aspects of their business could be spun off or regulated.\"</p><p>There are several actions that Congress could take. One option is new legislation to supplement or amend existing federal antitrust laws, or heightened pressure to enforce existing law to punish perceived violations, according to Elder. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see legislation regarding political censorship on social media platforms such as Facebook, though he noted that it was \"wholly apart from antitrust considerations.\"</p><p>The CEOs testified remotely via video to lawmakers. They provided data purporting to show how much competition they face and how valuable their innovation and essential services are to consumers.</p><p>But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices as well as a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy, and their relationship with China.</p><p>The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), said each platform controlled by the four companies \"is a bottleneck for a key channel of distribution.\"</p><p>\"Whether they control access to information or to a marketplace, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power,\" he said. \"They can charge exorbitant fees, impose oppressive contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.\"</p><p>Tim Derdenger, associate professor of marketing and strategy at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, told The Epoch Times that the hearing was unified in casting the four firms in a very negative light, highlighting \"the bipartisan recognition that these four firms wield excessive market power.\"</p><p>\"If I had to predict based upon this hearing, these firms will be regulated, and for Google, maybe even forced to divest or spin out its large entities such as Double Click and YouTube in order to mitigate the market power Google has with search,\" Derdenger said.</p><p>Ashley Baker, director of public policy at the Committee for Justice, meanwhile argued that antitrust \"shouldn't be weaponized to correct problems that have nothing to do with competition law.\"</p><p>\"Very little of the hearing was focused on antitrust, but was rather a mishmash of unrelated concerns about technology and tech companies,\" Baker told The Epoch Times. \"That's not to say that all of these concerns are invalid, but they are not antitrust problems.\"</p><p>In a letter for the record on the hearing, Baker and other conservative and free-market leaders argued that \"weaponizing antitrust for broader socioeconomic purposes would fundamentally alter the primary goal of antitrust, undermine the rule of law, and negatively impact consumers.\"</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2431226643</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JN-7S81-JC85-J47W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 761</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While he wished Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator's policy positions.</p><p>\"And he said, 'I assume you mean on things like tech,'\u2009\" Lambert recalled recently. \"And I said, 'Well, mainly.'\u2009\"</p><p>Their interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. The rising movement in the United States to consider charging the country's biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts. They include academics such as Lambert; lawmakers such as Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah; and groups such as the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.</p><p>These conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers. Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the last year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country.</p><p>But their power and influence have never been tested like this. The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department, and almost every state attorney general's office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley's giants. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign.</p><p>Hawley, a Republican, has helped lead efforts in Congress to rethink how government handles big tech firms. He recently told Facebook's chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company's most valuable services.</p><p>His actions have pushed Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Hawley says he does not remember.</p><p>\"This thinking is dangerous for conservatives,\" Lambert recently tweeted after Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech's critics, recently denouncing their \"snobbery and know-betterism.\"</p><p>At the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.</p><p>Some proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate and that the government just needs to enforce them.</p><p>Other proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test for monopoly cases, like factoring in the effect that a company's dominance has on workers or competitors. Still others see a solution somewhere in between.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-258f5b9e-01af-11ea-80cb-01a22c95a82d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFS-FS21-JC2G-C18C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"573\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Never happened.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, despite jitters over divided government and impeachment theatrics, corporate interests will exit year three of the Trump era largely unscathed, and some are downright giddy as they head into the potentially fraught 2020 campaign season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A year-end spending deal was especially loaded up with last-minute wins, some unexpected, for a slew of K Street operators, from medical device makers to craft brewers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's important to recognize that these big deals don't just materialize out of ether,\" said Democratic lobbyist Andy Rosenberg, a founder of Thorn Run Partners. \"Their underlying merit has been lobbied for months or longer to get them in a position to pass.\"</p><p>K Street has had to adapt to a new way of doing business, lining up support for favored measures all year long and then pressing leadership and key lawmakers and the administration in the final days.</p><p>\"True, the process has changed, and this has been a steady evolution over the past few years,\" said Rosenberg, who has clients in the health care and medical device sectors, including the Medical Device Manufacturers Association.</p><p>Mark Leahey, president and CEO of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association, had been lobbying for a decade for the permanent repeal of a tax on medical device makers that was in the 2010 health care overhaul (PL 111-148, PL 111-152); lawmakers did just that in the spending deal. Leahey called some of the early years of the effort \"lonely times,\" but said he and other groups built up overwhelming bipartisan support. \"We're thrilled,\" he said.  </p><p>Broadly speaking, K Street lobbying spending has gone up during the Trump administration, and the first three quarters of this year are roughly level -- about $2.6 billion -- as the same period last year, according to a tabulation by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Driving that spending this year were trade and health care issues plus business interests trying to shape government spending. </p><p>Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the end-of-year burst of legislative activity, culminating in a spending wrap-up (HR 1158, HR 1865) included many of the business group's priorities, such as the permanent repeal of health care and medical device taxes. The spending deal also included a seven-year reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank [Related: Spending bill has long renewal for Ex-Im Bank, terror risk insurance], another major priority of the top-spending lobbying group.  </p><p>The chamber also supports a renegotiated U.S. trade deal with Canada and Mexico that the House is expected to pass this week and is on track to move in the Senate early next year.  </p><p>\"It all goes back to good policy, and getting things done makes good politics,\" Bradley said. \"Whether you're an incumbent Republican or incumbent Democrat, being able to go back home and say, 'We actually got some good things done for the American people to keep the economy growing and paychecks rising....' I hope that's the lesson they're taking from this and it's one they can build on next year as we head into the election.\"</p><p>Despite the wins, Bradley said his group was disappointed that lawmakers and President Donald Trump couldn't cobble together a major infrastructure package or reach agreement over the status of Dreamers, a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and are now adults.</p><p>The drug industry's chief lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said it wouldn't support the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade because it did not include a provision that would have guaranteed makers of high-priced biologic medications at least a decade of market exclusivity for name-brand therapies before other manufacturers could offer cheaper copies.</p><p>Though PhRMA's year could have been worse -- it spent $22.5 million lobbying in the first three quarters of the year -- the drug lobby will again be on the hotseat in 2020 when it comes to proposals over prices.</p><p>Failure to launch</p><p>Despite high-powered K Street help and well-placed allies in the House, aerospace startups SpaceX and Blue Origin saw language they fought for stripped out of the fiscal 2020 defense authorization bill (S 1790)</p><p>The companies, whose representatives and lobbyists declined comment or did not respond to inquiries seeking comment, had pushed for wording that would have made it easier for them to compete for bids to launch national security satellites.</p><p>Another K Street flop this year was the failure to bring back earmarks, or member-directed spending, despite behind-the-scenes efforts to do so on and off Capitol Hill. \"It's fair to say we're disappointed,\" said Howard Marlowe, a longtime lobbyist who believes they'll make a return one day. \"I think they'll inch into it.\"  </p><p>AT&amp;T, which owns satellite provider DirecTV, did not get the outcome it sought in a renewal of a long-time satellite television access law. Lawmakers did not renew the law but instead tacked on to the year-end spending measures some related provisions, including one that makes permanent a requirement that \"pay TV providers,\" such as satellite companies, and broadcasters negotiate in 'good faith' during retransmission consent discussions, according to the National Association of Broadcasters.</p><p>\"Under this legislation, AT&amp;T-DirecTV will be encouraged to finally serve all satellite TV subscribers with their local TV stations,\" said NAB President Gordon Smith, a former Republican senator from Oregon, in a news release. \"The bill also ends the five-year renewal cycle of satellite TV legislation that has incentivized pay TV companies to deny carriage of broadcast TV stations during retransmission consent negotiations.\"</p><p>A spokesman for AT&amp;T referred comment to previous press statements including one in the summer from Tim McKone, the company's executive vice president of federal relations. \"Amid cord-cutting, growing video options and internet-based platforms, broadcasters use their special protections in current law to continue to demand price increases from the customers of cable and satellite distributors for TV programming that consumers watch less and less,\" the statement said.</p><p>Seeking Facebook friends</p><p>Social media and technology companies saw mixed results in Washington this year. </p><p>Sure, lawmakers targeted Facebook and others with scathing rhetoric, but most technology interests were pleased with the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal text, which offers them immunity from lawsuits over the content on their platforms [Related: Big Tech wins protections in new USMCA trade deal]. Even Facebook's whopping $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission may not be as bad as the company's policy opponents would have wanted.  </p><p>\"I would consider the Facebook settlement to be a win for Facebook,\" said David Segal, executive director of the liberal group Demand Progress. \"We were pushing for structural remedies.\" </p><p>Though it was the agency's biggest fine in history, Segal says his group does not believe it was enough and wanted to see the social media giant forced to spin off some of its holdings, such as Instagram.</p><p>Segal said that generally business interests had a good year, including regulatory rollbacks in the executive branch. Additionally, a merger between SunTrust and BB&amp;T banks won approval.</p><p>Craft brewers were pleased that they got a one-year extension on a recalibrated excise tax included in the year-end spending and tax bargain.</p><p>Tonya Saunders, a longtime lobbyist who represents the Federally Employed Women, says her client had a win in the defense bill, which included a provision to give federal employees paid family leave. \"That's been one of their top issues for many years now,\" Saunders said.</p><p>Lobbyist Stu Van Scoyoc, who runs Van Scoyoc Associates, said his firm scored client wins on some major deals but also on niche measures such as spurring movement in July on a protocol amending the tax convention with Spain, ratified by the Senate. It was a big deal for North American Stainless, a client of one of the firm's lobbyists, Shannon Campagna, Van Scoyoc said. </p><p>\"It saved the company millions of dollars,\" he said.</p><p>Source: CQ News<br/>Copyright 2019 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

And is something most users don't know about.Facebook also signed on to the 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace,'[5] an alliance of Big Tech and global governments to quash speech they find offensive.The platform worked with German chancellor Angela Merkel[6] to censor 'hateful' criticism of the migrant/refugee crisis and its impact on German society. </p><p>Facebook became so overzealous in this task that German courts had to step in to defend free speech[7]. A German man's post saying, 'Germans are getting increasingly stupid. No wonder, since the left-wing system media litters them every day with fake news about 'skilled workers,' declining unemployment figures or Trump\" had to be restored by a court order.Facebook also released an update to its leftist internal audit on June 30, announcing a taskforce[8] led by COO Sheryl Sandberg. The task force's purpose will be to 'ensure civil rights concerns raised by outside groups are escalated promptly to decision-makers so that they can be considered and acted on quickly.'

And is something most users don't know about.Facebook also signed on to the 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace,'[5] an alliance of Big Tech and global governments to quash speech they find offensive.The platform worked with German chancellor Angela Merkel[6] to censor 'hateful' criticism of the migrant/refugee crisis and its impact on German society. </p><p>Facebook became so overzealous in this task that German courts had to step in to defend free speech[7]. A German man's post saying, 'Germans are getting increasingly stupid. No wonder, since the left-wing system media litters them every day with fake news about 'skilled workers,' declining unemployment figures or Trump\" had to be restored by a court order.Facebook also released an update to its leftist internal audit on June 30, announcing a taskforce[8] led by COO Sheryl Sandberg. The task force's purpose will be to 'ensure civil rights concerns raised by outside groups are escalated promptly to decision-makers so that they can be considered and acted on quickly.'

I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Friday, July 22nd, and we are coming to you live from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Your top stories right now at 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. It is official, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>formally accepting the Republican's Party nomination for president of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Friends, delegates and fellow Americans, I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Trump rallying the crowd last night giving the longest acceptance speech in more than 40 years.</p><p>TRUMP: I have visited the laid off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not to be outdone by the excitement in Cleveland, Clinton looking to make waves ahead of the democratic convention next week, expected to name her vice presidential pick at an event in Florida today. On to the business world, a massive headache for General Motors to report, the company is recalling over 4 million vehicles. Chipotle profitable again, the result however didn't miss expectations, leaving investors hungry for growth. We'll tell you about it. Then Facebook's drone taking flight, the stunning images of its maiden voyage. Markets this morning are pointing to a higher opening once again, after snapping a nine-day trading win. Street yesterday, we are awaiting earnings once again from big names like General Electric and Honeywell, we will bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the date. In Europe this morning, markets are searching for some direction. Take a look, investors are watching manufacturing data out of the Eurozone and many of their purchasing manger's indexes were below expectations. In Asia overnight, markets were lower, led by Japan's Nikkei average big names like Nintendo in the red making Nikkei average down better than 1%. All of those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Maverick Pac National Co-chair Morgan Ortagus and former Massachusetts Senator and Trump supporter, Scott Brown. Good morning every body.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning. That's my Hillary voice. That's my \"I didn't sleep enough\" voice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a night.</p><p>MCDOWELL: As much as I was watching <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>speech, I thought <person><nameText>Peter Thiel, </nameText></person>what he did and what Ivanka Trump did, really drove home various messages.</p><p>BARTIROMO: <person><nameText>Peter Thiel, </nameText></person>I'm proud to be gay. I'm proud to be Republican, I'm proud to be an American.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The first time that's ever happened where someone went on stage and quite said, I am gay on a GOP, in front of a GOP convention audience, the first time it's ever happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was stunning and he got lots of applause for it.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Ivanka was the speech of the week for me. I mean, she is my age, we're both young, millennial women. She spoke about women, you know, earning the same as men. She spoke about young mothers and what that's like in the workforce. I think that she had warmth and grace and a message that would really attract young women. It was the speech of the week, yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And a dress from her line that's not very expensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I saw that.</p><p>BROWN: The important thing is, well, the important thing was <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>did exactly what he had to do. He needed to really not, I think, veer off too far away. There were times when he kind of looked at the crowd and was very humble, and you know, cracked a couple of jokes and I thought that really brought out some good personality. And I thought he had every single topic. My wife and family and a lot of folks around the convention center were like, whoa, okay, you know, I wish he had done that a while ago. So here we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, it was a great night. We're going to talk all about it this morning and joining us to talk about it is Texas Congressman, Louie Gohmert is with us. New York Congressman Lee Zeldin will join us. Retired United States Marine Corps General, Anthony Zinni is with us. And billionaire investor and Co-founder of Paul Mitchell, John Pual De Joria. Also with us Comedian Joe Piscopo, you don't want to miss a moment with them, so if you stay with us as we kick it off right now with top story. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>accepting the Republican nomination last night with a historic address to the crowd. Blake Berman is live in the Quicken Loans Arena right now with all the highlights, Blake.</p><p>BERMAN: Hi there Maria, good morning to you. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>really did not reinvent the wheel last night as far as it relates to the issues that he's talked about over the last 400 days of his campaign, trade, immigration, security. However, he certainly hit the gas pedal as it relates to focusing on Hillary Clinton and that'll be his focus from now until November. One issue that definitely stood out here last night was the issue of security, especially in light of the recent shootings here all across the country in the last couple of weeks. Trump started off his speech by saying beginning January 20th, 2017, quoting here, he says, safety will be restored. Trump was introduced last night by his daughter Ivanka and then an hour and 15 minutes later, the longest convention speech in some four-plus decades, Trump made this vow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Friends, delegates and fellow Americans, I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: Coming back out here live from the Quicken Loans Arena, you can see the party is quite literally over here this morning, construction crews taking things down. They got to get everything out of here. Now, the attention turns over to Philadelphia where it is quite a different scene this morning as the preparations there are underway now. The Democrats will have their turn, Hillary Clinton will be in the spotlight and many will be keeping an eye on today, possibly tomorrow as to who she will select as her vice presidential running mate. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right Blake, thank you so much. Blake Berman with the latest there, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>savoring the moment he officially became the Republican nominee for president, his speech clocking in at about 75 minutes as you heard, the longest national party convention acceptance speech since 1972. I want to bring in the Fox News contributors, Mercedes Schlapp, a Republican strategist and Julie Roginsky, a Democratic strategist. Ladies, it's good to see you both. Mercedes, it's good to talk with you, your reaction to all these since last night and the speech.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, I got to tell you Maria, it was incredibly, just there was so much energy in that room, I think the delegates responded so well. And I was texting with folks back at home, individuals who kept saying he's doing a great job. And why he was focused on the working class message, I think was incredibly important for him to be able to address the workers. And one of my favorite lines was when he goes after big business, when he goes after the elite media and basically saying Hillary is with them. I'm not with them, I'm your champion. And I think that message really resonate across America. I think the biggest challenge is going to be in terms of whether he's able to attract again the women and the minorities which I think Ivanka did a great job. Sometimes I wish I would have both of them on to stage at the same time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great point. I wonder if Ivanka's performance will move the needle in terms of the female voter. I want to talk about that this morning. But Julie, what's your take? What grade would you give Trump last night?</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: You know, I give him a C minus and I'll explain why. He did what he had to do for the B because certainly, it gave him the red meat as they demanded, but he didn't really move the needle much with anybody else. Look, if you are scared to death and you think Hillary Clinton in the anti-Christ, you're already voting for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>You need to expand that out to people who are on the fence and dependents, potentially the Democrats that he was trying to get would appeal to Bernie Sanders' voters. But it was such a dystopian dark speech, people called it the midnight in America's speech. And it really was, that it didn't do much for people who were hoping for some solutions for him and hoping for something positive. Ivanka gave the speech last night that he should have given. They should have just flipped scripts. She was fantastic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>ROGINSKY: She had a bright speech. She appealed to the better angels in our country. She did not, and I feel like he kind of stepped on the sorry that she was trying to tell that time.</p><p>BROWN: Maria, with respect to Julie, a C minus I think that's really ridiculous. He gave a fantastic speech and did exactly what he needed to do. And if you would just look at the focus groups after the fact, a lot of those folks in those focus groups are not voting for Hillary at all, and a lot of them actually are coming over to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>He showed humility and he showed humor and I thought he laid a very matter-of-factly, the differences between him and Hillary and also the things that he wants to tackle on his first hundred days in office. So I thought it was one of the better speeches in my family by the way who were not going to vote for him, were kind of on the fence at this point. They're all in now. So that's a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah I want to -- Well actually C minus is hard. What would you give him Mercedes?</p><p>SCHLAPP: I gave him a B and the reason why it's above average is the fact that it was a very long speech. So I think you'll lose a lot of the folks going through. And I think the strongest points were at the end. I think he was very strong when he -- he softened his tongue when he spoke about his parents.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>SCHLAPP: He was -- when he was able to connect in terms of saying, you know, it's about Hillary, it's about I'm with her. But I am with you. That is such a strong and powerful message.</p><p>And I think what he tried to do was talk about the dreary picture of the State of America and then he moved to the positive where we need to be going moving forward. I wish I could have seen more of that just one in the beginning of the speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That has been the big issue from critics. That it was a dire speech. I didn't see it that way. But --</p><p>BROWN: The crowd didn't see it that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the crowd --</p><p>ROGINSKY: And the people at home didn't see it that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, but the crowd --</p><p>ROGINSKY: What I thought was really --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yeah. I was going to say, the crowd with all due respect are already with him. And that's my whole point. Senator, with all due respect, you're already with him. So, you're not the message -- you're not person to whom the message needs to appeal. Who it needs to appeal to are --</p><p>BROWN: I should go home then I guess Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Are the people that needs to appeal to, or the people that are watching from home. And consistently, what I saw was this very dark, dystopian vision of America, which I think most people don't share. We believe that we're a great country. We don't believe that we're going off a cliff despite what he does -- he has to say.</p><p>It's a speech that Vladimir Putin, that Vladimir Putin could have given about this country. It's not a speech that somebody who loves and cares about this country and thinks it's great, needs to get and that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the talking points from the critical.</p><p>BROWN: I love you, Julie.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . Democratic sides certainly more you know.</p><p>ORTAGUS: But Julie, what did you think about the fact that -- I was struck when we mentioned this earlier about <person><nameText>Peter Thiel </nameText></person>getting up and saying you know that, \"I'm gay. I'm Republican. I'm American\". And also both Ivanka and Mr. Trump referenced LGBTQ and getting it right at 6 a.m. in the morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Referenced those rights. So we've never heard that on the Republican stage before. So, someone who attended the Big Tent Brunch this week, I was really excited to hear that coming from the stage. Do you think that maybe that applied to millennial voters at all?</p><p>ROGINSKY: I love it.</p><p>ORTAGUS: And independents.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Yeah, listen. I love it. I think it's about high time that we have both parties in this country join in supporting the LGBT community and opportunities for them. Yeah, to the extent that you reconcile it with the Republican platform that was passed earlier last week which essentially was probably the most regressive in terms of LGBT issues in the history of the party. It consistently spoke out against everything that <person><nameText>Peter Thiel </nameText></person>was talking about that even that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was talking about.</p><p>So you've got these two strains in the party that need to be reconciled. But to the extent that millions of people were watching <person><nameText>Peter Thiel </nameText></person>and Ivanka Trump and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>appeared to our better angels and the part of the LGBT community, I think it was a very, very positive step in such a difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Morgan, from 2004 when -- if you remember a lot of what the Republican Party did to win that race was run against gay marriage in places like Ohio, it's very refreshing to see 12 years later how much the party has verbally shifted on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, we certainly know where Trump is, much more to the middle than all the way on the right. Mercedes, good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, Julie again it would be always a pleasure.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Thanks very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks everybody. We will see you soon.</p><p>Coming up next, Cleveland police declaring a safe end to the convention, with a surprisingly few numbers of arrest, more on the efforts to keep convention attendees safe. That's next.</p><p>And then the government spending billions to subsidize your junk food, guilty pleasures. The shocking numbers straight ahead. Back in a minute live from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Cleveland Police reporting relatively few arrests at the Republican National Convention this week.</p><p>With Cheryl Casone at our New York Headquarters with the headlines and more. Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEW CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>Well, after all the concerns about violence in a week of protests, there have only been about 23 arrests. But Cleveland's Police Chief says, still that is too many. There were concerns that the city would see an extreme amount of protest and arrest following the recent shootings across the country. Thousands of police officers were deployed to keep everyone safe in Cleveland. Looks like they have succeeded.</p><p>Well, in business headlines this morning, stock to watch, General Motors. The company may have to recall millions of more vehicles because of defective Takata airbags. GMs says federal regulators may force them to recall 4.3 million more vehicles and additional cost of $550 million.</p><p>In May, GM recalled almost 2 million vehicles because of the airbag problem and expanded the recall to another 600,000 in the month of June.</p><p>And finally this, despite the Government's healthy food initiatives, the federal Government apparently has been heavily subsidizing the fast food industry.</p><p>The New York Times reports from 1995 to 2010 the Government spent -- get this, $170 billion in agricultural subsidies to produce ingredients that make chunk food cheaper. This is as report from the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention shows that only a small fraction of federal subsidies actually support fresh produce production.</p><p>By the way, Maria, Congress renews the farm bill every five years. They may want to take a closer look at this particular part of their spending bill. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, not over yet. All right, Cheryl. Thank you. Coming up next, customers still passing on Chipotle's Burritos, details on the company's struggle to convince customers to move past that e-coli outbreak.</p><p>And then Facebook taking flight, the social media giant's internet beaming drone making its maiden voyage more on the company's plan to bring internet to remote parts of the world. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, markets are looking higher today. Take a look. Dow Jones Industry leverage up, that's 30 points right now in terms of futures, looking at a pretty good open. Markets are digesting mixed second quarter results this week. That certainly has been the driver. Chipotle, for one, reporting disappointing second quarter numbers after the bell last night. It is still struggling to regain its footing following the food safety concerns. Joining us right now, Rhino Trading Partners Chief Strategist Michael Block in New York. Michael, good to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS, LLC: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how would you characterize the earning season so far?</p><p>BLOCK: You know, earning season, you know, we'll talk about Chipotle last night, but really, expectations were really low, Maria. The bar was really low and, you know, coming into it last night, you had something of over three quarters of the companies that reported, surpassed the expectations. Those expectations were a lot lower. Take a company like Goldman Sachs, everyone was excited that they beat analyst estimates for their second quarter. However, those numbers have been lower substantially where they had come from. It was really inline numbers, and not a question as what's good, what's bad. The point is, the bar was low they were exceeding it. Now, in the case of Chipotle, they weren't really exceeding it and I think that's something that's interesting here in terms of looking at that company, but looking at the U.S. consumer as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah and that's an individual story. But you know, as always, digging it's always the guidance. So, what are we hearing from companies about the rest of the year? Has that been better than expected?</p><p>MCDOWELL: In some instances and I'm curios what Michael thinks about because again, your winners have been in technology to a certain extent. But what about these sectors that look very expensive at this point and I think technology would be one of them, right, Mike?</p><p>BLOCK: Yeah, technology that, you know, again, it comes down to it's always a tale of two cities, who is winning and who is losing, and what are the expectations here? Take the other night, a great example of what I'm talking about. You had Intel and Qualcomm reporting. There was a lot of excitement going into Intel. People were excited about this growth in the server business, the cloud business, if you will. And maybe they fell a little bit short of expectations in the stock as accordingly as compared to Qualcomm where there's concerns about mobile growth, lo and behold. The bar was low, they vaulted over it, the stock traded better. Last night you had --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, I sure did. It was up 8 percent that was the best, right?</p><p>BLOCK: Yeah, look at that, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that helped the NASDAQ, NASDAQ hit a record high yesterday following a week of record highs for the other two major indices. So, like you said, it really is technology and that's why you had the NASDAQ doing so well yesterday.</p><p>BLOCK: Yeah, well, as that no -- so you know, biotech has got a nice, little, stealthy run. It gets left for dead and then it walks back because people, growth investors, need to find a growth somewhere. Where did they find it? They're not finding it in industrials. They're not finding it in utilities. They're going to find it in areas like biotech. So, that's where the opportunity's big.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I still think that there are no story which broke last year's, scared a lot of people out of biotechnology companies.</p><p>BLOCK: Sure, it's a big boy game. You have to really know what you're doing. You can quietly enter duty stocks but, you know, for the talented bottoms up biotech experts, there's a lot of opportunity out there. Now, last night, we had Chipotle but we also had Star Bucks not doing so well, and we also had Capital One which is the bank, but it's a proxy play on the U.S. consumer, not doing as well there. What does that all mean? We've had advanced retail sales numbers looking better, some U.S. economic data looking better, but what are those companies telling us? Star Bucks can't get over a relatively high bar. What does that tell us? Capital One, what does that tell us? Next week we are going to have Apple, we're going to have Amazon, and Alphabet, A.K.A. Google, some very big tech names. Now, if tech has been the driver, can that continue?</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you want to do before that? As an investor, what are you going to do ahead of Apple, Google and these big tech names?</p><p>BLOCK: Again, everything has its time and price. If expectation is going to Apple a little guarded, maybe that tells you that the -- you know, that everyone's leading the wrong way and that the bar is lower. They can give some good color in upcoming products, they can give color on margins. Maybe that's all the stock needs. And Apple is also very well known for sandbagging their guidance and I think that's built into expectations as well. Google, everyone is excited about the ad platform. Everyone is so, you know, worried about at -- But then there's some worry about regulation, the European commission cracking down on them, can they get expectations there? As for Amazon, I hear over and over again, this is a thousand dollar stock, everyone loves it, they dominate retail. That's a high bar to get over and that valuation matters in that company but, you know, I've heard a lot of bullish arguments there. So that number better be good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is Amazon going to -- is anybody going to look at valuation on Amazon? I mean, that has been the story in retail to buy, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Anytime anybody says valuation isn't important, then it will suddenly become important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And regardless of whatever metric you use to value it.</p><p>BLOCK: Yeah, and that's what it comes down to with. I can make the argument that that be carved out the cloud business. We're going to do businesses separately. People have said, hey, that business is cheap. I've actually heard that argument. We don't have time to get into it here, but suffice to say, that's the mentality out there. So it tells you about expectations from the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Jeff Bezos keeps knocking to cover up the ball, Michael, good to see you my friend. We'll see you back in New York. Michael Block there.</p><p>BLOCK: All right. OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ahead, the Democratic National Convention has not even started but the speaker list is already sparking outrage from police. We will tell you why. Stay with us on that and then <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>officially expecting the Presidential nomination with the message of law and order. We will get Congressman Gohmert's highlights from last night, coming up. Back in a minute.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, once again, here is Maria BARTIROMO.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. I am Maria Bartiromo. It is Friday, July 22nd. We are coming to you live from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p>First though your top stories at 6:30 a.m. on the east coast, it is official, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>formally accepting the Republican Party's nomination for president of the United States last night. The acceptance the end of a big night that included a speech from Trump's daughter, Ivanka.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP'S </nameText></person>DAUGHTER: Come January 2017 all things will be possible again, we can hope and dream and sink big again. No one has more faith in the American people in my father. He will be your greatest, truest, and most loyal champion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not to be outdone by the excitement in Cleveland Hillary Clinton looking to make waves ahead of the Democratic convention next week. She is expected to name her vice presidential pick today at an event in Florida.</p><p>Plus a Russian warplane reportedly bombing a secret U.S. military base in Syria. The latest on the escalating global tensions.</p><p>The future of crime-fighting, why police in Michigan are turning to 3D printing to solve a case.</p><p>Pandora reportedly tunes out a takeover bid, the decision that is weighing on stock ahead of the open this morning.</p><p>Plus Facebook's drone taking flight, the stunning images of its maiden voyage.</p><p>Markets this morning indicating a higher opening. Futures are looking good after snapping a nine-day trading win streak yesterday.</p><p>We are waiting earnings from big names like General Electric and Honeywell. They may very well set the tone next week, big week for tech.</p><p>In Europe, markets are searching for direction this morning. Investors are watching manufacturing data out of the Eurozone. The purchasing manager's index coming in slightly above expectations but not enough to move market, though. DAX index in Germany down a fraction. The FT 100 up about 20 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower led by Japan's Nikkei average, which was down over 1 percent.</p><p>With the Republican National Convention wrapping up, it is now the Democrats turn, Philadelphia gearing up for the Democratic National Convention next week.</p><p>That is where we find, Fox News' Doug McKelway. Doug, good morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS: Good morning, Maria. How are you doing? I think this is your first live shot out of the city of Philadelphia. So glad to be kicking things off here.</p><p>They are in the final stages of preparation. Things are going fast and furiously around here as they put the finishing touches on the Wells Fargo Center. In fact, they are going to be unveiling the arena and the floor inside the arena within the next 15 minutes or so.</p><p>So we will be rushing over as a live shot is done. I got a sneak peek of it last night, no cameras allowed. It's an impressive site indeed.</p><p>Philadelphia, the city itself also in the last stages of preparation as they expect a number of demonstrators, many of which will be occurring in FDR Park, which is a block to my right. Things could get a little bit tense here as they did at the Republican convention.</p><p>Manhole covers have been sealed shut, extra surveillance cameras and chemical detectors have been put in place and all trucks over 5 tons have been prohibited from using Interstate 95 in close proximity of the Wells Fargo Center.</p><p>In fact, all traffic will be blocked off in the immediate vicinity of the Wells Fargo Center. The convention itself offers -- promises to offer as stark a contrast to the Republican convention as anything we have seen in generations.</p><p>And one clue to that is a tweet that Hillary Clinton sent out last night just after midnight after <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>had completed his speech. Her tweet said and I quote, \"I am with you @realdonaldtrump. Not included women, African-Americans, LGBT people, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants.\"</p><p>So the battle lines are drawn, Maria. Another indication of how stark those battle lines are now is a group of people who will be speaking here on Tuesday night. This is a group that's known as the Mothers of the Movement.</p><p>It includes the mother of Eric Garner, the mother of Trayvon Martin and the mother of Michael Brown, the young African-American who was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, which helped to set off so much of the tension, which exists in this country.</p><p>Recall that the major theme in <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>speech last night was law and order. We are going to be hearing a very, very stark contrast to that at the Democratic convention here at the Wells Fargo Center. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Doug, thanks so much. We'll check in as news develops there. Joining us right now is Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. Are you expecting Hillary to announce her VP pick today and who do you think?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS: The truth is I don't really care. It just doesn't matter. She is going to be at the top ticket and that I think the vice president in her case really is irrelevant.</p><p>In Trump's case it made a difference. He is a big risk taker, which always helps for foreign policy. When \"Saturday Night Live (inaudible) where is the red button? That was great because your enemies need to think you are unpredictable and that is why Trump will make a terrific president when it comes to foreign affairs.</p><p>But with Hillary Clinton, I mean, come on. It just doesn't matter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I think that's right. I mean, people are voting. When they vote, they are going to vote for Hillary Clinton if they want -- they are not going to vote for her VP pick whereas Trump's pick for the VP was much more important. Isn't that right, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT BROWN, FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR: Absolutely. The stability he offers -- with Pence he brought in the constitutional conservatives. He actually bridged the gap between leadership being a former congressman and knowing his way and the ability to pass legislation and that executive experience as a governor.</p><p>Let me ask you something, Congressman, so obviously Ted and what he said the night before, how is that affecting your delegation -- I mean, I've heard from many Texans, who were saying, you know what, he shouldn't have done it. We are really one party.</p><p>It's really not about Ted or Kasich. It's about the party and the direction of our country. What are your thoughts?</p><p>GOHMERT: I have gotten a lot of mixed readings from so many of the Texans about backing Texas, getting messages, and from people up here, but a lot of people were disappointed. Brian Kilmead (ph) was just giving me a hard time.</p><p>I told him before the speech, Ted is so intelligent, this is going to be very well thought out and bring us together. It was interesting. But you know something else, Scott, I've heard from people who are devout Christians going wow, Trump comes out looking like he is the forgiving one. That is not exactly what some Christians were hoping for.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Looking back at the last week, are people going to -- because Trump still has to worry about getting 90 percent of Republican voters and he has been somewhere in kind of the mid to high 70 percent range at least in some of the recent polls.</p><p>Will people look back at the last week, will they remember the Melania Trump snafu or will they remember Ted Cruz or are they going to remember last night?</p><p>GOHMERT: The Melania Trump snafu, I don't talk to anybody who even thinks about the Melania Trump snafu. There is no way they'll remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL: My mother brought it up on the phone, what the heck happened there?</p><p>GOHMERT: People that read the \"Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times,\" they really spend a lot of time on it.</p><p>BROWN: And if you want to talk about speeches, let's talk about the 21 million Hillary got the fact that she has not released any of the transcripts from her speeches with Wall Street because with respect, those speeches that she's probably doing the wink, wink, nod, nod. Hey, listen, you guys give me all your money and I'll take care of you when I get elected.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But to my point that Trump still coming into this week had to worry about winning over some Republicans who are still on the sidelines.</p><p>GOHMERT: But to think Trump had going for him is all about comparison. And Maria, I know that's why you had me on the show. You need to look at Trump, the bar he had to clear, McCain, Romney, he was glowing last night in comparison.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Romney got no bump after his convention in 2012.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Trump is getting a bump, right? I mean, this is helping.</p><p>GOHMERT: Who was he talking to? Unlike the Democratic convention, they are going to be talking to all of those that they are giving benefits. Trump was talking to all the people across America, the middle-class that are paying the way for everybody else, that made it a really strong speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, the DNC released the list of speakers, and now we know that Hillary has invited the families of those lost African-Americans, but she didn't invite the families of the police who were shot --</p><p>GOHMERT: Are you telling me that Hillary is going to have 2,000 parents from Chicago whose kids were shot on the street?</p><p>MCDOWELL: She has some of the families are on the speaker list.</p><p>GOHMERT: You are talking about all those that have been killing each other on the streets of Chicago. Those are the true victims. Those are the black lives matter that people aren't talking about, on the streets of Chicago, the streets of Washington, D.C, where there is so much gun control and yet you have 2,000 people shot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it going to look like she is politicizing this?</p><p>BROWN: Of course, she politicizes everything, that is Democratic playbook 101 is to divide and conquer, us versus them, the \"have\" and the \"have not,\" 99 percent, 1 percent, they divide so they keep everybody fighting and pick them off one by one.</p><p>You will see such a contrast of what we saw here and I think the Occupy Wall Street and moveon.org and Black Lives Matter, they are not happy with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders selling out to the queen of Wall Street and there will be hell to pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about Trump's speech because it was so anticipated at the convention. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>accepting the nomination obviously and laying out his plans for Trump administration. Listen to this, want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have a message for all of you, the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, I mean, very soon, come to an end. Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored. Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone, but my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did the message resonate? What do you think, Congressman?</p><p>GOHMERT: I think he resonated loud and clear. The sensitivity to what is really bothering Americans was born out, who talked about the TSA needing fixed? Americans traveling are so sick of the TSA and the way he plugs that in is on Middle America's radar but Hillary won't notice that.</p><p>He has a private plane and yet he still knows what is really bothering people these days. One thing you won't hear from Republicans after Hillary brings victims' families, you won't hear unlike Hillary you won't hear Republicans say what difference at this point does it make because people are very sensitive on the Republican side to the violence except we don't want to pander, we want to fix the problem. I love hearing that from <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you know, it's interesting, the party -- they don't necessarily like each other. I mean, a lot of people are holding their nose saying I will get in line. Republicans can't do that. They don't just fake it.</p><p>GOHMERT: That's true. That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's not good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You saw that in the blues on Wednesday nights. One criticism of the speech last night, 75 minutes is too long. When you go past 11:00 at night that is a problem. A commute and a speech should never be longer than 60 minutes.</p><p>GOHMERT: Well, except he may have messed up in looking to build Clinton for the proper length of the speech. Hillary will have -- the built her husband, didn't have.</p><p>I was asking the clerk, who retired a few years ago, what is the most memorable thing that happened during in your time? And he said it was Bill Clinton's state of the union address where the teleprompter didn't work and he got a number of applause lines because he was winging it.</p><p>And he turned around, and I asked Stephanopoulos, he said this is absolutely true, he said he turned around to Al Gore, facing Al Gore, Stephanopoulos is on the wing, and he said they got the wrong speech on the teleprompter.</p><p>And turned back smiling, and Stephanopoulos runs out, gets them to punch out the cd and it turned out they had the year before state of the union. They spent much of the speech --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is an episode --</p><p>GOHMERT: That was Bill Clinton. Hillary can't do that.</p><p>BROWN: It's not Bill Clinton's party anymore, Maria, sorry to jump on you. It's not Bill Clinton's party anymore or JFK's -- so it's so true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Louie Gohmert, good to see you. Thank you so much, sir. Great to have you. Appreciate it very much. We'll take a short break.</p><p>Then criminals could prove to be no match for scientists. Straight ahead, how a lab in Michigan is using 3D printing to help police catch a murderer.</p><p>Starbucks customers become disloyal after changes to its loyalty program, breaking its 25 quarter growth streak. More on that coming up next. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Russian fighter jets targeting a Syrian outpost used by the U.S. military. Cheryl Casone with the story and the headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria. Good morning. Well, alert sirens went off at the Pentagon last month after U.S. officials say the base near the Jordanian border, which is used by American and British Special Forces with hit by missile fire.</p><p>Turns out the outpost was bombed by Russian warplanes. After the first strike, the U.S. military reached out to the Russian air campaign headquarters in Syria saying the base should not be attacked, but Russian jets hit it again about 90 minutes later. Four Syrian rebel troops were killed in those airstrikes, we should say. British troops had just left the base one day before.</p><p>Here at home police in Michigan are working with a 3D printing lab to try and catch a killer. The lab is working to, get this, recreate the fingers of a murder victim.</p><p>With those prints they hope to unlock the victim's iPhone, which might include clues to who killed him. The lab is using a set of fingerprints from the victim that were taken during an unrelated prior arrest. Technicians at the lab hope to use the 3D fingers to bypass the biometric lock that is on the dead man's iPhone.</p><p>And finally this, Facebook's drone has completed its first test flight in Arizona. The solar powered drone which a wingspan of a Boeing 737 lifted off the runway at a military installation in Arizona yesterday.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg was there on site to witness it. The drone was airborne for about 90 minutes, more than three times longer than Facebook, and you can see Mr. Zuckerberg celebrating the victory for his company.</p><p>You know what, Maria, this is interesting. Facebook plans to use the drone to deliver faster internet service to billions of people that who don't have it. Think, Maria, about other continents in particular like Africa. But again, Mark Zuckerberg, big celebration in Arizona for him yesterday with that drone. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. We're going to take a short break. We will be right back with highlights from this week's special coverage of the Republican National Convention. Stay with us live from Cleveland this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It has been an incredible week for our show here in Cleveland. We want to show of the highlights from our great guests this week. Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP OF SHOW'S HIGHLIGHTS OF THE WEEK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Before we take a quick break, I want to get to Cheryl in New York with this week's ETF report. Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. S&amp;P 500 sectors ending the week mixed and technology leading driven by solid earnings from eBay up 13 percent and Qualcomm up 9 percent. Energy, the biggest drag, supply concerns sent oil sliding almost 3 percent for the week. So Maria, obviously it has been a decent week for our markets. That is it for MORNINGS WITH MARIA from New York. We are going back to Cleveland after a short break. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2016072201cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K98-9VY1-JB20-G0SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>July 22, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002KBZ</classCode><className>NINTENDO CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, July 22nd, and we are coming to you live from the  Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.  Your top stories right  now at 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is official, Donald Trump formally  accepting the Republican's Party nomination for president of the United  States. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Friends, delegates and fellow  Americans, I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the  presidency of the United States. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Trump rallying the crowd last night giving the longest  acceptance speech in more than 40 years. </p><p>TRUMP:  I have visited the laid off factory workers and the communities  crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.  These are the forgotten  men and women of our country.  And they are forgotten, but they're not  going to be forgotten long.  These are people who work hard but no longer  have a voice.  I am your voice. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to be outdone by the excitement in Cleveland, Clinton  looking to make waves ahead of the democratic convention next week,  expected to name her vice presidential pick at an event in Florida today.   On to the business world, a massive headache for General Motors to report,  the company is recalling over 4 million vehicles.  Chipotle profitable  again, the result however didn't miss expectations, leaving investors  hungry for growth.  We'll tell you about it.  Then Facebook's drone taking  flight, the stunning images of its maiden voyage.  Markets this morning are  pointing to a higher opening once again, after snapping a nine-day trading  win.  Street yesterday, we are awaiting earnings once again from big names  like General Electric and Honeywell, we will bring you those numbers as  soon as they hit the date.  In Europe this morning, markets are searching  for some direction.  Take a look, investors are watching manufacturing data  out of the Eurozone and many of their purchasing manger's indexes were  below expectations.  In Asia overnight, markets were lower, led by Japan's  Nikkei average big names like Nintendo in the red making Nikkei average  down better than 1%.  All of those stories coming up this morning and  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Maverick Pac National Co-chair Morgan Ortagus and former Massachusetts  Senator and Trump supporter, Scott Brown.  Good morning every body.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  That's my Hillary voice.  That's my \"I didn't  sleep enough\" voice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a night.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As much as I was watching Donald Trump's speech, I thought Peter  Thiel, what he did and what Ivanka Trump did, really drove home various  messages. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Thiel, I'm proud to be gay.  I'm proud to be Republican,  I'm proud to be an American. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The first time that's ever happened where someone went on stage  and quite said, I am gay on a GOP, in front of a GOP convention audience,  the first time it's ever happened. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was stunning and he got lots of applause for it.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Ivanka was the speech of the week for me.  I mean, she is my age,  we're both young, millennial women.  She spoke about women, you know,  earning the same as men.  She spoke about young mothers and what that's  like in the workforce.  I think that she had warmth and grace and a message  that would really attract young women.  It was the speech of the week,  yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a dress from her line that's not very expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I saw that.</p><p>BROWN:  The important thing is, well, the important thing was Donald Trump  did exactly what he had to do.  He needed to really not, I think, veer off  too far away.  There were times when he kind of looked at the crowd and was  very humble, and you know, cracked a couple of jokes and I thought that  really brought out some good personality.  And I thought he had every  single topic.  My wife and family and a lot of folks around the convention  center were like, whoa, okay, you know, I wish he had done that a while  ago.  So here we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, it was a great night.  We're going to talk all about it  this morning and joining us to talk about it is Texas Congressman, Louie  Gohmert is with us.  New York Congressman Lee Zeldin will join us.  Retired  United States Marine Corps General, Anthony Zinni is with us.  And  billionaire investor and Co-founder of Paul Mitchell, John Pual De Joria.   Also with us Comedian Joe Piscopo, you don't want to miss a moment with  them, so if you stay with us as we kick it off right now with top story.   Donald Trump accepting the Republican nomination last night with a historic  address to the crowd.  Blake Berman is live in the Quicken Loans Arena  right now with all the highlights, Blake. </p><p>BERMAN:  Hi there Maria, good morning to you.  Donald Trump really did not  reinvent the wheel last night as far as it relates to the issues that he's  talked about over the last 400 days of his campaign, trade, immigration,  security.  However, he certainly hit the gas pedal as it relates to  focusing on Hillary Clinton and that'll be his focus from now until  November.  One issue that definitely stood out here last night was the  issue of security, especially in light of the recent shootings here all  across the country in the last couple of weeks.  Trump started off his  speech by saying beginning January 20th, 2017, quoting here, he says,  safety will be restored.  Trump was introduced last night by his daughter  Ivanka and then an hour and 15 minutes later, the longest convention speech  in some four-plus decades, Trump made this vow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Friends, delegates and fellow Americans, I humbly and gratefully  accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.  To all  Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make  this promise.  We will make America strong again.  We will make America  proud again.  We will make America safe again.  And we will make America  great again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  Coming back out here live from the Quicken Loans Arena, you can  see the party is quite literally over here this morning, construction crews  taking things down.  They got to get everything out of here.  Now, the  attention turns over to Philadelphia where it is quite a different scene  this morning as the preparations there are underway now.  The Democrats  will have their turn, Hillary Clinton will be in the spotlight and many  will be keeping an eye on today, possibly tomorrow as to who she will  select as her vice presidential running mate.  Maria, back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Berman with the  latest there, Donald Trump savoring the moment he officially became the  Republican nominee for president, his speech clocking in at about 75  minutes as you heard, the longest national party convention acceptance  speech since 1972.  I want to bring in the Fox News contributors, Mercedes  Schlapp, a Republican strategist and Julie Roginsky, a Democratic  strategist.  Ladies, it's good to see you both.  Mercedes, it's good to  talk with you, your reaction to all these since last night and the speech.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, I got to tell you Maria, it  was incredibly, just there was so much energy in that room, I think the  delegates responded so well.  And I was texting with folks back at home,  individuals who kept saying he's doing a great job.  And why he was focused  on the working class message, I think was incredibly important for him to  be able to address the workers.  And one of my favorite lines was when he  goes after big business, when he goes after the elite media and basically  saying Hillary is with them.  I'm not with them, I'm your champion.  And I  think that message really resonate across America.  I think the biggest  challenge is going to be in terms of whether he's able to attract again the  women and the minorities which I think Ivanka did a great job. Sometimes I  wish I would have both of them on to stage at the same time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  I wonder if Ivanka's performance will  move the needle in terms of the female voter.  I want to talk about that  this morning.  But Julie, what's your take?  What grade would you give  Trump last night? </p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You know, I give him a C minus and  I'll explain why.  He did what he had to do for the B because certainly, it  gave him the red meat as they demanded, but he didn't really move the  needle much with anybody else.  Look, if you are scared to death and you  think Hillary Clinton in the anti-Christ, you're already voting for Donald  Trump.  You need to expand that out to people who are on the fence and  dependents, potentially the Democrats that he was trying to get would  appeal to Bernie Sanders' voters.  But it was such a dystopian dark speech,  people called it the midnight in America's speech.  And it really was, that  it didn't do much for people who were hoping for some solutions for him and  hoping for something positive.  Ivanka gave the speech last night that he  should have given.  They should have just flipped scripts.  She was  fantastic. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. </p><p>ROGINSKY:  She had a bright speech.  She appealed to the better angels in  our country.  She did not, and I feel like he kind of stepped on the sorry  that she was trying to tell that time.</p><p>BROWN:  Maria, with respect to Julie, a C minus I think that's really  ridiculous.  He gave a fantastic speech and did exactly what he needed to  do.  And if you would just look at the focus groups after the fact, a lot  of those folks in those focus groups are not voting for Hillary at all, and  a lot of them actually are coming over to Donald Trump.  He showed humility  and he showed humor and I thought he laid a very matter-of-factly, the  differences between him and Hillary and also the things that he wants to  tackle on his first hundred days in office.  So I thought it was one of the  better speeches in my family by the way who were not going to vote for him,  were kind of on the fence at this point.  They're all in now.  So that's a  good thing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah I want to -- Well actually C minus is hard.  What would  you give him Mercedes?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I gave him a B and the reason why it's above average is the fact  that it was a very long speech.  So I think you'll lose a lot of the folks  going through.  And I think the strongest points were at the end.  I think  he was very strong when he -- he softened his tongue when he spoke about  his parents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  He was -- when he was able to connect in terms of saying, you  know, it's about Hillary, it's about I'm with her.  But I am with you.   That is such a strong and powerful message.</p><p>And I think what he tried to do was talk about the dreary picture of the  State of America and then he moved to the positive where we need to be  going moving forward.  I wish I could have seen more of that just one in  the beginning of the speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That has been the big issue from critics.  That it was a  dire speech.  I didn't see it that way.  But --</p><p>BROWN:  The crowd didn't see it that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the crowd --</p><p>ROGINSKY:  And the people at home didn't see it that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, but the crowd -- </p><p>ROGINSKY:  What I thought was really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yeah.  I was going to say, the crowd with all due respect are  already with him.  And that's my whole point.  Senator, with all due  respect, you're already with him.   So, you're not the message -- you're  not person to whom the message needs to appeal.  Who it needs to appeal to  are -- </p><p>BROWN:  I should go home then I guess Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Are the people that needs to appeal to, or the people that are  watching from home.  And consistently, what I saw was this very dark,  dystopian vision of America, which I think most people don't share.  We  believe that we're a great country.  We don't believe that we're going off  a cliff despite what he does -- he has to say.</p><p>It's a speech that Vladimir Putin, that Vladimir Putin could have given  about this country.  It's not a speech that somebody who loves and cares  about this country and thinks it's great, needs to get and that's the  problem. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the talking points from the critical.</p><p>BROWN:  I love you, Julie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  . Democratic sides certainly more you know.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  But Julie, what did you think about the fact that -- I was struck  when we mentioned this earlier about Peter Thiel getting up and saying you  know that, \"I'm gay.  I'm Republican.  I'm American\".  And also both Ivanka  and Mr. Trump referenced LGBTQ and getting it right at 6 a.m. in the  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Referenced those rights.  So we've never heard that on the  Republican stage before.  So, someone who attended the Big Tent Brunch this  week, I was really excited to hear that coming from the stage.  Do you  think that maybe that applied to millennial voters at all?</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I love it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And independents.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Yeah, listen.  I love it.  I think it's about high time that we  have both parties in this country join in supporting the LGBT community and  opportunities for them.  Yeah, to the extent that you reconcile it with the  Republican platform that was passed earlier last week which essentially was  probably the most regressive in terms of LGBT issues in the history of the  party.  It consistently spoke out against everything that Peter Thiel was  talking about that even that Donald Trump was talking about.</p><p>So you've got these two strains in the party that need to be reconciled.   But to the extent that millions of people were watching Peter Thiel and  Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump appeared to our better angels and the part of  the LGBT community, I think it was a very, very positive step in such a  difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Morgan, from 2004 when -- if you remember a lot of what the  Republican Party did to win that race was run against gay marriage in  places like Ohio, it's very refreshing to see 12 years later how much the  party has verbally shifted on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, we certainly know where Trump is, much more to the middle  than all the way on the right.  Mercedes, good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, Julie again it would be always a pleasure.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Thanks very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks everybody.  We will see you soon.</p><p>Coming up next, Cleveland police declaring a safe end to the convention,  with a surprisingly few numbers of arrest, more on the efforts to keep  convention attendees safe.  That's next.</p><p>And then the government spending billions to subsidize your junk food,  guilty pleasures.  The shocking numbers straight ahead.  Back in a minute  live from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, Cleveland Police reporting relatively few arrests  at the Republican National Convention this week.</p><p>With Cheryl Casone at our New York Headquarters with the headlines and  more.  Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEW CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>Well, after all the concerns about violence in a week of protests, there  have only been about 23 arrests.  But Cleveland's Police Chief says, still  that is too many.  There were concerns that the city would see an extreme  amount of protest and arrest following the recent shootings across the  country.  Thousands of police officers were deployed to keep everyone safe  in Cleveland.  Looks like they have succeeded.</p><p>Well, in business headlines this morning, stock to watch, General Motors.   The company may have to recall millions of more vehicles because of  defective Takata airbags.  GMs says federal regulators may force them to  recall 4.3 million more vehicles and additional cost of $550 million.</p><p>In May, GM recalled almost 2 million vehicles because of the airbag problem  and expanded the recall to another 600,000 in the month of June.</p><p>And finally this, despite the Government's healthy food initiatives, the  federal Government apparently has been heavily subsidizing the fast food  industry.</p><p>The New York Times reports from 1995 to 2010 the Government spent -- get  this, $170 billion in agricultural subsidies to produce ingredients that  make chunk food cheaper.  This is as report from the Centers for Disease  and Control Prevention shows that only a small fraction of federal  subsidies actually support fresh produce production.</p><p>By the way, Maria, Congress renews the farm bill every five years.  They  may want to take a closer look at this particular part of their spending  bill.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, not over yet.  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Coming up  next, customers still passing on Chipotle's Burritos, details on the  company's struggle to convince customers to move past that e-coli outbreak.</p><p>And then Facebook taking flight, the social media giant's internet beaming  drone making its maiden voyage more on the company's plan to bring internet  to remote parts of the world.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, markets are looking higher today.  Take a look.   Dow Jones Industry leverage up, that's 30 points right now in terms of  futures, looking at a pretty good open.  Markets are digesting mixed second  quarter results this week.  That certainly has been the driver.  Chipotle,  for one, reporting disappointing second quarter numbers after the bell last  night.  It is still struggling to regain its footing following the food  safety concerns.  Joining us right now, Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist Michael Block in New York.  Michael, good to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS, LLC:  Great to see  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the earning season so far? </p><p>BLOCK:  You know, earning season, you know, we'll talk about Chipotle last  night, but really, expectations were really low, Maria.  The bar was really  low and, you know, coming into it last night, you had something of over  three quarters of the companies that reported, surpassed the expectations.   Those expectations were a lot lower.  Take a company like Goldman Sachs,  everyone was excited that they beat analyst estimates for their second  quarter.  However, those numbers have been lower substantially where they  had come from.  It was really inline numbers, and not a question as what's  good, what's bad.  The point is, the bar was low they were exceeding it.   Now, in the case of Chipotle, they weren't really exceeding it and I think  that's something that's interesting here in terms of looking at that  company, but looking at the U.S. consumer as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah and that's an individual story.  But you know, as always,  digging it's always the guidance.  So, what are we hearing from companies  about the rest of the year?  Has that been better than expected?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In some instances and I'm curios what Michael thinks about  because again, your winners have been in technology to a certain extent.   But what about these sectors that look very expensive at this point and I  think technology would be one of them, right, Mike? </p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, technology that, you know, again, it comes down to it's  always a tale of two cities, who is winning and who is losing, and what are  the expectations here?  Take the other night, a great example of what I'm  talking about.  You had Intel and Qualcomm reporting.  There was a lot of  excitement going into Intel.  People were excited about this growth in the  server business, the cloud business, if you will.  And maybe they fell a  little bit short of expectations in the stock as accordingly as compared to  Qualcomm where there's concerns about mobile growth, lo and behold.  The  bar was low, they vaulted over it, the stock traded better.  Last night you  had -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I sure did. It was up 8 percent that was the best, right?</p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, look at that, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that helped the NASDAQ, NASDAQ hit a record high yesterday  following a week of record highs for the other two major indices.  So, like  you said, it really is technology and that's why you had the NASDAQ doing  so well yesterday. </p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, well, as that no -- so you know, biotech has got a nice,  little, stealthy run.  It gets left for dead and then it walks back because  people, growth investors, need to find a growth somewhere.  Where did they  find it?  They're not finding it in industrials.  They're not finding it in  utilities.  They're going to find it in areas like biotech.  So, that's  where the opportunity's big.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I still think that there are no story which broke last year's,  scared a lot of people out of biotechnology companies. </p><p>BLOCK:  Sure, it's a big boy game.  You have to really know what you're  doing.  You can quietly enter duty stocks but, you know, for the talented  bottoms up biotech experts, there's a lot of opportunity out there.  Now,  last night, we had Chipotle but we also had Star Bucks not doing so well,  and we also had Capital One which is the bank, but it's a proxy play on the  U.S. consumer, not doing as well there.  What does that all mean?  We've  had advanced retail sales numbers looking better, some U.S. economic data  looking better, but what are those companies telling us?  Star Bucks can't  get over a relatively high bar.  What does that tell us?  Capital One, what  does that tell us?  Next week we are going to have Apple, we're going to  have Amazon, and Alphabet, A.K.A. Google, some very big tech names.  Now,  if tech has been the driver, can that continue?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to do before that?  As an investor, what are  you going to do ahead of Apple, Google and these big tech names? </p><p>BLOCK:  Again, everything has its time and price.  If expectation is going  to Apple a little guarded, maybe that tells you that the -- you know, that  everyone's leading the wrong way and that the bar is lower.  They can give  some good color in upcoming products, they can give color on margins.   Maybe that's all the stock needs.  And Apple is also very well known for  sandbagging their guidance and I think that's built into expectations as  well.  Google, everyone is excited about the ad platform.  Everyone is so,  you know, worried about at -- But then there's some worry about regulation,  the European commission cracking down on them, can they get expectations  there?  As for Amazon, I hear over and over again, this is a thousand  dollar stock, everyone loves it, they dominate retail.  That's a high bar  to get over and that valuation matters in that company but, you know, I've  heard a lot of bullish arguments there.  So that number better be good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is Amazon going to -- is anybody going to look at valuation on  Amazon?  I mean, that has been the story in retail to buy, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anytime anybody says valuation isn't important, then it will  suddenly become important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And regardless of whatever metric you use to value it.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yeah, and that's what it comes down to with.  I can make the  argument that that be carved out the cloud business.  We're going to do  businesses separately.  People have said, hey, that business is cheap.   I've actually heard that argument.  We don't have time to get into it here,  but suffice to say, that's the mentality out there.  So it tells you about  expectations from the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.  Jeff Bezos keeps knocking to cover up the ball,  Michael, good to see you my friend.  We'll see you back in New York.   Michael Block there.</p><p>BLOCK:  All right.  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ahead, the Democratic National Convention has not even started  but the speaker list is already sparking outrage from police.  We will tell  you why.  Stay with us on that and then Donald Trump officially expecting  the Presidential nomination with the message of law and order.  We will get  Congressman Gohmert's highlights from last night, coming up.  Back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Live from the Republican National Convention in  Cleveland, Ohio, once again, here is Maria BARTIROMO.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  I am Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Friday, July 22nd.  We are coming to you live from the  Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p>First though your top stories at 6:30 a.m. on the east coast, it is  official, Donald Trump formally accepting the Republican Party's nomination  for president of the United States last night.  The acceptance the end of a  big night that included a speech from Trump's daughter, Ivanka.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER:  Come January 2017 all things will  be possible again, we can hope and dream and sink big again.  No one has  more faith in the American people in my father.  He will be your greatest,  truest, and most loyal champion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not to be outdone by the excitement in Cleveland Hillary  Clinton looking to make waves ahead of the Democratic convention next week.   She is expected to name her vice presidential pick today at an event in  Florida.</p><p>Plus a Russian warplane reportedly bombing a secret U.S. military base in  Syria.  The latest on the escalating global tensions.</p><p>The future of crime-fighting, why police in Michigan are turning to 3D  printing to solve a case.</p><p>Pandora reportedly tunes out a takeover bid, the decision that is weighing  on stock ahead of the open this morning.</p><p>Plus Facebook's drone taking flight, the stunning images of its maiden  voyage.</p><p>Markets this morning indicating a higher opening.  Futures are looking good  after snapping a nine-day trading win streak yesterday.</p><p>We are waiting earnings from big names like General Electric and Honeywell.   They may very well set the tone next week, big week for tech.</p><p>In Europe, markets are searching for direction this morning.  Investors are  watching manufacturing data out of the Eurozone.  The purchasing manager's  index coming in slightly above expectations but not enough to move market,  though.  DAX index in Germany down a fraction.  The FT 100 up about 20  points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower led by Japan's Nikkei average, which  was down over 1 percent.</p><p>With the Republican National Convention wrapping up, it is now the  Democrats turn, Philadelphia gearing up for the Democratic National  Convention next week.</p><p>That is where we find, Fox News' Doug McKelway.  Doug, good morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS:  Good morning, Maria.  How are you doing?  I think  this is your first live shot out of the city of Philadelphia.  So glad to  be kicking things off here.</p><p>They are in the final stages of preparation.  Things are going fast and  furiously around here as they put the finishing touches on the Wells Fargo  Center.  In fact, they are going to be unveiling the arena and the floor  inside the arena within the next 15 minutes or so.</p><p>So we will be rushing over as a live shot is done.  I got a sneak peek of  it last night, no cameras allowed.  It's an impressive site indeed.</p><p>Philadelphia, the city itself also in the last stages of preparation as  they expect a number of demonstrators, many of which will be occurring in  FDR Park, which is a block to my right.  Things could get a little bit  tense here as they did at the Republican convention.</p><p>Manhole covers have been sealed shut, extra surveillance cameras and  chemical detectors have been put in place and all trucks over 5 tons have  been prohibited from using Interstate 95 in close proximity of the Wells  Fargo Center.</p><p>In fact, all traffic will be blocked off in the immediate vicinity of the  Wells Fargo Center.  The convention itself offers -- promises to offer as  stark a contrast to the Republican convention as anything we have seen in  generations.</p><p>And one clue to that is a tweet that Hillary Clinton sent out last night  just after midnight after Donald Trump had completed his speech.  Her tweet  said and I quote, \"I am with you @realdonaldtrump.  Not included women,  African-Americans, LGBT people, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants.\"</p><p>So the battle lines are drawn, Maria.  Another indication of how stark  those battle lines are now is a group of people who will be speaking here  on Tuesday night.  This is a group that's known as the Mothers of the  Movement.</p><p>It includes the mother of Eric Garner, the mother of Trayvon Martin and the  mother of Michael Brown, the young African-American who was shot by a  police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, which helped to set off so much of  the tension, which exists in this country.</p><p>Recall that the major theme in Donald Trump's speech last night was law and  order.  We are going to be hearing a very, very stark contrast to that at  the Democratic convention here at the Wells Fargo Center.  Back to you,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug, thanks so much.  We'll check in as news  develops there.  Joining us right now is Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert.   Congressman, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  Are you  expecting Hillary to announce her VP pick today and who do you think?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  The truth is I don't really care.   It just doesn't matter.  She is going to be at the top ticket and that I  think the vice president in her case really is irrelevant.</p><p>In Trump's case it made a difference.  He is a big risk taker, which always  helps for foreign policy.  When \"Saturday Night Live (inaudible) where is  the red button?  That was great because your enemies need to think you are  unpredictable and that is why Trump will make a terrific president when it  comes to foreign affairs.</p><p>But with Hillary Clinton, I mean, come on.  It just doesn't matter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think that's right.  I mean, people are voting.  When  they vote, they are going to vote for Hillary Clinton if they want -- they  are not going to vote for her VP pick whereas Trump's pick for the VP was  much more important.  Isn't that right, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT BROWN, FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR:  Absolutely.  The stability he  offers -- with Pence he brought in the constitutional conservatives.  He  actually bridged the gap between leadership being a former congressman and  knowing his way and the ability to pass legislation and that executive  experience as a governor.</p><p>Let me ask you something, Congressman, so obviously Ted and what he said  the night before, how is that affecting your delegation -- I mean, I've  heard from many Texans, who were saying, you know what, he shouldn't have  done it.  We are really one party.</p><p>It's really not about Ted or Kasich.  It's about the party and the  direction of our country.  What are your thoughts?</p><p>GOHMERT:  I have gotten a lot of mixed readings from so many of the Texans  about backing Texas, getting messages, and from people up here, but a lot  of people were disappointed.  Brian Kilmead (ph) was just giving me a hard  time.</p><p>I told him before the speech, Ted is so intelligent, this is going to be  very well thought out and bring us together.  It was interesting.  But you  know something else, Scott, I've heard from people who are devout  Christians going wow, Trump comes out looking like he is the forgiving one.   That is not exactly what some Christians were hoping for.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Looking back at the last week, are people  going to -- because Trump still has to worry about getting 90 percent of  Republican voters and he has been somewhere in kind of the mid to high 70  percent range at least in some of the recent polls.</p><p>Will people look back at the last week, will they remember the Melania  Trump snafu or will they remember Ted Cruz or are they going to remember  last night?</p><p>GOHMERT:  The Melania Trump snafu, I don't talk to anybody who even thinks  about the Melania Trump snafu.  There is no way they'll remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My mother brought it up on the phone, what the heck happened  there?</p><p>GOHMERT:  People that read the \"Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times,\"  they really spend a lot of time on it.</p><p>BROWN:  And if you want to talk about speeches, let's talk about the 21  million Hillary got the fact that she has not released any of the  transcripts from her speeches with Wall Street because with respect, those  speeches that she's probably doing the wink, wink, nod, nod.  Hey, listen,  you guys give me all your money and I'll take care of you when I get  elected.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to my point that Trump still coming into this week had to  worry about winning over some Republicans who are still on the sidelines.</p><p>GOHMERT:  But to think Trump had going for him is all about comparison.   And Maria, I know that's why you had me on the show.  You need to look at  Trump, the bar he had to clear, McCain, Romney, he was glowing last night  in comparison.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Romney got no bump after his convention in 2012.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Trump is getting a bump, right?  I mean, this is helping.</p><p>GOHMERT:  Who was he talking to?  Unlike the Democratic convention, they  are going to be talking to all of those that they are giving benefits.   Trump was talking to all the people across America, the middle-class that  are paying the way for everybody else, that made it a really strong speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, the DNC released the list of speakers, and now we know  that Hillary has invited the families of those lost African-Americans, but  she didn't invite the families of the police who were shot -- </p><p>GOHMERT:  Are you telling me that Hillary is going to have 2,000 parents  from Chicago whose kids were shot on the street?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She has some of the families are on the speaker list.</p><p>GOHMERT:  You are talking about all those that have been killing each other  on the streets of Chicago.  Those are the true victims.  Those are the  black lives matter that people aren't talking about, on the streets of  Chicago, the streets of Washington, D.C, where there is so much gun control  and yet you have 2,000 people shot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to look like she is politicizing this?</p><p>BROWN:  Of course, she politicizes everything, that is Democratic playbook  101 is to divide and conquer, us versus them, the \"have\" and the \"have  not,\" 99 percent, 1 percent, they divide so they keep everybody fighting  and pick them off one by one.</p><p>You will see such a contrast of what we saw here and I think the Occupy  Wall Street and moveon.org and Black Lives Matter, they are not happy with  Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders selling out to the queen of Wall Street  and there will be hell to pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about Trump's speech because it was so anticipated  at the convention.  Donald Trump accepting the nomination obviously and  laying out his plans for Trump administration.  Listen to this, want to get  your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I have a message for all of you,  the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, I mean,  very soon, come to an end.  Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will  be restored.  Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of  the United States are enforced.  We are going to be considerate and  compassionate to everyone, but my greatest compassion will be for our own  struggling citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did the message resonate?  What do you think, Congressman?</p><p>GOHMERT:  I think he resonated loud and clear.  The sensitivity to what is  really bothering Americans was born out, who talked about the TSA needing  fixed?  Americans traveling are so sick of the TSA and the way he plugs  that in is on Middle America's radar but Hillary won't notice that.</p><p>He has a private plane and yet he still knows what is really bothering  people these days.  One thing you won't hear from Republicans after Hillary  brings victims' families, you won't hear unlike Hillary you won't hear  Republicans say what difference at this point does it make because people  are very sensitive on the Republican side to the violence except we don't  want to pander, we want to fix the problem.  I love hearing that from  Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you know, it's interesting, the party -- they don't  necessarily like each other.  I mean, a lot of people are holding their  nose saying I will get in line.  Republicans can't do that.  They don't  just fake it.</p><p>GOHMERT:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You saw that in the blues on Wednesday nights.  One criticism of  the speech last night, 75 minutes is too long.  When you go past 11:00 at  night that is a problem.  A commute and a speech should never be longer  than 60 minutes.</p><p>GOHMERT:  Well, except he may have messed up in looking to build Clinton  for the proper length of the speech.  Hillary will have -- the built her  husband, didn't have.</p><p>I was asking the clerk, who retired a few years ago, what is the most  memorable thing that happened during in your time?  And he said it was Bill  Clinton's state of the union address where the teleprompter didn't work and  he got a number of applause lines because he was winging it.</p><p>And he turned around, and I asked Stephanopoulos, he said this is  absolutely true, he said he turned around to Al Gore, facing Al Gore,  Stephanopoulos is on the wing, and he said they got the wrong speech on the  teleprompter.</p><p>And turned back smiling, and Stephanopoulos runs out, gets them to punch  out the cd and it turned out they had the year before state of the union.   They spent much of the speech -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is an episode -- </p><p>GOHMERT:  That was Bill Clinton.  Hillary can't do that.</p><p>BROWN:  It's not Bill Clinton's party anymore, Maria, sorry to jump on you.   It's not Bill Clinton's party anymore or JFK's -- so it's so true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Louie Gohmert, good to see you.  Thank you so much,  sir.  Great to have you.  Appreciate it very much.  We'll take a short  break.</p><p>Then criminals could prove to be no match for scientists.  Straight ahead,  how a lab in Michigan is using 3D printing to help police catch a murderer.</p><p>Starbucks customers become disloyal after changes to its loyalty program,  breaking its 25 quarter growth streak.  More on that coming up next.  Back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Russian fighter jets targeting a Syrian outpost  used by the U.S. military.  Cheryl Casone with the story and the headlines  now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  That's right, Maria.  Good morning.  Well,  alert sirens went off at the Pentagon last month after U.S. officials say  the base near the Jordanian border, which is used by American and British  Special Forces with hit by missile fire.</p><p>Turns out the outpost was bombed by Russian warplanes.  After the first  strike, the U.S. military reached out to the Russian air campaign  headquarters in Syria saying the base should not be attacked, but Russian  jets hit it again about 90 minutes later.  Four Syrian rebel troops were  killed in those airstrikes, we should say.  British troops had just left  the base one day before.</p><p>Here at home police in Michigan are working with a 3D printing lab to try  and catch a killer.  The lab is working to, get this, recreate the fingers  of a murder victim.</p><p>With those prints they hope to unlock the victim's iPhone, which might  include clues to who killed him.  The lab is using a set of fingerprints  from the victim that were taken during an unrelated prior arrest.   Technicians at the lab hope to use the 3D fingers to bypass the biometric  lock that is on the dead man's iPhone.</p><p>And finally this, Facebook's drone has completed its first test flight in  Arizona.  The solar powered drone which a wingspan of a Boeing 737 lifted  off the runway at a military installation in Arizona yesterday.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg was there on site to witness it.  The drone was airborne  for about 90 minutes, more than three times longer than Facebook, and you  can see Mr. Zuckerberg celebrating the victory for his company.</p><p>You know what, Maria, this is interesting.  Facebook plans to use the drone  to deliver faster internet service to billions of people that who don't  have it.  Think, Maria, about other continents in particular like Africa.   But again, Mark Zuckerberg, big celebration in Arizona for him yesterday  with that drone.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  We're going to take a short  break.  We will be right back with highlights from this week's special  coverage of the Republican National Convention.  Stay with us live from  Cleveland this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It has been an incredible week for our show here  in Cleveland.  We want to show of the highlights from our great guests this  week.  Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP OF SHOW'S HIGHLIGHTS OF THE WEEK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we take a quick break, I want to get to Cheryl in New  York with this week's ETF report.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  S&amp;P 500 sectors ending the week mixed and technology  leading driven by solid earnings from eBay up 13 percent and Qualcomm up 9  percent.  Energy, the biggest drag, supply concerns sent oil sliding almost  3 percent for the week.  So Maria, obviously it has been a decent week for  our markets.  That is it for MORNINGS WITH MARIA from New York.  We are  going back to Cleveland after a short break.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

The rapid advancement of digitalization is behind many of the trends, profoundly challenging our personal and societal assumptions. The relationship between humans and technology is switching, with humans increasingly augmenting the decisions of artificial intelligence, rather than the other way around. For example, in the next decade there will be a greater proliferation of autonomous vehicles, whilst energy production and transmission will increasingly become the domain of algorithms rather than people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The next ten years will also be defined as an era of precision, particularly in healthcare, food, and materials science. Agriculture and aquaculture will look toward robotics in combination with IoT-based and machine learning technologies to optimize crops and seafood at reduced cost. Additionally, increasingly precise sensor data will help the food industry meet expectations from consumers for insight into the entire value chain for individual products.</p><p>Traditional business models will be disrupted. Space, which was once reserved for state players, will continue to be transformed by private enterprises, who are driving down costs, for example through reusable launchers, enabled by advances in computing and manufacturing. The scope of Big Tech will widen as data becomes an increasingly important commodity, putting it toe-to-toe (and sometimes in partnership) with Big Pharma, for example.</p><p>Remi Eriksen, Group President and CEO of DNV GL, said, \"In an era where unicorns and mega-tech companies already seemingly appear overnight, what does the next decade hold for us? That technology development is accelerating is a given, but its digitalized, non-linear trajectory and global scale is hard for individuals to comprehend. DNV GL's Technology Outlook 2030 is focusing on five technology trends that are transformative in key industries: transport and logistics, energy, health care, and food. The industry that is possibly seeing the biggest change in the coming decade is health care. The human body is being analysed and described at levels of detail never previously possible and the rate of growth in data over the next five years is faster than in any other industry. Precision medicine and personalized treatments could vastly reduce nations' cost of health care and improve the health of patients, who should also have control over their data.\"</p><p>As digital technologies transform multiple industries, the risk picture is changing. Current assurance methods focus on physical and business process risks, but there is an urgent need for industries to properly identify, understand and manage emerging digital risks.</p><p>Underperforming sensors, communication and algorithms, unintentionally (cyber safety) or deliberately manipulated (cyber security), are the principal sources of the new risks. In addition, there is the increasing complexity of software systems, multiplied in uncertainty by machine learning and AI-based systems.</p><p>The digital transformation also opens new trust gaps in industries like food, health and manufacturing, in which a previously entirely physical-based business is augmented and eventually replaced by a digital business. Data on food nutrients and allergens, data on patients' health conditions, and data on products to be additively manufactured need to be verified and secured.</p><p>Despite holding the potential to deliver a 'technological bliss', the Technology Outlook 2030 says that the next decade is in danger of being characterized by missed opportunities, particularly our inability to address climate change and inequality. However, the keys are in ours hands to prevent negative outcomes, and with the correct regulatory framework, technology can greatly help to address humanity's fundamental challenges.</p><p>* * *</p><p>About the Technology Outlook 2030</p><p>The Technology Outlook 2030 features ten technology trends, 54 technologies that matter, 21 impact investigations across five global industries. An extensive exploration of the most likely technology developments over the next ten years can be expected of a technology-centric company like DNV GL.</p><p>Download images here.

The relationship between humans and technology is switching, with humans increasingly augmenting the decisions of artificial intelligence, rather than the other way around. For example, in the next decade there will be a greater proliferation of autonomous vehicles, whilst energy production and transmission will increasingly become the domain of algorithms rather than people.</p><p><br/><br/>The next ten years will also be defined as an era of precision, particularly in healthcare, food, and materials science. Agriculture and aquaculture will look toward robotics in combination with IoT-based and machine learning technologies to optimize crops and seafood at reduced cost. Additionally, increasingly precise sensor data will help the food industry meet expectations from consumers for insight into the entire value chain for individual products.<br/><br/>Traditional business models will be disrupted. Space, which was once reserved for state players, will continue to be transformed by private enterprises, who are driving down costs, for example through reusable launchers, enabled by advances in computing and manufacturing. The scope of Big Tech will widen as data becomes an increasingly important commodity, putting it toe-to-toe (and sometimes in partnership) with Big Pharma, for example.<br/><br/>Remi Eriksen, Group President and CEO of DNV GL, said, 'In an era where unicorns and mega-tech companies already seemingly appear overnight, what does the next decade hold for us That technology development is accelerating is a given, but its digitalized, non-linear trajectory and global scale is hard for individuals to comprehend. DNV GL's Technology Outlook 2030 is focusing on five technology trends that are transformative in key industries: transport and logistics, energy, health care, and food. The industry that is possibly seeing the biggest change in the coming decade is health care. The human body is being analysed and described at levels of detail never previously possible and the rate of growth in data over the next five years is faster than in any other industry. Precision medicine and personalized treatments could vastly reduce nations' cost of health care and improve the health of patients, who should also have control over their data.'<br/><br/>As digital technologies transform multiple industries, the risk picture is changing. Current assurance methods focus on physical and business process risks, but there is an urgent need for industries to properly identify, understand and manage emerging digital risks.<br/><br/>Underperforming sensors, communication and algorithms, unintentionally (cyber safety) or deliberately manipulated (cyber security), are the principal sources of the new risks. In addition, there is the increasing complexity of software systems, multiplied in uncertainty by machine learning and AI-based systems.<br/><br/>The digital transformation also opens new trust gaps in industries like food, health and manufacturing, in which a previously entirely physical-based business is augmented and eventually replaced by a digital business. Data on food nutrients and allergens, data on patients' health conditions, and data on products to be additively manufactured need to be verified and secured.<br/><br/>Despite holding the potential to deliver a 'technological bliss', the Technology Outlook 2030 says that the next decade is in danger of being characterized by missed opportunities, particularly our inability to address climate change and inequality. However, the keys are in ours hands to prevent negative outcomes, and with the correct regulatory framework, technology can greatly help to address humanity's fundamental challenges.<br/><br/>About the Technology Outlook 2030<br/><br/>The Technology Outlook 2030 features ten technology trends, 54 technologies that matter, 21 impact investigations across five global industries. An extensive exploration of the most likely technology developments over the next ten years can be expected of a technology-centric company like DNV GL.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Per Wiggo Richardsen<br/>Tel: +47 907 77 829<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN4-SKM1-JD3Y-Y177-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 3, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Consumers, policymakers, and other authorities have increasingly speculated that big tech companies are accumulating too much power.  Intuitively, this seems like it could be the case. Big tech companies have grown from mere startups[1] to mind-boggling sizes, especially in the past several years. </p><p>Apple was the first company to reach a market cap of $1 trillion, with tech companies Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) not far behind it. Collectively, these four powerhouses control the manufacture and distribution of countless devices and software applications\u2014and if you add in social media companies like Facebook and Twitter, the collective power wielded by a handful of organizations gets even more astounding.  But why do we care about how much 'power' that tech companies have, and what do we mean by 'power' in the first place? And if the excessive accumulation of power truly is a problem, what can we do about it? The Nature of Too Much PowerThe first goal is determining what it means for a big tech company to have too much power. It's easy to see the amount of revenue generated by a business and believe it's too big or too powerful, but if it doesn't influence the state of the world or your personal life, what does it matter?  These are some of the most important categories we need to consider:  Limiting competition. One of the most nefarious uses of excessive power is limiting the abilities and influence of competitors. This was a major problem during the 19th Century; wealthy entrepreneurs would intentionally cut prices lower than competitors could stand to offer, bully competitors out of the market, and forcefully set up a monopoly where no other businesses could enter. For example, Facebook has a history of purchasing smaller companies it believes could be a threat to its primary business model; it purchased Instagram before it could become big enough to become a threat, and frequently seeks to acquire other social media startups before they generate influence of their own. Controlling the narrative. Many tech companies are responsible for helping us discover content, learn new things, and engage with others. Accordingly, their algorithms and inner workings have the potential to control the public narrative; Google will only lead us to websites[2] that fit certain criteria, and Twitter will only show us the tweets it deems most relevant. It's trivially easy for any of these algorithms to be tweaked in a way that fits some ulterior motive. For example, an engineer could lead people to negative or positive information about a certain politician, or (perhaps inadvertently) give more attention to conspiracy theories or 'fake news.' This can have a massive impact on public sentiment, and in some cases, influence major political decisions. Restricting privacy. It's no secret that big tech companies love to gather and use consumer data. While in most cases, data is used for innocuous purposes, like generating custom advertising based on your expressed interests, we also need to be wary about the restriction of consumer privacy. If tech companies are tracking everything you do online (and everything you say in person, thanks to smart speakers), you won't have much privacy to exercise. Influence. With power comes money; the founders and CEOs of big tech companies are typically multi-billionaires, and the companies themselves have access to virtually unlimited funds. With this power and money, it's only natural that nefarious people within these companies could use this power to influence politicians\u2014and exercise even greater control over the machinations of the world at large. Exploitation. There are many ways in which a big tech company of sufficient power could use that power for exploitative purposes. They could use unfair pricing to squeeze more revenue out of unsuspecting consumers. They could attempt to get users addicted to their technology. They could even exploit their employees, forcing them to work in unfair conditions or face dismissal. Self-promotion. As tech companies expand to offer wider ranges of products and services, they often use their existing platforms for self-promotion. For example, Google can intentionally rank its own products higher in search engines, reducing the potential appearances of competing products. This drives a self-perpetuating cycle of increased influence.How Did This Happen? So how did we get here? Why is this such a problem?  In the United States, there's been no shortage of problems with companies getting too big or too powerful. For example, robber barons and other industrialists in the 19th Century used unscrupulous business practices to build monopolies until they were forcibly broken up with antitrust movements. So why haven't these laws and lessons learned prevented tech companies from getting too big? New territory. Many areas of technological development are new, and therefore hard to regulate. For example, artificial intelligence (AI)[3] is just emerging, and it's hard to tell how it's going to be used or how it's going to improve over the next few decades. Accordingly, it's hard to create sensible laws for how it can be wielded.  Slow legislation. Legislation is a tedious and slow process. It often takes years for federal lawmakers to move, even on important topics. Limited consumer awareness. While big tech companies have become a conversational focal point in recent years, there's still limited consumer awareness on just how powerful these companies are and how far they reach. With limited consumer awareness, there's limited demand for change. Mergers and acquisitions. If you can't do it yourself, get someone else to do it[4]. Tech companies increasingly turn to mergers and acquisitions as a way to consolidate power[5], increase their own influence, and limit competition all in one fell swoop. Getting customers hooked. Many tech companies intentionally try to get consumers 'hooked' on their products and their products alone. Addictive features, compatibility restrictions, and other elements make it incredibly hard for customers to switch to a competitor.  How big is too big? We also need to acknowledge that it's difficult to tell how big is 'too big.' Some issues are the natural byproduct of tech development and good business decisions; at what point do we really need to step in with a solution? The Potential Solutions If tech companies are in fact too big, or if they're going to get too big at some point in the future, what can we do about it? What steps can we take to limit their power and ensure we remain in good economic and cultural balance? These are just a few ideas:  Transparency laws. We can start by making consumers better informed. Clearer disclosures and better transparency from tech companies could go a long way to improving this situation and keeping customers aware of how they're being exploited. Data privacy laws. Big tech companies thrive on consumer data[6], so you can limit their power by imposing stricter regulations on the gathering and use of consumer data. Data is a relatively new commodity, so putting together data privacy laws is a long and intensive process. Antitrust laws and breakups. On a bigger scale, Congress could attempt to pass new antitrust laws and attempt to literally break up the biggest corporations in the tech world. Incentives for competitors. From the ground up, we could also incentivize more entrepreneurs to enter the tech space and give big companies a run for their money. Consumer decisions. Perhaps most importantly, we need to make better decisions as consumers, and only work with tech companies we trust and respect.  It's incredibly difficult to say whether there's truly a problem with tech companies getting too large, or if we'll face that problem in the near future. It's also hard to tell exactly where the line is, or what to do when we cross it. In the meantime, as consumers, it's on us to make the most informed, responsible decisions we can, and understand that not every tech company is going to have our best interests at heart. Keep learning and remain informed on topics related to big tech, and do what you can to make a positive difference in the world.

More than ever before, investment professionals are prepared to back lossmaking, highly valued companies in the belief that future growth will more than compensate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fund managers are not usually slow to spot a marketing opportunity, but for once their own response to this trend has been muted. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Technology and Telecoms sector remains the fourth smallest in the Investment Association universe: just a handful of funds have been launched in the space over the past three years, and 70 per cent of its funds have been around for eight years or more.</p><p>One reason for this is the perception that investors have a limited interest in thematic funds - even if the theme in question has helped propel the bull market higher in recent years.</p><p>While that may be the case for advisers, data from Asset Allocator, a sister publication to Money Management, shows a reasonable amount of interest in dedicated technology funds from discretionary fund managers. Polar Capital's open-ended offering is by far the most popular strategy among this group, although funds such as Fidelity Global Technology and Gam Star Technology have also attracted interest.</p><p>Retail investors have tended to prefer the Scottish Mortgage investment trust as their dedicated technology play of choice. The Baillie Gifford-managed vehicle does not qualify for our analysis because it sits in the Global sector rather than the tech universe - and because Baillie Gifford does not classify the strategy as solely a tech product. Were it included, its performance would rank it eighth in <url normalizedValue=\"http://media.ftadviser.com.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/MM_Aug2019_Stats/Insight_Table1_MM_0819.pdf&#34; title=&#34;Table 1: Top Technology and Telecoms funds\">Table 1</url> over five years, and second over 10 years.</p><p>Relatively speaking, advisers' interest in Scottish Mortgage has been less voracious - though this is because of their reticence to buy investment trusts rather than a preference for dedicated technology funds. Instead, they remain content to tap into the tech story via a mainstream US equity fund.</p><p>In keeping with this, net sales of technology funds look fairly muted at first glance. Average monthly retail sales for the sector over the past year stand at just \u00a336m: hardly a sign of considerable interest.</p><p>But there are signs that more are being swayed by the option of dedicated exposure. While total sales of tech funds may be limited, they remained in the black during the fourth quarter of last year - despite that being a period in which tech stocks suffered a notable derailment. And the past two months for which data is available, April and May, show a renewed uptick in interest from investors.</p><p>Add to this the fact there are just 16 funds in the sector, and sales suddenly look very healthy. To put that another way, the typical tech fund has sold better than the average fund in any other equity sector (barring Global) over the past 12 months.</p><p>                     Sentiment                   </p><p>That is very much in keeping with global trends. Technology stocks' latest surge in performance - the average tech fund is second only to the US Smaller Companies sector when it comes to returns in the first half of 2019 - has led to renewed concerns over herd behaviour. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch's monthly fund manager survey saw 25 per cent of investors rank US technology shares as the world's most crowded trade in June.</p><p>If nothing else, this percentage did represent a marked fall from the 35 per cent who said the same in May. That is perhaps because many are growing more nervous of the sector: the investment bank's survey also reported that global managers' allocations to technology shares fell 13 percentage points to a six-month low in June.</p><p>That low still constitutes a net overweight of 21 per cent, admittedly. But there are other reasons to be cautious.</p><p>Estimates from data provider FactSet predict that the US technology sector will see earnings fall by 7 per cent year on year in the second quarter - a drop matched only by firms operating in the materials sector. </p><p>FactSet predicts that US earnings as a whole will contract by 2.8 per cent, an outcome that would mark the first \"earnings recession\" - two or more quarters of contraction - since 2016.</p><p>There is a significant caveat to this data, too. A rejig of benchmark indices earlier this year means that some of the largest US technology companies, specifically social media businesses like Facebook and Google parent Alphabet, are no longer counted as part of the technology sector.</p><p>These companies face problems of their own. The Financial Times reported in early June that regulators in the US were considering antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Details remain scarce, and the precise targets of any would-be investigations are unclear, but US politicians are also becoming more forthright on the matter. </p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has pledged to break up the big tech firms if elected, while Republicans are also making more critical noises.</p><p>This increased scrutiny has arguably been inevitable ever since Big Tech became such a defining part of everyday existence. From investors' point of view, however, it's only really in the past few years that the sector's performance has decoupled from other sectors. </p><p>                     Chart 1 records the performance of several sub-sectors of the FTSE World index, from technology to oil and gas. It indicates that tech's outperformance began in earnest in mid-2016, and hasn't looked back since - barring the notable drawdown recorded at the end of last year. The past six months have proven a case in point: gains for global technology stocks have far outstripped those recorded elsewhere this year.</p><p>                     Standouts                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://media.ftadviser.com.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/MM_Aug2019_Stats/Insight_Table1_MM_0819.pdf&#34; title=&#34;Table 1: Top Technology and Telecoms funds\">Table 1</url> outlines all the tech-focused funds and trusts currently found in the relevant IA and Association of Investment Companies sectors, ranked by their five-year performance. Only those without the necessary track records have been excluded.</p><p>Topping the pile over both five and 10 years is Allianz Technology trust, a closed-ended fund run by Walter Price. Its medium-term figures are largely down to the significant gains produced in both 2016-17 and 2017-18, and have more than compensated for 2015-16 performance that was well below the IA sector average.</p><p>As with all funds in the sector, the Allianz trust is heavily weighted towards the US: the country accounts for 85 per cent of its assets. Top holdings include the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft, but the latter, at 3.1 per cent of the fund, is a sizeable underweight compared with benchmarks' typical position of around 14-15 per cent.</p><p>Microsoft's resurgence in recent years is a sign that the technology story is not as simple as 'new tech' versus 'old tech': the company has managed to reposition itself via a push into areas such as cloud networks.</p><p>But the company's return to the top of benchmark weightings also speaks to a growing problem for active managers: big tech firms' dominance of the indices makes it hard for specialised funds to be anything other than underweight these companies.</p><p>For now, plenty of funds have been able to best the index. One passive fund, the L&amp;G offering, has been included in <url normalizedValue=\"http://media.ftadviser.com.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/MM_Aug2019_Stats/Insight_Table1_MM_0819.pdf&#34; title=&#34;Table 1: Top Technology and Telecoms funds\">Table 1</url> as a reference point. Its performance suggests some investors would have been better off tracking an index during the past half decade. But the outsized gains delivered by other strategies makes the case for active management.</p><p>The funds and trusts run by Allianz, Polar Capital, Axa Investment Managers and Fidelity have, by and large, posted consistent double-digit returns in each of the five discrete annual periods covered by <url normalizedValue=\"http://media.ftadviser.com.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/MM_Aug2019_Stats/Insight_Table1_MM_0819.pdf&#34; title=&#34;Table 1: Top Technology and Telecoms funds\">Table 1</url>. </p><p>Their top holdings all tend to focus on the most recognisable tech names, but each strategy does have its own distinct characteristics. Axa IM's fund has an even greater underweight to Microsoft than the Allianz Trust, Fidelity has a notable overweight in Samsung, and none of the funds in question has materially backed Apple relative to the benchmark. </p><p>In performance terms, it's notable that Polar's open-ended fund has beaten its investment trust over five years and short-term time periods. But across 10 years it is the trust that has won out. Its one-year return is well below that of the sector, but there are reasons to think the closed-ended version is best placed to flourish if tech continues to outperform: as of mid-July it was trading on a discount to net asset value of more than 9 per cent, its widest level for three years.</p><p>Looking ahead, it seems unlikely that the next five years will be able to replicate the past half-decade. In total, 47 of the 60 discrete one-year performance periods for the 12 funds and trusts featured in the table produced double-digit gains.

Perhaps most importantly, programs operating under 804 authority are allowed to bypass the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System, oversight bodies that critics say slow the acquisition process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Air Force acquisition chief Will Roper, the former director of the Strategic Capabilities Office, has positioned his service as the leading user of the new authority, last month employing 804 to launch development of the Air-Launched Rapid Response weapon and the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared satellite constellation.</p><p>In a promotional video for Defense Acquisition University, Roper said Air Force program managers are well aware of his affinity for section 804.</p><p>\"They have quickly realized that I love 804, and I do not like traditional acquisition plans that I'm not going to see complete within the next decade,\" he said. \"They have quickly realized don't bring in traditional acquisition and they have all realigned program plans around 804.\"</p><p>In July, Inside Defense obtained a list of programs the Air Force and the other services told Congress they are considering for 804 authority.</p><p>Along with the two programs begun last month, the Air Force is contemplating using 804 for the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program, the new light-attack aircraft, F-22 modernization and protected tactical enterprise services.</p><p>Roper said in the DAU video that if there is a developmental program that \"doesn't naturally lend itself to this authority, I haven't found it yet.\"</p><p>Bruce Jette, the Army's acquisition chief, also appeared in the DAU video and said his service wants \"product, not process\" and is \"looking very hard\" at using section 804 for the Future Vertical Lift program as well as some systems for directed energy, air defense and small missiles.</p><p>\"Part of this is culture,\" he said. \"Don't get perfect. Where's the good break point? Let's see what we can do in five years.\" Critics warn of risks</p><p>But Frank Kendall, the former under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said the new rapid prototyping authorities won't eliminate the complexities of technology development.</p><p>\"What determines how long a development program takes is the product,\" he told Inside Defense. \"Complexity and technical difficulty drive schedule. That can't be wished away. Requirements set by operators drive both complexity and technical difficulty. You have to begin there.\"</p><p>Kendall said it is possible to build some kinds of prototypes quickly if requirements are reduced and designs are simplified.</p><p>\"Whether an operator will want that product is another question,\" he said. \"It's also possible to set totally unrealistic schedules and get industry to bid on them. There is a great deal of history that teaches us that this is a really bad idea.\"</p><p>Andrew Hunter, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously ran the Pentagon's Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, said he understands the appeal of section 804.</p><p>\"Section 804 authority clearly provides an alternative path in the acquisition system that exempts programs from many of the existing rules,\" he said. \"For this reason, it is appealing to those looking to streamline acquisition oversight and accelerate the initiation of development programs.\"</p><p>Like Kendall, however, Hunter said 804 authority is unlikely to alter the difficulty of technology development or the inherent need for trade-offs.</p><p>\"Putting the priority on delivering capability faster means compromising to some extent on one or more other traditional acquisition priorities such as unit cost, performance or sustainability,\" he said.</p><p>Hunter added that there aren't clear program oversight rules for section 804.</p><p>\"That is similar to the situation with [other transaction authority] where anything is possible, but the very lack of established rules means only a small cadre of experts currently feel comfortable using them,\" he said. \"I think, over time, the flexibility of section 804 authority will likely prove its particular value for certain kinds of development efforts, and a body of newer oversight mechanisms will develop optimized for those efforts.\" Wooing Congress</p><p>Because 804 is such a new tool, it has yet to be tested with one of the most powerful audiences -- Congress.</p><p>Though lawmakers voted to include 804 in the FY-16 NDAA and have frequently pushed for faster defense acquisition, the Pentagon has yet to use 804 it in a meaningful way that leads to what most technology developers say is inevitable and, in many cases, desirable: failure.</p><p>\"Let's see what happens when they go before Congress with a $500 million failure and say, 'Boy, we sure learned a lot,'\" said one former senior DOD official.</p><p>Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee, said Aug. 21 on the Senate floor the Pentagon needs to be more \"upfront\" with Congress about the costs of developmental weapon systems.</p><p>\"Right now, every weapon system -- every single one of them -- is sold to Congress with a rosy scenario: technological breakthroughs at a modest cost,\" he said. \"There is no difference between the sales pitch on a program that is easy to develop and one that is a giant risk.\"</p><p>Durbin said he has been told by Michael Griffin, who operates as the Pentagon's chief innovation officer, DOD officials are risk-averse because they fear bad headlines and testy congressional hearings.</p><p>\"He said that many members of the Department of Defense are afraid to be the last to say 'yes' to a program that may not succeed,\" Durbin said. \"If something goes wrong, failures are the subject of heated congressional hearings. We have seen that over and over -- from $20,000 toilet seats and similar scandals in the past.\"</p><p>Durbin, however, pointed out that congressional appropriators approved a record $95 billion for defense research and development in fiscal year 2019 -- the highest level in history, even when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>\"Very often, the contentious hearings that Dr. Griffin spoke about are not the result of a failed test, but a broken promise,\" Durbin said.</p><p>Philip Anton, a RAND Corp. analyst who previously served as deputy director of DOD's Acquisition Policy Analysis Center, said lawmakers will be \"tested\" as to whether they truly want the Pentagon to move faster, take bigger risks and pursue leap-ahead technology to offset gains made by China and Russia.</p><p>\"At some point, you can't get it both ways,\" he said. \"It's still acquisition, it's still bleeding edge, there are still going to be issues that crop up.\"</p><p>Still, Anton stressed that many 804 supporters say rapid prototyping will expose and \"burn down\" risk early enough in a program for acquisition executives to terminate it, rather than authorize programs built around unproven technologies that could lead to catastrophic failures, like the Army's Future Combat Systems effort.</p><p>\"Be aggressive about it,\" Anton advised. \"If the technology didn't work in the prototype, kill it. Don't wait. Hopefully, the prudence will be there.\"</p><p>That \"prudence\" involves a data collection and analytics strategy currently being discussed at the Pentagon.</p><p>Alan Shaffer, nominated to be deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in answers to advance policy questions that \"maintaining visibility\" into 804 prototyping would be vital to ensure the authority is properly used.</p><p>\"I understand that USD(A&amp;S) is currently working with the military departments and military services and other users of the 804 authority to develop a data collection and analytic process that will enable the department to have insight into how these projects are being managed and executed,\" he wrote.</p><p>USD A&amp;S Ellen Lord released interim guidance in April encouraging the use of section 804, and military services have followed suit. Final implementation guidance is expected in January that may contain additional details on DOD's 804 oversight structure. 'Cultural change' required</p><p>Maryann Watson, an administrator at DAU, has begun efforts to train and educate DOD's acquisition program managers on how to use section 804.</p><p>She said the video Roper and Jette made \"really shows that senior leaders have given a lot of thought to the value of this and how they approach it so they don't lose the authority.\"</p><p>Watson said she would be interested to see how \"creative\" program managers are able to be in applying 804.</p><p>\"There's a great deal of potential,\" she said. \"Hopefully, it will free up people to think differently about what they're allowed to do and, more importantly, what they're encouraged to do.\"</p><p>Lynne Giordano, professor of acquisition management at DAU, said one of the key features of the authority is that it allows program managers to start with a \"blank sheet of paper\" and add existing aspects of federal acquisition regulation as needed, rather than start with DOD's massive set of regulations and tailor them down.</p><p>Giordano said, however, that successful use of 804 would require \"cultural change\" in the department and Congress.</p><p>\"It's what happens when there is that first failure,\" she said. \"Because they are saying they are trying to move to the left and do the hard things first.\"</p><p>Shaffer told the Senate Armed Services Committee that, if confirmed to be Lord's deputy, he would encourage \"speed to field,\" while practicing proper risk management through rapid prototyping.</p><p>\"One thing that I believe is that advanced technology adds cost, schedule, and performance risk,\" he wrote. \"The bigger the technology advancement, the greater the risk. The crux of this question, I believe, is how should defense senior leaders think about and accept risk to allow greater technological advancement. This would represent a cultural change. However, I believe that more use of prototyping allow[s] greater technology advancement while retiring risk. If confirmed, I will advocate for more prototypes to support both introducing advanced technology into future weapons systems while reducing risk.\" -- Tony Bertuca   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INSARM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INSARM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T63-5RX1-DY0P-G0WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">285576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside the Army</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 3, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>DEFENSE ACQUISITION UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Perhaps most importantly, programs operating under 804 authority are allowed to bypass the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System, oversight bodies that critics say slow the acquisition process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Air Force acquisition chief Will Roper, the former director of the Strategic Capabilities Office, has positioned his service as the leading user of the new authority, earlier this month employing 804 to launch development of the Air-Launched Rapid Response weapon and the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared satellite constellation.</p><p>In a promotional video for Defense Acquisition University, Roper said Air Force program managers are well aware of his affinity for section 804.</p><p>\"They have quickly realized that I love 804, and I do not like traditional acquisition plans that I'm not going to see complete within the next decade,\" he said. \"They have quickly realized don't bring in traditional acquisition and they have all realigned program plans around 804.\"</p><p>In July, Inside Defense obtained a list of programs the Air Force and the other services told Congress they are considering for 804 authority.</p><p>Along with the two programs begun earlier this month, the Air Force is contemplating using 804 for the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program, the new light-attack aircraft, F-22 modernization and protected tactical enterprise services.</p><p>Roper said in the DAU video that if there is a developmental program that \"doesn't naturally lend itself to this authority, I haven't found it yet.\"</p><p>Bruce Jette, the Army's acquisition chief, also appeared in the DAU video and said his service wants \"product, not process\" and is \"looking very hard\" at using section 804 for the Future Vertical Lift program as well as some systems for directed energy, air defense and small missiles.</p><p>\"Part of this is culture,\" he said. \"Don't get perfect. Where's the good break point? Let's see what we can do in five years.\" Critics warn of risks</p><p>But Frank Kendall, the former under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said the new rapid prototyping authorities won't eliminate the complexities of technology development.</p><p>\"What determines how long a development program takes is the product,\" he told Inside Defense. \"Complexity and technical difficulty drive schedule. That can't be wished away. Requirements set by operators drive both complexity and technical difficulty. You have to begin there.\"</p><p>Kendall said it is possible to build some kinds of prototypes quickly if requirements are reduced and designs are simplified.</p><p>\"Whether an operator will want that product is another question,\" he said. \"It's also possible to set totally unrealistic schedules and get industry to bid on them. There is a great deal of history that teaches us that this is a really bad idea.\"</p><p>Andrew Hunter, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously ran the Pentagon's Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, said he understands the appeal of section 804.</p><p>\"Section 804 authority clearly provides an alternative path in the acquisition system that exempts programs from many of the existing rules,\" he said. \"For this reason, it is appealing to those looking to streamline acquisition oversight and accelerate the initiation of development programs.\"</p><p>Like Kendall, however, Hunter said 804 authority is unlikely to alter the difficulty of technology development or the inherent need for trade-offs.</p><p>\"Putting the priority on delivering capability faster means compromising to some extent on one or more other traditional acquisition priorities such as unit cost, performance or sustainability,\" he said.</p><p>Hunter added that there aren't clear program oversight rules for section 804.</p><p>\"That is similar to the situation with [other transaction authority] where anything is possible, but the very lack of established rules means only a small cadre of experts currently feel comfortable using them,\" he said. \"I think, over time, the flexibility of section 804 authority will likely prove its particular value for certain kinds of development efforts, and a body of newer oversight mechanisms will develop optimized for those efforts.\" Wooing Congress</p><p>Because 804 is such a new tool, it has yet to be tested with one of the most powerful audiences -- Congress.</p><p>Though lawmakers voted to include 804 in the FY-16 NDAA and have frequently pushed for faster defense acquisition, the Pentagon has yet to use 804 it in a meaningful way that leads to what most technology developers say is inevitable and, in many cases, desirable: failure.</p><p>\"Let's see what happens when they go before Congress with a $500 million failure and say, 'Boy, we sure learned a lot,'\" said one former senior DOD official.</p><p>Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee, said last week on the Senate floor the Pentagon needs to be more \"upfront\" with Congress about the costs of developmental weapon systems.</p><p>\"Right now, every weapon system -- every single one of them -- is sold to Congress with a rosy scenario: technological breakthroughs at a modest cost,\" he said Aug 21. \"There is no difference between the sales pitch on a program that is easy to develop and one that is a giant risk.\"</p><p>Durbin said he has been told by Michael Griffin, who operates as the Pentagon's chief innovation officer, DOD officials are risk-averse because they fear bad headlines and testy congressional hearings.</p><p>\"He said that many members of the Department of Defense are afraid to be the last to say 'yes' to a program that may not succeed,\" Durbin said. \"If something goes wrong, failures are the subject of heated congressional hearings. We have seen that over and over -- from $20,000 toilet seats and similar scandals in the past.\"</p><p>Durbin, however, pointed out that congressional appropriators approved a record $95 billion for defense research and development in fiscal year 2019 -- the highest level in history, even when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>\"Very often, the contentious hearings that Dr. Griffin spoke about are not the result of a failed test, but a broken promise,\" Durbin said.</p><p>Philip Anton, a RAND Corp. analyst who previously served as deputy director of DOD's Acquisition Policy Analysis Center, said lawmakers will be \"tested\" as to whether they truly want the Pentagon to move faster, take bigger risks and pursue leap-ahead technology to offset gains made by China and Russia.</p><p>\"At some point, you can't get it both ways,\" he said. \"It's still acquisition, it's still bleeding edge, there are still going to be issues that crop up.\"</p><p>Still, Anton stressed that many 804 supporters say rapid prototyping will expose and \"burn down\" risk early enough in a program for acquisition executives to terminate it, rather than authorize programs built around unproven technologies that could lead to catastrophic failures, like the Army's Future Combat Systems effort.</p><p>\"Be aggressive about it,\" Anton advised. \"If the technology didn't work in the prototype, kill it. Don't wait. Hopefully, the prudence will be there.\"</p><p>That \"prudence\" involves a data collection and analytics strategy currently being discussed at the Pentagon.</p><p>Alan Shaffer, nominated to be deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in answers to advance policy questions that \"maintaining visibility\" into 804 prototyping would be vital to ensure the authority is properly used.</p><p>\"I understand that USD(A&amp;S) is currently working with the military departments and military services and other users of the 804 authority to develop a data collection and analytic process that will enable the department to have insight into how these projects are being managed and executed,\" he wrote.</p><p>USD A&amp;S Ellen Lord released interim guidance in April encouraging the use of section 804, and military services have followed suit. Final implementation guidance is expected in January that may contain additional details on DOD's 804 oversight structure. 'Cultural change' required</p><p>Maryann Watson, an administrator at DAU, has begun efforts to train and educate DOD's acquisition program managers on how to use section 804.</p><p>She said the video Roper and Jette made \"really shows that senior leaders have given a lot of thought to the value of this and how they approach it so they don't lose the authority.\"</p><p>Watson said she would be interested to see how \"creative\" program managers are able to be in applying 804.</p><p>\"There's a great deal of potential,\" she said. \"Hopefully, it will free up people to think differently about what they're allowed to do and, more importantly, what they're encouraged to do.\"</p><p>Lynne Giordano, professor of acquisition management at DAU, said one of the key features of the authority is that it allows program managers to start with a \"blank sheet of paper\" and add existing aspects of federal acquisition regulation as needed, rather than start with DOD's massive set of regulations and tailor them down.</p><p>Giordano said, however, that successful use of 804 would require \"cultural change\" in the department and Congress.</p><p>\"It's what happens when there is that first failure,\" she said. \"Because they are saying they are trying to move to the left and do the hard things first.\"</p><p>Shaffer told the Senate Armed Services Committee that, if confirmed to be Lord's deputy, he would encourage \"speed to field,\" while practicing proper risk management through rapid prototyping.</p><p>\"One thing that I believe is that advanced technology adds cost, schedule, and performance risk,\" he wrote. \"The bigger the technology advancement, the greater the risk. The crux of this question, I believe, is how should defense senior leaders think about and accept risk to allow greater technological advancement. This would represent a cultural change. However, I believe that more use of prototyping allow[s] greater technology advancement while retiring risk. If confirmed, I will advocate for more prototypes to support both introducing advanced technology into future weapons systems while reducing risk.\" -- Tony Bertuca   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INSPEN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INSPEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T51-8H81-DY0P-G47N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">285579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside the Pentagon</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>DEFENSE ACQUISITION UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

If confirmed, I will advocate for more prototypes to support both introducing advanced technology into future weapons systems while reducing risk.\" -- Tony Bertuca   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INSNAV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INSNAV2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T63-5RX1-DY0P-G0YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">285577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside the Navy</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 3, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>DEFENSE ACQUISITION UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

But some observers say that while FSOC isunlikely to weighin under the Trump administration, the growing ties between cloud services and the nation's banks will heighten regulators' concerns over time.</p><p>\"I think it's coming,\" said one former banker who now advises financial institutions and spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"There's been a lot of discussion around having more guidance over the use of the cloud, and as more banks move that way, I'd be surprised if regulators didn't want more oversight.\"</p><p>Reliance on cloud providers seen as a risk</p><p>In a letter last month to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Reps. Katie Porter, D-Calif., and Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y., responded to the Capital One breach by taking aim at Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing industry's dominant player with a market share around 33% as of 2018.</p><p>Some have blamed the cyber intrusion on the fact that the data in question was in the Amazon cloud. The breach has been linked in part to an alleged hacker formerly employed in Amazon's cloud service who the authorities say was able to break into Capital One's system.</p><p>The lawmakers said FSOC should consider designating major cloud providers as SIFMUs.</p><p>\"The incident raises new and serious questions about banks' and financial institutions' dependence on cloud services for their data needs - and the risks these systems pose to the safety and stability of the financial system,\" Porter and Vel\u00e1zquez said in the Aug. 22 letter to Mnuchin, who chairs the FSOC.</p><p>They said the concentration of bank-related cloud services in just a few tech firms amplifies the risk if any one tech provider encounters trouble.</p><p>\"A lack of substitutability for the services provided by these very few firms creates systemic risk; a disruption at any major cloud computing platform would cause widespread and immediate harm and compromise the stability of the market,\" they said.</p><p>The issue came up Wednesday at a House Financial Services Committee hearing where lawmakers cited banks' reliance on cloud computing services as a financial stability concern.</p><p>Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill., asked a Federal Reserve Board governor at the hearing if the central bank had explored \"requiring major financial firms to connect to more than one cloud provider so they can fail over to the second one\" if one of the cloud providers were disrupted.</p><p>\"Certainly there's work internationally where we're thinking about precisely this question that you raise about the ability to fail over,\" said Gov. Lael Brainard said in response. She added that regulators recognize that \"migrating to the cloud mitigates some risks, adds other risks, and so we need to hold our institutions accountable for making that risk assessment in a very well-informed way and taking that migration very seriously.\"</p><p>An extreme step</p><p>Yet giving the big tech firms the \"systemic\" tag could be seen as an extreme step.</p><p>The council's focus after its creation in the Dodd-Frank Act has been on nonbank financial firms. Four companies - American International Group, Prudential Financial, MetLife, and GE Capital - were all previously labeled as \"systemically important financial institutions\" but have since been de-designated. Eight other companies that supports payments, clearing and other financial infrastructure are still designated as SIFMUs.</p><p>FSOC-designated firms have to date not included technology-focused companies.</p><p>\"Many people think\" an FSOC \"designation is a panacea that solves any problem,\" said Thomas Vartanian, a professor at George Mason University's law school where he directs the Financial Regulation and Technology Institute. \"Given the enormous authority they already have, the last thing we want to do is engage in regulatory overkill.\"</p><p>Vartanian and other experts disputed the notion that regulators need an extra layer of authority to monitor cloud computing, pointing to the advent of data processing in the 20th century when tech-leery bankers eventually warmed to the idea of storing data electronically.</p><p>\"You have to go back 50 or 60 years - regulators have long had substantial authority to examine and control the activities of entities that provide service to financial institutions,\" Vartanian said. \"It's not as if regulators can't look at or regulate the cloud right now.\"</p><p>But others say the FSOC's mission to focus on emerging risks makes it a suitable fit to look at cloud computing issues.</p><p>\"FSOC is a natural home for concerns that don't otherwise have an obvious spot in pre-existing regulatory silos,\" said David Portilla, a partner at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP and former policy adviser to FSOC.</p><p>Reiners said an FSOC designation would have to be bolstered with a strong case that cloud computing giants meet the same systemic risk criteria as other firms that have been targeted by the council.</p><p>\"Structurally, cloud providers are very different from past SIFMUs,\" he said. \"You'd have to explain why this was worth pursuing. You'd have to tie it to existing SIFIs - it's about having a vital role in the existing infrastructure.\"</p><p>General concentration-related concerns</p><p>The letter came as policymakers have sounded general alarms about the concentration of cloud-computing risks in just a handle of the largest tech firms. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud collectively make up nearly 60% of the cloud computing industry's market share.</p><p>An FSOC designation comes with a laundry list of requirements, including heftier capital standards and supervision by the Fed. Yet under the Trump administration, FSOC has shifted away from targeting individual firms and focused more on an\"activities-based\" approach to managing systemic risk.</p><p>FSOC has other avenues beyond a full-on SIFMU designation for risks that may be emerging in the financial system. \"FSOC has a lot of different mandates,\" Portilla said. \"It can decide that agencies need some additional authority and request action from Congress. Or it can assemble a working group of federal agencies to address the issue.\"</p><p>\"It's naturally inclined to explore all these routes,\" he said.</p><p>Another consideration is the companies themselves. While Microsoft has slowly grown accustomed to managing compliance and regulation over its 44-year history, Amazon and Google have comparatively little experience with real financial regulation.</p><p>\"Amazon and Google certainly have the resources to deal with compliance and some experience with it, but based on how they've been able to operate in the past - regulatory concerns have never been front and center,\" Reiners said.</p><p>Amazon, Google and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Limits of current vendor supervision</p><p>Even while new FSOC designations appear unlikely in the the current political landscape, future administrations will likely need to grapple with the growing dominance of the industry's major cloud providers.</p><p>Several policy experts have argued it's precisely their size and market dominance that raises the profile of systemic risk, and that the current regulatory framework offers little concrete guidance when it comes to cloud computing's concentration.</p><p>\"It's one thing to say, \"~Bank A needs to make sure Cloud Provider B meets all these requirements,\" said the former banker. \"But if you've got Banks A through Z all using Cloud Provider B, eventually the cloud company isn't going to want answer every single questionnaire. ... It's going to be better if a regulator can look at this all at once.\"</p><p>Reiners said supervision of the cloud providers separate from the monitoring of any particular bank would likely be more effective.</p><p>\"If cloud providers reported directly to the Federal Reserve, rather than indirectly through their relationships with banks, you'd have a more complete and wholesale picture of risk and concentration,\" he said.</p><p>Proponents of a designation say cloud computing infrastructure is currently a blind spot for regulators.</p><p>Each major provider has a unique proprietary architecture. Regulators would likely want to see and understand those inner workings, which will cause no small amount of bristling among the tech community.</p><p>\"Regulators are largely flying in the dark here,\" Reiners said.</p><p>In 2017, Microsoft announced anagreement with Bank of Americafor the bank to host about 80% of its technical functions through Azure. A Goldman Sachs tech executive was quoted in 2016 saying that, at that time, thecompany had\"85% of its distributed workloads running on the cloud.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016d-6980-dfa0-a1ef-7fb9cd290000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5M-K0S1-F06X-W00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Critics saw it as a sign of creeping privatisation and a data-protection disaster in waiting. Reactions to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">news last month</url> that Amazon's voice-controlled digital assistant Alexa was to begin using NHS website information to answer health queries were many and varied.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US-based healthcare tech analysts say the deal is just the latest of a series of recent moves that together reveal an audacious, long-term strategy on the part of Amazon. From its entry into the lucrative prescription drugs market and development of AI tools to analyse patient records, to Alexa apps that manage diabetes and data-driven experiments on how to cut medical bills, the $900bn global giant's determination to make the digital disruption of healthcare a central part of its future business model is becoming increasingly clear.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                   Why Amazon is moving into health                   </p><p>Few doubt new digital technologies have roles to play in the huge challenges healthcare systems are facing. Amazon has many detractors, but even they concede it has been highly successful in improving customer experiences and cutting costs. Yet the company's move into healthcare raises some fundamental questions. What precisely are its ambitions? Can we trust it with our sensitive health data? And are its commercial imperatives compatible with the core values of the NHS, or do they threaten its very existence?</p><p>While Amazon's recent focus on health has caught the attention of observers, its interest in the sector is far from new. As far back as 1999, it bought a big stake in online retailer Drugstore.com. The company's early bid to move in on the prescription drug market ultimately failed due to a combination of regulatory hurdles, logistical challenges and defensive moves by rivals.</p><p>Amazon came back for another go in June 2018 when it paid close to $1bn for online pharmacy PillPack, which has licences to supply prescription drugs across the US. The global healthcare market is worth more than $7tn, and health spending consumes a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">huge proportion of the GDP</url> of major economies - 17% in the US, around 11% in France and Germany and 10% in the UK.</p><p>Consumers are starting to expect the same level of flexibility from healthcare as they get from other industries</p><p>  Anurag Gupta    </p><p>\"First and foremost, Amazon sees a highly inefficient, highly regulated and potentially very lucrative multitrillion-dollar global healthcare market,\" says Jeff Becker, a senior tech analyst at US market research company Forrester. \"While most other companies are put off by the high barriers to market entry, organisations of the size and complexity of Amazon are not dissuaded, and see a major financial opportunity.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, health systems across the world are under pressure to reform to maintain care levels in the face of major challenges. The NHS faces an ageing population, rising demand for services, a funding squeeze, the continued social care gap and serious staffing problems.</p><p>                   Patient expectations are also changing                    </p><p>Thanks to digital transformations in other areas of our lives, we expect to get what we want quickly, conveniently and affordably in ways that take account of our personal needs. \"Consumers in the UK can order something at midnight and take delivery the next day,\" says Anurag Gupta, an analyst at global research consultancy Gartner. \"They're starting to expect the same level of service and flexibility from healthcare as they have got used to from other industries.\"</p><p>Amazon doesn't like to go into detail about its long-term vision, but a series of recent launches, acquisitions and appointments reveal a clear and ambitious strategy. In January 2018, it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">formed a not-for-profit joint venture</url> with banking giant JPMorgan Chase and multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway. Later named Haven, its public pronouncements have been vague and modest, stating that it aimed to better use data and technology to provide improved, cheaper healthcare for the three companies' 1.2 million employees and their family members.</p><p>Suspicions that this is far from the limit of Haven's aims were confirmed in June last year when it announced its new CEO was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">Atul Gawande</url>, a renowned surgeon, Harvard Medical School professor, writer and ambitious reformer with a firm belief in the power of data to deliver safer, more efficient and better integrated healthcare.</p><p>Analysts say Haven is in reality a test bed for new forms of employee healthcare benefits, experimenting in areas including improving GP access, remote patient monitoring and digital care delivery and reducing prescription drug costs. \"The idea is to apply Amazon's culture of taking the friction out for consumers end-to-end and bring that to healthcare,\" says Becker. \"I think Haven is an incubator for a next-generation healthcare delivery model, which, after testing, will be made available to general consumers.\"</p><p>Amazon's choice of partners in Haven is also instructive. Berkshire Hathaway's multibillionaire CEO Warren Buffett has described healthcare as the \"tapeworm\" of the US economy. JPMorgan Chase is one of the world's biggest banks. Together they would be well placed to create and sell lower-cost payment plans for other companies or advise them how to do so, based on an in-depth understanding of insurance risk and Haven's experimentation.</p><p>Amazon Prime for health                    </p><p>Last year, Amazon unveiled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">Amazon Comprehend Medical</url>, a cloud-based service that uses machine learning to extract information from medical data including patient records and provide new insights. In April, Amazon began offering PillPack's service - medications packaged by dose and time - with free delivery to its Prime subscribers.</p><p>Meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">last month's NHS-Alexa deal</url> is just the tip of a very big iceberg. Amazon has announced new Alexa applications under development, including ones that manage health-improvement goals, handle blood-sugar readings and book appointments. Crucially, it says it has created ways for Alexa-enabled devices to handle patient information that conform to US privacy laws.</p><p>Amazon consistently refuses to discuss its healthcare plans. Neither it nor Haven responded to multiple requests for comment for this article. In mid-2017, it was reported that the online retail giant had set up a secretive lab to explore tech-driven healthcare disruption called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">Amazon 1492</url>, presumably named after the year Columbus first arrived in the Americas as a signal of its paradigm-shifting ambitions.</p><p>Becker and others believe the company is working towards the launch of an Amazon Prime service for healthcare. The company already knows a lot about its customers, including their reading preferences, education levels, approximate weight if they buy clothes, search histories, and the eating habits of customers of its Whole Foods subsidiary. Add to this data from AI-powered extraction from medical records, Alexa, fitness trackers and connected medical devices like blood-pressure monitors and glucometers, and Amazon will know those who sign up inside out.</p><p>A Prime Health virtual doctor could decide whether you need a human doctor or just to stock up on tissues, for example. Appointments could be much simpler and quicker to book. Patients with chronic diseases or those recently discharged from hospital could be remotely monitored at home, while medication could become cheaper and quicker to access. Alexa could provide alerts and personalised health advice, and even reward healthy choices.</p><p>\"These elements are being deployed incrementally, and I think when we step back, what we'll see from Amazon is fully curated digital-first healthcare that, for example, only brings in your GP when and where it makes sense,\" says Becker.</p><p>He is not alone in his analysis. Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr, a friend of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, told a conference in November: \"Imagine what it's going to be like when he [Bezos] rolls out Prime Health, which I'm convinced he will.\"</p><p>Amazon and the NHS                   </p><p>But aren't Amazon's ambitious, data-driven plans more relevant in the US than in the UK, where all have access to free-at-the-point-of-delivery, more or less comprehensive care? In fact, NHS patients have been using virtual GP services for some time. The most high profile is London-based <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">Babylon Health</url>, which has more than 50,000 registered patients and recently launched in Birmingham.</p><p>The incentive for companies like Amazon is to increase profits, which puts them at odds with the goals the NHS</p><p>  Jeff Becker    </p><p>Most observers expect digital healthcare providers, both big and small, to work with rather than in competition with NHS providers, as they are already doing. \"These changes are relevant globally,\" says Becker. \"There would be real benefits to the UK public in some of the digital innovations inspired by the kinds of incubator models being generated in Haven. Like the NHS-Alexa deal, I think it will be a partnership rather than an alternative.\"</p><p>Others, however, believe the commercial imperatives of the tech giants conflict with the public service values of the NHS. \"What does return on investment look like in healthcare?\" asks Mathana Stender, a Berlin-based tech ethicist. \"The incentives of companies like Amazon are to increase market share, share prices and profits, which puts them at odds with the underlying goals of a public health system like the NHS.\"</p><p>Some fear that free-market tech evangelist politicians would be more than happy to cut NHS funding and invite private companies to fill the gap. However, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">Matthew Honeyman</url>, of health thinktank the King's Fund, says those primarily interested in cutting costs shouldn't expect quick gains. \"These kinds of transformations do bring efficiencies and productivity benefits, but our research suggests these take years to come through.\"</p><p>                   Can I trust Amazon with my health data?                    </p><p>The most widespread concerns relate to data protection. Last month it was revealed that contractors working on quality control of Apple's Siri voice assistant regularly hear recordings of confidential conversations, including doctor-patient discussions. In 2017, London's Royal Free hospital <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">was rebuked for failing to comply</url> with the Data Protection Act when it handed over the personal data of 1.6 million patients to Google's DeepMind as part of efforts to develop an early diagnosis system.</p><p>Amazon has promised that UK patients who asked Alexa for health advice would have their data encrypted, but critics demand more specifics on how patient data is protected. \"We need more detail and transparency about how people's sensitive data will be processed and used when they ask Alexa a question,\" says Honeyman.</p><p>Others say there are privacy risks even if big tech companies do make stringent efforts to protect patient data. \"Even using the most sophisticated anonymisation techniques, given enough data points, it may become possible to de-anonymise individuals in future,\" says Stender, also a fellow at the Centre for Internet and Human Rights at the Viadrina European University in Frankfurt an der Oder.</p><p>Healthcare is widely considered a \"digital laggard\" compared with other sectors. But the pace of change is quickening. Amazon and the other major tech companies have become rich and powerful in large part by realising the value of and monetising data. Critics highlight what they say is their poor data protection track record, and warn of irreparable damage to our privacy if the same approach is applied to personal health data. Few doubt digital disruption can bring big gains in healthcare. Less clear is whether Amazon and its ilk can or should be trusted to play central roles in the new era of data-driven healthcare they are carving out for themselves.</p><p>                   It's not just Amazon</p><p>Jeff Bezos's firm is far from alone in looking to disrupt healthcare with data and technology. Apple is rolling out its Health Records feature designed to make it easier fo users to visualise, use and store medical data on their iPhones. The latest Apple watches have ECG sensors that can alert users if they have potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythms. The Google-owned company DeepMind last month <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\">claimed its AI algorithm could predict acute kidney injury</url> - which kills 100,000 people per year in the UK - 48 hours before it happened.

The underlying assumption is that Apple, as a vertically integrated entity that operates both a platform for third-party apps and also makes it own apps, is acting nefariously whenever it 'discriminates' against rival apps through prioritization, enters into popular app markets, or charges a 'tax' or 'surcharge' on rival apps.For most people, the word discrimination has a pejorative connotation of animus based upon prejudice: racism, sexism, homophobia. One of the definitions you will find in the dictionary[4] reflects this. But another definition is a lot less charged: the act of making or perceiving a difference. </p><p>(This is what people mean when they say that a person has a discriminating[5] palate, or a discriminating taste in music, for example.)In economics, discrimination can be a positive attribute. For instance, effective price discrimination[6] can result in wealthier consumers paying a higher price than less well off consumers for the same product or service, and it can ensure that products and services are in fact available for less-wealthy consumers in the first place. That would seem to be a socially desirable outcome (although under some circumstances, perfect price discrimination can be socially undesirable[7]).Antitrust law rightly condemns conduct only when it harms competition and not simply when it harms a competitor. This is because it is competition that enhances consumer welfare, not the presence or absence of a competitor \u2014 or, indeed, the profitability of competitors. The difficult task for antitrust enforcers is to determine when a vertically integrated firm with 'market power' in an upstream market is able to effectively discriminate against rivals in a downstream market in a way that harms consumers.Even assuming the claims of critics are true, alleged discrimination by Apple against competitor apps in the App Store may harm those competitors, but it doesn't necessarily harm either competition or consumer welfare.The three potential antitrust issues facing Apple can be summarized[8] as: Prioritization - 'It has been prioritizing its own apps in search, as recent investigations by the New York Times[9] and Wall Street Journal[10] [have] documented.'Entry - 'It regularly turns successful third-party apps into native features of its operating systems[11].'Tax - 'Its 30 percent cut of revenue has disadvantaged competitors like Spotify[12], which can artificially inflate its price over what Apple is able to charge for its equivalent service.' There is nothing new here economically. All three issues are analogous to claims against other tech companies. But, as I detail below, the evidence to establish any of these claims at best represents harm to competitors, and fails to establish any harm to the competitive process or to consumer welfare. Prioritization Antitrust enforcers have rejected[13] similar prioritization claims against Google. For instance, rivals like Microsoft[14] and Yelp[15] have funded attacks against Google, arguing the search engine is harming competition by prioritizing its own services in its product search results over competitors. As ICLE[16] and affiliated scholars[17] have pointed out, though, there is nothing inherently harmful to consumers about such prioritization. There are also numerous benefits in platforms directly answering queries, even if it ends up directing users to platform-owned products or services.As Geoffrey Manne has observed[18]:there is good reason to believe that Google's decision to favor its own content over that of other sites is procompetitive. Beyond determining and ensuring relevance, Google surely has the prerogative to vigorously compete and to decide how to design its products to keep up with a changing market. In this case, that means designing, developing, and offering its own content to partially displace the original 'ten blue links' design of its search results page and offer its own answers to users' queries in its stead.Here, the antitrust case against Apple for prioritization is similarly flawed. For example, as noted in a recent article in the WSJ[19], users often use the App Store search in order to find apps they already have installed:'Apple customers have a very strong connection to our products and many of them use search as a way to find and open their apps,' Apple said in a statement. 'This customer usage is the reason Apple has strong rankings in search, and it's the same reason Uber, Microsoft and so many others often have high rankings as well.'If a substantial portion of searches within the App Store are for apps already on the iPhone, then showing the Apple app near the top of the search results could easily be consumer welfare-enhancing.Apple is also theoretically leaving money on the table by prioritizing its (already pre-loaded) apps over third party apps. If its algorithm promotes its own apps over those that may earn it a 30% fee \u2014 additional revenue \u2014the prioritization couldn't plausibly be characterized as a 'benefit' to Apple. Apple is ultimately in the business of selling hardware. Losing customers of the iPhone or iPad by prioritizing apps consumers want less would not be a winning business strategy.Further, it stands to reason that those who use an iPhone may have a preference for Apple apps. Such consumers would be naturally better served by seeing Apple's apps prioritized over third-party developer apps. And if consumers do not prefer Apple's apps, rival apps are merely seconds of scrolling away.Moreover, all of the above assumes that Apple is engaging in sufficiently pervasive discrimination through prioritzation to have a major impact on the app ecosystem. But substantial evidence exists that the universe of searches for which Apple's algorithm prioritizes Apple apps is small. For instance, most searches are for branded apps[20] already known by the searcher:Keywords: how many are brands? Top 500: 58.4%Top 400: 60.75%Top 300: 68.33%Top 200: 80.5%Top 100: 86%Top 50: 90%Top 25: 92%Top 10: 100% This is corroborated by data from the NYT's own study[21], which suggests Apple prioritized its own apps first in only roughly 1% of the overall keywords queried:Whatever the precise extent of increase in prioritization, it seems like any claims of harm are undermined by the reality that almost 99% of App Store results don't list Apple apps first.The fact is, very few keyword searches are even allegedly affected by prioritization. And the algorithm is often adjusting to searches for apps already pre-loaded on the device. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to conclude consumers are being harmed by prioritization in search results of the App Store. Entry The issue of Apple building apps to compete with popular apps in its marketplace is similar to complaints about Amazon creating its own brands to compete with what is sold by third parties on its platform. For instance, as reported multiple times in the Washington Post[22]:Clue, a popular app that women use to track their periods, recently rocketed to the top of the App Store charts. But the app's future is now in jeopardy as Apple incorporates period and fertility tracking features into its own free Health app, which comes preinstalled on every device. Clue makes money by selling subscriptions and services in its free app.However, there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about retailers selling their own brands. If anything, entry into the market is normally procompetitive. As Randy Picker[23] recently noted with respect to similar claims against Amazon:The heart of this dynamic isn't new. Sears started its catalogue business in 1888 and then started using the Craftsman and Kenmore brands as in-house brands in 1927. Sears was acquiring inventory from third parties and obviously knew exactly which ones were selling well and presumably made decisions about which markets to enter and which to stay out of based on that information. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, has a number of well-known private brands and firms negotiating with Walmart know full well that Walmart can enter their markets, subject of course to otherwise applicable restraints on entry such as intellectual property laws I think that is possible to tease out advantages that a platform has regarding inventory experimentation. It can outsource some of those costs to third parties, though sophisticated third parties should understand where they can and cannot have a sustainable advantage given Amazon's ability to move to build-or-bought first-party inventory. We have entire bodies of law\u2014 copyright, patent, trademark and more\u2014that limit the ability of competitors to appropriate works, inventions and symbols. Those legal systems draw very carefully considered lines regarding permitted and forbidden uses. And antitrust law generally favors entry into markets and doesn't look to create barriers that block firms, large or small, from entering new markets.If anything, Apple is in an even better position than Amazon. Apple invests revenue in app development, not because the apps themselves generate revenue, but because it wants people to use the hardware, i.e. the iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. The reason Apple created an App Store in the first place is because this allows Apple to make more money from selling devices. In order to promote security on those devices, Apple institutes rules for the App Store, but it ultimately decides whether to create its own apps and provide access to other apps based upon its desire to maximize the value of the device. If Apple chooses to create free apps in order to improve iOS for users and sell more hardware, it is not a harm to competition.Apple's ability to enter into popular app markets should not be constrained unless it can be shown that by giving consumers another choice, consumers are harmed. As noted above, most searches in the App Store are for branded apps to begin with. If consumers already know what they want in an app, it hardly seems harmful for Apple to offer \u2014 and promote \u2014 its own, additional version as well.In the case of Clue, if Apple creates a free health app, it may hurt sales for Clue. But it doesn't hurt consumers who want the functionality and would prefer to get it from Apple for free. This sort of product evolution is not harming competition, but enhancing it. And, it must be noted, Apple doesn't exclude Clue from its devices. If, indeed, Clue offers a better product, or one that some users prefer, they remain able to find it and use it. The so-called App Store 'Tax' The argument that Apple has an unfair competitive advantage over rival apps which have to pay commissions to Apple to be on the App Store (a 'tax' or 'surcharge') has similarly produced no evidence of harm to consumers.Apple invested a lot into building the iPhone and the App Store. This infrastructure has created an incredibly[24] lucrative[25] marketplace[26] for app developers to exploit. And, lest we forget a point fundamental to our legal system, Apple's App Store is its property[27].The WSJ and NYT stories give the impression that Apple uses its commissions on third party apps to reduce competition for its own apps. However, this is inconsistent with how Apple charges its commission[28].For instance, Apple doesn't charge commissions on free apps, which make up 84% of the App Store. Apple also doesn't charge commissions for apps that are free to download but are supported by advertising \u2014 including hugely popular apps like Yelp, Buzzfeed, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook. Even apps which are 'readers' where users purchase or subscribe to content outside the app but use the app to access that content are not subject to commissions, like Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Kindle, and Audible. Apps for 'physical goods and services' \u2014 like Amazon, Airbnb, Lyft, Target, and Uber \u2014 are also free to download and are not subject to commissions. The class of apps which are subject to a 30% commission include: paid apps (like many games),free apps that then have in-app purchases (other games and services like Skype and TikTok),and free apps with digital subscriptions (Pandora, Hulu, which have 30% commission first year and then 15% in subsequent years), andcross-platform apps (Dropbox, Hulu, and Minecraft) which allow for digital goods and services to be purchased in-app and Apple collects commission on in-app sales, but not sales from other platforms. Despite protestations to the contrary, these costs are hardly unreasonable: third party apps receive the benefit not only of being in Apple's App Store (without which they wouldn't have any opportunity to earn revenue from sales on Apple's platform), but also of the features and other investments Apple continues to pour into its platform \u2014investments that make the ecosystem better for consumers and app developers alike. There is enormous value to the platform Apple has invested in, and a great deal of it is willingly shared with developers and consumers. It does not make it anticompetitive to ask those who use the platform to pay for it.In fact, these benefits are probably even more important for smaller developers rather than bigger ones who can invest in the necessary back end to reach consumers without the App Store, like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon Kindle. For apps without brand reputation (and giant marketing budgets), the ability for consumers to trust that downloading the app will not lead to the installation of malware (as often occurs when downloading from the web) is surely essential to small developers' ability to compete. The App Store offers this.Despite the claims made in Spotify's complaint against Apple[29], Apple doesn't have a duty to deal with app developers. Indeed, Apple could theoretically fill the App Store with only apps that it developed itself, like Apple Music. Instead, Apple has opted for a platform business model, which entails the creation of a new outlet for others' innovation and offerings. This is pro-consumer in that it created an entire marketplace that consumers probably didn't even know they wanted \u2014 and certainly had no means to obtain \u2014 until it existed. Spotify, which out-competed iTunes to the point that Apple had to go back to the drawing board and create Apple Music, cannot realistically complain that Apple's entry into music streaming is harmful to competition. Rather, it is precisely what vigorous competition looks like: the creation of more product innovation, lower prices, and arguably (at least for some) higher quality.Interestingly, Spotify is not even subject to the App Store commission. Instead, Spotify offers a work-around[30] to iPhone users to obtain its premium version without ads on iOS. What Spotify actually desires is the ability to sell premium subscriptions to Apple device users without paying anything above the de minimis up-front cost to Apple for the creation and maintenance of the App Store. It is unclear how many potential Spotify users are affected by the inability to directly buy the ad-free version since Spotify discontinued offering it within the App Store. But, whatever the potential harm to Spotify itself, there's little reason to think consumers or competition bear any of it. Conclusion There is no evidence that Apple's alleged 'discrimination' against rival apps harms consumers. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case. The regulatory discrimination against successful tech platforms like Apple and the App Store is far more harmful to consumers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...kname=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...kname=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...kname=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...le=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3FThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...kname=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...kname=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...kname=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F10%2F16%2Fdoes-apples-discrimination-against-rival-apps-in-the-app-store-harm-consumers%2F...le=Does%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CDiscrimination%E2%80%9D%20Against%20Rival%20Apps%20in%20the%20App%20Store%20harm%20Consumers%3FThe</url> post Does Apple's 'Discrimination' Against Rival Apps in the App Store harm Consumers?[31] appeared first on Truth on the Market[32].

In the early 90s, the Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN), a private company, began to operate Time Warner Cable's public access channels for the city of Manhattan. MNN employees DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez produced a film criticizing MNN, and after MNN televised the film, suspended Halleck and Melendez. Halleck sued, claiming her First Amendment rights.</p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh (a conservative appointed by Trump) wrote the opinion of the majority, arguing that even though MNN was a \"state actor\" performing a public function for the city, governments don't traditionally and exclusively provide television channels, so MNN was not bound by the First Amendment.</p><p>\"The relevant function in this case -- operation of public access channels on a cable system--has not traditionally and exclusively been performed by government,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"The Court has stressed that 'very few' functions fall into that category.\"</p><p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor (an Obama liberal) sharply disagreed, pointing out that in the past, SCOTUS has always considered private entities liable to the Constitution if they take over a function for the state. SCOTUS even set a precedent for that in its 1988  West v. Atkins decision, Sotomayor argued.</p><p>\"The Court in West unanimously held that a doctor hired to provide medical care to state prisoners was a state actor,\" Sotomayor wrote, referencing the opinion of former Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative. \"Each State must provide medical care to prisoners, the Court explained, and when a State hires a private doctor to do that job, the doctor becomes a state actor, \"'clothed with the authority of state law.'\" If a doctor hired by the State abuses his role, the harm is 'caused, in the sense relevant for state-action inquiry,' by the State's having incarcerated the prisoner and put his medical care in that doctor's hands. The fact that the doctor was a private contractor, the Court emphasized, made no difference.\"</p><p>So what does this mean for Big Tech? According to one lawyer, David Duncan with Zalkind, Duncan and Bernstein, social media platforms are not and never have been bound by the First Amendment, regardless of this SCOTUS decision.</p><p>\"Anybody who thinks that Facebook is subject to the First Amendment is just wrong, they never have been,\" Duncan told InsideSources. \"[The Constitution] is very clearly addressed to state acton and state public forums, and Facebook never has been.\"</p><p>Even though platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube technically serve as public forums for speech, no government gave those platforms this responsibility, so in Duncan's view, the \"state actor\" argument doesn't apply.</p><p>\"The debate is, is a private entity operating like a public utility, or [is it] managing a public space on behalf of the government,\" Duncan said. \"Where is the line in public/private kind of partnerships going to be drawn between what's a state action and what's not a state action? This is a case where I would say the dissent is correct, but we're talking abut line-drawing. It's really almost a question of how do you characterize these things.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley seemed heavily invested in SCOTUS' decision. The Internet Association -- a lobbying group of which Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter are members -- filed an amicus brief in December 2018 encouraging \"this Court to limit its decision to the unique facts of this case so that its decision does not unintentionally disrupt the modern, innovative internet.\"</p><p>Later in the brief, the Internet Association added, \"this Court should make clear that private property will be deemed a public forum, and the regulation of private property will be deemed a 'public function,' only in extraordinary circumstances,\" suggesting Big Tech companies worry about setting a precedent that would bind them to the First Amendment when moderating content on their platforms.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a Silicon-Valley-based think tank, also filed an amicus brief in December 2018 and also called on SCOTUS to \"rule narrowly, and with an eye toward the application of its ruling in other contexts,\" specifically referencing internet companies.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Many things remain unclear, but most opinions seem to coalesce around two key themes: First, widespread and consistent testing for the virus, and second, contact tracing. Given the economic damage caused by movement restrictions and social distancing, there is no question that we need to seriously consider this to loosen the restrictions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this day and age, where most of the population in the hardest hit countries have a smartphone on them at all times, the technological opportunities for contact tracing are vast, at any rate.</p><p>China, furthest along in loosening its movement restrictions, relies on its deep app ecosystem for tracker apps, used to allow movement of people (entering offices and malls, travelling between regions) based on an individual red/amber/green risk rating.</p><p>Google, for its part, has released aggregated location data showing where stay-at-home orders are being followed and where not.</p><p>Most of these efforts are relatively surface-level, by which I mean that the technology we have available enables far more granular, and hence effective, tracking. But of course, the risk of tumbling into a privacy hellscape is huge.</p><p>This risk is compounded by the various states of emergency and crisis powers enacted in many countries, that erode democratic supervision and that are usually easy to implement quickly but far harder to roll back once they are no longer required.</p><p>Fortunately, technical solutions that balance effective contact tracing and privacy can be built. And as it happens, Apple and Google have announced that they are working together to build such a system at the level of the operating system (OS) in their phones.</p><p>Not only do both companies cover probably 99 per cent of the global smartphone market, having this functionality at the OS level also solves issues with standalone apps using the same concept that have already appeared.</p><p>The way Apple and Google's system would work is by leveraging the Bluetooth technology available on our phones. In a nutshell, whenever one person spends more than 10 minutes in close proximity with someone else, both phones register a pair of keys for that encounter.</p><p>If one of the persons then later tests positive, the system can alert all people that were in contact with the infected person by using these keys. The keys are anonymised so they can't be traced back to the individual user, they are stored on the phone, and are only uploaded to a server with the user's content, to alert other users of the positive test.</p><p>The system Apple and Google propose seems to achieve a commendable balance betweentracking contacts and privacy, and notably, it doesn't rely on GPS location data. Other apps have also gone down this route, such as Singapore's TraceTogether app and the NHS' proposed app.</p><p>However, having this functionality available at the system level solves one key issue, namely that it doesn't require the standalone app to be running at all times in order to log the Bluetooth contacts.</p><p>As a result, contact tracing through this system should be far more systematic and effective, and therefore hopefully able to provide a solid foundation for one of the two preconditions to restarting the economy.</p><p>More broadly, this collaboration between Apple and Google also feels like a departure for the tech industry as a whole. Whichever way you look at it, the technology packed into a tiny device like a smartphone is incredible.</p><p>But until now, it had only been used for relatively trivial (on-demand cars, location tagging) and sometimes seedy (adtech) applications. Now it can suddenly and truly change our lives for the better, in an unprecedented, life-or-death situation.</p><p>As such, the systems and decisions implemented now will determine the relationship between technology and society for years to come. Hence it is all the more important that privacy is carefully considered, and it is encouraging that the two companies that have effectively created the current technological landscape seem to have understood this.</p><p>But it is time for the rest of society to abandon the idea that the advance of technology is ineluctable and that it follows a singular path. Instead, technological advances are determined by regulation, existing institutions and ultimately our values.</p><p>Now more than ever we must actively shape our technology to work for us rather than resignedly accepting it.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

From the government. After years of shady dealing, data collection, and intentionally designing addictive technologies, Zuckerberg has asked the government to regulate tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who do you think will help write all the regulation that regulates all these tech firms? Bureaucrats in Washington won't have enough knowledge of course so they'll have to get it from experts in the tech industry. Lucky tech industry. Now that Facebook and Google et. al. have such huge marketshare, it's time to create barriers to entry and costly regulations that only big existing firms can afford.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the critiques of capitalism from from progressives to traditionalists Catholics is that despite all the talk of free markets, capitalism always ends up in crony capitalism. Supporters of the market economy claim that this is a distortion of capitalism, and that it is government intervention that is the culprit, but this can often sound like the socialist who tells us despite the evidence from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela that real socialism hasn't been tried.</p><p>How should we think about the relationship between capitalism and crony capitalism. It is the case that capitalism always becomes captured by special interests, or can we create and maintain what Luigi Zingales has called capitalism for the people a capitalism that doesn't simply favor the wealthy and well connected at the expense of everyone else?</p><p>The Road to Serfdom or The Road to Crony Capitalism?</p><p>Mike Munger Mario Villareal-Diaz wrote an interesting piece on this topic in the Independent Review.</p><p>(There is a pay wall but there is much more to this article than I am highlighting it is worth money. They ask whether capitalism be sustained in a democracy and use the work of Smith and the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset's book The Revolt of the Masses, which has some profound insights. I use of Gasset's work, especially his idea of the spoiled child of history in my lectures on cultural critiques of capitalism and the victory of socialism. )</p><p>You can also listen to Munger's EconTalk interview with Russ Roberts.</p><p>Munger and Villarreal-Diaz ask If real capitalism exists, is it sustainable? Or does capitalism in a democracy alway devolve into corporatist cronyism?</p><p>The reality is that companies benefit when they go to the government for help and protection.</p><p>At some point point, rational companies cut back on hiring engineers and shift their focus to lawyers and lobbyists. The use of patents, lawsuits, professional licensing, and other regulatory barriers to competitive entry into your industry or product line can produce enormous revenues, even though it adds nothing to the value of the product and does nothing to benefit consumers.</p><p>It's not just companies that benefit. So does the state. Munger summarizes the tendency toward crony capitalism in a follow up piece for the American Institute for Economic Research:</p><p>corporate leaders benefit, monetarily and in the short run, from negotiating favorable legislation and protection from politicians.</p><p>Even if business leaders behave \"irrationally\" and leave that money on the table remember, it's legal to lobby, even if it's immoral it's still true that politicians benefit from making businesses dependent on taxpayer handouts. Businesses that don't play along will be singled out for \"special\" attention, either extra taxes or unwelcome regulation.</p><p>Capitalism for the People</p><p>They are not alone in addressing this problem. There are number of interesting books on the problems of crony capitalism. Luigi Zingales 2012 book Capitalism for the People, Jonathan Tepper's The Myth of Capitalism, Tim Wu's The Curse of Bigness, Hunter Lewis' Crony Capitalism in America are worth reading. They have different perspectives. Some make the case for anti-trust legislation, some think that will make the problem worse.</p><p>As Munger and others have noted, the problem of crony capitalism was identified by the father of modern economics, Adam Smith himself.</p><p>Smith wrote:</p><p>\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"</p><p>Smith argues that it would be violation of liberty, but that law should at least be careful not to facilitate such assemblies.</p><p>Collusion among businessmen is bad enough. It becomes even worse with business and government collude together. This, unfortunately, is the essence of today's political economy, government and business working together for their own interests, what I've called Davos Capitalism.</p><p>Munger and Villareal-Diaz are right that the road to cronyism leads through capitalism. But must it always be so? And is there any solution to it? I think the answer to both questions is yes and no.</p><p>There is no way to create a perfect economy with perfect justice. As long as there are men and women involved, there will be collusion, cheating, and attempts at dishonest gainincluding legal dishonest gain that excludes competition. There is no perfect solution. The best we can do is create a system and solutions that help minimize cronyism and give the widest amount of opportunity to people. This requires rule of law, personal virtue, long-term thinking, and a culture that helps foster these things.</p><p>Munger argues that along with other institutional changes we need to empower entrepreneurs not to want to become rent seekers and to constrain state actors not to sell off rents in the first place.</p><p>This is right, but this requires a radically different concept of the the state-market relationship that we have now, not to mention a profound cultural and moral shift that would include among other things:</p><p>a shift away from the faulty thinking that as long as something is legal, then it must be moral</p><p>a restructuring the current regulatory regimes and the revolving door between business and government</p><p>a reduction in the power and size of the state</p><p>a reduction in the political power, access, and influence of business</p><p>a new vision of a commercial society that promotes real competition and access</p><p>a reconnection of economics and moral philosophy</p><p>The Economy is Embedded in Culture</p><p>Part of the problem is that we have unhinged market economies from any real consideration of morality. This applies to the legal, but unfair and unjust practice of crony capitalism in the regulated sectors of the economy. And some of the practices in the freer, less regulated sectors, notably tech. Those of us who support free and competitive market economies may not like to admit it, but alongside a highly regulated economy, we do have some radical free market ideology in parts of big tech. When you combine the Silicon Valley ethos of radical autonomy, Berkley Buddhism, and morally and socially unhinged techno-utopians with a free market economy, you get, well, Google, Facebook, and what Shoshanna Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. To be clear I am not suggesting that regulation is the best answeras I note above it will, like most other regulation get captured and only institutionalize the corruption.</p><p>This is complicated topic with no immediate or simple solution. The commercial society grew out of a certain culture with certain beliefs and standards. A lot of what we need to do is to re-frame how we think about the economy in the light of human flourishing and the common good. We also need to take seriously the effects of culture on the economy.</p><p>As I wrote 10 years ago in a piece called Davos Capitalism: Adam Smith's Nightmare</p><p>The goal of economic liberty is not a society of producers and consumers in equilibrium. Economic liberty is important because it creates space for people to live out their freedom, take care of their families, and fulfill their responsibilities. Economic freedom is necessary because it allows people to take risks and create material prosperity for a flourishing life. Economic liberty is needed because without it there can be no political liberty. Both require individual virtue and a moral culture for sustenance. Neither an adolescent culture following its whims, nor a soulless culture severed from its historical roots, from the sacrifices and struggles of our fathers whose spirit and dedication to freedom made it possible, is adequate.</p><p>Lord Acton wrote, Liberty is the delicate fruit of a mature civilization. We must begin anew the work of rebuilding the moral cultureone committed to truth, responsibility and a spiritual depth that the Davos Man cannot provide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122856077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW1-R2F1-JCBF-S3S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Paul</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prof. Luigi Zingales argues for journalism as protection against 'crony capitalism'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"One of the busiest corners of the globe at the opening of the year 1872 was a strip of NorthwesternPennsylvania, not over fifty miles long,\" journalist Ida Tarbell wrote in 1902. In the span of just 12 years, those once quiet Pennsylvania hills were overrun with hardy young entrepreneurs seeking to make their fortunes from a new product: petroleum. But the days of bustling competition did not last.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"At the very heyday of this confidence,\" Tarbell went on, \"a big hand reached out from nobody knew where, to steal their conquest and throttle their future.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hand was that of John D. Rockefeller. By 1880, his Standard Oil Company controlled about 90 percent of the oil produced in the United States, including its transport, refining and marketing. Rockefeller pioneered market domination by undercutting prices across all areas of the oil business and buying up his competitors.</p><p>For a cohort of eight journalists on campus at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business last spring, Tarbell's two-year, 19-article expose on Standard Oilwidely considered to be the birth of investigative journalismserved as both inspiration and how-to guide.</p><p>Credited with exposing the deleterious effects of monopolies on society, as well as inspiring government efforts to counter them, Tarbell's muckraking series \"created the political demand for intervention,\" Chicago Booth economist Luigi Zingales explained in an episode of his podcast Capitalisn't. In 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil into 34 individual companies. (Rockefeller, who referred to Tarbell as \"Miss Tar Barrel,\" became the nation's first billionaire and spent the later years of his life giving away much of his fortune, including funds to found the University of Chicago.)</p><p>Journalists and business school professors may seem like strange bedfellows, but not to Zingales, the faculty director of the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State. In 2017, he launched the Stigler Center Journalists in Residence program. For the reporters who participate, it's a taste of the business school experience and a crash course in economic theory: they audit classes, meet scholars, and attend special events.</p><p>Why invest in the next generation of muckraking? Because, in Zingales' view, capitalism depends on it. He believes investigative journalism is a major reason why American capitalism has historically been so successful compared to the \"crony capitalist\" systems that prevail elsewhere. Take his native Italy, where, he has argued, personal connectionsnot merit or competitiondetermine who wins in the marketplace.</p><p>The guiding idea behind the residency is that journalists in the trenchesfiling pieces on the daily and weekly happenings of the business world and exposing special interests that aim to subvert markets for their own gainhelp create a demand to keep markets free.</p><p>\"Inquisitive, daring and influential media outlets willing to take a strong stand against economic power are essential in a competitive capitalist society,\" Zingales wrote in the Financial Times in 2015. \"They are our defense against crony capitalism. When the media outlets in any country fail to challenge power, not only are they not part of the solution, they become part of the problem.\"</p><p>'A period of great ferment'</p><p>The problem is the fragility of capitalism itself. Adam Smith's invisible hand and the free-market laissez-faire approach so famously espoused by Chicago economists can easily be shackled by special interests. These include price-cutting monopolies like Rockefeller's Standard Oil; competition-shy incumbents aiming to deter new market entrants; and rent-seeking corporations that look to the government for an advantage in the marketplace via subsidies or regulatory capturethat is, when laws increase the market advantage for the very firms meant to be regulated.</p><p>It was Nobel Prize winner George J. Stiglerthe UChicago economist who founded his namesake centerwho first questioned the impact of regulation on competition, and who in 1971 put forward the idea that industry \"acquires\" regulation for its benefit. His two-part hypothesis: one, industries will wield whatever political power they have to prevent new competitors from entering the market, and two, regulations will be written to slow those new entrants' growth.</p><p>Before Stigler, regulation had been studied entirely from a content perspectivein other words, how the rules were written to prevent market failure and protect consumers from unfairly high prices. Not questioned was the assumption that regulation itself, particularly of natural monopolies such as public utilities, was necessary. So Stigler and his co-author Claire Friedland, AM'55, took up the study of electricity regulation, aiming to understand the actual outcomes of such controls, as opposed to the intentions. Did regulation keep prices for consumers down? By comparing areas with varying degrees of electricity oversight from the early 1900s to 1960, Stigler found that the price difference was negligible, casting doubt on the need for regulation at all.</p><p>The finding shocked economists. \"I can't tell you how important it was,\" says Prof. Emeritus Sam Peltzman, PhD'65, a former graduate student of Stigler's who took over directing the center after its founder's death in 1991. \"What happened next was a period of great ferment.\"</p><p>Over the subsequent decades, economists followed Stigler's lead in examining the real-world effects of regulation and stopped taking for granted that regulation accomplishes what it intends. Stigler's 1982 Nobel citation states that his work \"resulted in fundamental testing of the forces, purposes and effects\" of legislation.</p><p>Overall, Stigler set in motion an understanding for which Chicago economics has become known: that the outcomes of regulation and government intervention, such as antitrust litigation, are complicated, to say the leastand, at worst, can end up hurting competition and hampering free markets.</p><p>This brings us back to the Stigler Center today, where Zingales is in the surprising position of arguing that the pendulum against antitrust and government regulation has swung too far.</p><p>\"My claim is that part of the change in attitude is due to a change in surroundings,\" he says. \"The world today is completely different from the world in the 1970s.\"</p><p>A little more than a century after Progressive Era figures like Tarbell and Sen. John Sherman intervened against Rockefeller, the economy has cycled through the Great Depression, the increasing regulatory environment of the 1950s and '60s that Stigler studied, and the economic contraction of the 1970s. What followed \"as a result, in part, of the triumph of the ideas of the Chicago school,\" Zingales says, was a reduction in regulation and an era of innovation and economic expansion, lasting until the 200809 meltdown of the financial sector.</p><p>Now the Stigler Center has cast its gaze on Silicon Valley titans such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. This fall, wrapping up a large-scale effort to examine the current shape of economic concentration and its effects in the United States, the center issued its assessment: There is little evidence the market will, or can, rein in these companies' increasingly unchecked power.</p><p>The finding drew from the work of 30 experts from across the country; representing the fields of business, economics, law, and political science, they spent a year researching and debating whether monopoly has reached a worrisome level. The ultimate question was what to do about, to use Tarbell's phrase, the \"big hand\" of tech giants in the marketplace.</p><p>One surprising and much-debated conclusion was to create a digital authority to regulate the industry.</p><p>In May, Yale economist Fiona Scott Morton, who led the Stigler Center group that analyzed the market structure of the digital platforms, quietly delivered the recommendation to the U.S. Senate as part of hearings on digital advertising and competition policy. Zingales spent the summer getting traction on the idea of a digital authority. In September, The New York Times business section trumpeted, \"Chicago School Professor Fights 'Chicago School' Beliefs that Abet Big Tech.\"</p><p>As the economists, law scholars, and political scientists debate, one thing is certain: the Stigler Center's journalists have been all ears. The purpose of the residency program, after all, is to educate the journalists. How they use what they learn is up to them.</p><p>Not very 'Stiglerian'</p><p>All spring, Adam Creighton was on fire with the ideas he was encountering at UChicago. The economics editor for The Australian and a 2019 Stigler Center journalist in residence, Creighton filed stories and columns that bore the fingerprints of the classes he was taking and scholars he'd met during his 12 weeks in Hyde Park. In one piece he argued that patents create \"artificial monopolies\"; in another, a critique of Australia's retirement savings system, he cited UChicago's own Eugene Fama and Richard Thaler.</p><p>On campus, at the noontime seminar of the spring 2019 quarter, this year's journalists gathered with Chicago Booth's Austan Goolsbee, who chaired President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and is the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics. Xinning Liu of the Financial Times asked about the U.S.-China trade war, trying to understand the real-time and potential long-term implications of President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Other journalists peppered Goolsbee with equally timely questionsabout the outcomes of a recent Federal Reserve conference, the student debt bubble, the viability of the wealth tax, universal basic income, and his favorite in the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>Asked what he thought of the idea of a digital authority, Goolsbee wondered aloud how it would work in practice.</p><p>After the session, Creighton gave his own take on the proposed digital authority: \"It's not very 'Stiglerian.'\"</p><p>The comment doesn't faze Zingales. \"I think, and I'm sure I'm not alone here, that the contribution of Stigler is great, but mostly to learn what we should not do,\" he says later, back in his office.</p><p>Stigler's work shouldn't be used as a justification for sitting back and doing nothing, Zingales argues: \"I think that the absence of regulation can be as bad as, and sometimes worse than, bad regulations. ... I'm very happy to come to a conclusion, if you convince me, that maybe the intervention is not worth the effort. But starting with the presumption that nothing can be done? That's the kind of ideological block that I would like to avoid.\"</p><p>Zingales notes that Stigler's views also evolved to fit the times, citing the economist's 1952 Fortune magazine article \"The Case Against Big Business.\" In it, Stigler argued for breaking up large corporations when necessary, writing, \"This, I would emphasize, is the minimum program, and it is essentially a conservative program.\"</p><p>He lets Stigler's statement sink in.</p><p>\"Wait a minute,\" Zingales says, \"what is so conservative about that?\"</p><p>In 1952, Stigler saw no economies of scale in big business and argued that it was better to break up than to regulate large firms. But those ideas evolved under the influence of another UChicago economist, the late Harold Demsetz, who established that big business tends to be more efficient.</p><p>Zingales' point: What's conservative depends on the evidence and the contextand maybe what's \"Stiglerian\" does too.</p><p>\"If the world around you changes, you should change your prescriptions,\" he says. \"If you don't, it's called ideology. ... I don't say, 'Whatever Stigler said in 1970, it cannot be changed.' That's religion, not research.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123420177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYT-N4H1-DYTH-G176-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1968\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts unleashed the most aggressive attack to date on Amazon, Facebook and Google, pledging that if she becomes president in 2020 she will break each of those companies apart and rein in others that have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The senator's threat sent shock waves through Silicon Valley, where for years, tech companies enjoyed close ties to national Democrats who wanted to burnish their digital credentials and benefit from tech executives' deep pockets. The result long had been lax regulation of the industry - something Warren's proposal would end.</p><p>Tech experts said they fear other Democratic presidential hopefuls soon would follow her lead.</p><p>\"I don't believe this will be an out-of-the-mainstream proposal in 2020,\" said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank whose board of directors includes representatives from Apple, Microsoft, Google and other tech companies.</p><p>Calling Warren's plan \"appalling,\" Atkinson said of the tech industry's ties to Democrats: \"Not only is the honeymoon over, but they're in divorce court.\"</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Warren's proposal illustrates the tech industry's political fall from grace as policymakers grapple with the ills posed by Silicon Valley - from job losses threatened by the rise of automation to the spread of malicious falsehoods online. In recent years, members of Congress have grown frustrated with the privacy mishaps at Facebook, which is now facing the prospect of a multibillion-dollar fine for mishandling its users' data. And the concern is bipartisan: A key federal watchdog agency in the Trump administration just this month commissioned a new task force to study if big tech had become too big.</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, then-candidate Barack Obama famously appeared at Google headquarters during the early days of his 2008 campaign, hoping to tout his tech savviness particularly with younger voters. Now, though, the party's White House aspirants in 2020 have become some of the Valley's fiercest critics in pursuit of a different political edge. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), for example, broadly has decried the \"major monopoly problem\" in the United States - particularly with big tech. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, has tangled specifically with Amazon over its treatment of workers.</p><p>Spokesmen for Klobuchar and Sanders did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, who has bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford University, last year raised concerns about corporate consolidation across industries, including tech. But Booker, a regular patron of the Bay Area, has long raised considerable money from the tech industry. His office declined to comment.</p><p>             Warren's new pledge, which was published on the Medium website, has two key elements. First, the Democratic lawmaker said her administration would appoint \"regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>Second, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services - such as Amazon's marketplace for goods - as \"platform utilities,\" which would have to be spun off from those tech giants' other businesses. In effect, it could theoretically stop the e-commerce giant from making, selling and promoting clothes, toys or other goods alongside those same offerings from competitors on its website, a ban that's meant to embolden Amazon's rivals.</p><p>Warren unveiled her blueprint before she spoke to supporters in Long Island City, New York, where Amazon initially sought to construct one of two new headquarters. The company ultimately withdrew from the city amid staunch local opposition and fierce criticism from national figures, including Warren, who said Amazon had received \"taxpayer bribes\" from New York. She has not yet introduced her proposal as a bill in Congress, where it would likely face heavy opposition.</p><p>\"We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\" she wrote in her post.</p><p>Recognizing the stakes, the tech industry's advocates in Washington quickly blasted Warren's proposal. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, said it was an \"unwarranted and extreme proposal, which focuses on a highly admired and highly performing sector.\" In a statement, Ed Black, the president of the group, added that it \"is misaligned with progressive values, many of which are shared within the tech industry.\"</p><p>Supporters, meanwhile, said Warren's antitrust pledge drew inspiration from history. In 1933, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, a law that forced banks to separate commercial and investment activities. Even today, banks are not permitted to control shopping chains, said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor and a critic of large tech firms, though Glass-Steagall was essentially repealed during the Bill Clinton presidency.</p><p>Wu and others also said AT&amp;T offers a historical model for the kind of breakup Warren is proposing for the tech industry. In the 1980s, the U.S. government moved to split apart AT&amp;T's telecom monopoly, severing its long-distance service from what became seven regional \"Baby Bells.\" Before the breakup, AT&amp;T controlled virtually every aspect of a consumer's telephone experience, from owning the handset in Americans' homes to operating the switches that connected their calls.</p><p>Warren's proposal also draws inspiration more recently from a forthcoming law article written by Lina Khan, an advocate of more aggressive antitrust enforcement, according to several people familiar with Warren's plan who requested anonymity to speak openly about her efforts. Khan helped renew an academic debate about large tech companies with an essay on Amazon in the Yale Law Journal in 2017.          </p><p>To that end, the senator's proposal foretells a looming struggle among Democrats over how far to distance themselves from an industry they once considered an ally, according to Hal Singer, an economist at George Washington University's Institute of Public Policy.</p><p>\"This is going to be a fight for the soul of the Democratic party,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8464d1e198fc4da7a6b52faf639ef503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKK-73P1-JB4M-V46N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><timeReceived>2:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Do you see anything about Medicare for All, or even about health care? by Thomas NeuburgerDoes presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren support Medicare for All? I mean this as an actual question. </p><p>I don't know the answer \u2014 or I think I know and I'm not sure \u2014 and I'd appreciate it if someone pinned her down on this. In the meantime I've been seeing articles like this one from Jacobin, \"Elizabeth Warren Has a Plan for Everything \u2014 Except Health Care[1],\" which suggest that she may not.Let's start with the Issues page[2] at Warren's campaign website. Unless I missed it, I found nothing about health care (see image at the top). The \"Rebuild the Middle Class[3]\" topic includes strong proposals for antitrust enforcement[4], her Ultra-Millionaire Tax[5] plan, universal childcare[6], and a plan for housing[7]. Nothing though about addressing the health care crisis.\"Latest Announcements[8]\" lists 21 proposals ranging from \"Economic Patriotism[9]\" and green manufacturing[10] to the aforementioned \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax.\" The only topic that seems to touch health care is this one: Tackling the Opioid Crisis Head On[11]: Every day, 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose. This is a public health crisis - and we need to start treating it like one. That's why Congressman Elijah Cummings and I are rolling out the CARE Act, a comprehensive plan that invests $100 billion over the next ten years in states and communities that are on the frontlines of the epidemic - to provide prevention, treatment, and recovery services for those who need it most.An important proposal to be sure, but it's not a health care plan. The website appears to have no stated comprehensive health care proposal at all. Her campaign appearances are not more clarifying. As Jacobin writer Tim Higginbotham observes: Warren had several opportunities in the [March 18 CNN] town hall to address the health care crisis. Instead, she avoided the topic almost entirely. Even when discussing issues directly related to health care like repealing the Hyde Amendment and improving access to hearing aides, she neglected to propose a comprehensive policy solution. ... [This] continues a disturbing trend with the Warren campaign ... you'll hear the usual platitudes ('health care is a human right;' 'everyone deserves access to care'), but you won't hear her endorse a specific policy.The March 18 CNN Town Hall is an excellent example of Higginbotham's observation. Below is Warren's complete response to a Medicare for All question[12]. Note first that the questioner starts by worrying that the Medicare for All bill, which Warren cosponsors and presumably supports, would eliminate private insurance plans. Then noe that the question is succinct \u2014 \"Can you explain how Medicare for All would be better for workers than simply improving the Affordable Care Act?\"I don't see an answer to that question in her answer (emphasis mine throughout): QUESTION: Senator Warren, thank you so much for being here this evening and your tireless advocacy for universal health care. As a supporter of universal health care and an advocate for organized labor, I do worry about the current bills' elimination of private health insurance...WARREN: Oh, yeah.QUESTION: ... that would eliminate the private health employer-based plans that so many unions have advocated for. Can you explain how Medicare for All would be better for workers than simply improving the Affordable Care Act?WARREN: OK, so it's a good question. Let's start with our statement that we should make every time we start to talk about changes in our health care, and that is health care is a basic human right and we fight for basic human rights.(APPLAUSE)And then let's put these in order, because I appreciate that your question starts with the Affordable Care Act. Let's all remember when we're talking about what's possible, let's start where we are and the difference between Democrats and Republicans.Right now, Democrats are trying to figure out how to expand health care coverage at the lowest possible cost so everybody is covered. To interrupt for a moment: This is not an accurate statement of what Medicare for All is about. Medicare for All is instead an implementation of what she said earlier in this exchange, that \"health care is a basic human right.\" Finding the lowest-cost solution among a suite of solutions is a neoliberal approach, not an FDR social insurance approach. But to continue: WARREN: Republicans right this minute are out there trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They've got a lawsuit pending down in Texas where they're trying to roll it back. What they couldn't do with a vote, they're trying to do with the courts. HHS every day is doing what they can to undermine the Affordable Care Act.So when we're talking about health care in America right now, the first thing we need to be talking about is defend the Affordable Care Act, protection under the Affordable Care Act.(APPLAUSE)Then part two. Let's make the improvements that are what I think of as low-hanging fruit. For example, let's bring down the cost of prescription drugs all across this country.(APPLAUSE)We got lots of ways we can do that. We can import drugs from Canada where the safety standards are the same. That would cut costs dramatically. We can negotiate the prices under Medicare. That would cut costs dramatically.And I've got a proposal to help bring down the cost on generic drugs, which could be about 90 percent of all prescriptions. So let's get those costs down.And then you know what you're going to hear from a consumer advocate, and that is we need to hold insurance companies accountable. And that means no tricking and trapping people on those insurance contracts.(APPLAUSE)And then when we talk about Medicare for all, there are a lot of different pathways. What we're all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure everybody gets covered. And some folks are talking about let's start lowering the age, maybe bring it down to 60, 55, 50. That helps cover people who are most at risk and can be helpful, for example, to the labor's plans.Some people say, do it the other way. Let's bring it up from \u2014 everybody under 30 gets covered by Medicare. Others say let employees be able to buy into the Medicare plans. Others say let's let employees buy into the Medicare plans.For me, what's key is we get everybody at the table on this, that labor is at the table, that people who have to buy on their own, everybody comes to the table together. And we figure out how to do Medicare for All in a way that makes sure that we're going to get 100 percent coverage in this country at the lowest possible cost for everyone. That's our job. Does \"everyone at the table\" include the health insurance companies? Note, by the way, that of this list of options, none receives her endorsement; they are presented merely as possibilities. What would a President Warren actually do? We still don't know. About this exchange, Higginbotham says: \"Taking this answer at face value, it seems Warren sees herself pursuing an incremental approach that expands public coverage while preserving the private insurance industry should she be elected president. This would likely surprise many of her supporters, who might view her cosponsorship of Sanders's Medicare for All bill as an endorsement of single-payer health care.\"Apparently, Jake Tapper didn't see an answer in her answer either, so he follows up by re-asking the question: TAPPER: If I could just follow up a little on Jay's question, so you are a co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All bill, and I understand there are a lot of different paths to universal coverage, but his bill that you've co-sponsored would essentially eliminate private insurance. Is that something you could support?WARREN: He's got a runway for that. I think we get everybody together. And that's what it is, we'll decide. I've also co-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as another approach that we use. But what's really important to me about this is we never lose sight of what the center is, because the center is about making sure that every single person in this country gets the coverage they need and that it's at a price that they can afford. We start with our values, we'll get to the right place.(APPLAUSE)TAPPER: So, theoretically, though, there could be a role for private insurance companies under President Warren?WARREN: There could. Or there could be a temporary role. Even Bernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's \u2014 look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure that we land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. Everybody has got to stay covered. It's critical. Quite simply, I don't hear in any of those words the support for Medicare for All that's widely assumed to be her position.What is Elizabeth Warren's actual plan for addressing the health care crisis in America? Is it anything like the Sanders and Jayapal proposals, or is she shielding with words and options her actual preference, which sounds suspiciously like a free-market-with-regulation plan?If the latter, she should say so, because currently it looks like she's obfuscating, a dangerous approach for someone with her otherwise progressive credibility. I think it's time Elizabeth Warren's team announced her actual position.

Should Congress step in to protect your privacy?</p><p>Whenever Phoebe Companion-Racicot, 15, downloads an app on her phone and sees the option to log in with Facebook, she does it. After all, it's easier than creating a whole new account for the app. But it does make Phoebe a little suspicious.</p><p>\"It worries me that someone is getting a hold of my information and I don't know what they are doing with it,\" says the 11th-grader at Colchester High School in Vermont.</p><p>She's not alone. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the detailed personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users wound up in the hands of a voter-profiling firm called Cambridge Analytica. The company obtained the data when users logged into a quiz app with their Facebook accounts. The information--including location data, private messages, and lists of every Facebook page users had ever liked--was later used to build profiles of potential voters for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>The revelation that so much private Facebook data had been harvested without users' knowledge or consent sparked outrage and led many to question whether big tech companies know too much about us. Some lawmakers are now calling for regulations that would require companies to be more transparent about how much of our data they're collecting, who that information could be shared with, and for what purposes it could be used.</p><p>\"Facebook can learn almost anything about you by using artificial intelligence to analyze your behavior,\" says Peter Eckersley, the chief computer scientist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \"That knowledge turns out to be perfect both for advertising and propaganda.\"</p><p>'Data Crunchers'</p><p>Practically everything you do online can be tracked, and much of it is. Facebook, as well as Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012, monitors users' every action on the sites: everything they like and post, their conversations, locations, and much more (see \"What Facebook Knows About Me,\" p. 17). In fact, the company is so adept at gathering users' information that it can pinpoint when they're feeling \"stressed,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"anxious,\" and like \"a failure.\"</p><p>Google, with its range of products including Gmail, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and the Android operating system, is able to gather even more user information on people--everything from your entire search history on the web and where you live to the destination of your last vacation. Google Home, the smart speaker and voice assistant, has recordings of everything you've ever said to it, including all the times you've asked it to turn on or off your lights and how many times you've asked to listen to Rihanna's newest track (as does Amazon's Alexa).</p><p>Collecting this data is a big part of how Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies make money. Though Facebook and Google don't sell your data, they do sell access to you. Companies pay Facebook and Google to place ads on those sites, using the data that's been gathered to target consumers who may be interested in their products. For example, a company that sells athletic gear may post an ad on Facebook that gets shown to people whose interests include sports. Last year, Facebook generated $40 billion in online ad revenue--second only to Google's $95 billion.</p><p>Countless more companies use web cookies and other trackers that load in people's web browsers to collect information about their browsing activities. That's why you might see an advertisement show up on websites for the exact product you had just been searching for online.</p><p>\"It's not just companies like Facebook and Google,\" says Jamie Winterton, a cybersecurity expert at Arizona State University. \"There's a whole other slew of trackers and data crunchers that also sit in the back of the room, so to speak, and watch everything that's going on and build these data profiles not only of individuals but of populations of people.\"</p><p>Facebook, for its part, notes that when users sign up for an account, they must agree to the company's data policy. Still, many of Facebook's 2.2 billion users have no idea how much data it and other companies collect about them and how these companies use or share that data. Media watchdog groups say the information is typically buried in the terms and conditions, which people often accept without reading.</p><p>Senators Weigh In</p><p>In April, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, introduced a bill that would help address this issue. It would require websites to provide users a copy of the data that's being collected on them, as well as a list of who has had access to their data.</p><p>Two other senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, introduced a separate bill that would force companies to get consent to share or sell personal data.</p><p>In Europe, strict regulations already went into effect in May. The European Union passed new laws that require companies to explain in simple language how they plan to use and share people's personal information. And tech companies must ask for users' consent for their data.</p><p>While some U.S. lawmakers have cautioned against moving too quickly to adopt regulations before understanding how they would affect American tech companies, many privacy experts say such regulations are necessary to keep internet users' privacy secure. They argue that the Cambridge Analytica scandal makes it clear that if people's data ends up in certain hands, it could be used not just for targeting ads but also for more questionable purposes, such as trying to sway an election.</p><p>\"The Cambridge Analytica story is an example of why it can matter,\" says Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>\"This data can be used to manipulate us, it can be used in a discriminatory fashion, it can be abused if it's very personal information.\"</p><p>Of course, political campaigns, government agencies such as the Census Bureau, and advertisers have always tried to gather data on people. But the information they were previously able to collect was in broad statistical categories--things like age, sex, and race. Using Facebook, Cambridge Analytica was able to gain a far deeper understanding of individuals through what's called psychographic data, which includes interests, hobbies, and even people's opinions. And experts say companies will only get better at analyzing all of this data in the future.</p><p>\"There's no question that political campaigns and a lot of other people want to gather as much information as they can and want to track us,\" says Stanley, \"but now they increasingly have the ability.\"</p><p>'A Right to Privacy'</p><p>All that tracking can provide benefits to consumers. For example, it allows Instagram to suggest memes and videos users might be interested in, based on photos they've liked. It enables sites like Facebook and Snapchat to be free to use, since they're able to make money from ads. Plus, advertisers argue, wouldn't you prefer to see an ad for something you're interested in rather than for a totally random product?</p><p>\"The data that people give is extremely helpful in order for you to get more-relevant offers, deals, opportunities that you potentially want,\" says Ben LeDonni, CEO of the digital marketing agency Creative Multimedia Solutions. But he adds that \"with power comes great responsibility, and data is power.\"</p><p>In testimony before Congress in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it's \"inevitable\" that there will be some regulations and agreed that the company needs to \"step up and do more\" to protect people's information. And Facebook has taken measures to do this. It's banning apps from accessing personal information, like a user's religious or political views. And it's launching a new \"privacy dashboard\" to give users more control over their privacy settings.</p><p>Regardless of what steps companies and lawmakers take to safeguard information, experts say, everyone should gain a better understanding of how they can control their privacy settings (see \"Taking Control of Your Data,\" facing page).</p><p>\"People have a right to privacy,\" says Winterton, the cybersecurity expert, \"and people have a right to decide what that means for them.\"</p><p>With reporting by Natasha Singer of The New York Times.</p><p>Social Media BY THE NUMBERS</p><p>2.2 billion</p><p>NUMBER of monthly active Facebook users</p><p>SOURCE: STATISTS</p><p>79%</p><p>PERCENTAGE of teens who use Snapchat--the most popular social media site among young people</p><p>SOURCE: STATISTA</p><p>95 million</p><p>NUMBER of photos and videos shared per day, on average, on Instagram</p><p>SOURCE: INSTAGRAM</p><p>200</p><p>NUMBER of apps suspended by Facebook in May for possible data \"misuse\"</p><p>SOURCE: REUTERS</p><p>TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR DATA</p><p>Here are some steps vou can take to limit the data you share with companies</p><p>DENY ACCESS</p><p>When you install an app on your phone, you're asked to allow that app certain permissions, such as access to your photos or microphone. Some of these permissions are necessary for an app to function. For example, Snapchat wouldn't be useful without access to your camera. But some apps ask for permissions they don't really need.</p><p>OPT OUT</p><p>You can see which apps have access to your Facebook data by going to the \"apps\" option in your \"settings.\" You can cut off apps from gaining your data by tapping the \"X\" button next to the app. You can also control which apps have access to your Google account by going to the \"Apps with access to your account\" page.</p><p>CRUNCH COOKIES</p><p>Third-party cookies allow companies to dig up data on internet users. Most internet browsers allow you to delete or limit cookies. Search under \"Tools\" or \"Settings\" for a \"Privacy\" category. Blocking all cookies may make it difficult to use some websites, so look for a setting that blocks third-party cookies.</p><p>WHAT FACEBOOK KNOWS ABOUT ME</p><p>An Upfront staffer downloaded the information that Facebook has on him. The results were frightening.</p><p>BY GREG GOTFRIEND</p><p>If you want to find out what Facebook knows about you, the company has now made it easy, providing a tool on its site. But be forewarned: It might creep you out, as it did me when I recently downloaded my data.</p><p>Starting when I created my account on July 28, 2009, Facebook has been keeping track of every one of my likes, posts, photos, and searches. It knows what ads have appeared on my page and whether I've clicked on them. It knows all of the contacts on my phone--names and numbers. It knows that I'm a runner (because of my connected app Runkeeper), some of my television habits (I liked Conan O'Brien's page), and some of my favorite restaurants and stores (I've clicked on an ad for Chick-fil-A and searched for Nike). That's impressive, but also terrifying.</p><p>It knows more intimate details too. If I searched for someone--perhaps a crush, dozens of times too many--Facebook has kept count, and it knows whether she ever searched for me. Luckily, I never connected my Location Services to the app, so Facebook doesn't know my location every second of every day. But it does have a record of every city I've ever logged in from.</p><p>By joining Facebook, I know that every move I make has the possibility of being tracked. But seeing everything laid out in front of me is jarring, to say the least. All of my information--including the unique numerical code that Facebook assigned to me, which enables it to recognize my face in photos--is right there for Big Brother. It feels as though I gave up a good chunk of my identity just to view videos of puppies and argue with family members about politics.</p><p>To see what Facebook has on you, go to the desktop version of the site and click \"Settings\" in the drop-down menu on the right side of the screen. Underneath \"General Account</p><p>Settings,\" choose the link to \"Download a copy of your Facebook data.\" From there, you just need to click \"Create File,\" and after a bit of downloading, you can cringe at posts Facebook has archived from your first day on the site. Good luck--and brace yourself. (Greg, an intern at Upfront, is studying for his master's degree in journalism at Columbia University.)</p><p>Caption: Many apps ask for access to personal information when you start using them.</p><p>LESSON PLAN: CLOSE READING</p><p>MEDIA LITERACY PAGES 14-17 Lexile levels available online</p><p>Does Facebook Know Too Much?</p><p>Facebook, Google, and other tech companies are tracking your every move.

The author means that until now, information about how much data companies are collecting, who that information could be shared with, and for what purposes it could be used has only appeared in the fine print. Some lawmakers want companies to have to reveal this kind of information in a more straightforward way, not just bury it in a terms-and-conditions page that few people read in full.)</p><p>* How does the author support the claim that data collection by tech companies may offer some benefits to consumers?</p><p>Analyze claims, cite text evidence</p><p>(One way in which the author supports the claim is with examples. He notes that sites like Instagram use data to suggest memes or videos that individual users might like. And he points out that the tailored ads that Facebook and Snapchat sell based on user data enable these sites to remain free. The author also uses a quote from a CEO of a marketing agency to support the claim. The CEO, Ben LeDonni, says that data collection lets companies offer \"opportunities that [consumers] potentially want.\")</p><p>* Advertisers, government agencies, and political campaigns have always collected information on people. How have their efforts changed in recent years, according to the article?</p><p>Compare and contrast</p><p>(The article notes that the kind of data available to advertisers, agencies, and campaigns has changed.

The policy was created to address a simmering controversy surrounding NFL players' behavior during the anthem. The controversy began two years ago, when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt on the sidelines during the anthem to protest police brutality against African-Americans. Several other players followed suit. Many Americans, including President Donald Trump, were angered by the anthem protests, which they viewed as unpatriotic and disrespectful to America's troops. Many other Americans sided with the protesting players, saying that protesting inequality is just as American as standing for the anthem. The NFL hopes that the new policy will mean less attention on the anthem issue.</p><p>SHARE KEY IDEAS: Give only the major points from the text.

Frank[1] The role of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is to protect the public[2] by regulating the Telecom Industry. Because they don't do this often - if ever - they have been labelled a 'Captured Agency[3].' This label is not new to the Trump administration. </p><p>Activist Post has already reported this week about the noise[4] and stink[5] made recently by former FCC Chairman and 5G proponent, Tom Wheeler[6]. Old Tommy Boy worked for Big Telecom and Big Cable before and after being FCC Chairman under Obama. Increasing issues, widespread opposition[7], and research proving harm[8] hasn't deterred him from continuing to champion 5G technology[9]. Of course, that's to be expected. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, however, currently works for the American people. Unfortunately, he acts more like a salesman for Big Telecom and Big Tech than a government regulator.From Fierce Wireless:FCC Commissioner Carr talks infrastructure, spectrum and jobs needed for 5G[10] Regulators at the FCC are taking action around infrastructure, spectrumand jobs to speed the deployment of 5G nationwide. 'We need to update and modernize our rules,' he said. 'The old rules that were in place during the 3G and 4G deployments of the past are simply not up to speed when it comes to the massive new deployment of small cells and other next-generation infrastructure that we need to see to support 5G.' There are roughly 300,000 cell sites across the country today, but 5G is going to require a 10- to 100-fold increase in cell sites, according to Carr. As such, the FCC has updated environmental preservation review procedures and historic preservation rules by excluding small cells, which will comprise the bulk of 5G infrastructure and put a cap on how long local governments can take to act on applications for adding a small cell to an existing antenna.Download Your First Issue Free!

Download Your Free Copy of Counter Markets'The finish line is not the first time we see 5G deployments,' he said. 'The finish line is making sure that every single community in the country has a fair shot at seeing these next-generation 5G networks. In too many cases, a handful of outlier cities were charging exorbitant fees and taking too long to review applications looking to deploy small cells and other 5G infrastructure.'[embedded content] Countless communities in the U.S. and around the world DO NOT want 5G[11] for a variety of reasons. A 5G court case was won[12] in Gateshead, England last year after 5G had been installed in street lamps and residents became sick. Some women had stillbirths. This has obviously not fazed Carr and the rest of the FCC who has resorted to forcing 5G on Americans anyway. It's gross - to say the least.Activist Post Daily NewsletterSubscription is FREE and CONFIDENTIAL Free Report: How To Survive The Job Automation Apocalypse with subscription [ 1]: <url

But can this freedom to build large enterprises turn consumers into prisoners?</p><p>For the Democratic members of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, the answer is a resounding \"yes\".</p><p>Jerrold Nadler, committee chairman, likened the current dominance of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple over the digital economy to the railroad monopolies of the 19th century.</p><p>\"Concentration of power is dangerous to a democratic country,\" Mr Nadler said.</p><p>Just as the railroad barons \"sowed fury and despair across the country\", the big four tech giants had left \"businesses in fear of exclusion from these platforms\", he said.</p><p>David Cicilline, another Democrat, said that monopoly power was \"incompatible with democracy\". Each of the big four controlled digital \"bottlenecks\" and had the \"power and incentive\" to exploit consumers and businesses in \"harmful and destructive ways\" . They \"stifled creativity and innovation\" by acquiring or copying putative rivals, he said.</p><p>The hearing is the culmination of 13 months of investigation into the power of the four companies over the digital economy.</p><p>Each company faces its own lengthy list of complaints, from abusing their market positions to trampling on privacy and free speech rights. But the thrust of the investigation is that the quartet, which are collectively worth nearly $5 trillion, hold too great a sway over consumers and have the ability to crush smaller rivals when they start to become a threat.</p><p>Jeff Bezos wrapped himself in the American flag as he rebutted accusations that Amazon is a profit-gouging monopolist. He pointed to his adoptive father, who came to the US as a 16-year-old from Fidel Castro's Cuba and built a successful life in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \"The rest of the world would like the tiniest sip of the elixir we have,\" said Mr Bezos, 56, the world's richest man.</p><p>He suggested that America alone could create the conditions that enabled him to grow Amazon from a humble bookseller into the goliath it is today. \"It feels like yesterday that I was driving packages to the post office myself,\" Mr Bezos said.</p><p>The committee is expected to produce a report on its investigation in the autumn, which could inform new regulations for the tech sector.</p><p>The big four are also subject to federal investigations.</p><p>                   Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-64819947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G6-YK81-JCJY-G45V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"430\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;
