And they say, no, no, he's the one that causes that fight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And he comes in and he talks about his country, but then they have a picture of him five days sooner walking up, flying the national flag of their country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, if he's so afraid of his country, why is he flying the flag of the country, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  My opening monologue coming up in just a minute.</p><p>But, first, we go right back to the president.  He is in Panama City Beach at a rally in Florida.  Stay with us.</p><p>TRUMP:  -- our border, save that flag, we love our country.  We love our country but we're afraid of it.  For purposes of getting into the United States, we are afraid of our country.</p><p>Now, we can't let this happen.  The Democrats, we need the votes.  We need the votes.  Otherwise, you are going to have to vote them out of office -- Congress, the Senate, you're going to have to vote them out of office.  Come November, next November, November 3rd next year, you're going to have to vote them out of office because otherwise you can't make a chase.  We need the votes.  We have to go through Congress.</p><p>However, we ended with this is incredible.  But they don't mind it so much because they do not mind crime.  They don't mind crime.  No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws and no one should run for office without an ironclad plan to protect and defend American's borders.  They shouldn't be allowed to run.</p><p>And to confront this crisis -- you saw that!  It was a big deal two months ago.  I declared a national emergency, which is what it is.  This is an invasion.</p><p>When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion.  I was badly criticized for using the word \"invasion.\"  It's an invasion.</p><p>And it's also in the invasion of drugs coming in from Mexico, OK?  It's an invasion of drugs.  They all better be careful, because, you know, we are destroying the lives of hundreds and thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border.  They better damn well be careful because people are wise to it now.</p><p>They have drug dens and drug labs in factories right along the border.  They make the crack right there and send it over our border what we don't have walls.  They drive it right through because we have 2,000 miles between the Gulf and the Pacific, 2,000 miles!</p><p>Now, a lot of it, you don't need the wall because its mountains, big strong rivers, it's snake country.  Nobody's walking to certain areas.  You've got to like snakes a lot.</p><p>It's a rough country.  But what we need and what we have done, but they can't do this.  They can't let this happen.  We've been very tough with them, I will be honest.</p><p>Mexico made $100 billion on average over the past ten years, 100 billion!  They took 30 percent -- almost -- of our automobile business.  We make cars.  They send them to the United States.  That won't happen anymore under the USMCA.  It will be prohibited.  It'll be economically prohibited.</p><p>Our current immigration crisis is the result of Democrat back policies that prevent border policies from being swiftly returned home.  A border crosser comes in, you say, sorry, we are taking your home.  That sounds nice.  I want to do that, OK?</p><p>But we are the only one that has judges.  Judges -- think about it.  They come across, they have judges.  Nobody else has judges.  We give them a trial.  We need Perry Mason.  It's crazy.  Folks, it's crazy.</p><p>And then they say, and the wall would help.  It would not help, but the wall would stop it.  When you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great -- and don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons but we can't.  Other countries do.  We can't.  I would never do that.</p><p>But how do you stop these people?  You can't.  There's -- that's only in the panhandle you can get away with that, folks.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Only in the panhandle!  So it's a tough situation.  But if they change the loopholes, we'll have it perfectly.  When the wall is finished, it's going to be great.  Democrats even supported deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets.  They are protected.</p><p>Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congress must act to fix our horrible immigration laws.  We must end catch-and-release.  Stop human smugglers.</p><p>Have you seen what's happening?  Human smugglers, human traffickers -- have you seen what they are doing?  This is an ancient thing.  It's an ancient crime.</p><p>It's bigger now because of the computer, the Internet than ever before, worldwide!  Not just here, worldwide, and most come through our southern border where we don't have a wall.  They don't go through ports of entry -- you have people looking inside the cars.  You can't do that.</p><p>If you have women tied up with tape over their mouths, you can take them through a port of entry.  And a lot of these people say, they come to the ports -- they don't come through the port.  They come to areas where you don't have the wall.  Fifteen miles up, make a left.</p><p>We've got to shut down century cities.  Deport criminal aliens and replace the visa lottery, the chain migration, with a modern system of immigration.  We have to do it.</p><p>On issue after issue, the Democrat Party has never been further outside the American mainstream.  It's never been.  I've never been that I've never heard of anything like what's going on.  I want to run so badly.  I want to don't make this race to start immediately.</p><p>Now, Democrats are pushing a $100 trillion takeover of the U.S. economy, known as the Green New Deal.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>That was written up by a real genius.</p><p>The Democrat Party believes in socialism.  Take a look at Venezuela.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>Republicans believe in freedom.  We need to get senators elected.  We need to get the votes.  We need congressmen and women elected, Republicans, we need to get the votes.</p><p>You've got to get out of there.  You got to work.  Otherwise we'll be playing around for too long.</p><p>And Democrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mothers' wombs, right up until the moment of birth.</p><p>And then you have this governor in Virginia, you saw that?  The baby is born, and you wrap the baby beautifully, and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby.  Oh, can't do that.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>So who heard of that one, that came up and that's now something -- and they don't even want to discuss it.  They don't even want to discuss it.</p><p>And to protect innocent life, I call on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, witch hunts, and delusions.</p><p>The Republican Party is the party for all Americans.  We want to make America great again.  That's what we are doing.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>Will you please show these people?  I go home, you know, you hear it.  You hear it.  You can hear how many people.  But they never show it.  They don't want to do it.</p><p>It's like in Florida or Florida State football game, isn't it?</p><p>We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every day we are making very, very good on our motto.  In fact, much better than we promise.  And you know what it is?  Its promises made, promises kept.</p><p>We've actually given you more promises.  My opponents said this.  They weren't happy about this.</p><p>But we've given you more promises than we said we would do.  That's very unusual for politicians.  That may be a first.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are carefully monitoring the actions of social media giants, big tech must not censor conservative or other voices.</p><p>We are also taking steps to address judicial overreach, activist judges whose issue -- that's right.  You know about that, right?  We did a big thing.</p><p>And the Democrats hate that I did this, because you know who started this in reverse was Bill Clinton when he was president.  Because activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law.</p><p>Take a look at what we did for criminal justice reform.  Nobody thought it could be done.  And we passed it.  And it's tough as hill, but it's also fair.  It's fair.</p><p>That's why we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as it's written, and we just confirmed -- listen to this, our 100th federal judge.  We'll be in record territory not to mention two great Supreme Court judges.</p><p>We've got to go great Supreme Court judges, what a difference having him appear makes you feel good about your country, doesn't it?  It makes you really go to got your country.</p><p>We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  We are doing big.  Last year, prescription drug prices went down for the first time in nearly 51 years.  Just today, we announced that the drug companies will be required by law to include prices in television advertisement, first time.  It's going to drive the price down.</p><p>And we are vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare before we terminate it and replace it with something good once we take over the House, the Senate, the presidency again.</p><p>And we will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, always.  The Republican Party will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, people with pre-existing conditions.  And for the veterans, we passed V.A. Choice, right?</p><p>So, now, as they wait in line for three weeks, ten days, four days, two months, people who weren't even very sick, the terminally ill, before they get to see a doctor?  They immediately go outside, find a good local doctor, get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill, and it's a great thing for our veterans and trying to get it passed for 44 years, we've got it passed.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we also passed -- 46 years they've been trying -- V.A. accountability.  Because under the V.A., you couldn't fire anybody.  They were terrible to our great vets, they could be sadistic, they could steal, they could rob, they could do anything -- we had no way of firing these people.</p><p>Now, we passed V.A. accountability.  They don't treat our vets right?  Boom.  You are fired.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Forty-six years they tried to get that.  It's a little hard working -- I mean, in that case, it was against the union, against civil service, not too easy.</p><p>We are unlocking American energy.  The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.  One.</p><p>We are slashing permitting delays for vital infrastructure projects.  We had highways that would take 21 and 22 years to get approved.  We brought it way down.  We are trying to make it one year.  We are close to getting that.  We are down to two or three at the most.</p><p>This was taken 21 -- there was a certain road and a certain state.  They were working on it for 21 years.  It costs hundreds of times more money.</p><p>It used to be a straight line, now it's a line like this.  You had a couple of drinks?  You had a very bad shot of making it home.</p><p>It cost a fortune, 21 years.  Now we are trying to get it down to one year.  Maybe it gets rejected for environmental reasons.  That's OK.  But you have people who worked on projects almost their entire life.  And then they go to a vote on some counsel and they lose three to two?</p><p>Now, you may get rejected, it's going to take a year, year and a half, but mostly, you're not going to get rejected.  It's going to be done in a really good way.  So, we are trying to get that permitting process down for roads, for highways, for bridges, for tunnels, for everything.  There's no reason you should be taking 20 years.</p><p>And as promised, we've directed more than half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee.  Herbert Hoover dike.  Everybody wanted that done.</p><p>Your governor, both your governors -- your last governor and your current governor wanted that done.  So, we have the Army Corps of Engineers, they're doing a fantastic job and they're getting it done.  It'll now be completed in three years, way ahead of schedule, years ahead of schedule.  I was out there eight weeks ago and it was incredible.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed legislation providing $100 million to fight the red tide that harms coastal regions, especially in Florida.  The red tide.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It doesn't look too inviting.  I come down to Florida.  I say, what the hell is that?  The red tide.  So, we are going to get rid of it.</p><p>And to keep America safe, we are rebuilding America's military might like never before, including $133 million for the gulf coast test range.</p><p>Do you know what that is, gulf?  Anybody there?  Anybody like practice shooting?  Trust me, it's a good thing for you folks.  You don't have to shoot.</p><p>It's a good thing, $133 million, the military needs it so badly.  It's going to be very quickly completed, and many other enhancements of the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors who are doing such an incredible job.</p><p>As an example, at Eglin Air Force Base.  Eglin.  Eglin.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great people.</p><p>And we have made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrifice our sovereignty, surrendered our jobs, and tied us down to endless foreign wars.  I do not know if you saw it, but about eight weeks ago, we took 100 percent of the caliphate.  It was supposed to take two years in Syria -- ISIS.</p><p>That doesn't mean they are going to go around.  These people are stone cold crazy.  It doesn't mean that they will go around blowing up a store and blowing up something.  They are just nuts.</p><p>But we took 100 percent.  When I took over this helm, this great country, we were way behind.  I showed you the map.  It was all -- so much ISIS.  And within a short period of time, we wiped it out, the caliphate.  We had 100 percent.</p><p>But still.  Still.  It's a mental condition.  These people are stick.  They are crazy.  They are crazy.</p><p>So always keep your eyes open, be careful.  And let law enforcement go when you see a kook.  Let them know, because we have the greatest law enforcement on earth.</p><p>And everything we do, we are now putting America first.  For years, we lost in so many different ways.  We were losing on trade.  We were getting beaten by people in countries that had no chance.</p><p>We were insisting that no NATO members -- you had to see this.  The NATO folks, they don't pay their fair share they were supposed to pay.  We were taking over and sending almost 100 percent of our money to protect the countries in NATO, which is Europe.</p><p>And I said, that's not right.  On top of that, the E.U. absolutely kills us on trade.  It's all changing, folks.  $100 billion extra was just given by those countries that's now pouring into NATO, because I said, you've got to pay off.</p><p>Your past presidents would go meet them and wouldn't talk about it or say, gee, whenever you get a chance, maybe you could pay up.  You've got to see.  It was like a chart this way.</p><p>Now, it's like a rocket ship the other way.  They are paying up, $100 million, they pay.  $100 billion with a B.</p><p>Last month, I announce that my administration is unsigning the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which is great for your Second Amendment.  We love our Second Amendment.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>And we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious Second Amendment, and your rights under the Second Amendment.</p><p>I also withdrew the United States from the horrible he Iran the nuclear deal.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And, unfortunately, just today, I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran's iron, aluminum, and copper industries because I hope to be able to at some point, maybe it won't happen, possibly won't, to sit down and work out a fair deal.</p><p>We're not looking to hurt anybody.  We want a fair deal.  We just don't want them to have nuclear weapons.  That's all we want.</p><p>I recognized Israel's capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And just two weeks ago, I announced the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.  That's a big deal.</p><p>And as rockets rained down on Israel, we reaffirmed America's solidarity with the citizens of Israel in their fight against terror.  They have done just a great job.</p><p>It's a dangerous place.  The Middle East is a dangerous place.</p><p>We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we forcefully condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And our hearts are united with you people of Venezuela, and many of their relatives who are here right now with us tonight, the people of Cuba, and the people of Nicaragua in their struggle to be free.  It'll all happen, folks.  It'll all happen.</p><p>Each of us in this great arena, this arena doesn't have a roof, but a minor detail.  Problem is if you had a roof, couldn't hold this many people.  So --</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We are all united by the same timeless values.  We believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law.  We believe in the strong borders, strong families, and a strong national defense.</p><p>We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life.  We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, the right to keep and bear arms.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We believe that mothers and fathers, not government regulators know best how to raise our children and teach our great country's values.  And we believe in the words of our national motto.  In God, we trust.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>These are the traditions, customs, and principles that bind us together as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans.  These are the values that unite people in the panhandle.  Panhandle.  Oh, we love the panhandle.</p><p>You all love the panhandle!  I think so.</p><p>You are incredible people.  I tell you.  You are incredible people.</p><p>You are smart, you're loyal, you are unbelievable people.</p><p>But all across the magnificent state of Florida and all over our country, you join our movement because you rejected the failures and the betrayals of past politicians.  You stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense.</p><p>The system is rigged.  I used to say it, it's still rigged, but a lot less rigged.  We are getting a rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly, folks.</p><p>You reclaim your destiny, you defended your dignity, and he took back your country.  You have always been loyal to this nation.  Now, you finally have a president who was loyal to you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And every day between now and the November 3rd 2020, I think of that.  November 3rd 2020.  Boy, it's close, huh?</p><p>But every day, we are going to keep on working.  We're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Remember, I used to tell the story that your governor would come to see me.  You'd be winning so much in the state of Florida, Governor Ron would say, president, please, in the oval office, please, we are winning too much.  We are used to this, Mr. President.  We aren't used to this.</p><p>For years and years, we've been losers.  We've been losing, Mr. President.  Now, we are winning so much.  The people of Florida cannot stand the winning so much.  Can you maybe pull it back a little bit, Mr. President?</p><p>And I said, no, I can't, Ron, I'm sorry.  He said, I thought you'd say that.  We're going to keep winning.  We are never going to be winning like we have now.  You've never had winning numbers.  You never had -- I think, more loyalty.</p><p>You look at what's happening to this state and you look at what's happening to this country, and we are proud again.  We are proud again.</p><p>With every last ounce of heart and hope and sweat and soul, we are going to make our stand.  We are going to stand for liberty.  We are going to stand for justice.  We are going to stand for faith, family, and freedom.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God.  We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And together, with these proud people of the Panhandle, the proud people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again!  We will make America strong again!  We will make America safe again!  And we will make America great again!</p><p>Thank you, Florida!  Thank you very much.</p><p>(MUSIC))</p><p>HANNITY:  All right.  You can keep the volume up.  Twelve thousand five hundred strong.  The president speaking in Panama City, Florida, 12,500 people.</p><p>You know, the president is right.  We do not see the crowd a lot.  Frank is our great director here.</p><p>Seeing more shots of the crowd, and overflowed crowd outside.  We are told 12,500 strong estimated inside.  Pretty big arena.  Crazy Uncle Joe couldn't get a thousand people in, let's see, Iowa.  Pretty amazing.</p><p>All right.  There you have it.  The president wrapping up.</p><p>And we start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two-plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation, 1.5 million documents handed over.  Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress.  Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege, not once.  Even White House counsel, which to me unfathomable, Don McGahn spent 30 hours with Mueller's pals and Hillary's attorney.</p><p>Now, the president saying enough is enough, and today, the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report.  And the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress.  They already had 30 hours.</p><p>The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff.  For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened.  And the attorney general is saying, and it's not going to happen now.</p><p>And the endless stream of documents, subpoenas, they're being now rejected now by the administration. In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the President.</p><p>And by the way, four separate independent -- four! They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results. The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation -- Oh, Peter Strzok, no (ph) there. Oh, we had nothing.</p><p>In -- just before the employment of Mueller, Lisa Page said, \"We have the House Intel Committee Investigation.\" No collusion. No conspiracy. No cooperation with Russia.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate investigation. And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing. No collusion, no obstruction.</p><p>Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees? And for what? What about every single person that had been called before the committees, or called before Mueller? They all have to pay for lawyers. Lawyers in Washington, D.C., can be as much as $1,000 an hour! Now, they are going to be called in to be asked the same questions, now a fourth, fifth and sixth time?</p><p>This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power. And frankly, a brand-new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States and anybody that has dared - that dares to enter his orbit in support. That's why tonight, we turn to the Washington Swamp, 19-term Congressman Jerry Nadler wasting valuable time, resources to continue to prolong and continue to push a debunked hoax of conspiracy. The desperation reeks in an effort to be totally transparent, the Attorney General gave Nadler 11 other senior lawmakers access to a totally un-redacted version of the Mueller report.</p><p>That included everything except grand jury material. Everything but 0.1% was handed over because that's illegal. You've got to keep in mind this is because of a law that Nadler supported in the 1990s. Barr was under no obligation because people like Nadler wanted the law this way. He didn't even want the Starr report sent to the American people, to be seen by the American people, fighting against we the people seeing that.</p><p>Then they change the law. Now, the Attorney General has no obligation to release one word of the Mueller report. But still, the Attorney General Barr, well, un-redacted classified information, ongoing case materials, other publicly withheld content that might reveal sources and methods, the whole entire country was able to see.</p><p>The Judiciary Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats all refused to actually take the time and see the un-redacted version. Go see the whole thing!</p><p>Instead today, Chairman Nadler's circus voted to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. And according to Nadler, this is all about Barr's decision to defy his subpoena which demanded that the un-retracted Mueller report be released to the full committee.</p><p>Well, Ranking Committee Member Doug Collins will join us in a moment, pointed out that Nadler once claim that is a subpoena was \"a powerful and course of tool only to be used when attempts to reach an accommodation with the witness have reached an impasse.\" But during the hearing, Chairman Nadler on his high horse in his circus committee, well, he said the subpoena was merely intended to start a dialog with Barr's office.</p><p>Oh, that's new. Let's start a dialog. Here, we are going to subpoena you and we'll have other members threaten the sergeant of arms to put you in cuffs and drag you to the committee. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The subpoena is written as the beginning of a dialog process. This is a beginning of a process to talk to the Attorney General and to the Department of Justice and ultimately, to go to court. But it's designed to be the foundation of a dialog and it's not designed to force our hand in what we insist on in court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: This is not the first time that Nadler and his circus have been caught totally, completely, utterly contradicting himself. As it turns out, Nadler has one set of standards for his good friend Bill Clinton, remember him? Bill Clinton, the Starr report listed 11 separate felonies committed by Clinton.</p><p>He lost his practice -- license to practice law. He did pay Paula Jones almost $1 million. And yes, he was impeached. Yet Nadler has a whole other standard for President Trump. Just like Democrats care about collusion, but not if it's Ukraine and Hillary. They care about obstruction but not Hillary and her deleting subpoenaed emails -- 33,000, BleachBit and hammers and SIM cards removed. They don't care about that.</p><p>They care about - I believe but only for a high school student Kavanaugh, not for Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, selective modern outrage. Anyway watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: It's the culmination of nearly three months of requests, discussions and negotiations with the Department of Justice for the complete un-redacted report by Special Counsel Mueller.</p><p>NADLER: Somebody, the staff of the Judiciary Committee, perhaps the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the Judiciary Committee is going to have to go over this material, at least the 400 pages, 500 pages in the report to determine what is fit for release and what is, as a matter of decency and protecting people's privacy rights, people who may be totally innocent, third parties, what must not be released at all.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you think the President obstructed justice?</p><p>NADLER: Yes, I do. It's very clear that the President obstructed justice.</p><p>NADLER: We must not overturn an election and remove a President from office except to defend our system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat.</p><p>NADLER: We have to protect the rule of law, and that means we have to investigate and hold hearings and layout to the American people if this Administration is involved of abuses of power or obstruction of justice.</p><p>NADLER: The American people have heard the allegations against the President and they overwhelmingly oppose impeaching him. They elected President Clinton; they still support him. We have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Just a phony hypocrite. And by the way, his shift in opinion is not just an exercise in anti-Trump vitriol and hypocrisy, Nadler's current fishing expedition is about so much more than a simple case of Trump hate rage Derangement Syndrome.</p><p>Democrats now fear the Attorney General, caught red-handed, concocting, perpetuating a massive fraud. This is what's underlying the fear and the hatred in the attacks against the Attorney General. The Attorney General will expose their hoax, their conspiracy theories, what really happened. It scares the living daylights out of them because he's going to investigate the biggest abuse of power and that's only just beginning.</p><p>So, they've got to smear him before he does his job. We'll have more of that in a moment, but joining us with more the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins. We'll get back to my monologue in a second.</p><p>Congressman, you actually picked up, I saw on Twitter - you are the guy, a lot of credit, I stole it, so I got to give credit and attribution. The hypocrisy of what he said then, what he's saying now.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): It's just amazing, Sean. I mean what we saw today is just insist for Barr (ph). They want to destroy Bill Barr because they don't like an Attorney General who actually does his job and follows the law - and follows the rules.</p><p>Think about what happened today. Bill Barr did what the regulations said they were to do. He actually offered more than he should have, and what are they rewarding with, a contempt in record time, ten times faster than Eric Holder was held in contempt. This is over 400 days for Eric Holder. We are less than 40. This is nothing but a political crusade to do -- mock Bill Barr, because they don't want what he is doing.</p><p>HANNITY: But Congressman, you said -- the reason they are doing it is because they fear what Barr said to Senator Lindsey Graham, which we played numerous times. The Mueller report is over. He's not changing his mind. He has the final definitive answer there. But now, he has been very clear -- Hillary's rigged investigation, FISA abuse, we of course also have the Horowitz report, an attempt to undo duly elected President, the abuse of the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence tools that we have by a few high-ranking people, all of this now will come to the forefront. Will it not, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: It will. And I think that's what we're seeing in the Attorney General. And what we have today is -- and again, you brought this up earlier. When you have a Chairman of the Judiciary Committee say that a subpoena is something to start a dialog with, that's crazy. That's not what a subpoena is for. It's not to prop up your position in court; it is actually to get documents and he asked for everything, including what the Attorney General can't give him. He's asking the Attorney General to break the law.</p><p>You want to know what this was about today? All you got to do is listen to what Hank Johnson from Georgia said. He said we've got to get the documents. So, how can we impeach if we don't get the documents? And then when asked about the time frame, he said we don't have 400 days. Sean, this is -- the people need to know what's happening here. There is a rush to judgment because they don't like -- what you just saw just a few minutes ago in Florida where the American public are seeing a President who is leading, who has an economy that's booming and growing.</p><p>HANNITY: Congressman, last exit question in few short seconds we have. You courageously have released the closed-door testimony of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, and the General Counsel Baker and Strzok and Page. There are 53 other closed-door testimonies that I'm aware of, will you continue that release?</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. Get ready for that. I would fill you by (ph). Just stay close Twitter, stay close the next few weeks. We will be releasing the rest of those.</p><p>HANNITY: Any this week, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: Probably not this week. But, we're getting ready for next week. We want to let the Democrats, their hypocrisy, shine this week. And we're going to get back in Fox what Bill Barr is doing and we're going to get back exposing this to the American people.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Congressman Collins, Georgia, thank you. Over the next weeks and months, two distinct sides are going to emerge. On the one hand, the Attorney General Barr will do his job. The Inspector General Horowitz is expecting - we're expecting his report on FISA abuse. \"Wall Street Journal\" today pointed out it will focus seriously on the Dirty Dossier.</p><p>By the way, why didn't Mueller focus on that? On the other hand, Democrats, the media mob, bad actors in the Deep State will desperately try to extend, even though we've had four separate investigations that say no Russia collusion. They will try to pass it on as long as humanly possible.</p><p>And this includes the king of the Deep State himself, James Comey, is noticeably flustered at the thought of the Attorney General that is now investigating the Deep State spying. And by the way, the FISA application, the first one that he signed in October, that verified the bulk of information that he claimed was true and verified to the best of his ability, that was in October of 2016 and in January 2017, told the President it is salacious and unverified.</p><p>He lied either in October of 2016, January of 2017 or both. I know he thinks he's a super patriot. I have said it before. Jimbo, you have the right to remain silent. You talking like this is a bad idea. I suggest you take my advice. Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP BEGINS)</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: The Attorney General says he believes spying occurred in looking after the President's van campaign. What do you think about that?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: I have no idea what he's talking about. The FBI doesn't spy. The FBI investigates. We investigated a very serious allegation that Americans might be hooked up with the Russian effort to attack our democracy. The Republicans need to breathe into a paper bag.</p><p>DICKERSON: So the debate is a semantic one. The FBI was investigating into Trump Campaign, but you are sending they had cause to. And you just wouldn't use the word spy.</p><p>COMEY: Of course.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP ENDS)</p><p>HANNITY: He signed the FISA warrant that allowed -- well, based on -- we know perhaps even Russian disinformation according to The New York Times -- that allowed the spying of Carter Page. He just lied in what he said.</p><p>Now Democrats, they are running cover for Comey and everyone else who helped them perpetuate their hoax, their lies, their conspiracy theories for years. And now, in the coming weeks, they will try to subpoena everyone, anyone associated with the Special Counsel's 20-month investigation, including Mueller himself.</p><p>And while the White House moves to block Mueller from appearing and put this divisive witch hunt to rest after two-plus years, Mueller does have serious questions I'd like answered. Let not your heart be troubled because, in the coming weeks, truth will prevail, justice will be served.Our constitutional republic will survive.</p><p>Joining us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordon and I got to give credit to both of them and the entire Freedom Caucus, including Doug Collins.</p><p>It was you're questioning that nobody knew behind closed-doors that got us a lot more information and I can't wait to see the other 53 closed-door interviews that are coming. Good to see you both. Mark Meadows.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Good to be with you.</p><p>HANNITY: It's now beginning to unravel, the Attorney General, it's over. Mueller is dead. It's finished. They can cling as tightly as they want to their sinking ship and their conspiracy theory. But what is coming is FISA abuse, the FISA applications, the rigged investigation into Hillary, the attempt to bludgeon and undo an election, the attempts to steal an election, all now under the purview of the Attorney General and others. Where are we going with this?</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, I think in the coming days and by days, I mean just a few days, you will start to see a lot of this unravel. But as it unravels, part of why you are seeing Jerry Nadler and others go crazy is because they know that the truth is coming out.</p><p>And for as passionate as they were today and my good friend Jim Jordan did a great job in that committee hearing, but as passionate as they were today, they haven't been passionate when we've been in the privacy of those rooms, asking those questions, like Jim and I and others have. They won't even look at the documents because they don't want to know the truth.</p><p>And Director Comey, he has his day of reckoning too. He says they investigate -- we also know that they criminally leaked as well. So, it's time for accountability.</p><p>HANNITY: If the law is applied equally, do we have to go back to Hillary and the rigged investigation? By the way, you two got the information; you didn't share with me, which by the way, I deeply resent.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You could have shared this information and given me exclusive. But I know, because of the closed-door testimony, number one, Lisa Page said, yes after nine months, the FBI had nothing.</p><p>But we also, Strozk and Page put all the--</p><p>JORDAN: Comey said that.</p><p>HANNITY: --FBI decisions on Hillary right inside Loretta Lynch's office. Then we've got a lot more - well we'll see what Inspector General Horowitz says, but where do you see it going? Jim Jordon?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I mean Comey said the same thing. All the way up to the day he was fired, he said he still had no evidence, any type of collusion, and obviously the Mueller Report demonstrated that as well.</p><p>To Jim Comey though, I mean, to not use the word spying, remember what we got last week from The New York Times. We got the - the story last Thursday where it said the FBI put a person posing as someone else to talk to George Papadopoulos in the Trump campaign. That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: Hold on Jim, you got to give the details.</p><p>JORDAN: That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: We had a 30-year-old flirtatious suggestive blonde bombshell spy trying to seduce information out of George Papadopoulos.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: You can put this in a bond movie.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes. If that's not spying, tell me what is. And frankly, I did not know that anyone who actually puts much weight into what Jim Comey says now other than CNN is doing a--</p><p>HANNITY: Wait a minute, when he signed the first FISA warrant, okay wasn't that a warrant based on a dirty Russian dossier that might have been Russian disinformation according to The New York Times?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: To spy on Carter Page and the Trump Campaign? Did he not sign that, was not that on spying or am I just out of my mind?</p><p>JORDAN: We're not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEADOWS: It's worse than that. Yes, it's worse than that. He actually knew that there were credibility problems before he ever entered into it. That's the problem.</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Mark--</p><p>JORDAN: They didn't tell the court who paid - they didn't tell the court who paid for it. They didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele was desperate to stop Trump, and they didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI because he was out talking to the press, and yet they used the document.</p><p>HANNITY: Okay that's - by the way that would be I believe footnote eight in the dossier, in the application. Doesn't the application - you guys correct me if I'm wrong and thanks for not sharing all of the secret information, both of you got the information from Bruce Ohr that he warned everybody that Steele hated Trump, it wasn't verified, and Hillary paid for it. But now we have Steele at the State Department and all that information was withheld.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, exactly right, Sean.</p><p>MEADOWS: Yes, all of it's been held. But I think there will be some good reporting that brings all of that to light in the very coming near future.</p><p>HANNITY: By the way, both of you are in deep trouble because you kept it all from me and I hounded you to death for that information and you wouldn't give it to me.</p><p>When we come back, a lot more to get to tonight. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett on all this new breaking information and the attempts to character assassinate Barr, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright, here with tonight's breaking news more on and author of the number one New York Times best seller, the Russia hoax Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Fox News Contributor, Sara Carter.</p><p>Sara, let's start with the reporting side of this. President cooperates fully for over two years. Everybody gets to talk to Mueller, everyone is encouraged to go talk to Mueller and Congressional committees, no executive privilege. President answers questions. It goes on and on.</p><p>The fourth time now, no conspiracy, collusion, nothing, okay. 1.5 million documents. Now, this is now about harassment. This isn't about trying to get information. And the people -- the working men and women, they don't make a whole lot of money in D.C. And every time they are stuck testifying, they're paying up to $1,000 an hour for their attorney because nobody would be stupid enough not to hire one to go for a perjury trap every time they are called in for this crap.</p><p>SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, Sean. I mean, we have seen what's happened to General Flynn, we've seen what's happened to other people who have testified like Sam Clovis. I mean, they are continually dragging it out.</p><p>And I think the American people realize what is going on here. This has been so highly politicized. The President did the right thing, he did the right thing by evoking executive privilege over the Mueller Report.</p><p>They have given -- Attorney General Barr has given every chance for Representative Nadler to view this. The only thing that's redacted is, like you said, a very small amount of grand jury material and that's by law.</p><p>I think a second very important point is that we have to bring up here is that the FBI, if we're looking at the whole issue of spying and this debate and how the Democrats are politicizing this, the whole issue of spying is this - is the fact that--</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Comey just said he didn't spy. What planet is this idiot living on when he signed the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign? All right, we are running out of time. In the 206 year history of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler doesn't want to interview or question Barr, or the Democrats. They want their lawyers to do it. It's never happened, Gregg Jarrett. I wouldn't do that, nor - and they had access to the un-redacted Mueller report. They're just lying, it's a circus sideshow.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, the ever hysterical Jerry Nadler is saying this is a constitutional crisis. He would think a dirty diaper is a crisis. Everything that Donald Trump and his administration does is somehow a crisis.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The fact is that Barr could be prosecuted for turning over grand jury material that Nadler is demanding. So Barr is simply following the law and Jerry Nadler wouldn't know the law if it slapped him in the face, took him forever to get through a law school.</p><p>HANNITY: Apparently, you would both agree, that's spying Jim. Stop lying, you have the right to remain silent, I warn you again. Guys, sorry to cut it short, don't blame me, blame the President. He took my time. Alright, more Hannity after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright unfortunately that's all the time we have for you this evening. Don't forget we will never be the rage, psychotic media mob. We are fair and balanced. Thank you so much for watching. You make this show possible.</p><p>Big show tomorrow The Great One, Mark Levin, is going to weigh in on the Attorney General. Oh, they want to stop him from getting to the truth, of course. But let not your heart be troubled. Why? Because the news continues.</p><p>I think she is back in the swamp tonight. Laura Ingraham.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2224437329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDH1-DY0W-411V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

And they say, no, no, he's the one that causes that fight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And he comes in and he talks about his country, but then they have a picture of him five days sooner walking up, flying the national flag of their country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, if he's so afraid of his country, why is he flying the flag of the country, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  My opening monologue coming up in just a minute.</p><p>But, first, we go right back to the president.  He is in Panama City Beach at a rally in Florida.  Stay with us.</p><p>TRUMP:  -- our border, save that flag, we love our country.  We love our country but we're afraid of it.  For purposes of getting into the United States, we are afraid of our country.</p><p>Now, we can't let this happen.  The Democrats, we need the votes.  We need the votes.  Otherwise, you are going to have to vote them out of office -- Congress, the Senate, you're going to have to vote them out of office.  Come November, next November, November 3rd next year, you're going to have to vote them out of office because otherwise you can't make a chase.  We need the votes.  We have to go through Congress.</p><p>However, we ended with this is incredible.  But they don't mind it so much because they do not mind crime.  They don't mind crime.  No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws and no one should run for office without an ironclad plan to protect and defend American's borders.  They shouldn't be allowed to run.</p><p>And to confront this crisis -- you saw that!  It was a big deal two months ago.  I declared a national emergency, which is what it is.  This is an invasion.</p><p>When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion.  I was badly criticized for using the word \"invasion.\"  It's an invasion.</p><p>And it's also in the invasion of drugs coming in from Mexico, OK?  It's an invasion of drugs.  They all better be careful, because, you know, we are destroying the lives of hundreds and thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border.  They better damn well be careful because people are wise to it now.</p><p>They have drug dens and drug labs in factories right along the border.  They make the crack right there and send it over our border what we don't have walls.  They drive it right through because we have 2,000 miles between the Gulf and the Pacific, 2,000 miles!</p><p>Now, a lot of it, you don't need the wall because its mountains, big strong rivers, it's snake country.  Nobody's walking to certain areas.  You've got to like snakes a lot.</p><p>It's a rough country.  But what we need and what we have done, but they can't do this.  They can't let this happen.  We've been very tough with them, I will be honest.</p><p>Mexico made $100 billion on average over the past ten years, 100 billion!  They took 30 percent -- almost -- of our automobile business.  We make cars.  They send them to the United States.  That won't happen anymore under the USMCA.  It will be prohibited.  It'll be economically prohibited.</p><p>Our current immigration crisis is the result of Democrat back policies that prevent border policies from being swiftly returned home.  A border crosser comes in, you say, sorry, we are taking your home.  That sounds nice.  I want to do that, OK?</p><p>But we are the only one that has judges.  Judges -- think about it.  They come across, they have judges.  Nobody else has judges.  We give them a trial.  We need Perry Mason.  It's crazy.  Folks, it's crazy.</p><p>And then they say, and the wall would help.  It would not help, but the wall would stop it.  When you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great -- and don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons but we can't.  Other countries do.  We can't.  I would never do that.</p><p>But how do you stop these people?  You can't.  There's -- that's only in the panhandle you can get away with that, folks.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Only in the panhandle!  So it's a tough situation.  But if they change the loopholes, we'll have it perfectly.  When the wall is finished, it's going to be great.  Democrats even supported deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets.  They are protected.</p><p>Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congress must act to fix our horrible immigration laws.  We must end catch-and-release.  Stop human smugglers.</p><p>Have you seen what's happening?  Human smugglers, human traffickers -- have you seen what they are doing?  This is an ancient thing.  It's an ancient crime.</p><p>It's bigger now because of the computer, the Internet than ever before, worldwide!  Not just here, worldwide, and most come through our southern border where we don't have a wall.  They don't go through ports of entry -- you have people looking inside the cars.  You can't do that.</p><p>If you have women tied up with tape over their mouths, you can take them through a port of entry.  And a lot of these people say, they come to the ports -- they don't come through the port.  They come to areas where you don't have the wall.  Fifteen miles up, make a left.</p><p>We've got to shut down century cities.  Deport criminal aliens and replace the visa lottery, the chain migration, with a modern system of immigration.  We have to do it.</p><p>On issue after issue, the Democrat Party has never been further outside the American mainstream.  It's never been.  I've never been that I've never heard of anything like what's going on.  I want to run so badly.  I want to don't make this race to start immediately.</p><p>Now, Democrats are pushing a $100 trillion takeover of the U.S. economy, known as the Green New Deal.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>That was written up by a real genius.</p><p>The Democrat Party believes in socialism.  Take a look at Venezuela.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>Republicans believe in freedom.  We need to get senators elected.  We need to get the votes.  We need congressmen and women elected, Republicans, we need to get the votes.</p><p>You've got to get out of there.  You got to work.  Otherwise we'll be playing around for too long.</p><p>And Democrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mothers' wombs, right up until the moment of birth.</p><p>And then you have this governor in Virginia, you saw that?  The baby is born, and you wrap the baby beautifully, and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby.  Oh, can't do that.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>So who heard of that one, that came up and that's now something -- and they don't even want to discuss it.  They don't even want to discuss it.</p><p>And to protect innocent life, I call on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, witch hunts, and delusions.</p><p>The Republican Party is the party for all Americans.  We want to make America great again.  That's what we are doing.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>Will you please show these people?  I go home, you know, you hear it.  You hear it.  You can hear how many people.  But they never show it.  They don't want to do it.</p><p>It's like in Florida or Florida State football game, isn't it?</p><p>We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every day we are making very, very good on our motto.  In fact, much better than we promise.  And you know what it is?  Its promises made, promises kept.</p><p>We've actually given you more promises.  My opponents said this.  They weren't happy about this.</p><p>But we've given you more promises than we said we would do.  That's very unusual for politicians.  That may be a first.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are carefully monitoring the actions of social media giants, big tech must not censor conservative or other voices.</p><p>We are also taking steps to address judicial overreach, activist judges whose issue -- that's right.  You know about that, right?  We did a big thing.</p><p>And the Democrats hate that I did this, because you know who started this in reverse was Bill Clinton when he was president.  Because activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law.</p><p>Take a look at what we did for criminal justice reform.  Nobody thought it could be done.  And we passed it.  And it's tough as hill, but it's also fair.  It's fair.</p><p>That's why we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as it's written, and we just confirmed -- listen to this, our 100th federal judge.  We'll be in record territory not to mention two great Supreme Court judges.</p><p>We've got to go great Supreme Court judges, what a difference having him appear makes you feel good about your country, doesn't it?  It makes you really go to got your country.</p><p>We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  We are doing big.  Last year, prescription drug prices went down for the first time in nearly 51 years.  Just today, we announced that the drug companies will be required by law to include prices in television advertisement, first time.  It's going to drive the price down.</p><p>And we are vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare before we terminate it and replace it with something good once we take over the House, the Senate, the presidency again.</p><p>And we will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, always.  The Republican Party will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, people with pre-existing conditions.  And for the veterans, we passed V.A. Choice, right?</p><p>So, now, as they wait in line for three weeks, ten days, four days, two months, people who weren't even very sick, the terminally ill, before they get to see a doctor?  They immediately go outside, find a good local doctor, get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill, and it's a great thing for our veterans and trying to get it passed for 44 years, we've got it passed.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we also passed -- 46 years they've been trying -- V.A. accountability.  Because under the V.A., you couldn't fire anybody.  They were terrible to our great vets, they could be sadistic, they could steal, they could rob, they could do anything -- we had no way of firing these people.</p><p>Now, we passed V.A. accountability.  They don't treat our vets right?  Boom.  You are fired.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Forty-six years they tried to get that.  It's a little hard working -- I mean, in that case, it was against the union, against civil service, not too easy.</p><p>We are unlocking American energy.  The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.  One.</p><p>We are slashing permitting delays for vital infrastructure projects.  We had highways that would take 21 and 22 years to get approved.  We brought it way down.  We are trying to make it one year.  We are close to getting that.  We are down to two or three at the most.</p><p>This was taken 21 -- there was a certain road and a certain state.  They were working on it for 21 years.  It costs hundreds of times more money.</p><p>It used to be a straight line, now it's a line like this.  You had a couple of drinks?  You had a very bad shot of making it home.</p><p>It cost a fortune, 21 years.  Now we are trying to get it down to one year.  Maybe it gets rejected for environmental reasons.  That's OK.  But you have people who worked on projects almost their entire life.  And then they go to a vote on some counsel and they lose three to two?</p><p>Now, you may get rejected, it's going to take a year, year and a half, but mostly, you're not going to get rejected.  It's going to be done in a really good way.  So, we are trying to get that permitting process down for roads, for highways, for bridges, for tunnels, for everything.  There's no reason you should be taking 20 years.</p><p>And as promised, we've directed more than half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee.  Herbert Hoover dike.  Everybody wanted that done.</p><p>Your governor, both your governors -- your last governor and your current governor wanted that done.  So, we have the Army Corps of Engineers, they're doing a fantastic job and they're getting it done.  It'll now be completed in three years, way ahead of schedule, years ahead of schedule.  I was out there eight weeks ago and it was incredible.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed legislation providing $100 million to fight the red tide that harms coastal regions, especially in Florida.  The red tide.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It doesn't look too inviting.  I come down to Florida.  I say, what the hell is that?  The red tide.  So, we are going to get rid of it.</p><p>And to keep America safe, we are rebuilding America's military might like never before, including $133 million for the gulf coast test range.</p><p>Do you know what that is, gulf?  Anybody there?  Anybody like practice shooting?  Trust me, it's a good thing for you folks.  You don't have to shoot.</p><p>It's a good thing, $133 million, the military needs it so badly.  It's going to be very quickly completed, and many other enhancements of the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors who are doing such an incredible job.</p><p>As an example, at Eglin Air Force Base.  Eglin.  Eglin.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great people.</p><p>And we have made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrifice our sovereignty, surrendered our jobs, and tied us down to endless foreign wars.  I do not know if you saw it, but about eight weeks ago, we took 100 percent of the caliphate.  It was supposed to take two years in Syria -- ISIS.</p><p>That doesn't mean they are going to go around.  These people are stone cold crazy.  It doesn't mean that they will go around blowing up a store and blowing up something.  They are just nuts.</p><p>But we took 100 percent.  When I took over this helm, this great country, we were way behind.  I showed you the map.  It was all -- so much ISIS.  And within a short period of time, we wiped it out, the caliphate.  We had 100 percent.</p><p>But still.  Still.  It's a mental condition.  These people are stick.  They are crazy.  They are crazy.</p><p>So always keep your eyes open, be careful.  And let law enforcement go when you see a kook.  Let them know, because we have the greatest law enforcement on earth.</p><p>And everything we do, we are now putting America first.  For years, we lost in so many different ways.  We were losing on trade.  We were getting beaten by people in countries that had no chance.</p><p>We were insisting that no NATO members -- you had to see this.  The NATO folks, they don't pay their fair share they were supposed to pay.  We were taking over and sending almost 100 percent of our money to protect the countries in NATO, which is Europe.</p><p>And I said, that's not right.  On top of that, the E.U. absolutely kills us on trade.  It's all changing, folks.  $100 billion extra was just given by those countries that's now pouring into NATO, because I said, you've got to pay off.</p><p>Your past presidents would go meet them and wouldn't talk about it or say, gee, whenever you get a chance, maybe you could pay up.  You've got to see.  It was like a chart this way.</p><p>Now, it's like a rocket ship the other way.  They are paying up, $100 million, they pay.  $100 billion with a B.</p><p>Last month, I announce that my administration is unsigning the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which is great for your Second Amendment.  We love our Second Amendment.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>And we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious Second Amendment, and your rights under the Second Amendment.</p><p>I also withdrew the United States from the horrible he Iran the nuclear deal.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And, unfortunately, just today, I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran's iron, aluminum, and copper industries because I hope to be able to at some point, maybe it won't happen, possibly won't, to sit down and work out a fair deal.</p><p>We're not looking to hurt anybody.  We want a fair deal.  We just don't want them to have nuclear weapons.  That's all we want.</p><p>I recognized Israel's capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And just two weeks ago, I announced the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.  That's a big deal.</p><p>And as rockets rained down on Israel, we reaffirmed America's solidarity with the citizens of Israel in their fight against terror.  They have done just a great job.</p><p>It's a dangerous place.  The Middle East is a dangerous place.</p><p>We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we forcefully condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And our hearts are united with you people of Venezuela, and many of their relatives who are here right now with us tonight, the people of Cuba, and the people of Nicaragua in their struggle to be free.  It'll all happen, folks.  It'll all happen.</p><p>Each of us in this great arena, this arena doesn't have a roof, but a minor detail.  Problem is if you had a roof, couldn't hold this many people.  So --</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We are all united by the same timeless values.  We believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law.  We believe in the strong borders, strong families, and a strong national defense.</p><p>We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life.  We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, the right to keep and bear arms.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We believe that mothers and fathers, not government regulators know best how to raise our children and teach our great country's values.  And we believe in the words of our national motto.  In God, we trust.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>These are the traditions, customs, and principles that bind us together as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans.  These are the values that unite people in the panhandle.  Panhandle.  Oh, we love the panhandle.</p><p>You all love the panhandle!  I think so.</p><p>You are incredible people.  I tell you.  You are incredible people.</p><p>You are smart, you're loyal, you are unbelievable people.</p><p>But all across the magnificent state of Florida and all over our country, you join our movement because you rejected the failures and the betrayals of past politicians.  You stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense.</p><p>The system is rigged.  I used to say it, it's still rigged, but a lot less rigged.  We are getting a rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly, folks.</p><p>You reclaim your destiny, you defended your dignity, and he took back your country.  You have always been loyal to this nation.  Now, you finally have a president who was loyal to you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And every day between now and the November 3rd 2020, I think of that.  November 3rd 2020.  Boy, it's close, huh?</p><p>But every day, we are going to keep on working.  We're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Remember, I used to tell the story that your governor would come to see me.  You'd be winning so much in the state of Florida, Governor Ron would say, president, please, in the oval office, please, we are winning too much.  We are used to this, Mr. President.  We aren't used to this.</p><p>For years and years, we've been losers.  We've been losing, Mr. President.  Now, we are winning so much.  The people of Florida cannot stand the winning so much.  Can you maybe pull it back a little bit, Mr. President?</p><p>And I said, no, I can't, Ron, I'm sorry.  He said, I thought you'd say that.  We're going to keep winning.  We are never going to be winning like we have now.  You've never had winning numbers.  You never had -- I think, more loyalty.</p><p>You look at what's happening to this state and you look at what's happening to this country, and we are proud again.  We are proud again.</p><p>With every last ounce of heart and hope and sweat and soul, we are going to make our stand.  We are going to stand for liberty.  We are going to stand for justice.  We are going to stand for faith, family, and freedom.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God.  We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And together, with these proud people of the Panhandle, the proud people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again!  We will make America strong again!  We will make America safe again!  And we will make America great again!</p><p>Thank you, Florida!  Thank you very much.</p><p>(MUSIC))</p><p>HANNITY:  All right.  You can keep the volume up.  Twelve thousand five hundred strong.  The president speaking in Panama City, Florida, 12,500 people.</p><p>You know, the president is right.  We do not see the crowd a lot.  Frank is our great director here.</p><p>Seeing more shots of the crowd, and overflowed crowd outside.  We are told 12,500 strong estimated inside.  Pretty big arena.  Crazy Uncle Joe couldn't get a thousand people in, let's see, Iowa.  Pretty amazing.</p><p>All right.  There you have it.  The president wrapping up.</p><p>And we start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two-plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation, 1.5 million documents handed over.  Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress.  Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege, not once.  Even White House counsel, which to me unfathomable, Don McGahn spent 30 hours with Mueller's pals and Hillary's attorney.</p><p>Now, the president saying enough is enough, and today, the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report.  And the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress.  They already had 30 hours.</p><p>The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff.  For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened.  And the attorney general is saying, and it's not going to happen now.</p><p>And the endless stream of documents, subpoenas, they're being now rejected now by the administration. In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the President.</p><p>And by the way, four separate independent -- four! They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results. The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation -- Oh, Peter Strzok, no (ph) there. Oh, we had nothing.</p><p>In -- just before the employment of Mueller, Lisa Page said, \"We have the House Intel Committee Investigation.\" No collusion. No conspiracy. No cooperation with Russia.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate investigation. And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing. No collusion, no obstruction.</p><p>Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees? And for what? What about every single person that had been called before the committees, or called before Mueller? They all have to pay for lawyers. Lawyers in Washington, D.C., can be as much as $1,000 an hour! Now, they are going to be called in to be asked the same questions, now a fourth, fifth and sixth time?</p><p>This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power. And frankly, a brand-new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States and anybody that has dared - that dares to enter his orbit in support. That's why tonight, we turn to the Washington Swamp, 19-term Congressman Jerry Nadler wasting valuable time, resources to continue to prolong and continue to push a debunked hoax of conspiracy. The desperation reeks in an effort to be totally transparent, the Attorney General gave Nadler 11 other senior lawmakers access to a totally un-redacted version of the Mueller report.</p><p>That included everything except grand jury material. Everything but 0.1% was handed over because that's illegal. You've got to keep in mind this is because of a law that Nadler supported in the 1990s. Barr was under no obligation because people like Nadler wanted the law this way. He didn't even want the Starr report sent to the American people, to be seen by the American people, fighting against we the people seeing that.</p><p>Then they change the law. Now, the Attorney General has no obligation to release one word of the Mueller report. But still, the Attorney General Barr, well, un-redacted classified information, ongoing case materials, other publicly withheld content that might reveal sources and methods, the whole entire country was able to see.</p><p>The Judiciary Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats all refused to actually take the time and see the un-redacted version. Go see the whole thing!</p><p>Instead today, Chairman Nadler's circus voted to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. And according to Nadler, this is all about Barr's decision to defy his subpoena which demanded that the un-retracted Mueller report be released to the full committee.</p><p>Well, Ranking Committee Member Doug Collins will join us in a moment, pointed out that Nadler once claim that is a subpoena was \"a powerful and course of tool only to be used when attempts to reach an accommodation with the witness have reached an impasse.\" But during the hearing, Chairman Nadler on his high horse in his circus committee, well, he said the subpoena was merely intended to start a dialog with Barr's office.</p><p>Oh, that's new. Let's start a dialog. Here, we are going to subpoena you and we'll have other members threaten the sergeant of arms to put you in cuffs and drag you to the committee. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The subpoena is written as the beginning of a dialog process. This is a beginning of a process to talk to the Attorney General and to the Department of Justice and ultimately, to go to court. But it's designed to be the foundation of a dialog and it's not designed to force our hand in what we insist on in court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: This is not the first time that Nadler and his circus have been caught totally, completely, utterly contradicting himself. As it turns out, Nadler has one set of standards for his good friend Bill Clinton, remember him? Bill Clinton, the Starr report listed 11 separate felonies committed by Clinton.</p><p>He lost his practice -- license to practice law. He did pay Paula Jones almost $1 million. And yes, he was impeached. Yet Nadler has a whole other standard for President Trump. Just like Democrats care about collusion, but not if it's Ukraine and Hillary. They care about obstruction but not Hillary and her deleting subpoenaed emails -- 33,000, BleachBit and hammers and SIM cards removed. They don't care about that.</p><p>They care about - I believe but only for a high school student Kavanaugh, not for Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, selective modern outrage. Anyway watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: It's the culmination of nearly three months of requests, discussions and negotiations with the Department of Justice for the complete un-redacted report by Special Counsel Mueller.</p><p>NADLER: Somebody, the staff of the Judiciary Committee, perhaps the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the Judiciary Committee is going to have to go over this material, at least the 400 pages, 500 pages in the report to determine what is fit for release and what is, as a matter of decency and protecting people's privacy rights, people who may be totally innocent, third parties, what must not be released at all.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you think the President obstructed justice?</p><p>NADLER: Yes, I do. It's very clear that the President obstructed justice.</p><p>NADLER: We must not overturn an election and remove a President from office except to defend our system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat.</p><p>NADLER: We have to protect the rule of law, and that means we have to investigate and hold hearings and layout to the American people if this Administration is involved of abuses of power or obstruction of justice.</p><p>NADLER: The American people have heard the allegations against the President and they overwhelmingly oppose impeaching him. They elected President Clinton; they still support him. We have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Just a phony hypocrite. And by the way, his shift in opinion is not just an exercise in anti-Trump vitriol and hypocrisy, Nadler's current fishing expedition is about so much more than a simple case of Trump hate rage Derangement Syndrome.</p><p>Democrats now fear the Attorney General, caught red-handed, concocting, perpetuating a massive fraud. This is what's underlying the fear and the hatred in the attacks against the Attorney General. The Attorney General will expose their hoax, their conspiracy theories, what really happened. It scares the living daylights out of them because he's going to investigate the biggest abuse of power and that's only just beginning.</p><p>So, they've got to smear him before he does his job. We'll have more of that in a moment, but joining us with more the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins. We'll get back to my monologue in a second.</p><p>Congressman, you actually picked up, I saw on Twitter - you are the guy, a lot of credit, I stole it, so I got to give credit and attribution. The hypocrisy of what he said then, what he's saying now.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): It's just amazing, Sean. I mean what we saw today is just insist for Barr (ph). They want to destroy Bill Barr because they don't like an Attorney General who actually does his job and follows the law - and follows the rules.</p><p>Think about what happened today. Bill Barr did what the regulations said they were to do. He actually offered more than he should have, and what are they rewarding with, a contempt in record time, ten times faster than Eric Holder was held in contempt. This is over 400 days for Eric Holder. We are less than 40. This is nothing but a political crusade to do -- mock Bill Barr, because they don't want what he is doing.</p><p>HANNITY: But Congressman, you said -- the reason they are doing it is because they fear what Barr said to Senator Lindsey Graham, which we played numerous times. The Mueller report is over. He's not changing his mind. He has the final definitive answer there. But now, he has been very clear -- Hillary's rigged investigation, FISA abuse, we of course also have the Horowitz report, an attempt to undo duly elected President, the abuse of the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence tools that we have by a few high-ranking people, all of this now will come to the forefront. Will it not, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: It will. And I think that's what we're seeing in the Attorney General. And what we have today is -- and again, you brought this up earlier. When you have a Chairman of the Judiciary Committee say that a subpoena is something to start a dialog with, that's crazy. That's not what a subpoena is for. It's not to prop up your position in court; it is actually to get documents and he asked for everything, including what the Attorney General can't give him. He's asking the Attorney General to break the law.</p><p>You want to know what this was about today? All you got to do is listen to what Hank Johnson from Georgia said. He said we've got to get the documents. So, how can we impeach if we don't get the documents? And then when asked about the time frame, he said we don't have 400 days. Sean, this is -- the people need to know what's happening here. There is a rush to judgment because they don't like -- what you just saw just a few minutes ago in Florida where the American public are seeing a President who is leading, who has an economy that's booming and growing.</p><p>HANNITY: Congressman, last exit question in few short seconds we have. You courageously have released the closed-door testimony of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, and the General Counsel Baker and Strzok and Page. There are 53 other closed-door testimonies that I'm aware of, will you continue that release?</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. Get ready for that. I would fill you by (ph). Just stay close Twitter, stay close the next few weeks. We will be releasing the rest of those.</p><p>HANNITY: Any this week, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: Probably not this week. But, we're getting ready for next week. We want to let the Democrats, their hypocrisy, shine this week. And we're going to get back in Fox what Bill Barr is doing and we're going to get back exposing this to the American people.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Congressman Collins, Georgia, thank you. Over the next weeks and months, two distinct sides are going to emerge. On the one hand, the Attorney General Barr will do his job. The Inspector General Horowitz is expecting - we're expecting his report on FISA abuse. \"Wall Street Journal\" today pointed out it will focus seriously on the Dirty Dossier.</p><p>By the way, why didn't Mueller focus on that? On the other hand, Democrats, the media mob, bad actors in the Deep State will desperately try to extend, even though we've had four separate investigations that say no Russia collusion. They will try to pass it on as long as humanly possible.</p><p>And this includes the king of the Deep State himself, James Comey, is noticeably flustered at the thought of the Attorney General that is now investigating the Deep State spying. And by the way, the FISA application, the first one that he signed in October, that verified the bulk of information that he claimed was true and verified to the best of his ability, that was in October of 2016 and in January 2017, told the President it is salacious and unverified.</p><p>He lied either in October of 2016, January of 2017 or both. I know he thinks he's a super patriot. I have said it before. Jimbo, you have the right to remain silent. You talking like this is a bad idea. I suggest you take my advice. Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP BEGINS)</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: The Attorney General says he believes spying occurred in looking after the President's van campaign. What do you think about that?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: I have no idea what he's talking about. The FBI doesn't spy. The FBI investigates. We investigated a very serious allegation that Americans might be hooked up with the Russian effort to attack our democracy. The Republicans need to breathe into a paper bag.</p><p>DICKERSON: So the debate is a semantic one. The FBI was investigating into Trump Campaign, but you are sending they had cause to. And you just wouldn't use the word spy.</p><p>COMEY: Of course.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP ENDS)</p><p>HANNITY: He signed the FISA warrant that allowed -- well, based on -- we know perhaps even Russian disinformation according to The New York Times -- that allowed the spying of Carter Page. He just lied in what he said.</p><p>Now Democrats, they are running cover for Comey and everyone else who helped them perpetuate their hoax, their lies, their conspiracy theories for years. And now, in the coming weeks, they will try to subpoena everyone, anyone associated with the Special Counsel's 20-month investigation, including Mueller himself.</p><p>And while the White House moves to block Mueller from appearing and put this divisive witch hunt to rest after two-plus years, Mueller does have serious questions I'd like answered. Let not your heart be troubled because, in the coming weeks, truth will prevail, justice will be served.Our constitutional republic will survive.</p><p>Joining us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordon and I got to give credit to both of them and the entire Freedom Caucus, including Doug Collins.</p><p>It was you're questioning that nobody knew behind closed-doors that got us a lot more information and I can't wait to see the other 53 closed-door interviews that are coming. Good to see you both. Mark Meadows.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Good to be with you.</p><p>HANNITY: It's now beginning to unravel, the Attorney General, it's over. Mueller is dead. It's finished. They can cling as tightly as they want to their sinking ship and their conspiracy theory. But what is coming is FISA abuse, the FISA applications, the rigged investigation into Hillary, the attempt to bludgeon and undo an election, the attempts to steal an election, all now under the purview of the Attorney General and others. Where are we going with this?</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, I think in the coming days and by days, I mean just a few days, you will start to see a lot of this unravel. But as it unravels, part of why you are seeing Jerry Nadler and others go crazy is because they know that the truth is coming out.</p><p>And for as passionate as they were today and my good friend Jim Jordan did a great job in that committee hearing, but as passionate as they were today, they haven't been passionate when we've been in the privacy of those rooms, asking those questions, like Jim and I and others have. They won't even look at the documents because they don't want to know the truth.</p><p>And Director Comey, he has his day of reckoning too. He says they investigate -- we also know that they criminally leaked as well. So, it's time for accountability.</p><p>HANNITY: If the law is applied equally, do we have to go back to Hillary and the rigged investigation? By the way, you two got the information; you didn't share with me, which by the way, I deeply resent.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You could have shared this information and given me exclusive. But I know, because of the closed-door testimony, number one, Lisa Page said, yes after nine months, the FBI had nothing.</p><p>But we also, Strozk and Page put all the--</p><p>JORDAN: Comey said that.</p><p>HANNITY: --FBI decisions on Hillary right inside Loretta Lynch's office. Then we've got a lot more - well we'll see what Inspector General Horowitz says, but where do you see it going? Jim Jordon?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I mean Comey said the same thing. All the way up to the day he was fired, he said he still had no evidence, any type of collusion, and obviously the Mueller Report demonstrated that as well.</p><p>To Jim Comey though, I mean, to not use the word spying, remember what we got last week from The New York Times. We got the - the story last Thursday where it said the FBI put a person posing as someone else to talk to George Papadopoulos in the Trump campaign. That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: Hold on Jim, you got to give the details.</p><p>JORDAN: That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: We had a 30-year-old flirtatious suggestive blonde bombshell spy trying to seduce information out of George Papadopoulos.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: You can put this in a bond movie.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes. If that's not spying, tell me what is. And frankly, I did not know that anyone who actually puts much weight into what Jim Comey says now other than CNN is doing a--</p><p>HANNITY: Wait a minute, when he signed the first FISA warrant, okay wasn't that a warrant based on a dirty Russian dossier that might have been Russian disinformation according to The New York Times?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: To spy on Carter Page and the Trump Campaign? Did he not sign that, was not that on spying or am I just out of my mind?</p><p>JORDAN: We're not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEADOWS: It's worse than that. Yes, it's worse than that. He actually knew that there were credibility problems before he ever entered into it. That's the problem.</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Mark--</p><p>JORDAN: They didn't tell the court who paid - they didn't tell the court who paid for it. They didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele was desperate to stop Trump, and they didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI because he was out talking to the press, and yet they used the document.</p><p>HANNITY: Okay that's - by the way that would be I believe footnote eight in the dossier, in the application. Doesn't the application - you guys correct me if I'm wrong and thanks for not sharing all of the secret information, both of you got the information from Bruce Ohr that he warned everybody that Steele hated Trump, it wasn't verified, and Hillary paid for it. But now we have Steele at the State Department and all that information was withheld.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, exactly right, Sean.</p><p>MEADOWS: Yes, all of it's been held. But I think there will be some good reporting that brings all of that to light in the very coming near future.</p><p>HANNITY: By the way, both of you are in deep trouble because you kept it all from me and I hounded you to death for that information and you wouldn't give it to me.</p><p>When we come back, a lot more to get to tonight. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett on all this new breaking information and the attempts to character assassinate Barr, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright, here with tonight's breaking news more on and author of the number one New York Times best seller, the Russia hoax Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Fox News Contributor, Sara Carter.</p><p>Sara, let's start with the reporting side of this. President cooperates fully for over two years. Everybody gets to talk to Mueller, everyone is encouraged to go talk to Mueller and Congressional committees, no executive privilege. President answers questions. It goes on and on.</p><p>The fourth time now, no conspiracy, collusion, nothing, okay. 1.5 million documents. Now, this is now about harassment. This isn't about trying to get information. And the people -- the working men and women, they don't make a whole lot of money in D.C. And every time they are stuck testifying, they're paying up to $1,000 an hour for their attorney because nobody would be stupid enough not to hire one to go for a perjury trap every time they are called in for this crap.</p><p>SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, Sean. I mean, we have seen what's happened to General Flynn, we've seen what's happened to other people who have testified like Sam Clovis. I mean, they are continually dragging it out.</p><p>And I think the American people realize what is going on here. This has been so highly politicized. The President did the right thing, he did the right thing by evoking executive privilege over the Mueller Report.</p><p>They have given -- Attorney General Barr has given every chance for Representative Nadler to view this. The only thing that's redacted is, like you said, a very small amount of grand jury material and that's by law.</p><p>I think a second very important point is that we have to bring up here is that the FBI, if we're looking at the whole issue of spying and this debate and how the Democrats are politicizing this, the whole issue of spying is this - is the fact that--</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Comey just said he didn't spy. What planet is this idiot living on when he signed the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign? All right, we are running out of time. In the 206 year history of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler doesn't want to interview or question Barr, or the Democrats. They want their lawyers to do it. It's never happened, Gregg Jarrett. I wouldn't do that, nor - and they had access to the un-redacted Mueller report. They're just lying, it's a circus sideshow.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, the ever hysterical Jerry Nadler is saying this is a constitutional crisis. He would think a dirty diaper is a crisis. Everything that Donald Trump and his administration does is somehow a crisis.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The fact is that Barr could be prosecuted for turning over grand jury material that Nadler is demanding. So Barr is simply following the law and Jerry Nadler wouldn't know the law if it slapped him in the face, took him forever to get through a law school.</p><p>HANNITY: Apparently, you would both agree, that's spying Jim. Stop lying, you have the right to remain silent, I warn you again. Guys, sorry to cut it short, don't blame me, blame the President. He took my time. Alright, more Hannity after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright unfortunately that's all the time we have for you this evening. Don't forget we will never be the rage, psychotic media mob. We are fair and balanced. Thank you so much for watching. You make this show possible.</p><p>Big show tomorrow The Great One, Mark Levin, is going to weigh in on the Attorney General. Oh, they want to stop him from getting to the truth, of course. But let not your heart be troubled. Why? Because the news continues.</p><p>I think she is back in the swamp tonight. Laura Ingraham.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2224437329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W58-13T1-JBHT-D3GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p> You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p> Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p> You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p> The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p> On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p> And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p> Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p> ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p> REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p> REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p> LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p> LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p> REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p> Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p> I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p> REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p> LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p> LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p> And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p> And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p> REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p> REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p> LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p> LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p> REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p> LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p> You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p> REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p> CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p> GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p> We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p> GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p> GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p> As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p> REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p> GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p> They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p> GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p> REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p> GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p> Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p>Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p> This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p> Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p> You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p> So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p> They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p> Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p> REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p> REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p> REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p> The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p> And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p> Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p> And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p> Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p> REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p> REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p> REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p> REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p> Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p> PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p> REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p> REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p> Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p> But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p> We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p> I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p> And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p> REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p> All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p> There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p> The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p> Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p> PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p> ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p> So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p> Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p> ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p> You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p> REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p> Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.  Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman  Schultz today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN:  Frankly, if you look  at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more  than a thousand dollars so far.  But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p> Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p> Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p> So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p> REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p> You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p> REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p> But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p> BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p> LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p> The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.  That's what the  President was talking about when he said we can all rise up.  I want you  all to be as rich as me.  That's the message.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be.  It's part  of what has made.  This nation is so great.  Thank you so much, Gina and  Robin.</p><p> We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow.   Liz has got you.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, but Trish, did you see this.  We're  looking at a snapback reversal at this hour -- </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I really do.   It's great to see because I think so many people were so pessimistic about  this, and you're right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REGAN:  They could pay for themselves, wouldn't that be great, but you're  also right on that spending front.  Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p>You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p>Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p>You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p>The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p>On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p>And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p>Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p>ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p>REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p>REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p>LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p>LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p>REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p>Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p>I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p>REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p>LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p>LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p>And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p>And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p>REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p>REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p>LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p>LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p>REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p>LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p>You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p>REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p>CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p>GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p>We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p>GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p>GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p>As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p>REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p>GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p>They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p>GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p>REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p>GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p>Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p>Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p>This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p>Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p>You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p>So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p>They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p>Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p>REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p>REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p>REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p>The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p>And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p>Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p>And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p>Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p>REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p>REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p>REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p>REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p>Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p>REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p>REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p>But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p>We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p>I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p>And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p>REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p>There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p>The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p>Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p>ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p>So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p>Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p>ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p>You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p>REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p>Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.  Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman  Schultz today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN:  Frankly, if you look  at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more  than a thousand dollars so far.  But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p>Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p>Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p>So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p>REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p>You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p>REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p>But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p>BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p>LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p>The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.  That's what the  President was talking about when he said we can all rise up.  I want you  all to be as rich as me.  That's the message.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be.  It's part  of what has made.  This nation is so great.  Thank you so much, Gina and  Robin.</p><p>We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow.

I really do.   It's great to see because I think so many people were so pessimistic about  this, and you're right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REGAN:  They could pay for themselves, wouldn't that be great, but you're  also right on that spending front.  Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p>You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p>Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p>You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p>The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p>On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p>And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p>Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p>ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p>REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p>REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p>LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p>LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p>REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p>Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p>I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p>REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p>LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p>LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p>And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p>And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p>REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p>REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p>LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p>LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p>REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p>LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p>You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p>REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p>CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p>GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p>We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p>GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p>GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p>As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p>REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p>GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p>They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p>GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p>REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p>GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p>Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p>Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p>This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p>Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p>You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p>So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p>They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p>Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p>REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p>REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p>REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p>The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p>And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p>Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p>And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p>Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p>REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p>REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p>REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p>REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p>Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p>REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p>REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p>But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p>We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p>I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p>And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p>REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p>There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p>The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p>Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p>ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p>So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p>Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p>ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p>You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p>REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p>Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.  Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman  Schultz today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN:  Frankly, if you look  at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more  than a thousand dollars so far.  But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p>Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p>Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p>So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p>REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p>You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p>REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p>But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p>BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p>LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p>The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.

Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p> You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p> Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p> You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p> The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p> On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p> And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p> Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p> ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p> REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p> REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p> LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p> LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p> REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p>Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p> I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p> REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p> LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p> LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p> And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p> And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p> REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p> REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p> LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p> LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p> REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p> LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p> You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p> REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p> CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p> GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p> We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p> GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p> GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p> As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p> REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p> GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p> They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p> GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p> REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p> GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p> Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p> Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p> This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p> Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p> You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p> So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p> They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p> Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p> REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p> REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p> REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p> The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p> And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p> Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p> And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p> Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p> REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p> REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p> REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p> REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p> Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p> PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p> REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p> REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p> Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p> But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p> We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p> I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p> And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p> REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p> All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p> There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p> The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p> Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p> PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p> ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p> So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p> Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p> ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p> You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p> REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p> Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.  Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman  Schultz today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN:  Frankly, if you look  at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more  than a thousand dollars so far.  But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p> Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p> Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p> So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p> REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p> You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p> REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p> But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p> BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p>LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p> The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.  That's what the  President was talking about when he said we can all rise up.  I want you  all to be as rich as me.  That's the message.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be.  It's part  of what has made.  This nation is so great.  Thank you so much, Gina and  Robin.</p><p> We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow.   Liz has got you.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, but Trish, did you see this.  We're  looking at a snapback reversal at this hour -- </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I really do.   It's great to see because I think so many people were so pessimistic about  this, and you're right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> REGAN:  They could pay for themselves, wouldn't that be great, but you're  also right on that spending front.  Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p> You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p> Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p> You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p> The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p> On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p> And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p> Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p> ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p> REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p> REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p> LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p> LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p> REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p> Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p> I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p> REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p> LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p> LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p> And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p> And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p> REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p> REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p> LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p> LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p> REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p> LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p> You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p> REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p> CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p> GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p> We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p> GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p> GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p> As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p> REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p> GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p> They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p> GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p> REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p> GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p> Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p>Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p> This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p> Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p> You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p> So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p> They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p> Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p> REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p> REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p> REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p> The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p> And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p> Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p> And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p> Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p> REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p> REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p> REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p> REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p> Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p> PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p> REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p> REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p> Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p> But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p> We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p> I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p> And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p> REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p> All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p> There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p> The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p> Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p> PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p> ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p> So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p> Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p> ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p> You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p> REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p> Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.  Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman  Schultz today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN:  Frankly, if you look  at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more  than a thousand dollars so far.  But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p> Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p> Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p> So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p> REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p> You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p> REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p> But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p> BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p> LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p> The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.  That's what the  President was talking about when he said we can all rise up.  I want you  all to be as rich as me.  That's the message.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be.  It's part  of what has made.  This nation is so great.  Thank you so much, Gina and  Robin.</p><p> We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow.   Liz has got you.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, but Trish, did you see this.  We're  looking at a snapback reversal at this hour -- </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I really do.   It's great to see because I think so many people were so pessimistic about  this, and you're right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> REGAN:  They could pay for themselves, wouldn't that be great, but you're  also right on that spending front.  Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p> You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p> Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p> You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p> The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p> On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p> And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p> Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p> ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p> REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p> REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p> LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p> LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p> REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p>Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p> I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p> REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p> LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p> LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p> And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p> And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p> REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p> REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p> LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p> LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p> REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p> LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p> You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p> REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p> LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p> CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p> GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p> We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p> GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p> GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p> REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p> GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p> As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p> REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p> GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p> They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p> GARDNER:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p> GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p> REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p> GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p> Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p> Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p> This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p> Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p> You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p> So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p> They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p> Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p> REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p> REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p> REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p> The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p> And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p> Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p> And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p> Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p> REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p> REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p> SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p> REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p> REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p> Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p> PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p> REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p> REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p> SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p> SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p> Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p> But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p> We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p> I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p> And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p> REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p> All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p> There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p> The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p> Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p> PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p> ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p> So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p> Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p> ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p> You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p> ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p> REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p> Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.  Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman  Schultz today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN:  Frankly, if you look  at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more  than a thousand dollars so far.  But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p> Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p> Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p> So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p> REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p> You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p> REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p> But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p> BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p>LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p> The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.  That's what the  President was talking about when he said we can all rise up.  I want you  all to be as rich as me.  That's the message.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be.  It's part  of what has made.  This nation is so great.  Thank you so much, Gina and  Robin.</p><p> We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow.   Liz has got you.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, but Trish, did you see this.  We're  looking at a snapback reversal at this hour -- </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I really do.   It's great to see because I think so many people were so pessimistic about  this, and you're right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  Amazing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REGAN:  They could pay for themselves, wouldn't that be great, but you're  also right on that spending front.  Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p>You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p>Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p>You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p>The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p>On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p>And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p>Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p>ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p>REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p>REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p>LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p>LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p>REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p>Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p>I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p>REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p>LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p>LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p>And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p>And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p>REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p>REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p>LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p>LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p>REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p>LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p>You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p>REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p>CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p>GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p>We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p>GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p>GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p>As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p>REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p>GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p>They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p>GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p>REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p>GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p>Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p>Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p>This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p>Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p>You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p>So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p>They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p>Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p>REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p>REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p>REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p>The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p>And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p>Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p>And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p>Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p>REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p>REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p>REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p>REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p>Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p>REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p>REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p>But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p>We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p>I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p>And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p>REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p>There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p>The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p>Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p>ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p>So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p>Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p>ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p>You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p>REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p>Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.

But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p>Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p>Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p>So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p>REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p>You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p>REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p>But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p>BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p>LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p>The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.  That's what the  President was talking about when he said we can all rise up.  I want you  all to be as rich as me.  That's the message.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be.  It's part  of what has made.  This nation is so great.  Thank you so much, Gina and  Robin.</p><p>We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow.   Liz has got you.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, but Trish, did you see this.  We're  looking at a snapback reversal at this hour -- </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Neil, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, President Trump and several Cabinet members  are meeting with global business leaders right now in Davos, Switzerland.   They're discussing the success of America's tax plan and why businesses  should be investing in the United States of America.  All of this as we see  again, another record day on Wall Street, up 169 there on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>President Trump, taking his America first message right to the world stage.   Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are  calling the most important economic speech of his presidency.  And in that  speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more  to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p>You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it  again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic  pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p>Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's  going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is  wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And he's not even done.  As we just  saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local  time with European business leaders.  Quite the crowd that he has with him  here in Davos.</p><p>You just saw a little bit of that play out.  The President is sitting down  with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo,  Deloitte, just to name a few.  This is really been a two-fold message,  really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p>The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and  the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President  wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to  get across.  Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments  ago, here is President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to say that  there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot  of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and  people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but  also cutting of regulations.  And I think also being a cheerleader for our  country.  You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for  your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  So the President got into town today.  His delegation has been here  for a couple days though.  And the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross made  some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every  single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p>On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo,  the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to  be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it  is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  What I meant was this, every time  someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war.  Dumping steel is  an act of war.  Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything.   Forcing technology transfers, same thing.  That is what I had in mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  All right, so back to the President.  He is at that dinner right  now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is  done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Tomorrow  he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland  separately.</p><p>And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here  in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the  huge forum and really before the world.  Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  I'm looking forward to it.  You know where I am going to be,  watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in.  Maria is there in  Davos as well.  Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p>Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan,  Mr. Art Laffer.  Art, good to see you.  I know you have a good mood today.</p><p>ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:  Great  to see you.</p><p>REGAN:  Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program?  He was pointing  out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you  know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth,  if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well,  they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is the Laffer curve, isn't it?  It's my profile, Trish.  And it  should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way.  But --</p><p>REGAN:  No, no.  You --</p><p>LAFFER:  -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known  as such, sir.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  But walk as through.  Do you think it's --</p><p>LAFFER:  It happens.  It happens --</p><p>REGAN:  -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the  case?  No one thought.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish.  Not only will  we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all  the personal behavior things.  There is going to be less tax evasion,  there's going to be less tax sheltering.  They're going to be people are  going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p>Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S.  There going to  be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll  taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and  local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill.  And  we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount  on this net.</p><p>I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along  with rapid growth and tax cuts.  It just doesn't happen.  So this is the --</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him.   I take my hat off to him.  It's the best economic program I have seen by  any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LAFFER:  It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p>REGAN:  That is a big endorsement from you, Art.  Let me ask you this.</p><p>LAFFER:  It's huge.  Yes, please, yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going  to happen anyway.  These companies would have given out bonuses, they would  have raised wages.  That was all in the works before this tax plan ever  came into being.  What do you say to them?</p><p>LAFFER:  Well, I don't know what to say to them.  I feel very sorry for  them that they're playing catch-up.  This was Democratic Party policy when  Kennedy was president.  They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers.   There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p>And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are  the big naysayers.  They want to hold up the budget.  They want to raise  taxes.  They want to do all the wrong things.  And I'm very sorry for them.   But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they  lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p>And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but  they didn't.  And we did and it's going lead to prosperity.  I'm very  sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p>REGAN:  They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as  obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p>REGAN:  And this thing through.</p><p>LAFFER:  They voted against everything.  Everything, they voted against.   And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our  histories.  This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and  really unpleasant.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party  right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing.  A 1000 bucks,  Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Yes, I know.  I know.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I don't know.  But I think a lot of Americans would like to  have an extra thousand dollars.  Those are not crumbs.</p><p>LAFFER:  Of course.  I mean, these people --</p><p>REGAN:  This is real money.  This is significant.</p><p>LAFFER:  They are desperate.  They can see they're losing and they're  desperate.  And I wish they wouldn't.  I wish they just come and join us  and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan  under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p>You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote.  All the  Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth.  Al Gore told  me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in  economics.  I mean, this is cool, cool stuff.   And they should be with us,  not against us.</p><p>REGAN:  The Laffer curve at work.  Thank you so much, Art.</p><p>LAFFER:  Thank you.  You know, Trish, that's lovely.  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's turn to another big story.  North Korean calling for  unification of the Koreas, this as President Trump is expected to do warn  world  leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee  on East Asia.  He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has  been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions.  Here with me  right now, Senator Cory Gardner.  Senator, good to have you here.</p><p>CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions.   What about sanctioning China?</p><p>GARDNER:  I think that's where we have to turn to.  And we know that China  has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy.   They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p>We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were  responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy.  It has got to  stop, and they've got to do more.  If China wants to be a responsible  global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do  business with them.  You can't do it both ways.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese  and the Russians did, right?  And then we have video of them out there  trading with the North Koreans.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Despite what they promised us.  We've seen that North Korean GDP,  their economy has grown.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China.  So that  tells us China -- </p><p>GARDNER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p>GARDER:  Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN:  So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p>GARDNER:  Yes.  And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more  than they have in the past.  They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that  passed recently.  That is more than they have done.  But the problem is  there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p>As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further  advanced.  At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to  the United States.  And China needs to step up to do more.  They continue  to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p>REGAN:  I agree with you.   But here is my question for you, sir.  The  markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would  destabilize our economy.  Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p>GARDNER:  We need to build trust with China.  And trust with China that we  don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River.  But we need to  build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust.  But we also have to make sure  we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward  China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p>They stepped up to the brink.  And they actually behave in the way that was  helped us solved problem in Iran.  Now, we still have some a long ways to  go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of  ammunition here.  And I'm not talking about military ammunition.  I am  talking about economic ammunition.  And I say all the time, the viewer  knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars,  Senator, as opposed to lives.  And so, before we make a commitment to go to  all-out war, --</p><p>GARDNER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can  economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p>GARDNER:  I can't agree with you more.  Look, this is a situation where we  have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase  our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically  of the regime.  Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared  for that alternative.  We have to be prepared for the outcome.  We will  protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea.  But  we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the  forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned  country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p>REGAN:  Senator Gardner, thank you very much.  It's good to have your  perspective here.</p><p>GARDNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come  up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can  play a clip here.  He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade  war.  He sees the military option happening first.  Here he is with me a  short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  The American  business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access --  sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market.  Look, on your  show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how  they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, I don't care about them.  I care about the country and I care  about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs  be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs?  In other words,  who cares what they think.  Who cares what the CEO's think.  What we need  to do is what's best for our people.  So with that in mind, maybe we need  to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China  economically.</p><p>Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings.  About a quarter of all  S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings,  and they have beaten revenue estimates.  This is great news happening on a  day.</p><p>Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out  there.  They're handing out bonuses to employees.  And you know why?  One  after another tells us because of President Trump's tax reform.  So why  won't the left give him any credit at all?  Why are they trying to say that  this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had  none?  We're on it next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the  Dow.  The Dow is hitting new all-time high.  You never get tired of it,  right?  Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess  what?  It's only January.</p><p>This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American  companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican  tax bill.  But get this?  The mainstream media is still absolutely,  positively refusing to give the Donald Trump administration any credit at  all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p>Here is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross speaking with Maria Bartiromo  earlier today in Davos, Switzerland.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS:  They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually,  facts overcome fiction.  And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check,  doesn't care what the left-wing media says.  Then the person who gets a tax  cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care  what the left-wing media says.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist,  Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute  here.  Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p>You get the market hitting high after high after high.  You've got  unemployment moving lower, record low.  You've got wages moving higher.   And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we  haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer,  adjusted for inflation.</p><p>So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change,  right?  To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet,  the Democrats and the media they won't go there.  Why?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  You know,  this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground.  They're all  going, not me or I wish I had.  Political strategists of course are going  to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p>They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done  it, this would have happened anyway.  But the reality is it wouldn't have  because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut.  So, again,  taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what  you don't have unless you accrue debt.  But if you have it you can spend it  and that's what corporate America is doing.  More than 200 corporations  have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great  policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the  economy.  What do you say to that?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence  would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last  decade, last 20 years.  But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was  the bell word.  That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p>Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment.  And  CEOs are not dingalings.  CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and  they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best.  And this  time around is right here at home.</p><p>REGAN:  So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future?  I  mean, what do you think?  Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he  right?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the  planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly  understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from  financial perspective.  And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing  perspective.  But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p>REGAN:  So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I'm buying very selectively.  Obviously you don't do  anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance.  I mean, you do  it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense,  those are all things that the world must have.  That's the intelligence  place you can put your money because you know those things are never going  to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed  does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much.  Good to see you.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Yes it is.</p><p>REGAN:  A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what  they're calling value-capturing financing.  Basically means that -- and  this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular  project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in  part to the government.  Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going  through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by  stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up  being $1.7 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  President Trump addressing the nation' mayors offering more details  on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart  of Tuesday's State of the Union Address.  This as leaked documents released  this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p>The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and  they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar  for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects.  But here is  the sticking point.  This is what is very concerning to a lot of people  right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture  financing.</p><p>And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this -- </p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you  know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends  to do.  Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky.  We do it already in  the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for  decades.  This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p>Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200  billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects  they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say,  let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars.  So cities like  New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p>And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from  increase in property values after a public work's project.  So conceivably,  Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New  York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway.   You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in  property value to help fund the subway.</p><p>Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm sorry.  It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam.  I don't like  this one bit.  So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years  ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and  by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second  Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  There are rats all over New York City.</p><p>REGAN:  -- had to live with that.  Yes, that's true.  But they had to live  with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside  whatever comes with it.  That's their property.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York  City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet.  What's  been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal  that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal  government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San  Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing  mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p>REGAN:  OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Then, it would be up to the city to decide.  It would be up to  the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just  discussed.  Nobody is doing it that way yet.  Nobody is doing like that  yet.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there  would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that?  But Adam,  what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we  will give you $300 million or -- </p><p>SHAPIRO:  $5 billion for subway.</p><p>REGAN:  $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something  back in return, the city of New York.  I mean, they are going after a lot  of these cities and municipalities and states big time.  I mean, it's a  salt.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Again, remember the federal government has always required cities  like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form  federal tax dollars.  The change in this would be the value capture  financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and  states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're  going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a  city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line  didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value.   Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Wow.  All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Just a proposal right now.</p><p>REGAN:  Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p>Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com.   Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.:  Well, I think the most  interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's  mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states  want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure  package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the  full details, and we are talking about leaked information here.  So it's --  this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I know.  It's not perfect all the information we have and so  we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Right.  So this is all theoretical -- </p><p>REGAN:  And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government  for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up  being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being  developers and businesses.  And so if you've ever flown over Washington,  D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell  exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are  lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people  have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not  saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are  pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is  because if you listen to the clip that President Trump earlier he said, we  want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending.  The idea  is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what  that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out  of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in  infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here.  I think  that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know  if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or  this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just  happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in  your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all  right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property  is worth more?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say  to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to  have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the  borders that -- </p><p>REGAN:  Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter?  What happened  to property rights?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C.  And I often feel like I  don't own my house.  The district government exerts an awful lot of  concern.  And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying  that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being  proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course,  at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that.  Peter, thank  you very much.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier  gains that we saw on President Trump comments about wanting a strong  dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now.  And you can see  we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative  territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments  on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders.  Hey,  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  So right now we've  seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the  Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk  about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very  different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something  that's been front and center.</p><p>But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the  obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p>We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average,  three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs,  (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones  Industrial average</p><p>I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had  their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however  the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst  estimates.  And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of  Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes.  They raised forecast as well.  So  that's a real winner.  But ultimately, we've digested a few different  pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why  was that?  In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market,  they are doing better with their jobs.  It was more demand for home and it  wasn't the supply in decades.  So that's the big picture on the market  overall.</p><p>And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the  table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best  month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to  lose it.  So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great  and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p>REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude  closest $65.51 a barrel.  Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more  on this surge in oil prices.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, it had been a surge, up until I  think maybe the President's comments on the dollar.  You know, look, part  of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about  a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after  hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading  65.10.  Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which  is not necessarily a bad thing.  We've had a huge run-up here as you point  out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down  and U.S. supply.</p><p>There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think,  you know, we are swimming in oil.  Indeed, we are making more oil in the  country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies  but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we  still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet.  But  anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about  the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from  the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p>The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding  the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers  work past 9:00 p.m.  Nice life they might have, huh.  Look, you know, you  can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this  going end up, details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and  delivering trucks to deliver packages.  The union is entering contract  negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000  more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m.  But with online  retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS  actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and  -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p>Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst  Patrice Lee Onwuka.  Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Good  to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p>ONWUKA:  They are.  So I think they're actually speeding against the wind.   Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for  the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge  shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000  shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs.  And that's going to -- well, it's  over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p>So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient  particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why  technology can really come in.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos  Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very  real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless  cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and  drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone  industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if  their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're  going to be out of business.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think so.  I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are  using this as a bargaining chip.  I don't think they really expect that UPS  would not allow for drone delivery.  And by the way, there are also  regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you  know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also  means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that  means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks.   But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're  going to be available.</p><p>Technology is not something we should be running from.  It's something we  need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the  right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I  think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll,  you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll  booth, just doesn't exist anymore.  And in some cases the tolls themselves  don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by.   So these are jobs, right?  These are actual jobs so we need to be  transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think,  conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like  education.  It gets back to things like immigration.  There's a lot that  fold into it.</p><p>ONWUKA:  There is.  I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I  think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think  unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a  political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we  do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together  business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with  like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what  are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be  replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really  start to prepare young people for.</p><p>You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs  away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options,  better options and cheaper options.  So, you know, technology, I'm not one  of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  We have to think differently.</p><p>ONWUKA:  I think we need just to be smart.  Exactly.</p><p>REGAN:  Patrice, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ONWUKA:  Good to see you too.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that  bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are  simply crumbs.</p><p>Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand  dollars doesn't go very far.\"  How on earth can the Democrats look at  anybody with a straight face and say things like this?  This is nothing but  a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term  elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our  economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot  of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot  of people.  We will debate this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are  giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just  crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing.  Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman  Schultz today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN:  Frankly, if you look  at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more  than a thousand dollars so far.  But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars  which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by  some companies.  Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I  mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that.  I thought that  they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom  a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p>Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and  Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p>Gina, you know, this is not chump change.  I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi  it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  This is the  single most, elitist statement I've ever heard.  I think Debbie Wasserman  Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more  than a thousand dollars.  But you know what?  To your average minimum wage  worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a  year, that's 1/15th of their income.  I don't care who you are or what your  income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in  your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p>So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of  all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the  parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes  on and on.  They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on  how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p>REGAN:  I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is  suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness,  you know, a little extra money.  A lot of Americans, they are one car  payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality  of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they  ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are  struggling.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  You better believe it.  And, you know,  that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3  million.  So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that  statement.  My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p>You know, this Money is money.  I've said this before.  And it makes a  difference to everyday Americans.  They should have pointed out the  disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that Donald Trump himself said that he  won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from  the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate  tax.</p><p>REGAN:  I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point.  You've  heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was  basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the  private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will  tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't.  I've said  before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are  calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that,  Gina can't do that.  Income is income, investment is investment.  I  digress.</p><p>But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much  more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the  administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not  taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p>BIRO:  No, They really don't.  I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me  on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message.  We already had  lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state.   We can't put out statements like this.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell  you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a  little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing  but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p>LOUDON:  Absolutely.  It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something  where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only  digging its own grave.  And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it,  because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the  benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class  warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p>The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win  again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are  seeing what happens when we can all rise up.  And you know what?  Most  people don't care if Donald Trump himself does benefit in some way as long  a t rest of America is benefiting in big ways too.  That's what the  President was talking about when he said we can all rise up.  I want you  all to be as rich as me.  That's the message.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be.  It's part  of what has made.  This nation is so great.  Thank you so much, Gina and  Robin.</p><p>We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow.   Liz has got you.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, but Trish, did you see this.  We're  looking at a snapback reversal at this hour -- </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Welcome, everyone to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>taking his <person><nameText>America </nameText></person>first message right to the world stage. Tomorrow morning, the President is going to be delivering what many are calling the most important economic speech of his presidency. And in that speech, the President is also expected to pressure world leaders to do more to stop Kim Jong-un and his nuclear ambitions.</p><p>You know, I said it over and over and over again and I'm going to say it again, we have not even scratched the surface when it comes to economic pressure, economic pressure on China.</p><p>Senator Cory Gardner has been leading the charge on this effort and he's going to join me in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Blake Burman in Davos where the President is wrapping up his first full day at the economic forum. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And he's not even done. As we just saw there, he is sitting down for dinner, 8:00 here in the evening local time with European business leaders. Quite the crowd that he has with him here in Davos.</p><p>You just saw a little bit of that play out. The President is sitting down with leaders, for example, of Adidas, Bayer, Nokia, Nestle, Volvo, Deloitte, just to name a few. This is really been a two-fold message, really a two-fold reasoning for the President coming here to Davos.</p><p>The first you just hit on it, security issues that the United States and the world is dealing with, but also the economic message that the President wants to get across and the trade message he and his administration want to get across. Sitting down with those business leaders, those CEOs moments ago, here is <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just want to say that there has been a lot of warmth, a lot of respect for our country and a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars is coming into the U.S. and people are very happy with what we've done, not only on the tax bill, but also cutting of regulations. And I think also being a cheerleader for our country. You know, if you're not a cheerleader for your company or for your country, no matter what happens, it is not going to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: So the President got into town today. His delegation has been here for a couple days though. And the commerce secretary, <person><nameText>Wilbur Ross </nameText></person>made some headlines yesterday when he said that trade wars are happening every single day and U.S. troops, as he put it, are just starting to gear up.</p><p>On this very set earlier this morning when he spoke with Maria Bartiromo, the Commerce Secretary said it is not that he feels that there is going to be a race to the bottom, but he also clarified by saying the reality of it is there are trade abuses happening every day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>WILBUR ROSS, </nameText></person>SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: What I meant was this, every time someone violates trade rules, that to me, is act of war. Dumping steel is an act of war. Dumping aluminum is an act of war, dumping anything. Forcing technology transfers, same thing. That is what I had in mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: All right, so back to the President. He is at that dinner right now with European business leaders that will wrap up his day once he is done. He also met today, by the way, with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May. Tomorrow he has two more meetings with the presidents of Rwanda and Switzerland separately.</p><p>And then, of course, Trish, 8:00 Eastern, 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon here in Davos, the President will give that widely anticipated speech before the huge forum and really before the world. Trish?</p><p>REGAN: I'm looking forward to it. You know where I am going to be, watching FBN at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, tune in. Maria is there in Davos as well. Thank you soy much, Blake.</p><p>Joining me right now, former Economic Advisor to President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Art Laffer. Art, good to see you. I know you have a good mood today.</p><p>ARTHUR LAFFER, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: Great to see you.</p><p>REGAN: Did you hear Neil as we went into0 this program? He was pointing out to the viewer exactly what you have said all along when you said, you know, in a couple years, if this continues, if we get four percent growth, if we see a real significant upturn in the economy, tax revenues, well, they will go up and this whole thing will pay for itself.</p><p>LAFFER: It is the Laffer curve, isn't it? It's my profile, Trish. And it should be called the Cavuto or the Regan curve by the way. But --</p><p>REGAN: No, no. You --</p><p>LAFFER: -- it's wonderful, it's fun.</p><p>REGAN: -- you coined it back in the Reagan years.</p><p>LAFFER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: And, you know, it is the Laffer curve and it will always be known as such, sir.</p><p>LAFFER: Thank you.</p><p>REGAN: But walk as through. Do you think it's --</p><p>LAFFER: It happens. It happens --</p><p>REGAN: -- it's realist to think that that is in fact the going to be the case? No one thought.</p><p>LAFFER: -- I know, I'm very certain it is the case, Trish. Not only will we get higher growth, but it is more than just growth because you get all the personal behavior things. There is going to be less tax evasion, there's going to be less tax sheltering. They're going to be people are going to go back to c-corporations.</p><p>Corporate headquarters are going to move back to the U.S. There going to be secondary and tertiary tax revenues from income taxes, from payroll taxes, Medicare and Medicaid, all of this is going to have and state and local governments are going to do really well with this tax bill. And we're not only get it paid for, Trish, we are going to make a huge amount on this net.</p><p>I have never seen a surplus in the U.S. budget that does not come along with rapid growth and tax cuts. It just doesn't happen. So this is the --</p><p>REGAN: Wow.</p><p>LAFFER: -- this is the way to do it and Trump's done it and God bless him. I take my hat off to him. It's the best economic program I have seen by any president of the United States in his first year in office.</p><p>REGAN: Wow.</p><p>LAFFER: It is just incredible what he has done.</p><p>REGAN: That is a big endorsement from you, Art. Let me ask you this.</p><p>LAFFER: It's huge. Yes, please, yes.</p><p>REGAN: Democrat after Democrat is saying, well, you know, this was going to happen anyway. These companies would have given out bonuses, they would have raised wages. That was all in the works before this tax plan ever came into being. What do you say to them?</p><p>LAFFER: Well, I don't know what to say to them. I feel very sorry for them that they're playing catch-up. This was Democratic Party policy when Kennedy was president. They were the big tax cutters, pro-growers. There's budget surpluses and revenue raisers by cutting tax rates.</p><p>And now, these people are stuck in this alternative universe where they are the big naysayers. They want to hold up the budget. They want to raise taxes. They want to do all the wrong things. And I'm very sorry for them. But then, you know, they're wrong and we're right, and we won, and they lost, and now, they're trying to claim credit for what we won.</p><p>And if it had been done, Trish, they would have done it under Obama, but they didn't. And we did and it's going lead to prosperity. I'm very sorry, that they want to take credit for it, but they don't deserve it.</p><p>REGAN: They, you know, they certainly didn't have (INAUDIBLE) as obstructionist as they possibly could be, Art.</p><p>LAFFER: They have been totally obstructionist.</p><p>REGAN: And this thing through.</p><p>LAFFER: They voted against everything. Everything, they voted against. And this is the not the Democratic Party any of us ever knew in our histories. This is the antigrowth Democratic Party, which is brand new and really unpleasant.</p><p>REGAN: You know, and, Art, the other thing about the Democratic Party right now is they are out there saying, oh, this is nothing. A 1000 bucks, Nancy Pelosi says is crumbs, Art.</p><p>LAFFER: Yes, I know. I know.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, I don't know. But I think a lot of Americans would like to have an extra thousand dollars. Those are not crumbs.</p><p>LAFFER: Of course. I mean, these people --</p><p>REGAN: This is real money. This is significant.</p><p>LAFFER: They are desperate. They can see they're losing and they're desperate. And I wish they wouldn't. I wish they just come and join us and we can work out the stuff together just the way we did with Reagan under the '86 Tax Act.</p><p>You know, we passed the '86 Tax Act, Trish, with 97-3 on the vote. All the Democrats were with us to cut tax rate and provide growth. Al Gore told me, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, the best bill he ever voted for in economics. I mean, this is cool, cool stuff. And they should be with us, not against us.</p><p>REGAN: The Laffer curve at work. Thank you so much, Art.</p><p>LAFFER: Thank you. You know, Trish, that's lovely. Thanks.</p><p>REGAN: Let's turn to another big story. North Korean calling for unification of the Koreas, this as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is expected to do warn world leaders at Davos tomorrow that they got to do more to stop North Korea's nuclear ambitions.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Chairman of the Foreign Relation Subcommittee on East Asia. He is the point man on all things North Korea and he has been leading this charge on tougher North Korean sanctions. Here with me right now, Senator Cory Gardner. Senator, good to have you here.</p><p>CORY GARDNER (R), SENATOR, COLORADO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN: All right. I know your lead charge on North Korean sanctions. What about sanctioning China?</p><p>GARDNER: I think that's where we have to turn to. And we know that China has over 5000 businesses who are doing business with North Korea toy. They're in violation of our sanctions laws.</p><p>We know that the China has 10 businesses where at one point were responsible for 10 percent of North Korea's total economy. It has got to stop, and they've got to do more. If China wants to be a responsible global power, they need to make a choice, either do business with us or do business with them. You can't do it both ways.</p><p>REGAN: Well, you know, they signed on to the sanctions, sir, both Chinese and the Russians did, right? And then we have video of them out there trading with the North Koreans.</p><p>GARDNER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: Despite what they promised us. We've seen that North Korean GDP, their economy has grown.</p><p>GARDNER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: The only way it is grown is if they're trading with China. So that tells us China --</p><p>GARDNER: Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN: -- and here is the video that we have.</p><p>GARDER: Exactly right.</p><p>REGAN: So, China has not living up to what it promised us.</p><p>GARDNER: Yes. And what we're hearing is China is doing a little bit more than they have in the past. They didn't stop the new U.N resolutions that passed recently. That is more than they have done. But the problem is there is so much more to do and we don't have that much time.</p><p>As North Korea builds its nuclear program, they get further and further advanced. At some point, they cross that red line that is unacceptable to the United States. And China needs to step up to do more. They continue to send a crude to China -- North Korea, it's got to stop.</p><p>REGAN: I agree with you. But here is my question for you, sir. The markets at an all-time high, 26,418 right now on the Dow.</p><p>GARDNER: Right.</p><p>REGAN: And there is a lot of fear about a kind of trade war that it would destabilize our economy. Is that a risk you're willing to take?</p><p>GARDNER: We need to build trust with China. And trust with China that we don't want to have U.S. troops deployed on the Yalu River. But we need to build that trust and say, hey, we're interested in denuclearizing Kim Jong- un and his regime, let's build that trust. But we also have to make sure we look at the past, in the past, when we have taken strong steps toward China, whether it is Iran or other sanctions, they have came to the table.</p><p>They stepped up to the brink. And they actually behave in the way that was helped us solved problem in Iran. Now, we still have some a long ways to go in Iran but we have gotten even further way to go in North Korea.</p><p>REGAN: You know, I bring it up because I think we actually have a lot of ammunition here. And I'm not talking about military ammunition. I am talking about economic ammunition. And I say all the time, the viewer knows I would much rather be in a situation where we are losing dollars, Senator, as opposed to lives. And so, before we make a commitment to go to all-out war, --</p><p>GARDNER: Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- shouldn't we be doing everything possible, everything we can economically to be at war before we're actually losing lives?</p><p>GARDNER: I can't agree with you more. Look, this is a situation where we have plenty of room left on the diplomatic and economic runway to increase our pressure, increase our sanctions, increase the isolation diplomatically of the regime. Before any action is taken military, we have to be prepared for that alternative. We have to be prepared for the outcome. We will protect our allies, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens in Korea. But we have to ramp up that pressure to turn those dials so they move from the forth most sanctioned country in the world, to the first most-sanctioned country in the world, that being North Korea</p><p>REGAN: Senator Gardner, thank you very much. It's good to have your perspective here.</p><p>GARDNER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>REGAN: I do want to just to mention to the viewer, you know, this has come up over and over again on the show, Ambassador Bolton, let's see if we can play a clip here. He doesn't think that we would go to an actual trade war. He sees the military option happening first. Here he is with me a short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: The American business community is not going to sign on willing to cutting off access -- sanctions on steroid, as you put it, to the Chinese market. Look, on your show next week, call in the head of JPMorgan, Goldman Sach ans ask them how they would like to cult off banking access to the Chinese market.</p><p>REGAN: Well, I don't care about them. I care about the country and I care about the fact there could be a nuclearized North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: And I also asked why would Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs be calling the shots when it comes to our foreign affairs? In other words, who cares what they think. Who cares what the CEO's think. What we need to do is what's best for our people. So with that in mind, maybe we need to be looking long and hard at how we can better influence China economically.</p><p>Anyway markets soaring today on strong earnings. About a quarter of all S&amp;P 500 companies have reported in about 80 percent have beaten earnings, and they have beaten revenue estimates. This is great news happening on a day.</p><p>Home Depot joins hundreds of companies that are spreading the wealth out there. They're handing out bonuses to employees. And you know why? One after another tells us because of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>tax reform. So why won't the left give him any credit at all? Why are they trying to say that this is related to President Obama's economic policies of which he had none? We're on it next</p><p>REGAN: Stock surging right now, up triple digits, 119 we're higher on the Dow. The Dow is hitting new all-time high. You never get tired of it, right? Now on the pace for its 10th record close of the year, and guess what? It's only January.</p><p>This as Home Depot, Northrop Grumman, all jump on this wave of American companies given away bonuses and wage hikes as a result of the Republican tax bill. But get this? The mainstream media is still absolutely, positively refusing to give the <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>administration any credit at all for this economic success and for our now booming labor market.</p><p>Here is Commerce Secretary <person><nameText>Wilbur Ross </nameText></person>speaking with Maria Bartiromo earlier today in Davos, Switzerland. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS: They have no alternative but to make up fiction but, eventually, facts overcome fiction. And I think the fellow who just got $1000 check, doesn't care what the left-wing media says. Then the person who gets a tax cut in the next withholding he is also -- he/she is also not going to care what the left-wing media says.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald. Keith, you know, let's forget politics for a minute here. Let's just look at what is happening.</p><p>You get the market hitting high after high after high. You've got unemployment moving lower, record low. You've got wages moving higher. And I can't wait to see the numbers next month on wage inflation because we haven't had any wage inflation for -- well, the last 30 years or longer, adjusted for inflation.</p><p>So, this is an opportunity for to us be happy about things for a change, right? To be happy about the economy and happy about the markets, and yet, the Democrats and the media they won't go there. Why?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS: You know, this is kind of like a bunch of children on the playground. They're all going, not me or I wish I had. Political strategists of course are going to seize on a moment like this because the logic is irrefutable.</p><p>They're going to try to play the card that says well, we would have done it, this would have happened anyway. But the reality is it wouldn't have because that requires the cash that is coming from the tax cut. So, again, taking the politics out of it, the reality of money is you can't spend what you don't have unless you accrue debt. But if you have it you can spend it and that's what corporate <person><nameText>America </nameText></person>is doing. More than 200 corporations have jumped on bandwagon at this point.</p><p>REGAN: Well, you know, the left would say, well just because of the great policies of President Obama and now they're finally catching up to the economy. What do you say to that?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: Well, if that were true, then the words hope and confidence would have been a critical part in the American lexicon the last year, last decade, last 20 years. But the reality was uncertainty and hesitation was the bell word. That's why corporations kept the money overseas.</p><p>Now that they're bringing it home that reflects a change in sentiment. And CEOs are not dingalings. CEOs are very credible, intelligent people and they're moving their money where it is going to be treated best. And this time around is right here at home.</p><p>REGAN: So does that mean this rally continues for foreseeable future? I mean, what do you think? Jamie Dimon saying four percent GDP growth, is he right?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: I think Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest individuals on the planet and I think he is possibly the only individual over there who truly understands how to make money in today's complex financial markets, from financial perspective. And a lot of other managers do from manufacturing perspective. But yes I think he is absolutely correct.</p><p>REGAN: So are you still buying this market, Keith?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: I'm buying very selectively. Obviously you don't do anything, like bet the ranch or putting your inheritance. I mean, you do it intelligently, big medicine, big tech (ph), big resources, big defense, those are all things that the world must have. That's the intelligence place you can put your money because you know those things are never going to go away no matter what happens on Wall Street, no matter what the Fed does next or no matter what politicians decide on either side of the aisle.</p><p>REGAN: Well, it's a good time to be an investor I think, Keith Fitz- Gerald, thank you very much. Good to see you.</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: Yes it is.</p><p>REGAN: A recently leaked White House infrastructure plan outlines what they're calling value-capturing financing. Basically means that -- and this is crazy, a private landowner's property gains in a particular project, that may have come because of a public works project belongs in part to the government. Sounding a little Venezuelan to me but we're going through it all with Adam Shapiro, coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are also work to go rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by stimulating a $1 trillion investment and that'll actually probably end up being $1.7 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>addressing the nation' mayors offering more details on his long-awaited infrastructure plan which he says is going to be hart of Tuesday's State of the Union Address. This as leaked documents released this week call the White House's plan -- well, potentially problematic.</p><p>The White House is saying that this is actually largely accurate and they're pointing to $10 billion in cost-sharing payments, 50 billion-dollar for world project, $50 billion for transformative projects. But here is the sticking point. This is what is very concerning to a lot of people right now. There's something tucked in there called the value capture financing.</p><p>And Adam Shapiro has more on it but basically my concern about this --</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- and if I'm understanding your reporting right here Adam, you know, people's property rights wouldn't be the same.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Depending on where you live and what your city or state intends to do. Value capture financing, it sounds very wonky. We do it already in the United States through tax increment financing, have been doing for decades. This doesn't really affect individual homeowners.</p><p>Going forward, if the proposal as it's written for infrastructure, 200 billion in federal dollar to leverage a trillion in infrastructure projects they would require -- the federal government would require cities like say, let's just say New York, for instance, to have a value capture financing mechanism in place in order to get the federal tax dollars. So cities like New York would have to come up with what the rules would mean.</p><p>And what value capture financing tries to do is capture the value from increase in property values after a public work's project. So conceivably, Trish, you can say to the people who live along, say, Second Avenue in New York City whose apartment value all went up because they built that subway. You will going to have to give us a little bit of the sup side in gain in property value to help fund the subway.</p><p>Now, it's -- no one is doing it that way.</p><p>REGAN: I'm sorry. It kind of sounds Venezuelan to me, Adam. I don't like this one bit. So you're the person that buys the apartment, say, 10 years ago on Second Avenue and just because they decide to put a train there, and by the way, you go through 10 years of major discomfort and --</p><p>SHAPIRO: Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- you know what came with that, there were rats, right, on Second Avenue as a result of all that digging.</p><p>SHAPIRO: There are rats all over New York City.</p><p>REGAN: -- had to live with that. Yes, that's true. But they had to live with that for nearly 10 years, so shouldn't they, in fact, get that upside whatever comes with it. That's their property.</p><p>SHAPIRO: That's for the people of New York City and leaders of New York City to determine, but keep in mind that nobody is doing that yet. What's been proposed is that the federal government if they pass that proposal that was leaked as it is in order to get tax dollars from the federal government for future transit projects, cities like New York or say San Francisco or Cleveland, Ohio would have to have a value capture financing mechanism in place to get those federal tax dollars.</p><p>REGAN: OK, I see what they are saying.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Then, it would be up to the city to decide. It would be up to the city to decide if they were going to do it the way you and I just discussed. Nobody is doing it that way yet. Nobody is doing like that yet.</p><p>REGAN: Right. Because that would be pretty onerous and I think that there would be a lot of legal ramifications, shall we say, to that? But Adam, what's interesting here is, he is basically saying, OK, New York City, we will give you $300 million or --</p><p>SHAPIRO: $5 billion for subway.</p><p>REGAN: $5 billion whatever, but you're going to have to give us something back in return, the city of New York. I mean, they are going after a lot of these cities and municipalities and states big time. I mean, it's a salt.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Again, remember the federal government has always required cities like New York or cities like South Bend, Indiana to match in some form federal tax dollars. The change in this would be the value capture financing portion of it and it would be up to these individuals cities and states to determine how they would do that, nobody has said --</p><p>REGAN: OK.</p><p>SHAPIRO: -- what the battle on Capitol Hill is going be -- is if you're going to do this, what parameters do you put in place to make sure that a city like South Bend, Indiana, if they wanted to do a new light rail line didn't charge the tax home owner for the upside in t property value. Unless the people of South Bend wanted to do that.</p><p>REGAN: OK. Wow. All right, Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Just a proposal right now.</p><p>REGAN: Fortunately, Fortunately.</p><p>Joining me right now, Peter Suderman, he's managing editor for Reason.com. Peter, what do you think of this?</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, MANAGING EDITOR, REASON.COM.: Well, I think the most interesting and maybe the most worrying part about this is that it's mandatory, is that what the federal government is saying that if states want to get this federal money as part of this proposed infrastructure package which again is still a proposal, Trump hasn't even announced the full details, and we are talking about leaked information here. So it's -- this is not -- either a final proposal.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, I know. It's not perfect all the information we have and so we are just talking about this a bit in theory right now.</p><p>SUDERMAN: Right. So this is all theoretical --</p><p>REGAN: And the idea that cities would effective have to pay the government for any upside their property has and the question is would that wind up being individuals or just taxpayers as a whole?</p><p>SUDERMAN: I suspect that in a lot of cases it would wind up being developers and businesses. And so if you've ever flown over Washington, D.C., you can't see the subway because it's underground but you can tell exactly where it is because you can see the pockets of tall build that are lining the subway lines right and where all the stops are because people have built up around those stops and so the theory here -- and I'm not saying, I think it's a good one, but the theory here is, OK, those are pockets of economic activity, let's leverage that and in part this is because if you listen to the clip that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>earlier he said, we want to stimulate a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending. The idea is to take $200 billion and to turn it into trillion and so part of what that means is they're going to try to extract value out of the economy, out of the economic boom that they hoped that comes out of the 200 billion in infrastructure spending that they are potentially proposing here. I think that somebody is going to lose out of that.</p><p>REGAN: Well, let me jump in here and just point out that -- look, you know if you say, Mr. President, I really want you to build this new train or this new highway stop near my business, that's one thing, but if you just happened to be the land owner that winds up having a new highway exit in your part of town, how can the government come back to you and say, all right, you going to pay up because we put that exit and now your property is worth more?</p><p>SUDERMAN: I think the government is going to be -- can and often does say to property owners, look, you own property as a result, you are going to have to pay us, just for the privilege of owning property within the borders that --</p><p>REGAN: Well, then you don't really own it, do you, Peter? What happened to property rights?</p><p>SUDERMAN: I'm a home owner in Washington, D.C. And I often feel like I don't own my house. The district government exerts an awful lot of concern. And I think that this is -- like I said, I think it's worrying that not only is this something that is being proposed, it is being proposed as requirement in order to participate in the infrastructure plan.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Well, we will see what happens on Tuesday, of course, at the state of the union, but we are on it, you know that. Peter, thank you very much.</p><p>SUDERMAN: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>REGAN: Markets probably in the green right now, although cutting earlier gains that we saw on <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>comments about wanting a strong dollar, we'll going to have more on these markets and where they're heading next.</p><p>REGAN: Pairings (ph) and gains here, up just 92 now. And you can see we've reversed course there on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, just negative territory slightly and it's all coming as the President makes some comments on the strength of the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides, who is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Look at those comments and how it's affecting traders. Hey, Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Hey, Trish. So right now we've seen a mix buy, you can see the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq or to the downside, the Dow is higher by 92 points, had been up over 200, we had a lot of talk about the U.S. dollar, weaker U.S. dollar might help trade and that's very different than what we heard from prior administrations, that's something that's been front and center.</p><p>But big picture, the market has been running up to new record highs on the obvious and that is, a better economy and good corporate earnings.</p><p>We are seeing some of the winners here on the Dow Jones Industrial average, three at Boeing, United Technology, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, (INAUDIBLE) so far have been hitting new all-time highs on the Dow Jones Industrial average</p><p>I wanted to focus on both Caterpillar and 3M both of which actually had their quarterly reports, Caterpillar reported loss in the quarter, however the earnings including the tax charge and other items did top the analyst estimates. And the 3M, which actually hit a new high, that is the maker of Scotch Tape and bandages, post-it notes. They raised forecast as well. So that's a real winner. But ultimately, we've digested a few different pieces of information such as home sales today, home sales dropped, but why was that? In fact, it was because people had more in the labor market, they are doing better with their jobs. It was more demand for home and it wasn't the supply in decades. So that's the big picture on the market overall.</p><p>And we have come back, some people are really just taking money off the table and extensive conversation with one trader who said, having the best month of his career and he's selling, he's just saying, I don't want to lose it. So some people are right near the top and feeling pretty great and saying, let me take them off of the table.</p><p>REGAN: Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, oil prices, everyone, harboring a three year high as U.S. crude closest $65.51 a barrel. Our own Jeff Flock is live at the CME with more on this surge in oil prices. Hey, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, it had been a surge, up until I think maybe the President's comments on the dollar. You know, look, part of the run up, the most recent, yesterday at least, had been talking about a weak dollar which obviously is bullish for oil, now we're in the after hours down even farther than we were at the close, we are now trading 65.10. Just about $65 and, again, strong dollar, weaker oil prices which is not necessarily a bad thing. We've had a huge run-up here as you point out, Trish, and that on the strength of 10 consecutive weeks of draw down and U.S. supply.</p><p>There's much supply out there as we did, and maybe as much as people think, you know, we are swimming in oil. Indeed, we are making more oil in the country than we ever have in part thanks to the administration's policies but we still, you know, we are still part of the world marketplace and we still net import oil, so we are not at energy independence yet. But anyway, I think largely on the strength of the President's comments about the dollar, we are now trading down 50 cents from yesterday's -- or from the open this morning at 65.11, the last trade here at the CME in Chicago.</p><p>REGAN: All right, thanks very much, Jeff.</p><p>The Teamsters union playing ball with UPS in contact negotiations demanding the company not use drones, not use driverless trucks, nor make drivers work past 9:00 p.m. Nice life they might have, huh. Look, you know, you can't stop the future even though the unions are trying, so where is this going end up, details next.</p><p>REGAN: Teamsters labor union wants to ban UPS from using drones and delivering trucks to deliver packages. The union is entering contract negotiations with a whole long list of demands that include hiring 10,000 more workers and stopping all deliveries after 9:00 p.m. But with online retail creating a lot of demand for delivery companies, how can UPS actually agree to all of this and still compete with rivals like FedEx and -- well, the U.S. Postal Service?</p><p>Joining me right now Independent Women's Forum Senior Policy Analyst Patrice Lee Onwuka. Good to see you, Patrice.</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Good to see you too.</p><p>REGAN: So the unions are up at, at it again?</p><p>ONWUKA: They are. So I think they're actually speeding against the wind. Technology, automation, drone delivery is going to be really important for the transportation delivery industry in part because there's a huge shortfall of drivers, qualified drivers out there something like 48,000 shortfall jobs and in terms of jobs. And that's going to -- well, it's over 175,000 over probably the next decade.</p><p>So you need more drivers but you also need to make those drivers efficient particularly when they are delivering out in rural areas and that's why technology can really come in.</p><p>REGAN: You know, driverless cars are on the way, I was talking to Carlos Ghosn recently who said, you know, look just few years away, this is a very real possibility for our country that, you know, will all be in driverless cars which is good news for me since I hate to drive but between that and drones and you know how much Amazon has been investing in the drone industry, if these companies like UPS can't keep up with technology and if their workers are so resistant to that, you know, at some point, they're going to be out of business.</p><p>ONWUKA: I think so. I mean, realistically, I think the Teamsters are using this as a bargaining chip. I don't think they really expect that UPS would not allow for drone delivery. And by the way, there are also regulation that don't permit it and like a full commercial space, but, you know, it is important for us to be able to embrace technology, that also means, though, we need to start preparing our workforce for what that means, it may mean that we don't have as many drivers delivering trucks. But, you know, what are the other opportunities and the other jobs they're going to be available.</p><p>Technology is not something we should be running from. It's something we need to embrace but be smart about it.</p><p>REGAN: Yeah, I mean, and this -- we have an -- I would argue, had the right economic policies in place to be smart about it because, you know, I think about when I was a kid on the highway and you had to pay your toll, you gave it to -- you gave your money to someone, someone there at the toll booth, just doesn't exist anymore. And in some cases the tolls themselves don't exist because it's just all automated and they get your car going by. So these are jobs, right? These are actual jobs so we need to be transitioning our workforce, and it's a much bigger broader, I think, conversation, Patrice, because it gets back to a lot of things like education. It gets back to things like immigration. There's a lot that fold into it.</p><p>ONWUKA: There is. I mean, reaching (ph) the workforce for the future I think is one of those topics that people are afraid of and I think unfortunately you have some folks on the left who are using it as a political chip and a political ploy which they really shouldn't be, but we do need to think about from a policy perspective how do we bring together business, our higher education system, our K-12 education system and with like these technology companies to say, what are the skills, you know, what are the types of jobs that are not going to be automated that can't be replicated by a computer or Rosie the Robot, you know, that we can really start to prepare young people for.</p><p>You know, driverless cars, they are great, they're going to take some jobs away, sure but they also deliver us as consumers, you know, faster options, better options and cheaper options. So, you know, technology, I'm not one of those doom and gloom type of people out there.</p><p>REGAN: Right. We have to think differently.</p><p>ONWUKA: I think we need just to be smart. Exactly.</p><p>REGAN: Patrice, it's good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>ONWUKA: Good to see you too.</p><p>REGAN: All right, Nancy Pelosi is doubling down on her comments that bonuses that companies are handing out right now due to tax reform are simply crumbs.</p><p>Well, now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is joining the act saying, \"One thousand dollars doesn't go very far.\" How on earth can the Democrats look at anybody with a straight face and say things like this? This is nothing but a let them eat cake message, they're just wanting to try to win mid-term elections and they cannot admit that anything good is happening in our economy. I'll tell you one thing, a thousand bucks is a lot of money and it's a lot of money to a lot of people, Debbie, Nancy, maybe not to you, but to a lot of people. We will debate this, next.</p><p>REGAN: Nancy Pelosi dismissing once again those bonuses that companies are giving because of tax reform and saying they are crumbs, that's it, just crumbs, a thousand bucks is nothing. Take a listen to Debbie Wasserman Schultz today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN: Frankly, if you look at the bonuses, I mean, which, I haven't heard of a corporate bonuses more than a thousand dollars so far. But, I'm not sure that a thousand dollars which is taxable goes very far for almost anyone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: Actually I have heard bonuses of more than a thousand dollars by some companies. Anyway, even if it's just $500, or a thousand dollars, I mean, this is real money, why don't the Democrats get that. I thought that they were the party representing the people, hard working Americans to whom a thousand dollars matters to.</p><p>Donald J. Trump for President Advisory Board Member Gina Loudon is here and Democratic Strategist Robin Biro, they're joining right now.</p><p>Gina, you know, this is not chump change. I mean, maybe for Nancy Pelosi it is but for most Americans this matters.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: This is the single most, elitist statement I've ever heard. I think Debbie Wasserman Schultz is thinking in her mind, well, hey, I have a perm that costs more than a thousand dollars. But you know what? To your average minimum wage worker out there that they claim to champion who makes upward of $15,000 a year, that's 1/15th of their income. I don't care who you are or what your income is but if somebody told you we're going to get a 1/15th increase in your income this year, I know about you, I would be pretty excited.</p><p>So to say that it's chump change or to refer to it as chump, well, first of all, she is minimalizing it, because as you said, it's more you add on the parental leave that result to the bonuses, the stock options, the list goes on and on. They look like elitist losers, Trish, who have no concepts on how to reach their voters anymore.</p><p>REGAN: I think it's a big, big mistake, Robin, I think that this is suicide for them because Americans are looking at that -- thank goodness, you know, a little extra money. A lot of Americans, they are one car payment away from not being able to feed their family, that's the reality of the economy out there and I realize that Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman Schultz don't get that, they live in a different reality but they ought to get out of their cocoon now and then and see how people really are struggling.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: You better believe it. And, you know, that's mighty rich coming from Nancy Pelosi whose net worth is $39.3 million. So I do have a problem with her being the messenger of that statement. My problem with it, though, is that it's emotional.</p><p>You know, this Money is money. I've said this before. And it makes a difference to everyday Americans. They should have pointed out the disparity and maybe the hypocrisy that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>himself said that he won't benefit from this tax plan, when in fact we know that he will from the corporate pass throughs, the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax.</p><p>REGAN: I'll tell you, Robin, I've given them their talking point. You've heard me on the private equity carried interest loophole which was basically a big give away for real estate investors benefit from the private equity investors are benefiting from this and, you know, I will tell you, private equity investors they actually shouldn't. I've said before, this is nearly criminal when you think about it because they are calling their income an investment and I can't do that, you can't do that, Gina can't do that. Income is income, investment is investment. I digress.</p><p>But in other words, you're right, the Democrats, they could do so much more, there are opportunities to go after what maybe makes the administration vulnerable and the Republicans vulnerable but they're not taking them, they don't get it, do they not understand it?</p><p>BIRO: No, They really don't. I agree with GINA, this seems elitist to me on its face and I'm fearful that we are losing the message. We already had lost so much with the middle class and the Rust Belt, the far (ph) state. We can't put out statements like this.</p><p>REGAN: Gina, look, you know, it's good for the Republicans, I will tell you that because come midterms the economy is doing well and people have a little more in their pocket each week and Nancy Pelosi and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Chuck Schumer and the rest of them keep saying this is nothing but crumbs, they will become, the let them eat cake party.</p><p>LOUDON: Absolutely. It's like the dying bray of a donkey or something where you can't believe like it's literally saying this because it's only digging its own grave. And that is exactly how I saw this when I heard it, because I think that you're average person out there who was enjoying the benefits of the economy is going to be really tired of all of the class warfare going on and frankly just all of the identity politics in general.</p><p>The Democrats have got to get another message if they're ever going to win again, because that one is tired and old, and the American people are seeing what happens when we can all rise up. And you know what? Most people don't care if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>himself does benefit in some way as long a t rest of <person><nameText>America </nameText></person>is benefiting in big ways too. That's what the President was talking about when he said we can all rise up. I want you all to be as rich as me. That's the message.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, look, we're all very aspirational, as we should be. It's part of what has made. This nation is so great. Thank you so much, Gina and Robin.</p><p>We're off the highs of the session but still up 70 right there on the Dow. Liz has got you.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes, but Trish, did you see this. We're looking at a snapback reversal at this hour --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2018012501cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGX-RW61-DXH2-60CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7361\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001W53</classCode><className>NESTLE SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

This is a special edition of RELIABLE SOURCES, all about information warfare. I'm going to show you what I mean.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An example right here, Tucker Carlson attacking Ilhan Omar, and Omar hitting back, calling him a racist fool. What does Rupert Murdoch think about all of this?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, we're going to show a triumph of journalism. \"The Miami Herald's\" reporting about Jeffrey Epstein and that plea negotiated by Alex Acosta. It's the latest example of investigative journalism linked to hasty exits from Trump world. We'll get into that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And later a story about working together to cover the climate crisis. One of the biggest stories in the world. A lot coming up.</p><p>But, first, we've got to reckon with something really troubling that's going on in the media world. And here it is. The information wars are raging. And real reliable information is getting lost in a blizzard of B.S. B.S. that's designed to deceive you.</p><p>And most of the misinformation is not coming from Russian trolls, meddlers or other foreign governments. Yes, that's a problem. But most of this stuff is coming from right in our own backyards.</p><p>In America, it is fellow Americans peddling smears and racism. In China, it's Chinese government spewing propaganda. And India, well, here's a quote from Facebook's former security chief saying: In India, the disinformation is being proven by the India's political parties. All around the world, this is a growing problem.</p><p>Hundreds of years ago, newspaper owners and pamphleteers were able to spread lies. The difference now is the speed and the reach and the allure of the Internet. Information is being weaponized. The tension is being hijacked.</p><p>And all of us are really just starting to adapt. It was a lot easier in these days than it is today. The world is very murky. But there is a dividing line.</p><p>I want us to keep it in mind. I think it's between the people trying to be constructive and careful, carrying about truth, accountable to an editor or a boss or someone, versus people who are unaccountable, destructive, you know, caring only about winning the information world. Constructive versus destructive, that is the dividing line.</p><p>And that brings me, of course, to President Trump. Trump creates such a flurry of information. The truth melts away like an ice cube on a summer day.</p><p>I could show you a hundred examples, but here's one this week. Out of nowhere, Trump retweeted a loyal Trump super fan posted this the day after the Charlottesville riot. She wrote here: These protests are not spontaneous, they are pre-manufactured by OFA. She means Obama. And then she linked to a Lou Dobbs segment from FOX Business.</p><p>This is lunacy. A Twitter user who spends all day sharing pro-Trump anti-immigrant memes picks up a Fox segment, uses it to claim white supremacist violence was Obama's fault to deep the heat off Trump. And the president retweeted two years later, and no one bat an eyelash because Trump says so much, and the web is so chaotic and it's all so crazy, it's just background noise in this never-ending information battle. That's what I mean when I say there is an information war going on.</p><p>None of this is journalism, these memes, these smears, this crap has no relation to journalism. But journalists have to grapple with this misinformation muck, what we used to call fake news. Actually fake stories designed to deceive you, because otherwise, the result is uninformed, ill-informed readers.</p><p>We saw this at the White House social media that wasn't. Did you hear about this a few days ago? It was a clear stunt by the president. He was ridiculing reporters while inviting Internet trolls and far right TV personalities and fringe radio hosts to the White House, in some ways maybe a campaign rally for 2020.</p><p>It was tempting to say we should just ignore this event and call it a stunt and move on. But something important was happening. Trump was legitimizing provocateurs and in some cases extremists who deliberately spread misinformation. It felt to me like he was preparing his 2020 meme corps, you know, the folks that make those visual images that spread all across Facebook and go viral.</p><p>As Charlie Warzel of \"The New York Times\" put it, the summit suggests that 2016's meme army was just proof of concept for an information war in 2020. Warzel said whatever is coming, we're not prepared. I think what he means by we is newsrooms, media companies, the people that try to make sense of the world for you. It felt the summit was a campaign 2020 strategy session, with Trump's hand-picked press corps.</p><p>But the attendees don't work for newsrooms. In most cases, they don't have editors who have been trained in journalistic standards. What they do is they promote the president. They promote his brand, they promote his agenda, sometimes through conspiracy theories and misinformation.</p><p>[11:05:04] Now, I'm not trying to lump everyone in together. But that is what we see oftentimes on the pro-Trump web. Now, at the same time, disinformation knows no political party. There are liberals, there are Democrats are getting away with all sorts of smears as well. But we see it constantly on the right.</p><p>People like Jim Hoft, he's the founder of the right wing Website called \"The Gateway Pundit\", just one of the many examples of a website that specializes in this kind of misinformation that confuses people, OK? Putting up lies right here saying that recently Obama was responsible for removing the citizenship question on the census. That's obviously not true. It's false.</p><p>There were lots of other websites -- there are examples on this website of smears and false information that's been spread. But Gateway Pundit is just one example of this.</p><p>Here's the bigger story, I've got to be honest, I want to take a minute and talk you through this before I bring in the panel. These smears, these lies, this misinformation that comes mostly on the right from pro-Trump Websites, Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, supported by television hosts, radio hosts, they are softening the ground for straight-up racism out of the president's Twitter account.</p><p>That's what we are seeing today. This is one of the president's most recent tweets straight-up racist talking about progressive congresswomen. Let's read part of here. He says: It's interesting to see progressive Democratic congresswomen -- we'll put it back on a sec -- who originally came from countries whose governments are complete and total catastrophe. And now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States how to run the government.</p><p>Here's the key part. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came?</p><p>Now, he's probably talking about Representative Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia, who fled to Kenya and then came to the United States when she was 12 years old. There are other Democratic congresswomen who she is associated with, who she is friendly with, all of whom were born in the United States.</p><p>But the president is talking about Democratic congresswomen who need to go back to back to they're from.</p><p>It's 2019. We're two and a half years into the Trump presidency and his racism is becoming more obvious, more frightening. There are millions of Americans who knows what he means when he says go back to where you came from. They have heard those words in the school yard, behind their backs at work.</p><p>That kind of racism that Americans have been fighting against for decades is coming from the president's Twitter feed. There's no bigger story in the country right now.</p><p>And I want to relate this to the media by pointing out that the ground has been softened by the president by this collection of pro-Trump bloggers, radio hosts, television stars who somehow think it's acceptable to attack fellow Americans like this.</p><p>Let's talk about these information wars and a lot more. Again, a special edition of the program. I have a special panel to start us off.</p><p>Former senior adviser to national security under Obama and CNN national security analyst, Sam Vinograd, is here. Robby Soave is an associate editor of \"Reason Magazine\" and he's the author of \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump\". And from \"Vox\", senior politics reporter, Jane Coaston.</p><p>Jane, let me start with you. The president's tweets I view as part of this information war that's raging. And obviously he posts so much so off that's part of his strategy.</p><p>But are today's tweets different at all?</p><p>JANE COASTON, VOX SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER: I mean, I think we can all remember the Judge Curiel incident of 2016 to know that this is not new. That President Trump's views of who is adequately American are, shall we say, different from my own.</p><p>But I think that it's reflective of this understanding that to criticize this country means you are no longer able to be a representative of this country, which is a strange thing for someone who in 2015 described America as a hell hole to do. And I think that it's interesting, though, that this hasn't changed. You know, this is the same language he used about Judge Curiel of Indiana. This is the same language he has used again and again and again.</p><p>STELTER: You don't think the racism is getting more explicit in some cases?</p><p>COASTON: I think if you've been paying attention, this is just the basic way in which he talks about people with whom -- who don't follow him. I think there is an understanding of Trump. And I think one of the challenges we have is we are -- you're going to start seeing a lot of people attempt to defend these tweets by arguing that, no, no, no, he just meant this one representative, he just meant this. Maybe he did mean go back to Cincinnati.</p><p>But you're going to start to see that back and forth, back and forth.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>COASTON: But the thing is, what is at the root of this understanding, that if you criticize how this country works, you are no longer -- you know, you're no longer acceptable to the president and you're no longer available to continue in the work that you're doing.</p><p>[11:10:07] STELTER: As American as the rest.</p><p>COASTON: Right.</p><p>STELTER: Robby, how do you view it?</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REASON: Yes, I think it's shameful that this faction of the pro-Trump right has seemed to actually embrace identity politics, something the right has long criticized as being bad for this country. But they have embraced as now, you know, if you look different or you're from somewhere else, that defines you and thus we're going to criticize you on that grounds. And that's -- again, that's a thing that the right used to be really against or at least claim purportedly to be against.</p><p>And now, it's driving and defining so much of their criticism of other people. And, again, Trump ran on -- was like I'm going to be anti- identity politics, political correctness is killing.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>SOAVE: All that kind of stuff.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>SOAVE: But, of course, like so many criticisms of that, he is what he purports to criticize.</p><p>STELTER: So let's go big picture now, Sam. This broader information about information wars that are raging. Do you think that it is fair to say that, you know, these pro-Trump Twitter accounts, Facebook accounts, they soften the ground for what then Trump says?</p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I think the first rule of psy-ops or psychological operations, is to condition your audience. And President Trump, unlike previous U.S. presidents, uses information warfare against American people rather than against foreign enemies. You had the office of war information, the office of security during World War II, and other government agencies that were used to promote psychological operations against foreign enemies.</p><p>President Trump uses information warfare against perceived enemies here at home. And the issue is that all of these memes, all of these tweets are being weaponized. We're talking about these racist tweets today. They will be weaponized by Russian trolls, because they sow divisions, and they're going to be weaponized by Trump surrogates to try to spread information who, to your point, is or isn't American.</p><p>And, Brian, we have seen an uptick in hate crimes in this country. President Trump knows that these tweets about the other, about immigrants, have actual security implications and he just seemingly doesn't care because it ticks a political box for him.</p><p>STELTER: How powerful are they then? Robby, the people who were invited in the White House, social media summit that wasn't, how powerful do you think these provocateurs or are not? Let's be real about this.</p><p>SOAVE: Well -- so I would sound a more cautionary notes than some of these comments. I mean, there have been studies, for instance, that actually very little fake news is being seen or shared on places like Facebook and Twitter. I think the Twitter study was 80 percent of fake news was being seen by just 1 percent of Twitter users.</p><p>VINOGRAD: How much of that is Donald Trump's Twitter account, though? Because that's being reshared quite consistently and that has misinformation -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: And some of it is not all fake, right? Some of it is hyperpartisan content that can be accurate but if it's all obsessed with immigration, you come away with a misunderstanding about the world.</p><p>SOAVE: Right, this is a new way of delivering information to people, social media, broadly speaking.</p><p>STELTER: Right. We are all still learning how to interact in this world.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOAVE: We're learning and I don't think we should just like panic across the board about it because new is always different and scary. But, you know, there are traditional media outlets serving up what people would call fake information or misleading information, too. So, is this so different? Is this, you know, changing votes or warping the country?</p><p>It's bad and poisonous to tweet mean things about people. But I don't know this is responsible for Trump being our president.</p><p>STELTER: I think it is sending us more into our own corners. President Trump for years has told his fans not to believe the mainstream media. And as a result, they are likely to believe the folks that were invited to the summit. And so, as the result, the left's information pool and the right's information pool are becoming so separate from each other. And that feels like it has long-term consequences for democracy.</p><p>COASTON: I agree. And I think there is an understanding we're not even arguing about the same basic facts anymore, and understanding how this country works or what this country is supposed to do. I think -- you know, when we're not starting from, OK, we disagree about this one thing, we're not even sure what we're discussing anymore.</p><p>And I think an important point, though, about talking about the social media summit is that several people were actually banned from social media platforms, were not invited to the summit.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>COASTON: And there was someone who was invited but then disinvited because it turns out everyone likes moderating content of some kind, especially when it is an anti-Semitic cartoonist.</p><p>STELTER: And Robby sets up for our next segment. There are increasing calls on the right for regulation of technology companies, of the Facebooks, of the Twitters because of so-called claims of bias. How new is this? Where is this coming from?</p><p>SOAVE: Right, this was a dramatic shift in recent times. You would think the right would just generally speaking -- economic conservatives against government, regulation or intervention into private business. But the right feels that, or some segment of the right, significant segment, feels that they are -- that social media companies, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, et cetera, are biased against their content and are taking action against them. And they're saying the solution is for the government to act, to step in.</p><p>You know, as a libertarian, I think it would be disastrous. I mean, that has First Amendment implications if you're telling private companies what kind of content they have to allow on their platform, it's a problem.</p><p>[11:15:03] STELTER: Right.</p><p>SOAVE: But that it's something the right is very seriously interested in doing.</p><p>STELTER: So, fact versus fiction on that debate. That's coming up next. To the panel, please stay with me.</p><p>Quick break here. Then, we're going out to San Francisco to talk to Renee DiResta about fact versus fiction when it comes to these claims of bias.</p><p>STELTER: Hey, we're talking about RELIABLE SOURCES in the age of information wars, when partisans and propagandists spread ideas through memes and bots.</p><p>Right now, President Trump seems to be creating this new villain in the form of big tech, big tech technology companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, et cetera. He held this social media summit at the White House but didn't invite any of the tech companies. However, he did say he would have them into the White House soon for a meeting. We will see if that's true or not.</p><p>Let's talk about it with Renee DiResta. She's a research manager at the Stanford Information Observatory. In 2018, she testified at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on foreign influence involving social media.</p><p>And here with me in New York is CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy.</p><p>Renee, break down the idea conservative bias, the idea that the technology companies are biased against conservatives. How much of that is fact and how much of that is fiction?</p><p>RENEE DIRESTA, STANFORD INTERNET OBSERVATORY RESEARCH MANAGER: Yes. So, I mean, this is all anecdotal. And that's the problem. You know, Ted Cruz ran a hearing on this --</p><p>STELTER: All anecdotal?</p><p>DIRESTA: Ted Cruz ran a hearing on it a couple months ago and he started off by saying, all we really have are anecdotes right now. I mean, there are a couple reasons for that. So, there's two things that are universally true about moderation.</p><p>[11:20:00] And that is that it is nearly impossible to do well at scale and everyone is always unhappy with it. So, when you have the tech platforms, they have tens of millions of posts per day. You know, Facebook probably more than that with 2 billion users.</p><p>And so, what you see is massive quantities of content coming out. The latest stats from Twitter's transparency report said 11 million accounts were reported in the last six months of last year. And the most recent from Facebook says that tens of millions of posts are reported per week. And 2.6 million were actioned, which means they were taken down or someone -- you know, something had to change about them in the last three months.</p><p>So, when you have that volume of posts that are being actioned, that number of accounts --</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>DIRESTA: -- anybody can cherry pick certain anecdotal moments and tell a story about them.</p><p>What we don't have is any kind of real understanding about whether at scale there's a bias problem, whether there is an institutional or algorithmic, foundational problem with the way that these companies are handling information. There is nothing that suggests that that's true. Everything --</p><p>STELTER: So, we don't know --</p><p>DIRESTA: -- suggests the opposite.</p><p>STELTER: Right. So, we don't know. There's no reason to believe it's true. But it is a very effective political narrative for the president of the United States to say that he and his supporters are aggrieved, that they are the victims of these technology companies which are very powerful.</p><p>So, Oliver, is that what the summit was really about when the president gathered his supporters, his fans from social media on Thursday? Is that really what this was about?</p><p>OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, outside of being reprehensible about some of the people he invited, I think it was a fairly smart strategy.</p><p>STELTER: Politically.</p><p>DARCY: Yes. You see brands, right? And they know that Instagram influencers, for instance, can really sway the way the brand is looked at in public.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, on Instagram, you can follow a lot of addresses through Instagram influencers. Same idea. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>DARCY: Exactly. So, the president understands that these are his influencers. These are the people that influence media coverage and these are people that influence his supporters. And so, he is inviting them to the White House. He's giving them all the content that they need and really validating them saying, these are my guys, go forth and, you know, meme.</p><p>STELTER: And how does this relate to the broad -- and, by the way, not all memes are political.</p><p>DARCY: Right.</p><p>STELTER: Some are just funny. Some are political and funny. They're a new form of political cartoon. I just think there is just so much confusion and hate being spread through these kinds of viral performances. And that's the issue --</p><p>DARCY: The people that he invited to are a lot of conspiracy theories. People that put smears online. And I think what the president of the United States was doing there is basically giving them the okay. I mean, he didn't do it --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: Keep it going. Get better for 2020.</p><p>DARCY: Go out and do the stuff for me on my behalf. And that's what's disturbing and really worrisome.</p><p>STELTER: Renee, what is the compact of that long term?</p><p>DIRESTA: Well, I think even the idea that we are dignifying this with the idea that it was a social media summit --</p><p>STELTER: I know, I know. It was not a summit. It was not a summit. He called it there.</p><p>DIRESTA: It was not a summit. Nobody was there to discuss anything. This was a pseudo event.</p><p>This was an event that was guaranteed -- it was a gathering to generate media coverage around a manufactured controversy to keep it in the news, to keep people talking about it. This is a David and Goliath story for him, right? He is going to be the defender of people against these big evil tech companies.</p><p>And the problem is it really distracts from the fact that there is actually a whole lot wrong with big tech as it is today. And having these waste-of-time kind of moments that are indicative of nothing distracts us from having conversations about the real problem. It makes people believe that they are being censored.</p><p>And, occasionally, you know, I would ask folks on Twitter, why do you think you're being shadow banned? Why do you think that is? And you hear responses when you asked that question, like, well, my friends don't see all of my content. So, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of basic things like algorithmic curation on online.</p><p>And the fact that you don't see everything that friends post, and that's because there is such a high volume --</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>DIRESTA: -- that the platforms are constantly curating it to show people what they want to see.</p><p>And then the other problem with that, to your point about not all memes are bad, is that the ones that go viral unfortunately are the ones emotionally resonant, that drive a lot of engagement. And so, you have a situation where the most sensationalist content is what's privileged.</p><p>STELTER: You look online on some of these accounts, with millions of followers. And all they're doing is talking immigrants killing Americans, immigrants destroying America. There is so much of it -- there's so volume of it. It's so one-sided and so misleading, that eventually, it hurts public understanding.</p><p>It's not that every individual video is false. It is eventually it hurts people's understanding. And companies like Facebook and Twitter don't have a solution to that, right, Renee? There's no easy solution for that?</p><p>DIRESTA: No, there is no easy solution for --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: It's about human psychology, yes.</p><p>DIRESTA: Yes. Well, it's propaganda. So, it's computation propaganda. It's -- there is nothing that is illegal about propaganda. Most of it is -- you know, there is some grain of truth in there. That is why it is so convincing, that's why it's so resonant.</p><p>And so, the problem becomes the platform don't want to be in a position of moderating around truth.</p><p>[11:25:00] And so, they are left with this weird challenge of, you know, how can they moderate? And so, some of that is to look at how the information is spreading. Does it look like it's spreading authentically, or does it look like there are bot farms that are in there amplifying content, and you know, pushing things -- trying to be in the algorithms to get into these people's feeds?</p><p>There is no easy answer for a lot of this stuff, and that's because it's not going to come down under the terms of service that the platforms have because it's a political point of view.</p><p>STELTER: Renee, thank you. Oliver, please stick around. We go to media literacy later this hour. Up next, though, the view from the White House press corps. Alex Acosta is just the latest example of how news outlets are kind of functioning as Trump's human resources department.</p><p>STELTER: Hey, welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. I'm Brian Stelter.</p><p>We're going to go head to the White House beat now and I was going to begin with Alex Acosta resigning from the Trump cabinet, just the latest example of a Trump administration official in the wake of real investigative reporting.</p><p>But I would like to begin instead with the president's most recent tweet storm with a clear example of racism. The president saying that congresswomen, progressive congresswomen should go back to where they came from, fix their countries, and then come back to the U.S.</p><p>Let me bring in Katie Rogers of \"The New York Times\". She's been writhing about this. Her story is up on NYTimes.com right now and she's taking a few moments to come along with us, before she goes back to work.</p><p>Katie, what happens on a morning like this? All you were going to do this morning I hope is come on RELIABLE SOURCES, and then you have to write about the president's tweets.</p><p>KATIE ROGERS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, I mean, well, I -- to be sure, we always wake up on Sunday or Saturday mornings with the expectation that we'll be writing something about what the president has tweeted.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>[11:30:00] ROGERS: This particular attack against these for congresswoman came sandwiched between tons of retweets of his supporters and it just is on a day when there are ICE raids across the country. It's a very noisy day in general and he threw this in.</p><p>And so trying to write a story that contextualizes what he just said and putting that against what his administration is actually doing today is the -- is the trick.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR: Actions are always more important than words but words tell you about the actions. In your story, you say Democrats are calling this a racist trope. Have you heard from any Republicans responding to this?</p><p>ROGERS: Not yet. I mean, it's still early but mostly it's Democrats coming out and masked in support of these women saying -- I think Speaker Pelosi said something about this proves that make America great again has always been about making America white again. It's a pretty forceful attack on the President's words and it's actually privately Democrats are saying that this is sort of the galvanizing point that Democrats need right now.</p><p>This so-called squad has sort of been in a generational and existential battle with Pelosi. Trump might have just given them a gift.</p><p>STELTER: Right. This squabble might be resolved at least in part because of Trump's attacks. So let me ask you about Acosta and what it was like at the White House this week. All week long there were questions about what was going to happen. Now that Jeffrey Epstein is back behind bars, the plea deal negotiated by Acosta is under renewed scrutiny all thanks to the extraordinary reporting of the Miami Herald and Julie K. Brown.</p><p>By Friday, Acosta is out. I guess that press conference was not enough to save his job. Let's put on screen the other Trump officials who also left their jobs in the wake of really important investigative reporting. What did you make of this pattern, Katie, just six examples on screen but this is not a complete list of Trump departures linked to reporting?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, I think Acosta's was interesting because he actually was Senate confirmed. This plea deal came up in his line of questioning, he was still confirmed anyway. What was different was Julie Browns Miami Herald, her excellent work exposing the existence of this plea deal with Epstein that was secret that was kept from the victims, she was -- actually one of the things I saw her do after the press conference on Thursday was she immediately delivered sort of a point-by-point -- well here's what I know about you know my reporting and here's what Acosta said.</p><p>One of the examples was she thought his explanation of having a breakfast meeting with Epstein's defense lawyer right after the plea deal was still unclear. It's unclear what they talked about. She was actually -- she knew the subject so well that she immediately was able to fact check that sort of in real-time and it became sort of evident that you know, Acosta was not going to be able to surmount that coverage even though he tried.</p><p>STELTER: Now Acosta is out and I hope there can be more focus on the victims in this story. That is the focus. That should be the focus what these women went through. Katie Rogers, thank you so much. I let you get back to work.</p><p>ROGERS: Sure.</p><p>STELTER: Coming up here, how should the news media be covering the ICE raids that are reportedly starting across the country today. That's next.</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER: A fear-mongering show for the cameras. That's a fair description of what President Trump has said will be ICE raids major U.S. cities apparently today. He says this is going to happen. We don't have any confirmation yet about this happening but it is reportedly underway this weekend. So the idea is that the ICE is targeting about 2,000 people who are felons who are supposed to be deported. This is something that, of course, goes on all the time in the United States. But President Trump has been hyping it up talking about it, promoting it like it's a big event while people's lives are at stake.</p><p>There is a conversation we need to have about how to cover these sorts of -- well, are they stunts? Kyle Pope of the Columbia Journalism Review thinks so. He says journalism job must be to frame the immigration crackdown as a campaign event not a policy response that claims lives as collateral damage.</p><p>Now, let me bring back the panel and talk more about this with our group here Samantha Vinograd, Robby Soave, and Jane Coatson. Sam, the idea that the president is talking up these deportations, deportations that have been happening for decades, what do you think his strategy is?</p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: His strategy is to paint immigrants as criminals when it comes to internal security, much in the same way that he's done this when he's talked about Mexico, rapists coming across our borders, when he's talked about external security and what's coming across our southern border.</p><p>There -- he is trying to stereotype people that are here illegally by putting them in the same bucket. The challenge for us is to hold him to account when it comes to the human rights abuses, frankly, that are happening under his watch when it comes to migrants. We have potentially more family separations that are going to happen as a result of these raids.</p><p>STELTER: Right, but he wants these pictures right. He wants us to be showing this all day long all week long.</p><p>VINOGRAD: He -- I don't know that he wants us to be showing the pictures of family separation, the pictures of the children that according to the United Nations may be suffering human rights abuse at the hands of the U.S. President. That's why Vice-President Pence was allowed into one facility which had horrific conditions.</p><p>And then vice President Pence slammed CNN for the dishonest coverage of his visit to this facility because Vice President Pence said that CNN didn't show pictures of children smiling. We all have to be equitable in how we --</p><p>STELTER: We did show those pictures but we had to blur out their faces because of privacy reasons required by the government.</p><p>VINOGRAD: Right. But we all have to be equitable in terms of how we talk about migrants. They are migrants that have violated U.S. law. We should cover that. And there are also children that are in inhumane conditions in facilities at the same time. We should be equitable even if President Trump is not.</p><p>STELTER: Let's talk about what the president said about free speech this week because I don't want the show to go without noting what he said. Here is his comment about what free speech is and is not.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it, but that's not free speech.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: Is that free speech?</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REASON: Yes, that's free speech. And ironically, this was at the social media summit where the audience is supposedly a pro-free speech crowd who are concerned about censorship and you know and these are people who are also very upset.</p><p>And I'm upset as well about this sometimes too, about the left kind of turning against free speech and saying things like hate speech is in free speech. Well, this is the exact equivalent of that, Trump saying dangerous speech is not free speech, dangerous speech being speech that is like remotely critical of me in some way.</p><p>[11:40:03] STELTER: Yes.</p><p>SOAVE: So I mean, it goes to show you that he is a hypocrite on free speech as unfortunately so many are.</p><p>STELTER: Jane?</p><p>JANE COASTON, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, VOX: Yes. And I think that we see that time and time again because some of the same folks who were invited to this social media event made the point on Twitter of like while this person isn't banned but I got banned. And when the argument should be no one should be getting banned for -- on speech reasons you know.</p><p>And so I thought it was interesting that he's making this point that no, no, no, free speech isn't when I don't like it. It turns out free speech is when you don't like it.</p><p>STELTER: Is when you don't like it.</p><p>COASTON: And then you know, you have the speech to be able to respond to the thing that you don't like. That's how this works. That's how the constructive speech in this country is supposed to work.</p><p>STELTER: It is. One more note. Robby, you inspired me to bring this up about the Little Mermaid. All right, let's put Robby's headline on screen. You said, the backlash over the Little Mermaid casting, a black Ariel is fake news. That's the wrong tweet. We'll put up your right headline in a sec. What is the fake controversy here?</p><p>SOAVE: Yes. So it was trending on Twitter that people were outraged that Disney had cast a black actress to play The Little Mermaid who was white in the cartoon. So this is a racing of our culture which is -- which is ridiculous absurd and racist. But actually, it was trending because most people were saying -- were deploring the racism in saying that we were happy to have a black Ariel.</p><p>You know, there were like six people who had said the racist thing and then hundreds or thousands of people saying we condemn this. So then it's trending and it looks like news but that's deceptive. It's trending because people were good and like this is a humanity is good moment.</p><p>STELTER: I thought this has been a problem for years and it's got getting any better, Jane, this idea that stories are trending but they're not actually trends.</p><p>COASTON: And they're not actually trends. And a lot of the tweets -- I think you pointed this out in your piece, they were fake they were -- you know, you steal an image from some Instagram influencer and make that your user image, then you write something banana is racist, and then you just you know, you have one tweet, and that just goes around a lot and then everyone dunks or response to that tweet and then you think yours is done when you're just doing whatever this fake Twitter user wanted you to do.</p><p>STELTER: And to link this back to our earlier conversation, Sam, for interference, all these kind of operations, this concern about Russia meddling, Americans are doing this to each other.</p><p>VINOGRAD: Americans are doing this to each other.</p><p>STELTER: At least a lot of it.</p><p>VINOGRAD: They are. And you know, some of this to your point is free speech and Americans using social media as they want to, but I'm going to bring this back to President Trump, Brian. It is harder to get accurate information and to set an example when President Trump's Twitter feed resembles a Russian trolls and spreads misinformation and false facts and conspiracy theories.</p><p>Americans as private citizens can use Twitter and social media as they want as long as they don't violate the Terms of Service. And criticizing people, putting up fake memes, that's not violating social medias Terms of Service. What we all have to do is check the user and check the source and be very cognizant of the fact the President Trump and members of his administration are weaponizing information for political purposes much in the same way that foreign actors have done against Americans in the past.</p><p>STELTER: Let me pause for the panel. Thank you all for being here. We do have some breaking news. Let stand by for that. I mentioned a few minutes ago, ICE raids have been expected but no confirmation they've started. Now we have the confirmation. CNN's Jim Acosta telling us three minutes ago that a senior administration official tells him deportation raids are now underway in at least some of those cities I mentioned.</p><p>The official declined to give any specific operational details on where the raids are taking place, however, CNN has learned that the immigration authorities were planning raids in nine cities starting today Sunday. They were slated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and San Francisco. That's according to a senior immigration official.</p><p>A raid that was planned for New Orleans was postponed due to tropical storm Barry. So that's the word from CNN Jim Acosta. These Ice raids have started in at least some of those cities that President Trump was talking about. He's been promoting this idea. In my view, he wants press coverage of this in order to stoke fear and a controversy. We will see how the press covers this in the days and weeks to come, but we are told those ICE raids have started.</p><p>A quick break here and RELIABLE SOURCES. When we come back, a new for Fox's Tucker Carlson.</p><p>[11:45:00] STELTER: Now let's connect the dots between Paul Ryan, Ilhan Omar, and Rupert Murdoch. Ryan the devoted Republican and former Speaker of the House is getting trashed by President Trump for speaking truth to author Tim Alberta in the upcoming book American Carnage which is out on Tuesday.</p><p>Alberta quotes Ryan saying we've gotten so numbed by it all, not in government but where we live our lives. We have a responsibility to try and rebuild. Don't call a woman a horse face. Don't cheat on your wife. Don't cheat on anything. Be a good person. Set a good example.</p><p>Yes, yes, but Paul Ryan, you can help try to rebuild given your appointment to the board of the Murdoch's Fox Corp where Trump's most bombastic beliefs are on repeat all day long. Well, Bill Kristol called this out on Twitter this weekend. He said, perhaps Ryan could do something to halt some of the most egregious nativism and reckless demagoguery and conspiracy theorizing at Fox News since you're on the board.</p><p>And that brings us to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Tucker on Tuesday gave a speech on his show claiming that immigrants like Congresswoman Omar are dangerous, that they are undermining America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, HOST FOX NEWS CHANNEL: After everything America has done for Omar and for her family, she hates this country more than ever. She's an undisguised contempt for the United States and for its people. She's a living fire alarm, a warning to the rest of us that we better change our immigration system immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: The thing is Carlson has been talking that way almost as badly about Omar for many months. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Maybe our immigration system should prioritize people who actually like this country and are grateful to be here. According to Omar, there's barely a difference between this country and terrorist groups like al-Qaeda.</p><p>Congresswoman Ilhan Omar herself a symbol of America's failed immigration system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: Former Speaker Ryan, what do you think? Is Carlson setting in a good example? CNN's Oliver Darcy is back with me here. And Oliver, let me ask you a different question. Do you see a connection between Carlson's attack against Omar saying she's a danger and President Trump's racist tweets today?</p><p>OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: I think there's a clear connection here between the two. Carlson's rhetoric this week where he's basically saying effectively the same thing the President said this morning that people who are coming to this country hate this country just by criticizing some of the policies. And now the president basically saying today that if you don't like this country you can go back to where you came from.</p><p>So there's an undoubted connection between these two things and it's not surprising either, right, because the President does --</p><p>[11:50:21] STELTER: He knows he's watching.</p><p>DARCY: He watches Tucker Carlson.</p><p>STELTER: And he's talking with Carlson.</p><p>DARCY: Yes, he gets his advice from Carlson. We know during the Iran incident that he was advising the president. So I'm sure he's probably talking about these other issues and immigrations a hot issue for the president so it's not surprising. It is disturbing though that we're having this kind of rhetoric. It's one thing for Tucker and the president to criticize where Ilhan Omar might stand on policy --</p><p>STELTER: Of course. Bring it on.</p><p>DARCY: It's another thing to effectively say go back to where you came from.</p><p>STELTER: You don't belong here.</p><p>DARCY: That's disgusting there.</p><p>STELTER: You're not as American as me.</p><p>DARCY: Right.</p><p>STELTER: That's what he's saying. You're not as American as me. DARCY: And like you pointed out earlier in the segment, anyone who's not you know, maybe white hair and blonde hair and white knows how it feels to say -- to hear those words.</p><p>STELTER: Go back.</p><p>DARCY: To hear those words, go back to where you came from.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, to where you came from.</p><p>DARCY: It's not a good feeling.</p><p>STELTER: So let's wrap up on the topic of the information war we've been talking about this hour. This information war rages online every day. What advice do you share with folks who just want to know what is actually real and what is true? What is the media literacy lesson?</p><p>DARCY: I think it's difficult these days to know what is real and what is true. And I think that's what the President wants. He wants it to be confusing. He wanted to -- people not to know what's real and what's true and to take his word for it or to just be confused in general.</p><p>I mean, I would recommend that people watch this network, people read reputable outlets, The Journal, The Times, The Post, but most people I think they don't actually read the front page of the newspapers every morning. They go on Facebook, they see what their friends are sharing, and a lot of times what they're seeing is misinformation content from hyper-partisan Web sites, and I'm not really sure how we get out of this.</p><p>I think that we're going to be in this for a while and now the platforms are trying to do stuff about this. And so when they're reading out a lot of this misinformation, now they're being accused of bias because the right is flooding the whole area, the arena with misinformation. It's just a --</p><p>STELTER: That's where we are.</p><p>DARCY: -- a crazy place that we're at right now.</p><p>STELTER: It is where we are right now. Balanced diet is the best advice I can always give about a wide variety of news sources but that's only part --</p><p>DARCY: Right. It's easier said than done as well.</p><p>STELTER: It is. Oliver, thank you. A quick break here. More RELIABLE SOURCES in just a moment.</p><p>[11:55:00] STELTER: Hey, we're out of time here on T.V. but I hope you'll check out our on online feature about the Florida Climate Reporting Network. I spoke with two editors and one reporter about what they're doing in Florida to combine resources. And you can listen on our RELIABLE SOURCES podcast, listen to our full conversation about what it means to be collaborating with six newsrooms in the state of Florida.</p><p>We'll be back this time next week here on RELIABLE SOURCES, but stay tuned tonight for the movie. This the second episode of CNN's new original series The Movies. It's playing at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time. And we'll see you right back here on RELIABLE SOURCES this time next week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019071401CNV50</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-MN61-JB20-G35Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 14, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Therefore, as a matter of national security, I've signed this  omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this  bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill,  but we were in the sense forced if we want to build our military. We were  forced to have. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are some things we should have in the bill, but I say to Congress, I  will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again.  Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what --  $1.3 trillion. It's the second largest ever. We need to take care of our  military. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  All this on a day when the markets went down.  The Dow, S&amp;P, NASDAQ suffering their worst week in more than two years. The  Dow shedding more than 1100 points in two sessions. Trade jitters have been  rocking Wall Street. </p><p>Then, after that veto tease you saw, President Trump did indeed sign the  $1.3 trillion, 2200-page spending bill today. He says he's not happy about  it taking aim at the Democrats saying never again and calling them out for  wasteful spending on personal projects and for not extending legal  protections for the DREAMers. </p><p>Tonight we'll break it all down. Also tonight, the White House cracking  down on Iran. Nine Iranian nationals and one Iranian entity facing  sanctions today from the Treasury Department. </p><p>Tonight, we have a guest who says it's more proof the Iran deal is just a  bad deal. Also more Facebook data leak fallout. The billionaire Tesla  founder Elon Musk hitting Mark Zuckerberg hard, jumping on the delete  Facebook movement, deleting his own page and the SpaceX and Tesla pages as  well. </p><p>Tonight, a guest who recommends that do you the same. </p><p>It is an all-star guest line up. The Republican Congressman Tom Reed here  on that spending bill. Retired lieutenant general Thomas McInerney says  it's about time the military got some salary hikes. Former British Prime  Minister David Cameron adviser, Steve Hilton on the prospect of a trade war  with China. </p><p>More California cities looking to reject the state's sanctuary status.  Orange County supervisor Michelle Steel on her new push. It's all here and  it's all tonight. </p><p>Politics and money, we've got you covered. Good to be with you on a Friday.  I'm Connell McShane. Risk &amp; Reward starts right now. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have tremendous opposition from the Democrats. So if we take  something for the military, they want something for, in many cases, things  that are really a wasted sum of money. It's not right, because we need to  take care of our military, and because the Democrats, who don't believe in  that, added things that they wanted in order to get their votes. </p><p>DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats. We  wanted to include DACA. We wanted to have them in this bill. Eight hundred  thousand people, and actually it could even be more, and we wanted to  include DACA in this bill. The Democrats would not do it. </p><p>To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on  Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills, and  the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get down to  work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCSHANE:  President Trump calling out the Democrats as we wrap up what was  the worst week on Wall Street in more than two years. The Dow shedding more  than 1100 points here over the course of two days. And we're going to talk  a lot about that tonight. </p><p>First, though, President Trump signing that $1.3 trillion spending bill  after threatening to veto because his border wall wasn't fully funded and  there was no fix, he said for DACA. President signing what was a monster  piece of legislation, reluctantly saying in order to secure a necessary  increase in military spending he had to give money to Democratic projects  that he called a, quote, \"wasted sum of money.\" </p><p>Let's talk more though, about these markets. Boy, it was a brutal week and  just a terrible two days. We have fears of a trade war on Wall Street,  maybe some questions about the Fed as well. </p><p>We bring in Nicole Petallides who's live this evening on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange, and more than anything, Nicole, just another, just  another terrible finish to the day in that final hour, right? </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, you make a great point,  Connell. Because we saw much of the same yesterday. We started off to the  downside and drifted lower only to finish down over 700 points. And there  was hope for somewhat of a bounce back today, you can see in our intraday  chart here that we're showing, that you did see some green in the morning,  so there was some hope for those tech and financial groups that really have  gotten hit hard lately but they just couldn't keep them out there, so many  elements that are hitting these markets. </p><p>The Dow finishes down 424 points, today at 1.7 percentage. It's down about  1500 points for the week. Worst week for stocks since January of 2016. The  Dow took out the February 9th, the February lows, the S&amp;P 500 did not, but  it got close. </p><p>Taking a look at some of the big losers for the week. We saw 3M, G.E.,  Goldman Sachs down between 8 and 10 percent, and then we saw the defense  stocks. That was one group that did well on the heel of the spending bill  and more military support. </p><p>Facebook was a big issue, it hit tech stocks, and that was down about 13  percent for the week and drop box was the winner. That was a new IPO in the  technology sector and was well received. It was up about 35 percent. Big  picture, there are still worries and we saw some rotation. Defense stocks  and energy did all right. Back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes. It was rough. Get out of there, Nicole. Thanks a lot. We  appreciate. Have a good weekend. </p><p>Let's get to this massive spending bill now. The New York Republican  Congressman, Tom Reed (AUDIO GAP) who voted against it. He joins us now.  Quite a day, congressman. We're looking at the president who was thinking  he said about a veto, but he signed it, your thoughts? </p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  Well, you know, obviously, I voted against  it, and I shared the concern that was expressed by the president about the  fact that it wasn't in a position to be read and digested. </p><p>But on top of that, the massive amount of spending, I totally appreciate  the defense side of the equation.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>REED:  But the amount of spending overall is just mind-boggling to me. And  we have to get this national debt and the debt crisis under control. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I'm going to get to that defense in a moment. Are you  disappointed though, in the president's decision? </p><p>REED:  Well, you know, obviously I understand where he's at. He was in a  very difficult situation. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>REED:  Shutting down the government versus signing that bill. It's  incumbent upon us on Congress to lead on the issue. I appreciate the  president sending the message, we need to do better in Congress and that's  why I'm hopeful the next go around. </p><p>MCSHANE:  He used the argument, to your point, that he had, basically no  choice if he wanted the money for the military than to sign this. Take a  listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  While we're very disappointed in the 1.3 trillion, nobody more  disappointed than me because the number is so large, it will start coming  down. We had no choice but to fund our military because we have to have, by  far, the strongest military in the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  I was down in Washington all week and I heard Paul Ryan make that  same exact argument a number of times. So it's the idea, congressman, that  I guess you're never going to get a chance like this again if you don't  sign this. Is there something to that, that you would never have a chance  to have this type of an increase for military spending? </p><p>REED:  Well, I think we just we definitely were on a position on the  defense side. We needed to make those investments because our men and women  were being put in harm's way where we were. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>REED:  But at the end of the day, it shows exactly what was negotiated  here. They went more on the defense side in order to get the nondefense  number where they need because they needed those 10 Democrats plus or minus  to come over to support the bill. That's why going to 51 votes on the  Senate, at least on the appropriation the spending bills, to me is a reform  the Senate should strongly consider at least going down that path. Maybe  not blowing it up for anything, but at least for the appropriation spending  bills. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. Boy, I wonder if they'll do that. It doesn't seem like  this any kind of movement, right, to go in that direction? </p><p>REED:  No, it doesn't. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>REED:  It's been very clear us to that they don't want to change that  threshold. They want the Senate wants to continue that archaic rule but  that's up to the Senate to decide. All I can do is vote my conscience,  which is a no.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>REED:  This debt crisis is upon us. We need to get the spending under  control, and if we don't, our children and grandchildren are going to be  saddled with such debt and this county is threatened by this debt crisis  today is going off as we speak.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCSHANE:  One quick political question, Congressman on this, I know you say  you voted your conscience and voted no. But how worried are you about the  midterms at this point and the blowback from a bill like this, the effect  it could have on Republicans? </p><p>REED:  You know I think if we just continue as individual members to go out  and work hard and put our voice and our positions out there, we're going to  be fine on the Republican side. We have tax reform, we're seeing the  benefits in the economy. </p><p>Jobless numbers, the president hasn't been given credit for, in my humble  opinion, you know, low unemployment numbers, lowest levels for Hispanic and  African-American unemployment, we got to send that message and sell that  message to the American people and I think they'll be with us at the end of  the day. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I want to get your thoughts on one of the story before we let you  go, just on Iran, nine Iranian nationals today, one Iranian entity facing  sanctions also the prospect of federal charges. Let's take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROD ROSENSTEIN, UNITED STATES DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Federal grand jury  in the southern District of New York indicted nine Iranians for conspiring  to hack into computers and to defraud American and foreign universities,  businesses and government agencies. This indictment alleges that the  defendants worked on behalf of the Iranian government, specifically the  Islamic revolutionary guard corps. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  The charges you heard that these Iranians essentially, you know,  like they hacked into hundreds of universities and other organizations and  stole information on behalf of the government of Iran, so it comes at a  time, we're getting a new national security adviser, Iran is in the news  anyway, in particular the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Your thoughts. </p><p>REED:  Absolutely. I support the actions taken by the Justice Department as  well as treasury in regards to going after Iran for these actions of  hacking into our systems and stealing our information and putting real  American interests at risk. </p><p>And this is the right thing to do and I hope they continue to increase the  message that we're not going to put up with this anymore and we're going to  hold people accountable for these actions against our interests. </p><p>MCSHANE:  And what about the Iranian nuclear deal? </p><p>REED:  You know, I think with the new -- with John Bolton coming into the  administration, I think what you're going to see is what we all advocated  for when we strongly oppose that agreement. We need to hold Iran  accountable. You can't buy peace through appeasement. </p><p>We need to send the message we want peace through strength and that's what  you're going to get out of the new administration direction I think coming  down the pipeline. </p><p>MCSHANE:  You think they'll rip it up? </p><p>REED:  I think absolutely. I think at a minimum, it will hold them extreme  -- hold them accountable to each and every corner of that agreement, if not  destroy it and move forward and hold Iran accountable for its actions on  nuclearization. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Congressman, good to see you tonight. Thank you very  much for coming on. We appreciate it all the time. </p><p>REED:  Pleasure to be with you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Congressman Reed, upstate New York. </p><p>Now, President Trump with that announcement about John Bolton we just  mentioned briefly that the ambassador would come and take the place of H.R.  McMaster's national security adviser, that was last night big story, right?  Our next guest thinks it's a great choice. Former Air Force assistant vice  chief of staff, there he is, the retired lieutenant general Thomas  McInerney. He'll tell us why next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  I  think the consensus would be that the national security adviser among  whatever functions he or she might have has two critical roles. Number one,  making sure that the president has the full range of options presented to  him to make the decisions that only the president can make. </p><p>And the other side of the coin is when the president makes a decision, the  national security adviser is, among others, but certainly one of the  leading implementers of the decision, making sure that the bureaucracies  out there get the decision and implement it, and I've been in lots of  bureaucracies, and I've seen the way that bureaucracies that don't like  decisions sit on them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton is set to  take the place of H.R. McMaster as national security adviser to the  president, and he laid out there how he might handle the office.</p><p>We're joined by former air force assistant vice chief of staff, retired  lieutenant general Thomas McInerney with us tonight. Good to see you,  general. Thank you very much for coming on. </p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Thanks for having me,  Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  You know, we've had I think 23 hours or something like that to  digest this, I think maybe not the announcement, but the timing of this  caught just about everybody including maybe Ambassador Bolton off-guard  last night. But now that we've thought about it a little bit what do you  make of the move by the president? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  I think it's the most brilliant selection of a national  security adviser that I've seen in the last 50 years, and at least three of  the last 50 years became secretary of state. But John Bolton has more  experience than those three including Henry Kissinger. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  So I think it is a great tribute to President Trump that he had  the courage to select such a strong national security adviser who is so  articulate, can present the issues and as John pointed out, his job is to  give a balanced presentation, all the options to the president.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  And then ensure implementation. He knows how to do both base on  his experience, so I couldn't think of a finer person and a more capable  person, Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Kissinger, Powell and I guess one other, right, that went to be  secretary of state. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Rice.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Rice, of course, yes, that's right, Condoleezza Rice was  secretary of state and was in this position. I read a lot about it today  and even seen some of our colleagues in the media talking about it, and  you'll be surprised, general, not everybody agrees with your assessment. </p><p>Let's take a listen to a little bit of that then you can you react. Here's  some media reaction to the appointment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This may be the worst thing he's done. He said to them  no more stupid wars. Now he brings in the godfather of stupid wars, John  Bolton! </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that the risk of a war, of a shooting war with  Iran and North Korea are substantially greater than they were this morning.  I think it dramatically increases the risk that a lot of Americans and  Koreans, perhaps Japanese end up dead. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  John Bolton, he is the hammer and everything is a  nail. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just throwing all the toys at Iran, I'm mad! I'm  getting rid of everything. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, general. So, the idea obviously that we're more likely  to go to war now than we were before this appointment. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Yes, Connell, we're less likely to go to war with this  appointment than if others. It's like if we still had Curtis LeMay who  dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, if he became the chairman or joint  chiefs of staff, now you brought him back, the fact is that is a signal of  peace through strength. </p><p>John is a brilliant negotiator. He understands it. But he's not afraid to  make hard decisions. I think there's a much higher possibility of peace in  the resolution in both Korea and Iran being solid without war with John  Bolton there. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Interesting. Peace through strength. I want to ask you about  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis while I have you here, general. Because this  came up with the president's comments today about the spending bill, which  he did sign, we're talking earlier about why he signed it because he could  help the military. Here is Secretary Mattis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  In 1790 in George  Washington's first annual address to Congress, he stated to be prepared for  war is one of the most defective means of preserving the peace. </p><p>As the president noted today, we received the largest military budget in  history. Reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding. And  together, we are going to make our military stronger than ever. </p><p>We, in the military are humbled and grateful to the American people for  their sacrifices on behalf of this funding. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  We take a quick look at some of the defense-related stocks in the  trade today, remember it was a big time down day on Wall Street but the  likes of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman all faring quite well.  Even with the Dow down 400 plus points all of those.</p><p>All right. General, what, how did you view this, because part of it was, we  talk about earlier in the show, is that there are a number of people who  are conservatives who are quite upset that the president ended up signing  this bill and they don't like the runaway spending. But those who argue in  favor of it are using the military to make their arguments. What's your  take? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it's correct. I don't like that spending bill  either. I don't think they should have caved on all those domestic programs  that have been flush with money the last eight years. People don't realize  it, Connell, but Barack Obama left a hollow military. Now I was on active  duty when Jimmy Carter, just before Reagan came in and left a hollow  military, but the media has elected not to discuss it and point it out. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, the president talks about it a lot. Tell us how  specifically. What does that mean? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, it means like our in commission rates are at 50 percent.  They were 80 and 90 percent, this is for aircraft. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  There were 80 and 90 percent when I was in active duty and  commanding. We used to have 155 tactical fighter wings and the squadrons in  the air force. Today we've got 50. The fact is not only are we smaller but  they're less capable. The maintenance problem we had.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  We had two very serious accidents in the Pacific on destroyers  at sea, and all these things have come to, I think, a very critical tipping  point. And what worry--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right, and that's the point. It's critical enough that, you know,  you would make that argument, then we're not crazy about all the other  things maybe in a spending bill but we just need this that badly. That's  essentially the argument. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Exactly, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  And it takes a while to build that industrial buildup to get  those spare parts and those new airplanes and all those things. So there's  lag time in front of us and it must be done now and I would accept what  Secretary Mattis said that we need it now and that the president had to  make this decision. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, your argument did win the day, and the bill was signed.  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you very much. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Good seeing you, Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Markets, boy, the Dow shedding 1100 plus points just over a  couple of sessions. President Trump with the China tariffs. China with its  response, its own tariff threat that we'll talk about. In fact, our next  guest says it's smaller than expected which could be a sign of progress. </p><p>He's the former senior adviser to the former U.K. Prime Minister David  Cameron, that's Steve Hilton. He's coming up after a quick break. We'll be  right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  China is going to end up treating us fairly, for many years, they  had free reign, they don't have free reign anymore. We're very friendly  with China. We have great relationships with China, and look, it's time.  It's time. Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let  that happen. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, President Trump today saying he's making progress on  the China trade negotiation following his announcement that the  administration will impose tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese  imports. </p><p>Now China did have a response of its own here on this Friday with its own  tariff threat. The Chinese said they are planning to slap taxes on three  billion of U.S. goods. This affects only about 2 percent of China's imports  from the United States compared to roughly 10 percent of trade in the  opposite direction. </p><p>So let's talk about it, we're joined by the former senior adviser to David  Cameron, we know him as the host of the Next Revolution of the Fox News  Channel, Steve Hilton is with us. You know, a lot of people saw that, it  came out last night and Friday in China, and they said here we go, trade  war. But what do you say? </p><p>STEVE HILTON, HOST, FOX NEWS:  I think we need -- I think it's a good  start, basically. I think we need to be much, much tougher with China than  we've been for many years, and I think that you're seeing this  administration get to that tough position, not just with this measure but  also previously not long ago, they announced that CFIUS the committee on  foreign investment in United States would take a much tougher line on  foreign investments. </p><p>They blocked that really big tech deal where one of our most important tech  companies, Qualcomm, the key to the future of mobile technology is going to  be bought by a company that they thought was a security risk to China. I  think it's that transfer of technology to China who wants to use it for  their plans that they stated for world domination. That's what we've got to  watch out for. </p><p>And it looks to me like the tariffs are part of that. But the other thing  the administration are doing are actually more important. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now what about the Chinese response, though? I mention the three  billion that they've talked about, you say a drop in the bucket or the  start of something that could be much bigger and far more dangerous.  Certainly there are concerns whether they're justified or not on Wall  Street, the market since this protection is talked has started is not --  has not done well. The last couple of days down 1100 plus on the Dow, so. </p><p>HILTON:  This is a much bigger and more long-term question than even these  tariffs. It's about how are we going to handle a really aggressive nation  like China that has set out to beat America on every important front and  they said that they're going to do that using the latest technology. </p><p>I think a little fight over tariffs is really beside the point. (Inaudible)  this even if the trade between the U.S. and China went to zero, we'd still  have a massive problem, not economically but militarily, the way that  they're using technology to hack into our government and steal data and  influence all sorts of things around the world.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>HILTON:  Look at the way that they're spending so much on infrastructure to  try and control countries all around the world. That's the big issue.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I want to ask you we have another topic, so I just request a  short answer on this. But if -- because you have experience obviously  working on other governments. Some say there would have been a better way,  either, a, you go to the WTO or at least you build an alliance with other  countries and go after China altogether as opposed to kind of one on one. </p><p>HILTON:  I think that may be right in the small area of the trade  imbalance. But they're not going to listen to all those other countries or  the WTO on the big question of the strategic move they're making to become  the dominant nation in the world in the 21st century. Only America can  resist that. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK, we'll get back to this. But let me go to another topic,  former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger saying that the  Republicans in California are going down. Let's take a look. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA:  Our politics must be  the politics of solutions and substance. Today we are the Titanic after it  hits the iceberg, but before the last bit of the ship submerged. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Now you have an interview out there in California on your very  fine program that I mentioned earlier, the Next Revolution, Sunday on the  Fox News Channel. I don't know if he responds to this, but tell us a little  bit about it. </p><p>HILTON:  Well, actually, I was there for that event with former Governor  Schwarzenegger. And that's where I sat down with him for the interview.  Look, the thing is that he's not wrong about the political position of the  Republican Party here in California where I'm speaking to you from today.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>HILTON: California -- the Republicans in California haven't won statewide  office for years, over a decade. They're complete -- they're losing more  and more seats in the state legislature so the Democrats are in complete  control of California politically. </p><p>And you see the result in the terrible policies that are really harming  business and society throughout the state. So, you got to get back in there  somewhere that he was a winner in California, so I think it's important to  listen to his message. </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's always interesting to listen to him no matter what. So we  look forward to that. All right. We'll watch on Sunday, Steve. Thanks for  joining us tonight, we appreciate it. </p><p>HILTON:  Great to see you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  We have Steve Hilton Next Revolution 9 p.m. Sunday evenings on  Fox News Channel. So don't miss that with Mr. Schwarzenegger. </p><p>In a moment, we've been hot on tracking the California cities ditching the  state sanctuary policies and after Los Alamitos voted to opt out. Tonight,  another California administrator here to say her area too may vote to quit  California sanctuary policies. </p><p>The Orange County supervisor, just ahead, Michelle Steel here to speak out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  We do have some Friday evening breaking news here as the Attorney  General Jeff Sessions has just made it official announcement. A new  regulation that effectively bans bump stocks, as they're known. We thought  this might be coming and now this is the way the administration is going  about it, they asked for bump stocks to fall within the definition of  machine guns under federal law which will make them illegal. </p><p>Presidential tweet just before the announcement from Attorney General  Sessions, here it is. \"Obama administration legalized bump stocks. Bad  idea. As I promised, the president writes, today the Department of Justice  will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandate comment period. We  will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\" </p><p>So the president said he would take care of that on his own. Remember he  told members of Congress meeting at the White House that that's how he  would handle it. Apparently this is the method of doing so. More on that to  come. </p><p>In the meantime, President Trump signing that spending bill today after  threatening a veto. Once again, take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I say to Congress I will  never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again.  Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know, $1.3  trillion. It's the second largest ever. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  As he walks away, some members of the media did press the  president after the announcement. Here it is. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you, thank you. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, why the veto threat if you know you had  to sign the bill? </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, we'll figure it out in about 20 minutes after you look at it.  We're going to figure that out. You're going to figure that out. We looked  at it to veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about  doing the veto, but because of the incredible gains that we've been able to  make for the military, that overrode any of our -- any of our thinking. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, let's bring our panel in and see whether they have  figured it out by this evening. Patrice, Patrice Lee Onwuka is with us, the  Independent Women's Forum, Washington Times contributor Eric Schiffer is  here as well. Thanks to you both.</p><p>I know, Eric, I'll start with you on this. There are a number of  conservatives who are not happy that the bill was signed and not vetoed.  What are your thoughts this evening? </p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CONTRIBUTOR, WASHINGTON TIMES:  I think this was a giant  strategic mistake by the president, and I think he's going to regret it. To  not have vetoed this is inconsistent with everything that he's done so far. </p><p>I mean, he's been so consistent in keeping promises with the base on almost  everything but in this situation you're basically abandoning immigration  and that was a core issue, the wall, immigration.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  So--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  He said he had to for the military. He said he had to. </p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I'm a proponent of the military. There's no  question. But that's the window dressing. I think that the, and I'm glad  they got it but not to the extent that it just throws away immigration.  That's the core of his presidency was immigration, and that's what the base  was so excited about, and he's just ignored it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I started Patrice, with Eric on purpose. I know the base, the  Trump base, and we've heard from, you know, whether it's Twitter or  whatever it is throughout the day today and many other shows that preceded  ours that people in the president's base are not happy with his decision.  What do you make of that? </p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Well, I  mean, I think people recognize that, you know, they elected Republicans  from top to bottom, from the White House all the way to Congress, expecting  that there would be fiscal responsibility. </p><p>Looking at the national debt, looking at the driver of debt, and expecting  that, you know, once in power, Republicans would hold their -- would hold  their own and continue to do what they're supposed to do, but the political  realities here were you know that you're in an imperfect situation, where  you needed some sort of Democratic support and they felt that, you know,  this is the only way to avert a government shutdown. With the second or  third within this year alone, so, you know, this is what they had to do. </p><p>I do think though, that when we look at our big drivers of national debt--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>ONWUKA:  -- you know, it's really not even just a domestic spending that  increased, it's really those entitlement, those mandatory spending and that  unfortunately no one is talking about. </p><p>MCSHANE:  No one is talking about. I was going to say, yes, we haven't  even, you know, started to talk about that one yet. One of the olive  branches I guess that the president tried to throw out today and we'll talk  in a moment about whether there is any political reality in terms of this  coming to fruition, but he talked about a line-item veto, right, for all of  government spending bills. Let's take a listen once again to the president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm  calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending  bills, and the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get  down to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, here's the problem with that, Eric, among other  things. And that would require a constitutional amendment, two-thirds vote  in both Houses of Congress. I don't think I need to tell you that that's  not very likely, is it? </p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, conservatives don't need a line-item veto, they need a  president that keeps his word. Period.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  And that's what anger so many people that immigration has just  been thrown out the door, and that he has ignored the people that brought  him to this level of power, he's just completely ignored them. It's so  strange because up to this point he's been consistent, it's as if he's just  not, he's like he's lost his focus. He lost what he ran on and he's  deserted so many millions of people who really have counted on him. </p><p>MCSHANE:  The president knew that he would take a hit from his base on this  just by the tone he was using today. Because that was a somber president  for a bill signing ceremony as it was billed.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Patrice, we're going to come back to you and get much more from  you. Eric, as well, a little bit later in the program. I do have to take a  break now. As we've been talking, Liz has been hot on this topic, tracking  the California cities ditching the state sanctuary policies, and you know,  Los Alamitos I mentioned this earlier, opted out.</p><p>Tonight another California administrator is here to say her area too may  quit the sanctuary policy coming from the state. It's Michelle Steel, the  Orange County supervisor and she will speak out on that topic next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  I'm really excited. I've  been completely thrilled with the outpouring of all the city council  members and mayors across the state that have been communicating, saying  they were waiting for somebody to come out and do this.</p><p>DAVE HARRINGTON, MAYOR OF ALISO VIEJO, CALIFORNIA:  I think that's the shot  heard around the state of California. So it absolutely inspired me. And I  reached out to them right away not only to congratulate them but also, you  know, tap into what their experience was and how they managed to get it  done. </p><p>This makes us less safe. It makes my citizens less safe. I'm responsible  for the safety of 50,000 people, so I view this as primary responsibility.  You know, government has pretty much two jobs, roads and bridges, public  safety. And this erodes that second part which is public safety. So I'm  going to fight against it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Well, this is certainly been a very big topic on this  very program. And now more California towns and cities are looking to  follow the lead of Los Alamitos and rejecting the state's sanctuary law.  Buena Park, Fresno, Thousand Oaks, Aliso Viejo and all of Orange County may  now opt out of the sanctuary policy.</p><p>We're joined by the Orange County supervisor Michelle Steel. Thank you for  joining us this evening. We appreciate it, or this afternoon out in  California. </p><p>How does all this affecting your city. Tell us about it. </p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, SUPERVISOR, ORANGE COUNTY:  Well, you know what, actually  our city of Los Alamitos, and they started it, I'm just like so proud of  them, you know, what they did. So now all Orange County cities are coming  out and they want to come out, opt out against this California bad law, and  I thought we had to do something about it, so I'm actually asking my  colleagues on this coming Tuesday to add the lawsuit at the same time the  resolution goes out. So I want people to hear it.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  And make everything--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  What's the response been ahead of that from your colleagues? </p><p>STEEL:  Actually everybody is supporting it.</p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>STEEL:  And I got couple of bad e-mails. Other than that, my colleagues are  all supportive. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Couple of bad e-mails. Let me go to the California governor for a  moment. We'll listen together to Jerry Brown. He's dismissed this policy,  the sanctuary policy fight. He says the administration's lawsuit that we  had from the Department of Justice is nothing but a political stunt. Here's  the governor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JERRY BROWN, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA:  This is really unprecedented for  the chief law enforcement of the United States to come out to California  and act more like Fox News than a law enforcement officer. </p><p>This is a political stunt. It's more like Fox News and what's going on in  Washington, and it's not about the truth. It's not about protecting our  state. It's about dividing America. </p><p>What Jeff Sessions said is simply not true, and I call upon him to  apologize to the people of California, to bringing the mendacity of  Washington to California and trying to insert discord and division, and I  might add, dysfunctionality in a state that's really working. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, Michelle, what do you say to the governor? </p><p>STEEL:  You know, government duty, the first thing comes public safety, and  then you know what, he's not thinking about the safety. We are not talking  about here that President Trump and ICE are going after first generation  immigrants or any immigrant family. They are going after the criminal  aliens.</p><p>And you know, I get a lot of support especially from Congressman Dana  Rohrabacher in my district that he supported me that, you know, me too. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  So we are talking about this. Public safety comes down to it. This  has nothing to do with a stunt. This has nothing to do with racism. This  has nothing to do with, you know, what he thinks it's a show. So Jeff  Sessions did the right thing because it's unconstitutional, and actually  this law ties our sheriffs and that, you know, local police officers' hands  because they have to follow different laws from the federal government and  state government. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  So it's not really safe on the streets. So we have to do something  about it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, that's the issue and speaking of relationship between state  and local officials in the federal government. The Oakland mayor, as you  know, has really become the face of all this as well. Her name is Libby  Shaaf, and she was the person who had warned the illegal immigrants of  impending raids from immigration officials.</p><p>Well, anyway, she has hit back at the president. I want to bring up a quote  from the mayor of Oakland. \"It is continued destruction, it's a continued  perpetration of a racist lie that immigrants were not valued members of our  society. We in Oakland know better. We in Oakland have a community that  welcomes and honors all people no matter where they come from no matter  where how they got here.\"</p><p>Your response to the mayor of Oakland's latest comments. </p><p>STEEL:  Isn't it amazing? Because you can hear it. I'm a first generation  immigrant. At the same time, in Orange County, we have 3.2 million people  living in Orange County, and we are the third largest county in the state. </p><p>At the same time, we have a lot of large immigrant communities in our  county. At the same time we embrace everybody's diverse cultures. So this  has nothing to do with the -- you know, racism. This has things to do that  we are going against that law.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  And especially you cannot really go against federal law that he  would try to save that, you know, protect its own citizens. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK. Michelle Steel, keep us up to date, OK. Next Tuesday she says  is the big day. Thanks for coming on tonight. </p><p>STEEL:  We'll do that. Thank you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK. This Facebook story, there's more fallout over the leaks and  billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk got involved today. He really hit Mark  Zuckerberg with the delete Facebook movement. Taking shape as it is he  deleted his Facebook page, took the SpaceX page down, took the Tesla page  down as well. </p><p>So, what does it all mean for Facebook? Our panel is back after a quick  break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Elon Musk, the CEO of a couple of company Tesla and SpaceX, well,  he erased his own page from the world's most popular social media platform  responding to calls for support of the hash tag delete Facebook movement. </p><p>He took the company's pages down as well after 50 million users had their  personal info harvested by the political analytics firm Cambridge  Analytica. </p><p>The Facebook stock price it's been down heading, it was down again today.  Facebook down just over 3 percent, worst week since August of 2012. it's  wiped out the gains for the year this week. </p><p>Let's bring our panel back. Patrice Lee Onwuka, Eric Schiffer. Patrice, let  me start with you on this topic. </p><p>ONWUKA:  Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Boy, it took Facebook a long time I think especially in our world  here, you take five days to respond to something like this, if you're  Zuckerberg or even Sheryl Sandberg. What do you make of the way they've  handled it and what the fallout will be from here? </p><p>ONWUKA:  I think they've handled it in a way that shows that they have no  clue what they want to do or can do in the situation. You know, hearing  from Zuckerberg, you know, at this point it's not a question whether there  should be regulations--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>ONWUKA:  -- but that, hey, they welcome it is disconcerting. </p><p>I mean, it's concerning because, you know, Facebook will probably weather  this but they're going to have a heavy hand at any sort of regulation that  comes out and what happens with regulation -- with regulating technology is  that it limits -- probably will limit competition so and even use the  social media platform--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you're saying, I get that, but you're saying, Patrice, that  Facebook will have too much influence in that? Is that your point? </p><p>ONWUKA:  It's very possible that they'll be able to guide whatever  regulations come out of this, and any new competition, you know, will start  from a position of disadvantage, frankly, and then we don't know how  innovation is going to develop as a result of any new regulations. </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's funny, Eric, I don't think Facebook has a friend in the  world now politically, if you think about it, I mean, Republicans are not,  you know, the biggest fans of everybody up in Silicon Valley to begin with,  and you're not going to get a Democrat defending kind of the behavior here.  So, nowhere to turn if you are Zuckerberg or Sandberg, is there? </p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, I think we have to remember that there still are tens of  millions of users of Facebook, there's even more of Instagram.</p><p>MCSHANE:  More, yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  So they're not going to get eviscerated from the planet today.  They're going to be around. They will make it through this. But it's a  wake-up call. They got slapped in the face for disrespecting so many  Americans and people around the world with their data. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  I still don't think they get it. I still think that there's an  arrogance that somehow this was OK. I mean, their initial response was one  of the worst responses in the history of modern day crisis management. I  mean, it was terrible. But they have a war chest. Let's not forget. I mean,  they have millions, tens of billions of dollars of potential to be able to  spend. That's a-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  And by the way, as a final point -- that's funny the hacker way  we're looking at now -- the final point, Patrice, this is not just a  Facebook issue, this whole data thing. </p><p>ONWUKA:  No, it's a broader issue for the technology industry to think  about. But as users, I mean, we have given up a tremendous amount of  information about ourselves from our messages to our phone calls to our  photos and the question is how do we retain or regain some control over  that.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>ONWUKA:  And I think that's a conversation for society for public policy  and for technology to be having. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I think a lot of people wanted their Facebook settings started  deleting the access to some of the apps this week. Eric and Patrice, good  to see both of you. Have a good weekend.</p><p>ONWUKA:  You, too.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  It's good to see you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Quick break, we'll be right back after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Business alert for you. Boy, what a week. We said that  every week but we have made it to Friday night which is a big night here on  the Fox Business Network. Maria has her Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street  program this evening. That's 8 p.m. Eastern. You don't want to miss that.  The great Mario Gabelli is on tonight. So miss super Mario and Maria. </p><p>We thank you for watching. I'm Connell McShane. It's time for Charles  Payne. He's here now with Making Money.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Therefore, as a matter of national security, I've signed this  omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this  bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill,  but we were in the sense forced if we want to build our military. We were  forced to have. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are some things we should have in the bill, but I say to Congress, I  will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again.  Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what --  $1.3 trillion. It's the second largest ever. We need to take care of our  military. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  All this on a day when the markets went down.  The Dow, S&amp;P, NASDAQ suffering their worst week in more than two years. The  Dow shedding more than 1100 points in two sessions. Trade jitters have been  rocking Wall Street. </p><p>Then, after that veto tease you saw, President Trump did indeed sign the  $1.3 trillion, 2200-page spending bill today. He says he's not happy about  it taking aim at the Democrats saying never again and calling them out for  wasteful spending on personal projects and for not extending legal  protections for the DREAMers. </p><p>Tonight we'll break it all down. Also tonight, the White House cracking  down on Iran. Nine Iranian nationals and one Iranian entity facing  sanctions today from the Treasury Department. </p><p>Tonight, we have a guest who says it's more proof the Iran deal is just a  bad deal. Also more Facebook data leak fallout. The billionaire Tesla  founder Elon Musk hitting Mark Zuckerberg hard, jumping on the delete  Facebook movement, deleting his own page and the SpaceX and Tesla pages as  well. </p><p>Tonight, a guest who recommends that do you the same. </p><p>It is an all-star guest line up. The Republican Congressman Tom Reed here  on that spending bill. Retired lieutenant general Thomas McInerney says  it's about time the military got some salary hikes. Former British Prime  Minister David Cameron adviser, Steve Hilton on the prospect of a trade war  with China. </p><p>More California cities looking to reject the state's sanctuary status.  Orange County supervisor Michelle Steel on her new push. It's all here and  it's all tonight. </p><p>Politics and money, we've got you covered. Good to be with you on a Friday.  I'm Connell McShane. Risk &amp; Reward starts right now. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have tremendous opposition from the Democrats. So if we take  something for the military, they want something for, in many cases, things  that are really a wasted sum of money. It's not right, because we need to  take care of our military, and because the Democrats, who don't believe in  that, added things that they wanted in order to get their votes. </p><p>DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats. We  wanted to include DACA. We wanted to have them in this bill. Eight hundred  thousand people, and actually it could even be more, and we wanted to  include DACA in this bill. The Democrats would not do it. </p><p>To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on  Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills, and  the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get down to  work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCSHANE:  President Trump calling out the Democrats as we wrap up what was  the worst week on Wall Street in more than two years. The Dow shedding more  than 1100 points here over the course of two days. And we're going to talk  a lot about that tonight. </p><p>First, though, President Trump signing that $1.3 trillion spending bill  after threatening to veto because his border wall wasn't fully funded and  there was no fix, he said for DACA. President signing what was a monster  piece of legislation, reluctantly saying in order to secure a necessary  increase in military spending he had to give money to Democratic projects  that he called a, quote, \"wasted sum of money.\" </p><p>Let's talk more though, about these markets. Boy, it was a brutal week and  just a terrible two days. We have fears of a trade war on Wall Street,  maybe some questions about the Fed as well. </p><p>We bring in Nicole Petallides who's live this evening on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange, and more than anything, Nicole, just another, just  another terrible finish to the day in that final hour, right? </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, you make a great point,  Connell. Because we saw much of the same yesterday. We started off to the  downside and drifted lower only to finish down over 700 points. And there  was hope for somewhat of a bounce back today, you can see in our intraday  chart here that we're showing, that you did see some green in the morning,  so there was some hope for those tech and financial groups that really have  gotten hit hard lately but they just couldn't keep them out there, so many  elements that are hitting these markets. </p><p>The Dow finishes down 424 points, today at 1.7 percentage. It's down about  1500 points for the week. Worst week for stocks since January of 2016. The  Dow took out the February 9th, the February lows, the S&amp;P 500 did not, but  it got close. </p><p>Taking a look at some of the big losers for the week. We saw 3M, G.E.,  Goldman Sachs down between 8 and 10 percent, and then we saw the defense  stocks. That was one group that did well on the heel of the spending bill  and more military support. </p><p>Facebook was a big issue, it hit tech stocks, and that was down about 13  percent for the week and drop box was the winner. That was a new IPO in the  technology sector and was well received. It was up about 35 percent. Big  picture, there are still worries and we saw some rotation. Defense stocks  and energy did all right. Back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes. It was rough. Get out of there, Nicole. Thanks a lot. We  appreciate. Have a good weekend. </p><p>Let's get to this massive spending bill now. The New York Republican  Congressman, Tom Reed (AUDIO GAP) who voted against it. He joins us now.  Quite a day, congressman. We're looking at the president who was thinking  he said about a veto, but he signed it, your thoughts? </p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  Well, you know, obviously, I voted against  it, and I shared the concern that was expressed by the president about the  fact that it wasn't in a position to be read and digested. </p><p>But on top of that, the massive amount of spending, I totally appreciate  the defense side of the equation.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>REED:  But the amount of spending overall is just mind-boggling to me. And  we have to get this national debt and the debt crisis under control. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I'm going to get to that defense in a moment. Are you  disappointed though, in the president's decision? </p><p>REED:  Well, you know, obviously I understand where he's at. He was in a  very difficult situation. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>REED:  Shutting down the government versus signing that bill. It's  incumbent upon us on Congress to lead on the issue. I appreciate the  president sending the message, we need to do better in Congress and that's  why I'm hopeful the next go around. </p><p>MCSHANE:  He used the argument, to your point, that he had, basically no  choice if he wanted the money for the military than to sign this. Take a  listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  While we're very disappointed in the 1.3 trillion, nobody more  disappointed than me because the number is so large, it will start coming  down. We had no choice but to fund our military because we have to have, by  far, the strongest military in the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  I was down in Washington all week and I heard Paul Ryan make that  same exact argument a number of times. So it's the idea, congressman, that  I guess you're never going to get a chance like this again if you don't  sign this. Is there something to that, that you would never have a chance  to have this type of an increase for military spending? </p><p>REED:  Well, I think we just we definitely were on a position on the  defense side. We needed to make those investments because our men and women  were being put in harm's way where we were. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>REED:  But at the end of the day, it shows exactly what was negotiated  here. They went more on the defense side in order to get the nondefense  number where they need because they needed those 10 Democrats plus or minus  to come over to support the bill. That's why going to 51 votes on the  Senate, at least on the appropriation the spending bills, to me is a reform  the Senate should strongly consider at least going down that path. Maybe  not blowing it up for anything, but at least for the appropriation spending  bills. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. Boy, I wonder if they'll do that. It doesn't seem like  this any kind of movement, right, to go in that direction? </p><p>REED:  No, it doesn't. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>REED:  It's been very clear us to that they don't want to change that  threshold. They want the Senate wants to continue that archaic rule but  that's up to the Senate to decide. All I can do is vote my conscience,  which is a no.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>REED:  This debt crisis is upon us. We need to get the spending under  control, and if we don't, our children and grandchildren are going to be  saddled with such debt and this county is threatened by this debt crisis  today is going off as we speak.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCSHANE:  One quick political question, Congressman on this, I know you say  you voted your conscience and voted no. But how worried are you about the  midterms at this point and the blowback from a bill like this, the effect  it could have on Republicans? </p><p>REED:  You know I think if we just continue as individual members to go out  and work hard and put our voice and our positions out there, we're going to  be fine on the Republican side. We have tax reform, we're seeing the  benefits in the economy. </p><p>Jobless numbers, the president hasn't been given credit for, in my humble  opinion, you know, low unemployment numbers, lowest levels for Hispanic and  African-American unemployment, we got to send that message and sell that  message to the American people and I think they'll be with us at the end of  the day. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I want to get your thoughts on one of the story before we let you  go, just on Iran, nine Iranian nationals today, one Iranian entity facing  sanctions also the prospect of federal charges. Let's take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROD ROSENSTEIN, UNITED STATES DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Federal grand jury  in the southern District of New York indicted nine Iranians for conspiring  to hack into computers and to defraud American and foreign universities,  businesses and government agencies. This indictment alleges that the  defendants worked on behalf of the Iranian government, specifically the  Islamic revolutionary guard corps. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  The charges you heard that these Iranians essentially, you know,  like they hacked into hundreds of universities and other organizations and  stole information on behalf of the government of Iran, so it comes at a  time, we're getting a new national security adviser, Iran is in the news  anyway, in particular the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Your thoughts. </p><p>REED:  Absolutely. I support the actions taken by the Justice Department as  well as treasury in regards to going after Iran for these actions of  hacking into our systems and stealing our information and putting real  American interests at risk. </p><p>And this is the right thing to do and I hope they continue to increase the  message that we're not going to put up with this anymore and we're going to  hold people accountable for these actions against our interests. </p><p>MCSHANE:  And what about the Iranian nuclear deal? </p><p>REED:  You know, I think with the new -- with John Bolton coming into the  administration, I think what you're going to see is what we all advocated  for when we strongly oppose that agreement. We need to hold Iran  accountable. You can't buy peace through appeasement. </p><p>We need to send the message we want peace through strength and that's what  you're going to get out of the new administration direction I think coming  down the pipeline. </p><p>MCSHANE:  You think they'll rip it up? </p><p>REED:  I think absolutely. I think at a minimum, it will hold them extreme  -- hold them accountable to each and every corner of that agreement, if not  destroy it and move forward and hold Iran accountable for its actions on  nuclearization. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Congressman, good to see you tonight. Thank you very  much for coming on. We appreciate it all the time. </p><p>REED:  Pleasure to be with you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Congressman Reed, upstate New York. </p><p>Now, President Trump with that announcement about John Bolton we just  mentioned briefly that the ambassador would come and take the place of H.R.  McMaster's national security adviser, that was last night big story, right?  Our next guest thinks it's a great choice. Former Air Force assistant vice  chief of staff, there he is, the retired lieutenant general Thomas  McInerney. He'll tell us why next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  I  think the consensus would be that the national security adviser among  whatever functions he or she might have has two critical roles. Number one,  making sure that the president has the full range of options presented to  him to make the decisions that only the president can make. </p><p>And the other side of the coin is when the president makes a decision, the  national security adviser is, among others, but certainly one of the  leading implementers of the decision, making sure that the bureaucracies  out there get the decision and implement it, and I've been in lots of  bureaucracies, and I've seen the way that bureaucracies that don't like  decisions sit on them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton is set to  take the place of H.R. McMaster as national security adviser to the  president, and he laid out there how he might handle the office.</p><p>We're joined by former air force assistant vice chief of staff, retired  lieutenant general Thomas McInerney with us tonight. Good to see you,  general. Thank you very much for coming on. </p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Thanks for having me,  Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  You know, we've had I think 23 hours or something like that to  digest this, I think maybe not the announcement, but the timing of this  caught just about everybody including maybe Ambassador Bolton off-guard  last night. But now that we've thought about it a little bit what do you  make of the move by the president? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  I think it's the most brilliant selection of a national  security adviser that I've seen in the last 50 years, and at least three of  the last 50 years became secretary of state. But John Bolton has more  experience than those three including Henry Kissinger. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  So I think it is a great tribute to President Trump that he had  the courage to select such a strong national security adviser who is so  articulate, can present the issues and as John pointed out, his job is to  give a balanced presentation, all the options to the president.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  And then ensure implementation. He knows how to do both base on  his experience, so I couldn't think of a finer person and a more capable  person, Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Kissinger, Powell and I guess one other, right, that went to be  secretary of state. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Rice.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Rice, of course, yes, that's right, Condoleezza Rice was  secretary of state and was in this position. I read a lot about it today  and even seen some of our colleagues in the media talking about it, and  you'll be surprised, general, not everybody agrees with your assessment. </p><p>Let's take a listen to a little bit of that then you can you react. Here's  some media reaction to the appointment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This may be the worst thing he's done. He said to them  no more stupid wars. Now he brings in the godfather of stupid wars, John  Bolton! </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that the risk of a war, of a shooting war with  Iran and North Korea are substantially greater than they were this morning.  I think it dramatically increases the risk that a lot of Americans and  Koreans, perhaps Japanese end up dead. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  John Bolton, he is the hammer and everything is a  nail. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just throwing all the toys at Iran, I'm mad! I'm  getting rid of everything. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, general. So, the idea obviously that we're more likely  to go to war now than we were before this appointment. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Yes, Connell, we're less likely to go to war with this  appointment than if others. It's like if we still had Curtis LeMay who  dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, if he became the chairman or joint  chiefs of staff, now you brought him back, the fact is that is a signal of  peace through strength. </p><p>John is a brilliant negotiator. He understands it. But he's not afraid to  make hard decisions. I think there's a much higher possibility of peace in  the resolution in both Korea and Iran being solid without war with John  Bolton there. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Interesting. Peace through strength. I want to ask you about  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis while I have you here, general. Because this  came up with the president's comments today about the spending bill, which  he did sign, we're talking earlier about why he signed it because he could  help the military. Here is Secretary Mattis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  In 1790 in George  Washington's first annual address to Congress, he stated to be prepared for  war is one of the most defective means of preserving the peace. </p><p>As the president noted today, we received the largest military budget in  history. Reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding. And  together, we are going to make our military stronger than ever. </p><p>We, in the military are humbled and grateful to the American people for  their sacrifices on behalf of this funding. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  We take a quick look at some of the defense-related stocks in the  trade today, remember it was a big time down day on Wall Street but the  likes of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman all faring quite well.  Even with the Dow down 400 plus points all of those.</p><p>All right. General, what, how did you view this, because part of it was, we  talk about earlier in the show, is that there are a number of people who  are conservatives who are quite upset that the president ended up signing  this bill and they don't like the runaway spending. But those who argue in  favor of it are using the military to make their arguments. What's your  take? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it's correct. I don't like that spending bill  either. I don't think they should have caved on all those domestic programs  that have been flush with money the last eight years. People don't realize  it, Connell, but Barack Obama left a hollow military. Now I was on active  duty when Jimmy Carter, just before Reagan came in and left a hollow  military, but the media has elected not to discuss it and point it out. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, the president talks about it a lot. Tell us how  specifically. What does that mean? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, it means like our in commission rates are at 50 percent.  They were 80 and 90 percent, this is for aircraft. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  There were 80 and 90 percent when I was in active duty and  commanding. We used to have 155 tactical fighter wings and the squadrons in  the air force. Today we've got 50. The fact is not only are we smaller but  they're less capable. The maintenance problem we had.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  We had two very serious accidents in the Pacific on destroyers  at sea, and all these things have come to, I think, a very critical tipping  point. And what worry--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right, and that's the point. It's critical enough that, you know,  you would make that argument, then we're not crazy about all the other  things maybe in a spending bill but we just need this that badly. That's  essentially the argument. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Exactly, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCINERNEY:  And it takes a while to build that industrial buildup to get  those spare parts and those new airplanes and all those things. So there's  lag time in front of us and it must be done now and I would accept what  Secretary Mattis said that we need it now and that the president had to  make this decision. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, your argument did win the day, and the bill was signed.  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you very much. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Good seeing you, Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Markets, boy, the Dow shedding 1100 plus points just over a  couple of sessions. President Trump with the China tariffs. China with its  response, its own tariff threat that we'll talk about. In fact, our next  guest says it's smaller than expected which could be a sign of progress. </p><p>He's the former senior adviser to the former U.K. Prime Minister David  Cameron, that's Steve Hilton. He's coming up after a quick break. We'll be  right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  China is going to end up treating us fairly, for many years, they  had free reign, they don't have free reign anymore. We're very friendly  with China. We have great relationships with China, and look, it's time.  It's time. Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let  that happen. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, President Trump today saying he's making progress on  the China trade negotiation following his announcement that the  administration will impose tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese  imports. </p><p>Now China did have a response of its own here on this Friday with its own  tariff threat. The Chinese said they are planning to slap taxes on three  billion of U.S. goods. This affects only about 2 percent of China's imports  from the United States compared to roughly 10 percent of trade in the  opposite direction. </p><p>So let's talk about it, we're joined by the former senior adviser to David  Cameron, we know him as the host of the Next Revolution of the Fox News  Channel, Steve Hilton is with us. You know, a lot of people saw that, it  came out last night and Friday in China, and they said here we go, trade  war. But what do you say? </p><p>STEVE HILTON, HOST, FOX NEWS:  I think we need -- I think it's a good  start, basically. I think we need to be much, much tougher with China than  we've been for many years, and I think that you're seeing this  administration get to that tough position, not just with this measure but  also previously not long ago, they announced that CFIUS the committee on  foreign investment in United States would take a much tougher line on  foreign investments. </p><p>They blocked that really big tech deal where one of our most important tech  companies, Qualcomm, the key to the future of mobile technology is going to  be bought by a company that they thought was a security risk to China. I  think it's that transfer of technology to China who wants to use it for  their plans that they stated for world domination. That's what we've got to  watch out for. </p><p>And it looks to me like the tariffs are part of that. But the other thing  the administration are doing are actually more important. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now what about the Chinese response, though? I mention the three  billion that they've talked about, you say a drop in the bucket or the  start of something that could be much bigger and far more dangerous.  Certainly there are concerns whether they're justified or not on Wall  Street, the market since this protection is talked has started is not --  has not done well. The last couple of days down 1100 plus on the Dow, so. </p><p>HILTON:  This is a much bigger and more long-term question than even these  tariffs. It's about how are we going to handle a really aggressive nation  like China that has set out to beat America on every important front and  they said that they're going to do that using the latest technology. </p><p>I think a little fight over tariffs is really beside the point. (Inaudible)  this even if the trade between the U.S. and China went to zero, we'd still  have a massive problem, not economically but militarily, the way that  they're using technology to hack into our government and steal data and  influence all sorts of things around the world.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>HILTON:  Look at the way that they're spending so much on infrastructure to  try and control countries all around the world. That's the big issue.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I want to ask you we have another topic, so I just request a  short answer on this. But if -- because you have experience obviously  working on other governments. Some say there would have been a better way,  either, a, you go to the WTO or at least you build an alliance with other  countries and go after China altogether as opposed to kind of one on one. </p><p>HILTON:  I think that may be right in the small area of the trade  imbalance. But they're not going to listen to all those other countries or  the WTO on the big question of the strategic move they're making to become  the dominant nation in the world in the 21st century. Only America can  resist that. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK, we'll get back to this. But let me go to another topic,  former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger saying that the  Republicans in California are going down. Let's take a look. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA:  Our politics must be  the politics of solutions and substance. Today we are the Titanic after it  hits the iceberg, but before the last bit of the ship submerged. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Now you have an interview out there in California on your very  fine program that I mentioned earlier, the Next Revolution, Sunday on the  Fox News Channel. I don't know if he responds to this, but tell us a little  bit about it. </p><p>HILTON:  Well, actually, I was there for that event with former Governor  Schwarzenegger. And that's where I sat down with him for the interview.  Look, the thing is that he's not wrong about the political position of the  Republican Party here in California where I'm speaking to you from today.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>HILTON: California -- the Republicans in California haven't won statewide  office for years, over a decade. They're complete -- they're losing more  and more seats in the state legislature so the Democrats are in complete  control of California politically. </p><p>And you see the result in the terrible policies that are really harming  business and society throughout the state. So, you got to get back in there  somewhere that he was a winner in California, so I think it's important to  listen to his message. </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's always interesting to listen to him no matter what. So we  look forward to that. All right. We'll watch on Sunday, Steve. Thanks for  joining us tonight, we appreciate it. </p><p>HILTON:  Great to see you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  We have Steve Hilton Next Revolution 9 p.m. Sunday evenings on  Fox News Channel. So don't miss that with Mr. Schwarzenegger. </p><p>In a moment, we've been hot on tracking the California cities ditching the  state sanctuary policies and after Los Alamitos voted to opt out. Tonight,  another California administrator here to say her area too may vote to quit  California sanctuary policies. </p><p>The Orange County supervisor, just ahead, Michelle Steel here to speak out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  We do have some Friday evening breaking news here as the Attorney  General Jeff Sessions has just made it official announcement. A new  regulation that effectively bans bump stocks, as they're known. We thought  this might be coming and now this is the way the administration is going  about it, they asked for bump stocks to fall within the definition of  machine guns under federal law which will make them illegal. </p><p>Presidential tweet just before the announcement from Attorney General  Sessions, here it is. \"Obama administration legalized bump stocks. Bad  idea. As I promised, the president writes, today the Department of Justice  will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandate comment period. We  will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\" </p><p>So the president said he would take care of that on his own. Remember he  told members of Congress meeting at the White House that that's how he  would handle it. Apparently this is the method of doing so. More on that to  come. </p><p>In the meantime, President Trump signing that spending bill today after  threatening a veto. Once again, take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I say to Congress I will  never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again.  Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know, $1.3  trillion. It's the second largest ever. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  As he walks away, some members of the media did press the  president after the announcement. Here it is. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you, thank you. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, why the veto threat if you know you had  to sign the bill? </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, we'll figure it out in about 20 minutes after you look at it.  We're going to figure that out. You're going to figure that out. We looked  at it to veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about  doing the veto, but because of the incredible gains that we've been able to  make for the military, that overrode any of our -- any of our thinking. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, let's bring our panel in and see whether they have  figured it out by this evening. Patrice, Patrice Lee Onwuka is with us, the  Independent Women's Forum, Washington Times contributor Eric Schiffer is  here as well. Thanks to you both.</p><p>I know, Eric, I'll start with you on this. There are a number of  conservatives who are not happy that the bill was signed and not vetoed.  What are your thoughts this evening? </p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CONTRIBUTOR, WASHINGTON TIMES:  I think this was a giant  strategic mistake by the president, and I think he's going to regret it. To  not have vetoed this is inconsistent with everything that he's done so far. </p><p>I mean, he's been so consistent in keeping promises with the base on almost  everything but in this situation you're basically abandoning immigration  and that was a core issue, the wall, immigration.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  So--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  He said he had to for the military. He said he had to. </p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I'm a proponent of the military. There's no  question. But that's the window dressing. I think that the, and I'm glad  they got it but not to the extent that it just throws away immigration.  That's the core of his presidency was immigration, and that's what the base  was so excited about, and he's just ignored it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I started Patrice, with Eric on purpose. I know the base, the  Trump base, and we've heard from, you know, whether it's Twitter or  whatever it is throughout the day today and many other shows that preceded  ours that people in the president's base are not happy with his decision.  What do you make of that? </p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  Well, I  mean, I think people recognize that, you know, they elected Republicans  from top to bottom, from the White House all the way to Congress, expecting  that there would be fiscal responsibility. </p><p>Looking at the national debt, looking at the driver of debt, and expecting  that, you know, once in power, Republicans would hold their -- would hold  their own and continue to do what they're supposed to do, but the political  realities here were you know that you're in an imperfect situation, where  you needed some sort of Democratic support and they felt that, you know,  this is the only way to avert a government shutdown. With the second or  third within this year alone, so, you know, this is what they had to do. </p><p>I do think though, that when we look at our big drivers of national debt--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>ONWUKA:  -- you know, it's really not even just a domestic spending that  increased, it's really those entitlement, those mandatory spending and that  unfortunately no one is talking about. </p><p>MCSHANE:  No one is talking about. I was going to say, yes, we haven't  even, you know, started to talk about that one yet. One of the olive  branches I guess that the president tried to throw out today and we'll talk  in a moment about whether there is any political reality in terms of this  coming to fruition, but he talked about a line-item veto, right, for all of  government spending bills. Let's take a listen once again to the president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm  calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending  bills, and the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get  down to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, here's the problem with that, Eric, among other  things. And that would require a constitutional amendment, two-thirds vote  in both Houses of Congress. I don't think I need to tell you that that's  not very likely, is it? </p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, conservatives don't need a line-item veto, they need a  president that keeps his word. Period.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  And that's what anger so many people that immigration has just  been thrown out the door, and that he has ignored the people that brought  him to this level of power, he's just completely ignored them. It's so  strange because up to this point he's been consistent, it's as if he's just  not, he's like he's lost his focus. He lost what he ran on and he's  deserted so many millions of people who really have counted on him. </p><p>MCSHANE:  The president knew that he would take a hit from his base on this  just by the tone he was using today. Because that was a somber president  for a bill signing ceremony as it was billed.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Patrice, we're going to come back to you and get much more from  you. Eric, as well, a little bit later in the program. I do have to take a  break now. As we've been talking, Liz has been hot on this topic, tracking  the California cities ditching the state sanctuary policies, and you know,  Los Alamitos I mentioned this earlier, opted out.</p><p>Tonight another California administrator is here to say her area too may  quit the sanctuary policy coming from the state. It's Michelle Steel, the  Orange County supervisor and she will speak out on that topic next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA:  I'm really excited. I've  been completely thrilled with the outpouring of all the city council  members and mayors across the state that have been communicating, saying  they were waiting for somebody to come out and do this.</p><p>DAVE HARRINGTON, MAYOR OF ALISO VIEJO, CALIFORNIA:  I think that's the shot  heard around the state of California. So it absolutely inspired me. And I  reached out to them right away not only to congratulate them but also, you  know, tap into what their experience was and how they managed to get it  done. </p><p>This makes us less safe. It makes my citizens less safe. I'm responsible  for the safety of 50,000 people, so I view this as primary responsibility.  You know, government has pretty much two jobs, roads and bridges, public  safety. And this erodes that second part which is public safety. So I'm  going to fight against it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Well, this is certainly been a very big topic on this  very program. And now more California towns and cities are looking to  follow the lead of Los Alamitos and rejecting the state's sanctuary law.  Buena Park, Fresno, Thousand Oaks, Aliso Viejo and all of Orange County may  now opt out of the sanctuary policy.</p><p>We're joined by the Orange County supervisor Michelle Steel. Thank you for  joining us this evening. We appreciate it, or this afternoon out in  California. </p><p>How does all this affecting your city. Tell us about it. </p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, SUPERVISOR, ORANGE COUNTY:  Well, you know what, actually  our city of Los Alamitos, and they started it, I'm just like so proud of  them, you know, what they did. So now all Orange County cities are coming  out and they want to come out, opt out against this California bad law, and  I thought we had to do something about it, so I'm actually asking my  colleagues on this coming Tuesday to add the lawsuit at the same time the  resolution goes out. So I want people to hear it.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  And make everything--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  What's the response been ahead of that from your colleagues? </p><p>STEEL:  Actually everybody is supporting it.</p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>STEEL:  And I got couple of bad e-mails. Other than that, my colleagues are  all supportive. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Couple of bad e-mails. Let me go to the California governor for a  moment. We'll listen together to Jerry Brown. He's dismissed this policy,  the sanctuary policy fight. He says the administration's lawsuit that we  had from the Department of Justice is nothing but a political stunt. Here's  the governor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JERRY BROWN, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA:  This is really unprecedented for  the chief law enforcement of the United States to come out to California  and act more like Fox News than a law enforcement officer. </p><p>This is a political stunt. It's more like Fox News and what's going on in  Washington, and it's not about the truth. It's not about protecting our  state. It's about dividing America. </p><p>What Jeff Sessions said is simply not true, and I call upon him to  apologize to the people of California, to bringing the mendacity of  Washington to California and trying to insert discord and division, and I  might add, dysfunctionality in a state that's really working. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, Michelle, what do you say to the governor? </p><p>STEEL:  You know, government duty, the first thing comes public safety, and  then you know what, he's not thinking about the safety. We are not talking  about here that President Trump and ICE are going after first generation  immigrants or any immigrant family. They are going after the criminal  aliens.</p><p>And you know, I get a lot of support especially from Congressman Dana  Rohrabacher in my district that he supported me that, you know, me too. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  So we are talking about this. Public safety comes down to it. This  has nothing to do with a stunt. This has nothing to do with racism. This  has nothing to do with, you know, what he thinks it's a show. So Jeff  Sessions did the right thing because it's unconstitutional, and actually  this law ties our sheriffs and that, you know, local police officers' hands  because they have to follow different laws from the federal government and  state government. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  So it's not really safe on the streets. So we have to do something  about it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, that's the issue and speaking of relationship between state  and local officials in the federal government. The Oakland mayor, as you  know, has really become the face of all this as well. Her name is Libby  Shaaf, and she was the person who had warned the illegal immigrants of  impending raids from immigration officials.</p><p>Well, anyway, she has hit back at the president. I want to bring up a quote  from the mayor of Oakland. \"It is continued destruction, it's a continued  perpetration of a racist lie that immigrants were not valued members of our  society. We in Oakland know better. We in Oakland have a community that  welcomes and honors all people no matter where they come from no matter  where how they got here.\"</p><p>Your response to the mayor of Oakland's latest comments. </p><p>STEEL:  Isn't it amazing? Because you can hear it. I'm a first generation  immigrant. At the same time, in Orange County, we have 3.2 million people  living in Orange County, and we are the third largest county in the state. </p><p>At the same time, we have a lot of large immigrant communities in our  county. At the same time we embrace everybody's diverse cultures. So this  has nothing to do with the -- you know, racism. This has things to do that  we are going against that law.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>STEEL:  And especially you cannot really go against federal law that he  would try to save that, you know, protect its own citizens. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK. Michelle Steel, keep us up to date, OK. Next Tuesday she says  is the big day. Thanks for coming on tonight. </p><p>STEEL:  We'll do that. Thank you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK. This Facebook story, there's more fallout over the leaks and  billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk got involved today. He really hit Mark  Zuckerberg with the delete Facebook movement. Taking shape as it is he  deleted his Facebook page, took the SpaceX page down, took the Tesla page  down as well. </p><p>So, what does it all mean for Facebook? Our panel is back after a quick  break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Elon Musk, the CEO of a couple of company Tesla and SpaceX, well,  he erased his own page from the world's most popular social media platform  responding to calls for support of the hash tag delete Facebook movement. </p><p>He took the company's pages down as well after 50 million users had their  personal info harvested by the political analytics firm Cambridge  Analytica. </p><p>The Facebook stock price it's been down heading, it was down again today.  Facebook down just over 3 percent, worst week since August of 2012. it's  wiped out the gains for the year this week. </p><p>Let's bring our panel back. Patrice Lee Onwuka, Eric Schiffer. Patrice, let  me start with you on this topic. </p><p>ONWUKA:  Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Boy, it took Facebook a long time I think especially in our world  here, you take five days to respond to something like this, if you're  Zuckerberg or even Sheryl Sandberg. What do you make of the way they've  handled it and what the fallout will be from here? </p><p>ONWUKA:  I think they've handled it in a way that shows that they have no  clue what they want to do or can do in the situation. You know, hearing  from Zuckerberg, you know, at this point it's not a question whether there  should be regulations--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>ONWUKA:  -- but that, hey, they welcome it is disconcerting. </p><p>I mean, it's concerning because, you know, Facebook will probably weather  this but they're going to have a heavy hand at any sort of regulation that  comes out and what happens with regulation -- with regulating technology is  that it limits -- probably will limit competition so and even use the  social media platform--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you're saying, I get that, but you're saying, Patrice, that  Facebook will have too much influence in that? Is that your point? </p><p>ONWUKA:  It's very possible that they'll be able to guide whatever  regulations come out of this, and any new competition, you know, will start  from a position of disadvantage, frankly, and then we don't know how  innovation is going to develop as a result of any new regulations. </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's funny, Eric, I don't think Facebook has a friend in the  world now politically, if you think about it, I mean, Republicans are not,  you know, the biggest fans of everybody up in Silicon Valley to begin with,  and you're not going to get a Democrat defending kind of the behavior here.  So, nowhere to turn if you are Zuckerberg or Sandberg, is there? </p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, I think we have to remember that there still are tens of  millions of users of Facebook, there's even more of Instagram.</p><p>MCSHANE:  More, yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  So they're not going to get eviscerated from the planet today.  They're going to be around. They will make it through this. But it's a  wake-up call. They got slapped in the face for disrespecting so many  Americans and people around the world with their data. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  I still don't think they get it. I still think that there's an  arrogance that somehow this was OK. I mean, their initial response was one  of the worst responses in the history of modern day crisis management. I  mean, it was terrible. But they have a war chest. Let's not forget. I mean,  they have millions, tens of billions of dollars of potential to be able to  spend. That's a-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  And by the way, as a final point -- that's funny the hacker way  we're looking at now -- the final point, Patrice, this is not just a  Facebook issue, this whole data thing. </p><p>ONWUKA:  No, it's a broader issue for the technology industry to think  about. But as users, I mean, we have given up a tremendous amount of  information about ourselves from our messages to our phone calls to our  photos and the question is how do we retain or regain some control over  that.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>ONWUKA:  And I think that's a conversation for society for public policy  and for technology to be having. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I think a lot of people wanted their Facebook settings started  deleting the access to some of the apps this week. Eric and Patrice, good  to see both of you. Have a good weekend.</p><p>ONWUKA:  You, too.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  It's good to see you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Quick break, we'll be right back after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Business alert for you. Boy, what a week. We said that  every week but we have made it to Friday night which is a big night here on  the Fox Business Network. Maria has her Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street  program this evening. That's 8 p.m. Eastern. You don't want to miss that.  The great Mario Gabelli is on tonight. So miss super Mario and Maria. </p><p>We thank you for watching. I'm Connell McShane. It's time for Charles  Payne. He's here now with Making Money.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Trade jitters have been rocking Wall Street.</p><p>Then, after that veto tease you saw, President Trump did indeed sign the $1.3 trillion, 2200-page spending bill today. He says he's not happy about it taking aim at the Democrats saying never again and calling them out for wasteful spending on personal projects and for not extending legal protections for the DREAMers.</p><p>Tonight we'll break it all down. Also tonight, the White House cracking down on Iran. Nine Iranian nationals and one Iranian entity facing sanctions today from the Treasury Department.</p><p>Tonight, we have a guest who says it's more proof the Iran deal is just a bad deal. Also more Facebook data leak fallout. The billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk hitting Mark Zuckerberg hard, jumping on the delete Facebook movement, deleting his own page and the SpaceX and Tesla pages as well.</p><p>Tonight, a guest who recommends that do you the same.</p><p>It is an all-star guest line up. The Republican Congressman Tom Reed here on that spending bill. Retired lieutenant general Thomas McInerney says it's about time the military got some salary hikes. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron adviser, Steve Hilton on the prospect of a trade war with China.</p><p>More California cities looking to reject the state's sanctuary status. Orange County supervisor Michelle Steel on her new push. It's all here and it's all tonight.</p><p>Politics and money, we've got you covered. Good to be with you on a Friday. I'm Connell McShane. Risk &amp; Reward starts right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have tremendous opposition from the Democrats. So if we take something for the military, they want something for, in many cases, things that are really a wasted sum of money. It's not right, because we need to take care of our military, and because the Democrats, who don't believe in that, added things that they wanted in order to get their votes.</p><p>DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats. We wanted to include DACA. We wanted to have them in this bill. Eight hundred thousand people, and actually it could even be more, and we wanted to include DACA in this bill. The Democrats would not do it.</p><p>To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills, and the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get down to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: President Trump calling out the Democrats as we wrap up what was the worst week on Wall Street in more than two years. The Dow shedding more than 1100 points here over the course of two days. And we're going to talk a lot about that tonight.</p><p>First, though, President Trump signing that $1.3 trillion spending bill after threatening to veto because his border wall wasn't fully funded and there was no fix, he said for DACA. President signing what was a monster piece of legislation, reluctantly saying in order to secure a necessary increase in military spending he had to give money to Democratic projects that he called a, quote, \"wasted sum of money.\"</p><p>Let's talk more though, about these markets. Boy, it was a brutal week and just a terrible two days. We have fears of a trade war on Wall Street, maybe some questions about the Fed as well.</p><p>We bring in Nicole Petallides who's live this evening on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and more than anything, Nicole, just another, just another terrible finish to the day in that final hour, right?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you make a great point, Connell. Because we saw much of the same yesterday. We started off to the downside and drifted lower only to finish down over 700 points. And there was hope for somewhat of a bounce back today, you can see in our intraday chart here that we're showing, that you did see some green in the morning, so there was some hope for those tech and financial groups that really have gotten hit hard lately but they just couldn't keep them out there, so many elements that are hitting these markets.</p><p>The Dow finishes down 424 points, today at 1.7 percentage. It's down about 1500 points for the week. Worst week for stocks since January of 2016. The Dow took out the February 9th, the February lows, the S&amp;P 500 did not, but it got close.</p><p>Taking a look at some of the big losers for the week. We saw 3M, G.E., Goldman Sachs down between 8 and 10 percent, and then we saw the defense stocks. That was one group that did well on the heel of the spending bill and more military support.</p><p>Facebook was a big issue, it hit tech stocks, and that was down about 13 percent for the week and drop box was the winner. That was a new IPO in the technology sector and was well received. It was up about 35 percent. Big picture, there are still worries and we saw some rotation. Defense stocks and energy did all right. Back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. It was rough. Get out of there, Nicole. Thanks a lot. We appreciate. Have a good weekend.</p><p>Let's get to this massive spending bill now. The New York Republican Congressman, Tom Reed (AUDIO GAP) who voted against it. He joins us now. Quite a day, congressman. We're looking at the president who was thinking he said about a veto, but he signed it, your thoughts?</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK: Well, you know, obviously, I voted against it, and I shared the concern that was expressed by the president about the fact that it wasn't in a position to be read and digested.</p><p>But on top of that, the massive amount of spending, I totally appreciate the defense side of the equation.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>REED: But the amount of spending overall is just mind-boggling to me. And we have to get this national debt and the debt crisis under control.</p><p>MCSHANE: I'm going to get to that defense in a moment. Are you disappointed though, in the president's decision?</p><p>REED: Well, you know, obviously I understand where he's at. He was in a very difficult situation.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>REED: Shutting down the government versus signing that bill. It's incumbent upon us on Congress to lead on the issue. I appreciate the president sending the message, we need to do better in Congress and that's why I'm hopeful the next go around.</p><p>MCSHANE: He used the argument, to your point, that he had, basically no choice if he wanted the money for the military than to sign this. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: While we're very disappointed in the 1.3 trillion, nobody more disappointed than me because the number is so large, it will start coming down. We had no choice but to fund our military because we have to have, by far, the strongest military in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: I was down in Washington all week and I heard Paul Ryan make that same exact argument a number of times. So it's the idea, congressman, that I guess you're never going to get a chance like this again if you don't sign this. Is there something to that, that you would never have a chance to have this type of an increase for military spending?</p><p>REED: Well, I think we just we definitely were on a position on the defense side. We needed to make those investments because our men and women were being put in harm's way where we were.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>REED: But at the end of the day, it shows exactly what was negotiated here. They went more on the defense side in order to get the nondefense number where they need because they needed those 10 Democrats plus or minus to come over to support the bill. That's why going to 51 votes on the Senate, at least on the appropriation the spending bills, to me is a reform the Senate should strongly consider at least going down that path. Maybe not blowing it up for anything, but at least for the appropriation spending bills.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. Boy, I wonder if they'll do that. It doesn't seem like this any kind of movement, right, to go in that direction?</p><p>REED: No, it doesn't.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>REED: It's been very clear us to that they don't want to change that threshold. They want the Senate wants to continue that archaic rule but that's up to the Senate to decide. All I can do is vote my conscience, which is a no.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>REED: This debt crisis is upon us. We need to get the spending under control, and if we don't, our children and grandchildren are going to be saddled with such debt and this county is threatened by this debt crisis today is going off as we speak.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: One quick political question, Congressman on this, I know you say you voted your conscience and voted no. But how worried are you about the midterms at this point and the blowback from a bill like this, the effect it could have on Republicans?</p><p>REED: You know I think if we just continue as individual members to go out and work hard and put our voice and our positions out there, we're going to be fine on the Republican side. We have tax reform, we're seeing the benefits in the economy.</p><p>Jobless numbers, the president hasn't been given credit for, in my humble opinion, you know, low unemployment numbers, lowest levels for Hispanic and African-American unemployment, we got to send that message and sell that message to the American people and I think they'll be with us at the end of the day.</p><p>MCSHANE: I want to get your thoughts on one of the story before we let you go, just on Iran, nine Iranian nationals today, one Iranian entity facing sanctions also the prospect of federal charges. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROD ROSENSTEIN, UNITED STATES DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: Federal grand jury in the southern District of New York indicted nine Iranians for conspiring to hack into computers and to defraud American and foreign universities, businesses and government agencies. This indictment alleges that the defendants worked on behalf of the Iranian government, specifically the Islamic revolutionary guard corps.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: The charges you heard that these Iranians essentially, you know, like they hacked into hundreds of universities and other organizations and stole information on behalf of the government of Iran, so it comes at a time, we're getting a new national security adviser, Iran is in the news anyway, in particular the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Your thoughts.</p><p>REED: Absolutely. I support the actions taken by the Justice Department as well as treasury in regards to going after Iran for these actions of hacking into our systems and stealing our information and putting real American interests at risk.</p><p>And this is the right thing to do and I hope they continue to increase the message that we're not going to put up with this anymore and we're going to hold people accountable for these actions against our interests.</p><p>MCSHANE: And what about the Iranian nuclear deal?</p><p>REED: You know, I think with the new -- with John Bolton coming into the administration, I think what you're going to see is what we all advocated for when we strongly oppose that agreement. We need to hold Iran accountable. You can't buy peace through appeasement.</p><p>We need to send the message we want peace through strength and that's what you're going to get out of the new administration direction I think coming down the pipeline.</p><p>MCSHANE: You think they'll rip it up?</p><p>REED: I think absolutely. I think at a minimum, it will hold them extreme -- hold them accountable to each and every corner of that agreement, if not destroy it and move forward and hold Iran accountable for its actions on nuclearization.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Congressman, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for coming on. We appreciate it all the time.</p><p>REED: Pleasure to be with you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Congressman Reed, upstate New York.</p><p>Now, President Trump with that announcement about John Bolton we just mentioned briefly that the ambassador would come and take the place of H.R. McMaster's national security adviser, that was last night big story, right? Our next guest thinks it's a great choice. Former Air Force assistant vice chief of staff, there he is, the retired lieutenant general Thomas McInerney. He'll tell us why next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: I think the consensus would be that the national security adviser among whatever functions he or she might have has two critical roles. Number one, making sure that the president has the full range of options presented to him to make the decisions that only the president can make.</p><p>And the other side of the coin is when the president makes a decision, the national security adviser is, among others, but certainly one of the leading implementers of the decision, making sure that the bureaucracies out there get the decision and implement it, and I've been in lots of bureaucracies, and I've seen the way that bureaucracies that don't like decisions sit on them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton is set to take the place of H.R. McMaster as national security adviser to the president, and he laid out there how he might handle the office.</p><p>We're joined by former air force assistant vice chief of staff, retired lieutenant general Thomas McInerney with us tonight. Good to see you, general. Thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE: Thanks for having me, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: You know, we've had I think 23 hours or something like that to digest this, I think maybe not the announcement, but the timing of this caught just about everybody including maybe Ambassador Bolton off-guard last night. But now that we've thought about it a little bit what do you make of the move by the president?</p><p>MCINERNEY: I think it's the most brilliant selection of a national security adviser that I've seen in the last 50 years, and at least three of the last 50 years became secretary of state. But John Bolton has more experience than those three including Henry Kissinger.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY: So I think it is a great tribute to President Trump that he had the courage to select such a strong national security adviser who is so articulate, can present the issues and as John pointed out, his job is to give a balanced presentation, all the options to the president.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY: And then ensure implementation. He knows how to do both base on his experience, so I couldn't think of a finer person and a more capable person, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Kissinger, Powell and I guess one other, right, that went to be secretary of state.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Rice.</p><p>MCSHANE: Rice, of course, yes, that's right, Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state and was in this position. I read a lot about it today and even seen some of our colleagues in the media talking about it, and you'll be surprised, general, not everybody agrees with your assessment.</p><p>Let's take a listen to a little bit of that then you can you react. Here's some media reaction to the appointment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This may be the worst thing he's done. He said to them no more stupid wars. Now he brings in the godfather of stupid wars, John Bolton!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that the risk of a war, of a shooting war with Iran and North Korea are substantially greater than they were this morning. I think it dramatically increases the risk that a lot of Americans and Koreans, perhaps Japanese end up dead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: John Bolton, he is the hammer and everything is a nail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just throwing all the toys at Iran, I'm mad! I'm getting rid of everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, general. So, the idea obviously that we're more likely to go to war now than we were before this appointment.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Yes, Connell, we're less likely to go to war with this appointment than if others. It's like if we still had Curtis LeMay who dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, if he became the chairman or joint chiefs of staff, now you brought him back, the fact is that is a signal of peace through strength.</p><p>John is a brilliant negotiator. He understands it. But he's not afraid to make hard decisions. I think there's a much higher possibility of peace in the resolution in both Korea and Iran being solid without war with John Bolton there.</p><p>MCSHANE: Interesting. Peace through strength. I want to ask you about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis while I have you here, general. Because this came up with the president's comments today about the spending bill, which he did sign, we're talking earlier about why he signed it because he could help the military. Here is Secretary Mattis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: In 1790 in George Washington's first annual address to Congress, he stated to be prepared for war is one of the most defective means of preserving the peace.</p><p>As the president noted today, we received the largest military budget in history. Reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding. And together, we are going to make our military stronger than ever.</p><p>We, in the military are humbled and grateful to the American people for their sacrifices on behalf of this funding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: We take a quick look at some of the defense-related stocks in the trade today, remember it was a big time down day on Wall Street but the likes of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman all faring quite well. Even with the Dow down 400 plus points all of those.</p><p>All right. General, what, how did you view this, because part of it was, we talk about earlier in the show, is that there are a number of people who are conservatives who are quite upset that the president ended up signing this bill and they don't like the runaway spending. But those who argue in favor of it are using the military to make their arguments. What's your take?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Well, I think it's correct. I don't like that spending bill either. I don't think they should have caved on all those domestic programs that have been flush with money the last eight years. People don't realize it, Connell, but Barack Obama left a hollow military. Now I was on active duty when Jimmy Carter, just before Reagan came in and left a hollow military, but the media has elected not to discuss it and point it out.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, the president talks about it a lot. Tell us how specifically. What does that mean?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Well, it means like our in commission rates are at 50 percent. They were 80 and 90 percent, this is for aircraft.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY: There were 80 and 90 percent when I was in active duty and commanding. We used to have 155 tactical fighter wings and the squadrons in the air force. Today we've got 50. The fact is not only are we smaller but they're less capable. The maintenance problem we had.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>MCINERNEY: We had two very serious accidents in the Pacific on destroyers at sea, and all these things have come to, I think, a very critical tipping point. And what worry--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Right, and that's the point. It's critical enough that, you know, you would make that argument, then we're not crazy about all the other things maybe in a spending bill but we just need this that badly. That's essentially the argument.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Exactly, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCINERNEY: And it takes a while to build that industrial buildup to get those spare parts and those new airplanes and all those things. So there's lag time in front of us and it must be done now and I would accept what Secretary Mattis said that we need it now and that the president had to make this decision.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, your argument did win the day, and the bill was signed. General, good to see you, sir. Thank you very much.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Good seeing you, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Markets, boy, the Dow shedding 1100 plus points just over a couple of sessions. President Trump with the China tariffs. China with its response, its own tariff threat that we'll talk about. In fact, our next guest says it's smaller than expected which could be a sign of progress.</p><p>He's the former senior adviser to the former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, that's Steve Hilton. He's coming up after a quick break. We'll be right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: China is going to end up treating us fairly, for many years, they had free reign, they don't have free reign anymore. We're very friendly with China. We have great relationships with China, and look, it's time. It's time. Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let that happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, President Trump today saying he's making progress on the China trade negotiation following his announcement that the administration will impose tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.</p><p>Now China did have a response of its own here on this Friday with its own tariff threat. The Chinese said they are planning to slap taxes on three billion of U.S. goods. This affects only about 2 percent of China's imports from the United States compared to roughly 10 percent of trade in the opposite direction.</p><p>So let's talk about it, we're joined by the former senior adviser to David Cameron, we know him as the host of the Next Revolution of the Fox News Channel, Steve Hilton is with us. You know, a lot of people saw that, it came out last night and Friday in China, and they said here we go, trade war. But what do you say?</p><p>STEVE HILTON, HOST, FOX NEWS: I think we need -- I think it's a good start, basically. I think we need to be much, much tougher with China than we've been for many years, and I think that you're seeing this administration get to that tough position, not just with this measure but also previously not long ago, they announced that CFIUS the committee on foreign investment in United States would take a much tougher line on foreign investments.</p><p>They blocked that really big tech deal where one of our most important tech companies, Qualcomm, the key to the future of mobile technology is going to be bought by a company that they thought was a security risk to China. I think it's that transfer of technology to China who wants to use it for their plans that they stated for world domination. That's what we've got to watch out for.</p><p>And it looks to me like the tariffs are part of that. But the other thing the administration are doing are actually more important.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now what about the Chinese response, though? I mention the three billion that they've talked about, you say a drop in the bucket or the start of something that could be much bigger and far more dangerous. Certainly there are concerns whether they're justified or not on Wall Street, the market since this protection is talked has started is not -- has not done well. The last couple of days down 1100 plus on the Dow, so.</p><p>HILTON: This is a much bigger and more long-term question than even these tariffs. It's about how are we going to handle a really aggressive nation like China that has set out to beat America on every important front and they said that they're going to do that using the latest technology.</p><p>I think a little fight over tariffs is really beside the point. (Inaudible) this even if the trade between the U.S. and China went to zero, we'd still have a massive problem, not economically but militarily, the way that they're using technology to hack into our government and steal data and influence all sorts of things around the world.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: Look at the way that they're spending so much on infrastructure to try and control countries all around the world. That's the big issue.</p><p>MCSHANE: I want to ask you we have another topic, so I just request a short answer on this. But if -- because you have experience obviously working on other governments. Some say there would have been a better way, either, a, you go to the WTO or at least you build an alliance with other countries and go after China altogether as opposed to kind of one on one.</p><p>HILTON: I think that may be right in the small area of the trade imbalance. But they're not going to listen to all those other countries or the WTO on the big question of the strategic move they're making to become the dominant nation in the world in the 21st century. Only America can resist that.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK, we'll get back to this. But let me go to another topic, former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger saying that the Republicans in California are going down. Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA: Our politics must be the politics of solutions and substance. Today we are the Titanic after it hits the iceberg, but before the last bit of the ship submerged.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Now you have an interview out there in California on your very fine program that I mentioned earlier, the Next Revolution, Sunday on the Fox News Channel. I don't know if he responds to this, but tell us a little bit about it.</p><p>HILTON: Well, actually, I was there for that event with former Governor Schwarzenegger. And that's where I sat down with him for the interview. Look, the thing is that he's not wrong about the political position of the Republican Party here in California where I'm speaking to you from today.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: California -- the Republicans in California haven't won statewide office for years, over a decade. They're complete -- they're losing more and more seats in the state legislature so the Democrats are in complete control of California politically.</p><p>And you see the result in the terrible policies that are really harming business and society throughout the state. So, you got to get back in there somewhere that he was a winner in California, so I think it's important to listen to his message.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's always interesting to listen to him no matter what. So we look forward to that. All right. We'll watch on Sunday, Steve. Thanks for joining us tonight, we appreciate it.</p><p>HILTON: Great to see you.</p><p>MCSHANE: We have Steve Hilton Next Revolution 9 p.m. Sunday evenings on Fox News Channel. So don't miss that with Mr. Schwarzenegger.</p><p>In a moment, we've been hot on tracking the California cities ditching the state sanctuary policies and after Los Alamitos voted to opt out. Tonight, another California administrator here to say her area too may vote to quit California sanctuary policies.</p><p>The Orange County supervisor, just ahead, Michelle Steel here to speak out.</p><p>MCSHANE: We do have some Friday evening breaking news here as the Attorney General Jeff Sessions has just made it official announcement. A new regulation that effectively bans bump stocks, as they're known. We thought this might be coming and now this is the way the administration is going about it, they asked for bump stocks to fall within the definition of machine guns under federal law which will make them illegal.</p><p>Presidential tweet just before the announcement from Attorney General Sessions, here it is. \"Obama administration legalized bump stocks. Bad idea. As I promised, the president writes, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandate comment period. We will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"</p><p>So the president said he would take care of that on his own. Remember he told members of Congress meeting at the White House that that's how he would handle it. Apparently this is the method of doing so. More on that to come.</p><p>In the meantime, President Trump signing that spending bill today after threatening a veto. Once again, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I say to Congress I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know, $1.3 trillion. It's the second largest ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: As he walks away, some members of the media did press the president after the announcement. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you, thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, why the veto threat if you know you had to sign the bill?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, we'll figure it out in about 20 minutes after you look at it. We're going to figure that out. You're going to figure that out. We looked at it to veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto, but because of the incredible gains that we've been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our -- any of our thinking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, let's bring our panel in and see whether they have figured it out by this evening. Patrice, Patrice Lee Onwuka is with us, the Independent Women's Forum, Washington Times contributor Eric Schiffer is here as well. Thanks to you both.</p><p>I know, Eric, I'll start with you on this. There are a number of conservatives who are not happy that the bill was signed and not vetoed. What are your thoughts this evening?</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CONTRIBUTOR, WASHINGTON TIMES: I think this was a giant strategic mistake by the president, and I think he's going to regret it. To not have vetoed this is inconsistent with everything that he's done so far.</p><p>I mean, he's been so consistent in keeping promises with the base on almost everything but in this situation you're basically abandoning immigration and that was a core issue, the wall, immigration.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER: So--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: He said he had to for the military. He said he had to.</p><p>SCHIFFER: Well, look, I'm a proponent of the military. There's no question. But that's the window dressing. I think that the, and I'm glad they got it but not to the extent that it just throws away immigration. That's the core of his presidency was immigration, and that's what the base was so excited about, and he's just ignored it.</p><p>MCSHANE: I started Patrice, with Eric on purpose. I know the base, the Trump base, and we've heard from, you know, whether it's Twitter or whatever it is throughout the day today and many other shows that preceded ours that people in the president's base are not happy with his decision. What do you make of that?</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well, I mean, I think people recognize that, you know, they elected Republicans from top to bottom, from the White House all the way to Congress, expecting that there would be fiscal responsibility.</p><p>Looking at the national debt, looking at the driver of debt, and expecting that, you know, once in power, Republicans would hold their -- would hold their own and continue to do what they're supposed to do, but the political realities here were you know that you're in an imperfect situation, where you needed some sort of Democratic support and they felt that, you know, this is the only way to avert a government shutdown. With the second or third within this year alone, so, you know, this is what they had to do.</p><p>I do think though, that when we look at our big drivers of national debt--</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>ONWUKA: -- you know, it's really not even just a domestic spending that increased, it's really those entitlement, those mandatory spending and that unfortunately no one is talking about.</p><p>MCSHANE: No one is talking about. I was going to say, yes, we haven't even, you know, started to talk about that one yet. One of the olive branches I guess that the president tried to throw out today and we'll talk in a moment about whether there is any political reality in terms of this coming to fruition, but he talked about a line-item veto, right, for all of government spending bills. Let's take a listen once again to the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills, and the Senate must end, they must end the filibuster rule and get down to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, here's the problem with that, Eric, among other things. And that would require a constitutional amendment, two-thirds vote in both Houses of Congress. I don't think I need to tell you that that's not very likely, is it?</p><p>SCHIFFER: Well, conservatives don't need a line-item veto, they need a president that keeps his word. Period.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>SCHIFFER: And that's what anger so many people that immigration has just been thrown out the door, and that he has ignored the people that brought him to this level of power, he's just completely ignored them. It's so strange because up to this point he's been consistent, it's as if he's just not, he's like he's lost his focus. He lost what he ran on and he's deserted so many millions of people who really have counted on him.</p><p>MCSHANE: The president knew that he would take a hit from his base on this just by the tone he was using today. Because that was a somber president for a bill signing ceremony as it was billed.</p><p>SCHIFFER: That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE: Patrice, we're going to come back to you and get much more from you. Eric, as well, a little bit later in the program. I do have to take a break now. As we've been talking, Liz has been hot on this topic, tracking the California cities ditching the state sanctuary policies, and you know, Los Alamitos I mentioned this earlier, opted out.</p><p>Tonight another California administrator is here to say her area too may quit the sanctuary policy coming from the state. It's Michelle Steel, the Orange County supervisor and she will speak out on that topic next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TROY EDGAR, MAYOR, LOST ALAMITOS, CALIFORNIA: I'm really excited. I've been completely thrilled with the outpouring of all the city council members and mayors across the state that have been communicating, saying they were waiting for somebody to come out and do this.</p><p>DAVE HARRINGTON, MAYOR OF ALISO VIEJO, CALIFORNIA: I think that's the shot heard around the state of California. So it absolutely inspired me. And I reached out to them right away not only to congratulate them but also, you know, tap into what their experience was and how they managed to get it done.</p><p>This makes us less safe. It makes my citizens less safe. I'm responsible for the safety of 50,000 people, so I view this as primary responsibility. You know, government has pretty much two jobs, roads and bridges, public safety. And this erodes that second part which is public safety. So I'm going to fight against it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Well, this is certainly been a very big topic on this very program. And now more California towns and cities are looking to follow the lead of Los Alamitos and rejecting the state's sanctuary law. Buena Park, Fresno, Thousand Oaks, Aliso Viejo and all of Orange County may now opt out of the sanctuary policy.</p><p>We're joined by the Orange County supervisor Michelle Steel. Thank you for joining us this evening. We appreciate it, or this afternoon out in California.</p><p>How does all this affecting your city. Tell us about it.</p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, SUPERVISOR, ORANGE COUNTY: Well, you know what, actually our city of Los Alamitos, and they started it, I'm just like so proud of them, you know, what they did. So now all Orange County cities are coming out and they want to come out, opt out against this California bad law, and I thought we had to do something about it, so I'm actually asking my colleagues on this coming Tuesday to add the lawsuit at the same time the resolution goes out. So I want people to hear it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>STEEL: And make everything--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: What's the response been ahead of that from your colleagues?</p><p>STEEL: Actually everybody is supporting it.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>STEEL: And I got couple of bad e-mails. Other than that, my colleagues are all supportive.</p><p>MCSHANE: Couple of bad e-mails. Let me go to the California governor for a moment. We'll listen together to Jerry Brown. He's dismissed this policy, the sanctuary policy fight. He says the administration's lawsuit that we had from the Department of Justice is nothing but a political stunt. Here's the governor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY BROWN, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA: This is really unprecedented for the chief law enforcement of the United States to come out to California and act more like Fox News than a law enforcement officer.</p><p>This is a political stunt. It's more like Fox News and what's going on in Washington, and it's not about the truth. It's not about protecting our state. It's about dividing America.</p><p>What Jeff Sessions said is simply not true, and I call upon him to apologize to the people of California, to bringing the mendacity of Washington to California and trying to insert discord and division, and I might add, dysfunctionality in a state that's really working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Michelle, what do you say to the governor?</p><p>STEEL: You know, government duty, the first thing comes public safety, and then you know what, he's not thinking about the safety. We are not talking about here that President Trump and ICE are going after first generation immigrants or any immigrant family. They are going after the criminal aliens.</p><p>And you know, I get a lot of support especially from Congressman Dana Rohrabacher in my district that he supported me that, you know, me too.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>STEEL: So we are talking about this. Public safety comes down to it. This has nothing to do with a stunt. This has nothing to do with racism. This has nothing to do with, you know, what he thinks it's a show. So Jeff Sessions did the right thing because it's unconstitutional, and actually this law ties our sheriffs and that, you know, local police officers' hands because they have to follow different laws from the federal government and state government.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>STEEL: So it's not really safe on the streets. So we have to do something about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's the issue and speaking of relationship between state and local officials in the federal government. The Oakland mayor, as you know, has really become the face of all this as well. Her name is Libby Shaaf, and she was the person who had warned the illegal immigrants of impending raids from immigration officials.</p><p>Well, anyway, she has hit back at the president. I want to bring up a quote from the mayor of Oakland. \"It is continued destruction, it's a continued perpetration of a racist lie that immigrants were not valued members of our society. We in Oakland know better. We in Oakland have a community that welcomes and honors all people no matter where they come from no matter where how they got here.\"</p><p>Your response to the mayor of Oakland's latest comments.</p><p>STEEL: Isn't it amazing? Because you can hear it. I'm a first generation immigrant. At the same time, in Orange County, we have 3.2 million people living in Orange County, and we are the third largest county in the state.</p><p>At the same time, we have a lot of large immigrant communities in our county. At the same time we embrace everybody's diverse cultures. So this has nothing to do with the -- you know, racism. This has things to do that we are going against that law.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>STEEL: And especially you cannot really go against federal law that he would try to save that, you know, protect its own citizens.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK. Michelle Steel, keep us up to date, OK. Next Tuesday she says is the big day. Thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>STEEL: We'll do that. Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK. This Facebook story, there's more fallout over the leaks and billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk got involved today. He really hit Mark Zuckerberg with the delete Facebook movement. Taking shape as it is he deleted his Facebook page, took the SpaceX page down, took the Tesla page down as well.</p><p>So, what does it all mean for Facebook? Our panel is back after a quick break.</p><p>MCSHANE: Elon Musk, the CEO of a couple of company Tesla and SpaceX, well, he erased his own page from the world's most popular social media platform responding to calls for support of the hash tag delete Facebook movement.</p><p>He took the company's pages down as well after 50 million users had their personal info harvested by the political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>The Facebook stock price it's been down heading, it was down again today. Facebook down just over 3 percent, worst week since August of 2012. it's wiped out the gains for the year this week.</p><p>Let's bring our panel back. Patrice Lee Onwuka, Eric Schiffer. Patrice, let me start with you on this topic.</p><p>ONWUKA: Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE: Boy, it took Facebook a long time I think especially in our world here, you take five days to respond to something like this, if you're Zuckerberg or even Sheryl Sandberg. What do you make of the way they've handled it and what the fallout will be from here?</p><p>ONWUKA: I think they've handled it in a way that shows that they have no clue what they want to do or can do in the situation. You know, hearing from Zuckerberg, you know, at this point it's not a question whether there should be regulations--</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>ONWUKA: -- but that, hey, they welcome it is disconcerting.</p><p>I mean, it's concerning because, you know, Facebook will probably weather this but they're going to have a heavy hand at any sort of regulation that comes out and what happens with regulation -- with regulating technology is that it limits -- probably will limit competition so and even use the social media platform--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, you're saying, I get that, but you're saying, Patrice, that Facebook will have too much influence in that? Is that your point?</p><p>ONWUKA: It's very possible that they'll be able to guide whatever regulations come out of this, and any new competition, you know, will start from a position of disadvantage, frankly, and then we don't know how innovation is going to develop as a result of any new regulations.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's funny, Eric, I don't think Facebook has a friend in the world now politically, if you think about it, I mean, Republicans are not, you know, the biggest fans of everybody up in Silicon Valley to begin with, and you're not going to get a Democrat defending kind of the behavior here. So, nowhere to turn if you are Zuckerberg or Sandberg, is there?</p><p>SCHIFFER: Well, I think we have to remember that there still are tens of millions of users of Facebook, there's even more of Instagram.</p><p>MCSHANE: More, yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER: So they're not going to get eviscerated from the planet today. They're going to be around. They will make it through this. But it's a wake-up call. They got slapped in the face for disrespecting so many Americans and people around the world with their data.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>SCHIFFER: I still don't think they get it. I still think that there's an arrogance that somehow this was OK. I mean, their initial response was one of the worst responses in the history of modern day crisis management. I mean, it was terrible. But they have a war chest. Let's not forget. I mean, they have millions, tens of billions of dollars of potential to be able to spend. That's a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: And by the way, as a final point -- that's funny the hacker way we're looking at now -- the final point, Patrice, this is not just a Facebook issue, this whole data thing.</p><p>ONWUKA: No, it's a broader issue for the technology industry to think about. But as users, I mean, we have given up a tremendous amount of information about ourselves from our messages to our phone calls to our photos and the question is how do we retain or regain some control over that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>ONWUKA: And I think that's a conversation for society for public policy and for technology to be having.</p><p>MCSHANE: I think a lot of people wanted their Facebook settings started deleting the access to some of the apps this week. Eric and Patrice, good to see both of you. Have a good weekend.</p><p>ONWUKA: You, too.</p><p>SCHIFFER: It's good to see you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Quick break, we'll be right back after this.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Business alert for you. Boy, what a week. We said that every week but we have made it to Friday night which is a big night here on the Fox Business Network. Maria has her Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street program this evening. That's 8 p.m. Eastern. You don't want to miss that. The great Mario Gabelli is on tonight. So miss super Mario and Maria.</p><p>We thank you for watching. I'm Connell McShane. It's time for Charles Payne. He's here now with Making Money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018032301cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY2-S6Y1-DXH2-60F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Boneheads: President Trump attacks the Federal Reserve arguing rates should be lower. Exchange Trades: The Hong Kong Stock Exchange makes a $39 billion bid for the LSC, and Apple slices prices, relatively -- relatively cheaper iPhones, and certainly cheaper streaming. It's Wednesday, it's also September the 11th. And we remember, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to FIRST MOVE once again. Glad to have you with us, as always. As I mentioned there, it is September the 11th. And we will be observing a minute of silence here at the New York Stock Exchange to remember those who lost their lives and those that were impacted 18 years ago with members of the Emergency Services, as well, as you can probably see behind me, are going to be ringing the opening bell this morning, too, and we will bring that to you live as always.</p><p>For now, though, let me give you a look at what we're seeing for the U.S. markets -- premarket this morning. We are a little bit higher, but we are well and truly, as we've been saying all week, in wait-and-see mode right now.</p><p>An easy thing to do, perhaps we could argue here with major stock markets, sitting just one and a half percent away from record highs, though those figures belie underlying shifts going on within the sectors and we'll discuss that later on in the show, but lots of risk events coming up in the coming days.</p><p>The European Central Bank, of course, tomorrow potentially announcing a return to bond buying though Goldman Sachs warning overnight that fresh stimulus might not be forthcoming, given the divisions in the ECB leadership right now. So that will keep investors guessing.</p><p>I'll tell you what though, one man who isn't second guessing the need for more stimulus is President Trump. He has been tweeting this morning. Let me show you what he said, \"The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to zero or less and we should then start to refinance on debt. Interest costs could be brought way down.\"</p><p>He continues, \"The USA should always be paying the lowest rate. No inflation. It's only the naivete of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of quote 'boneheads.'\"</p><p>Naivete -- look, I've got it there. Now, some might say, that trade tariffs are also boneheaded hereto, some might say. Well, I can tell you there is good news on that front. Let's get to the drivers because there is a temporary reprieve -- Beijing waiving fresh tariffs on 16 types of U.S. products.</p><p>Christine, Romans joins us no this. Wow, Christine lots to discuss, including the fact I can't get my words out of my mouth this morning. First of its kind, though, in this case.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Tariffs have already been applied. They're going to be waived going forward for a year. This feels like a huge step from China. Is it an olive branch ahead of fresh talks? Or is this acknowledgement that tariffs are hurting the domestic economy or perhaps both here?</p><p>ROMANS: I think, a little bit of both. But the latter is a big driver here. I mean, you're talking about cancer treatment drugs, and you're talking about the kinds of products you use to feed livestock, and in the production of their own agriculture industry.</p><p>So it looks to me like they're trying to make sure that really important parts of their economy aren't going to be hurt. And the social, frankly, social stability in their country is going to be hurt by the higher prices, their cancer patient and farmers. That's, you know, pretty basic here.</p><p>So we've got two big rounds here, one list it's a total -- just you can waive these categories. It's everything from shrimp, shrimp seedlings, fish meal for feed, lubricating oil and the like. The second list, these are also exemptions -- whey, mold release agent, base stock for lubricating oil. Some of these you are going to be able to get a refund on if they've already paid these tariffs. Others, there's just a reprieve going forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. And I didn't know that neither pork nor soybeans, of course --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Critical --</p><p>ROMANS: Politically sensitive -- not on that list.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I do want to talk about what President Trump said though, neither of us will ever condone the name calling or the criticizing or the interference with the Federal Reserve here. But he does make an interesting point about utilizing low rates here.</p><p>Refinancing, borrowing longer term, when you can. Now this is an argument I've made about Europe. The governments in Europe should use the room that they have here perhaps to borrow, to provide fiscal support to their economies, while rates are low, what do we think of this?</p><p>[09:05:11]</p><p>ROMANS: This is a sort of a new attack on the Fed, I think, that is pretty interesting. A couple of days ago, Stephen Moore, of course, you remember who is somebody who the President wanted to put on the Fed, and that eventually was scuttled.</p><p>He is somebody who an op-ed piece in \"The Wall Street Journal\" with this very idea. He even use the term \"once in a lifetime\" to restructure, refinance American debt.</p><p>The President makes it very simplistic here, like it's a home loan that can be, you know, that can be remortgaged, and it doesn't really exactly work like that. There's some concern among bond market experts, for example, that while yes, you could maybe issues of new debt and very longer terms and low rates, that might be a good idea for the U.S. to keep its borrowing costs lower going into the future.</p><p>What kind of signal you're sending to international investors, if you're promising negative rates and talking about restructuring all the debt that we've already got out there? These are contractual obligations, legal, contractual obligations. It's not as easy as just one home loan.</p><p>But you're right, the point of the very low interest rates does give America kind of an interesting moment in time here and a lot of people have said this is the time actually to be borrowing at very long terms for infrastructure build, for example, that will be the kinds of thing to add to your debt pile for not necessarily maybe new tax cuts as we've already done.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such an interesting question, quite whether the President needs to call up Steve Mnuchin, of course, and the Treasury who issues debt versus the Federal Reserve.</p><p>ROMANS: It's not the Fed, right. And that's not the Fed's job. That's the Treasury, right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, yes. Yes. Christine Romans. Thank you so much for that. All right. Let's move on because we've got some the potential deal making going on.</p><p>Hong Kong Exchange is making a bid for the London Stock Exchange. We're talking a $39 billion tie up when you include the debt. The LSE stock up from five and a half percent in the session today. Clare Sebastian joins me now.</p><p>This is an interesting one, Clare. I make this a 23 percent premium for LSE shareholders trying to entice them away from that whopping refinitive offer that they made just a few weeks ago. What do we think of this?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, it's interesting, because it does seem to be presenting a binary choice between one deal or the other.</p><p>The Hong Kong Exchange is saying in that statement that essentially the deal would be contingent on dropping that $27 billion bed for a refinitive. Now, the stock price up as you see five percent this morning. It was up a little bit more.</p><p>So clearly, shareholders do see this as a potential positive, but it's also up, the LSE stock has still about 20 percent since before that refinitive deal was announced. It's hard to see at this moment, which one shareholders are going to see as the most lucrative going forward.</p><p>The LSE though for its part says it's still committed to that refinitive bid, and it describes the bid from the Hong Kong Exchange as quote, \"unsolicited preliminary and highly conditional.\" And it would of course, be a completely different direction for the company were they drop the bed for a refinitive that would have created a market data giant to rival Bloomberg, a combination of Hong Kong Exchange and LSE would be more of a giant in terms of market infrastructure to rival the likes of intercontinental exchanges in the U.S.</p><p>So you know, a couple of competing forces really here, but as I say, highly conditional preliminary and unsolicited is how the LSE is describing this this morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But that is exactly the point. These are two completely different directions and a number of people already coming out and sort of scratching their heads and going, \"What would be the financial benefits here?\"</p><p>But let's talk about some of the complications. What about the regulators here? We're talking about, in the end, a special administrative region of China. Is this effective, and will the regulator's look at this as a Chinese exchange buying a very strategically important exchange over in Europe? Are they going to be willing to sign off on that?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, it does seem like the politics is going to be a very important part of this going forward, Julia. We heard Andrea Leadsom, the U.K. Business Secretary on TV this morning saying that although she hadn't really looked at it yet, they would be thinking about the security implications of this like.</p><p>Look, this is a Hong Kong exchange that has been tightening its ties to China in recent years through stock connect programs and all of that, plus we have the backdrop in Hong Kong, the unrest that's been going on there fueled or rooted mostly in fears of rising Chinese influence in that region.</p><p>So that will certainly inform the decision making around this going forward, and of course, we have to mention Brexit. It's possible that the weakening pound has made the LSE more attractive as a takeover target, but we have a situation here, Julia, where these two exchanges could merge.</p><p>Two exchanges from some cities that because of local turmoil of both contemplating whether or not their status as a financial center is under threat. So very interesting timing here for this deal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, better together. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that update there. Now, regulators are keeping busy all over the world. Amazon, reportedly under investigation. U.S. antitrust regulators interviewing smaller Amazon sellers. The big question, it seems they're asking is Amazon using its market power to hurt competition here?</p><p>[09:10:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Matt Egan joins us on this story. This is an interesting one, what they're being asked here is, what proportion of their revenues are done with Amazon versus other players here like an eBay or a Walmart, all they to leveraged here to Amazon in terms of their percentage of revenues? It's an important question.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Julia, clearly, the crackdown on big tech is intensifying here. Bloomberg is reporting that the FTC is interviewing small business owners that use the Amazon Marketplace to see whether or not the tech giant is using its enormous size and influence to unfairly take advantage of competition.</p><p>And what's interesting is that this report suggests that the FTC has really started a sweeping and very serious probe of Amazon, and they're basing that on the fact that the FTC is devoting some serious manpower to these inquiry, and they're also asking really long questions.</p><p>I mean, these interviews have been going on apparently, for something like 90 minutes. Now, we should stress that we haven't confirmed this news ourselves, we've reached out to Amazon and to the FTC, haven't heard back yet.</p><p>But you know, we saw earlier this morning, Amazon shares were dipping premarket on this news. Because you know, it really is just another reminder of the serious antitrust scrutiny that Washington regulators are putting on big tech, which is a really big deal, because big tech is really the heart of the bull market.</p><p>Just earlier this week, we learned that 50 U.S. Attorneys General, they had announced this sweeping investigation into Google, Facebook, as well as facing scrutiny from eight states and the District of Columbia. And that's on top of Federal scrutiny.</p><p>The FTC is investigating Facebook. The Justice Department is looking at Google. There's a House Committee that is also looking at big tech. So I think that what is really important here is that, you know, even if this doesn't result in some sort of a breakup of any of these companies, you know, there are costs here.</p><p>I mean, there's obviously legal fees, there's distraction costs for the management, as well. And it really acts as kind of a cloud over the sector that we should expect will weigh on those lofty multiples for these companies. So Julia, clearly this issue is not going away anytime soon.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. And I will make the point that Amazon argue all the way through that, look, they are just four percent of the U.S. retail market, even if you total what they are in terms of e-commerce sales in the United States, which is just shy of 40 percent.</p><p>The question is does that defense hold when you're going down to the granular level in trying to understand how much and how much dependency there is on individual sellers on the Amazon platform. It's going to be fascinating to watch. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let's move on. Apple investors seemingly unmoved by the latest announcements, 11 is the magic number. But premarket gains show a lot less than that. We will bear in mind about 35 percent in the past 12 months. Apple banking on fresh models to reverse a year of sunken sales.</p><p>Seth Fiegerman joins us now on this story. Seth, they delivered exactly what we were expecting, and that's the problem here. We're looking for new innovation and we didn't get it. What did you make of the announcement yesterday?</p><p>SETH FIEGERMAN, CNN BUSINESS TECH EDITOR: It's certainly true. There was no radical redesign here, there was no breakthrough feature. The real breakthrough here, it was an aggressive pricing strategy, which is not nothing.</p><p>You know, after a year of being criticized and raising concerns on the market that they were reducing their customer base effectively, because people were taking longer to upgrade, and we're getting scared by four figure price tags, they did introduce a baseline model in this new line up that's $50 cheaper than they had offered last year at you know, some $700.00 price tag.</p><p>And we saw this repeat throughout the event. They offered a cheaper iWatch than we've ever seen. They offered -- excuse me -- Apple Watch. They offer a cheaper TV subscription service and people were expecting at $4.99.</p><p>It seems as though Apple understands they have to play ball at the lower end of the market here in order to broaden their customer base. But that's coming instead of them putting through a breakthrough feature that would naturally attract new users.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I agree with you, an aggressive pricing strategy going on here, perhaps acknowledgment that the price rises that they've put through in the past year and with the iPhone X in particular, just aren't sustainable in this kind of market with softening sales here.</p><p>What do we make of the price of Apple Plus, of the streaming? It is half the price, even under of the likes of Netflix and Disney here, but you know, I look at the relative content that they provide. And that's dwarfed by anything Disney and Netflix can provide, so value or not value? What do we think, Seth?</p><p>FIEGERMAN: You know one analyst I saw yesterday described it a showstopper and I do think that's right. Now, it's going to still depend on how much you care to watch Jennifer Aniston in a morning news show.</p><p>That said I do think that Apple is willing to be aggressive here and put billions of dollars, which they're rumored to be doing towards premium original content, knowing that it can be a loss leader for them, and they can afford to charge less for this than a company like Netflix where that's their entire business. They are a threat in this marketplace.</p><p>[09:15:29]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I can tell you that morning news shows are the most thrilling thing on television. Obviously, you would want to sign up, obviously. Seth, thank you so much for that. Seth Fiegerman there.</p><p>FIEGERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right. Let me bring you up to speed with some of the other stories that we're following around the world. Scotland's highest Court of Appeals has ruled that the Prime Minister's suspension of British Parliament is unlawful.</p><p>Parliament has been prorogued or shut down for a total of five weeks and will return on October 14th. The government says it is disappointed by the legal decision that will appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court.</p><p>The body of Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe is expected to arrive back in his home country soon for burial. Earlier on Wednesday, a police motorcade in Singapore escorted the vehicle carrying his casket to the airport.

He is the Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at National Securities Corp. Art, always a pleasure to have you on.</p><p>ART HOGAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES CORP.: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's important that we remember this, for most people, whether they were here or watching around the world, it was a moment they will never forget.</p><p>HOGAN: Absolutely, it's hard to believe it was 18 years ago. I've worked in the World Trade Center, and you know, every time this date rolls around, it just feels like it was 10 minutes ago, so yes, it's always important to remember all of the good friends and the co-workers that we lost, and particularly, all the folks that had to rush into the fire and help save lives, and they continue to do so as their job every day.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I know and we remember them, too. So it's a great point, and they'll be ringing the opening bell as well today. Grief, lots of hugs today.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, indeed, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right. Let's talk about markets. What do you think of what's going on? I made the point on the show where one and a half percent of record highs in aggregate for these majors, but beneath the surface, the shift has going on.</p><p>HOGAN: It's unbelievable. It's such a good way to put it. When you think about that. The indexes has been very, very stable. And yet yesterday is a perfect example, S&amp;P 500 virtually unchanged, a hundred stocks were up two percent, a hundred stocks were down two percent.</p><p>So what you're seeing is all of the very loved names for almost all of 2019 getting sold, profit taking the momentum and defensive. And all of those unloved, the unwashed masses are getting sponsorship for the first time this year.</p><p>Hard to know how long that lasts. We've seen this happen about three times in the last two years. It's usually a trend that stops abruptly, but it started abruptly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's a temporary. It's been a temporary phenomenon when we've seen it.</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And what we're talking about is people selling out of some of the technology stocks getting back into things like energy and financials, tie it to interest rates for me, because I feel like we've turned blue in the face talking about lower and lower and lower yields bags the things like banks, concerns about recession risk, and then, we've also seen in the last two weeks or so is starting to see rates sort of coming off the lows again.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's all tied.</p><p>HOGAN: That's a really good point. I think that when you think about interest rates, the yield on that 10-year in August got very low, probably oversold, and I think that overshoot, bouncing back has sent a signal that, \"Hey, perhaps the worst is not going to happen in the near time.\"</p><p>So basically, an advance of about 22 basis points from 1.47 to 1.69, as of yesterday, and that's a pretty significant move, and it didn't yield on a 10-year. So that sends a signal to investors, like \"Hey, maybe we don't have to be in that safety, momentum and the safety of defensives. Maybe we can look at the stuff in the middle that hasn't had any sponsorship this year.\" And I think that's what's going on right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, I think we can tie it to a presidential tweet, basically saying that the trade talks are back on. A phantom phone call that we never really confirmed.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, that's right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: At that point, I saw some comments from you, and it was so important. You said you don't really care whether the phone call happened or it didn't. The point is the President is trying to facilitate trade talks progress, and that was sort of the message to the investors, too.</p><p>HOGAN: That's exactly right. I don't care if he makes this up. He wants to have trade talks. And I think that's what we are getting done.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Such a great point.</p><p>HOGAN: Right? And it really -- but it's also important to remember, we're only one tweet away from triumph or tragedy on trade at any point in time. I think right now we're leaning in the direction of both sides wanting to get something done. We saw more of that today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>HOGAN: There may be a mini deal over the next couple of weeks, working into a larger deal. But I don't think this is an administration that wants to carry this fight into the election cycle and that's coming upon us really quickly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And in the interim, Central Banks are providing support. We're expecting to get some announcements from the European Central Bank this week, which investors are waiting for. And then of course, the Federal Reserve, this week.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes. Mario Draghi has got a tough one here. So he has only eight days left or so, and I mean, a couple of weeks left of his eight-year tenure. And what's interesting is, does he really trying to swing for the fences as his last central policy move? Or is he going to do the usual Mario Draghi, \"Hey, you know what? We'll do whatever it takes, but not today.\"</p><p>And my guess is, it is going to be more disappointing that it is because he has really backed himself in a corner on this one. In July 25th, he said, we're going to be doing a lot. But he has done this before. He said, \"Well, we're already doing a lot, but not just yet.\" And then we passes this along to his predecessors.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The next -- yes, the next --</p><p>HOGAN: Yes. There you go.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Christine Legarde.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, indeed.</p><p>[09:25:34]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Good luck with that. Do you think he perhaps announced this bond buying because he says, \"Look, we will start at some point in the future.\"</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Because that's kind of the midway point between the two? More stimulus is coming, just not yet.</p><p>HOGAN: Just not yet, and that feels like very Mario Draghi-ish, right? It's like, yes, we're definitely here. We're going to do whatever it takes -- next week. And I think that's exactly --</p><p>But I think the markets have gotten ahead of it. There's also an expectation both in the magnitude of quantitative easing that's announced and the magnitude of how negative they go on their rates.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, in the absence perhaps of leadership from politicians hereto. Very quickly. Fed, quarter point cut next week given. Do they do more?</p><p>HOGAN: They want to do more, I don't think they should do the quarter point, but that they're kind of they are in that place where that's exactly where they go.</p><p>There's too much going on for them to do nothing, but there's too many people out there maybe that don't want them to do 50 basis points for them to make the most. So we're talking 25 basis points now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Now, you're committed.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, that's it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Get on with it.</p><p>HOGAN: Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Next. Art Hogan, great to have you with us.</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you so much.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: As always. Art Hogan, the Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at National Securities Corp. there. We are counting down to the market open this Wednesday. Plenty more to come here on the show, including our latest \"Crypto Crazy\" segment, too. So stick around. We'll be back after this with the market open.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. That was the opening bell this Wednesday. Officials from the New York Police and Fire Departments here in New York ringing the opening bell in honor of the fallen heroes of September the 11th.</p><p>As we begin, a somber day of trading here at the New York Stock Exchange. We've got mostly higher open for stocks. The Dow on track for its sixth straight winning session. China also helping the mood, as we were discussing earlier on in the show, lifting tariffs on some U.S. goods for the first time in fact since the trade war. So an unprecedented step. A signal? Perhaps ahead of fresh talks next month.</p><p>Bond yields, as we were discussing with Art Hogan, also in focus. The 10- year breaking above 1.7 percent here. We also had the wholesale inflation numbers out for the United States today, core inflation rising a hotter than expected 0.4 percent last month, but still below the Fed's two percent year-over-year target. No problem there if the Federal Reserve wants to find an excuse not to cut rates. It wasn't in those numbers.</p><p>All right. Let me give you a look at the global movers. The London Stock Exchange trading up six percent right now after Hong Kong Exchanges made a $39 billion bid. The merger is aimed to quote \"redefine global capital markets.\" Tough choices here for the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>GE also in focus. The company giving up majority control of the oil services firm, Baker Hughes. GE will raise nearly $3 billion as a result, but it's likely to cost $7 billion in accounting charges.</p><p>Apple also in focus here trading higher as investors trying to unpick the fruits of its new products. The tech giant says they are relying on its new iPhone 11. The smartphone sales continue to slow. Now, there's no question that Apple launches are a big deal. There's always buzz, too, around a new iPhone back in 2007 though. Remember that? The original iPhone launch, I have to say, it did feel way more exciting. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's been out here for two days. She has been out here for three days, and these two over here, they've been out here for four days and counting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Touch screen.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The touch screen is cool.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it's cool.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What about the entertainment stuff because I hear --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like, iPod, yes, you could listen to music, you can watch YouTube, that's cool.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some people say only a loser would sit and wait in line. What do you say to them?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I say to them, \"Go to hell or come sit here with the rest of us.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): For all the hype, analysts stress Apple is a long way from becoming a smartphone seller.</p><p>IAN FOGG, ANALYST: It will take Apple a while for this to be a mass volume product. Apple have sold millions of iPods. Nokia have sold hundreds of millions of mobile phones.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): But it's the buzz surrounding the iPod that gives Apple so much hope that customers will be willing to upgrade their music players and ditch their old phone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We remember those days done. Dan Ives, analyst at WedBush Securities joins us now. This is clearly not the same excitement when we see a new iPhone launch. I mean, there were people there queuing for three or four days. What did you make of this latest announcement though because this is Apple getting aggressive on pricing -- relatively aggressive.</p><p>DAN IVES, ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: This is cooked in Cupertino, taken off the gloves and aggressively going after Netflix, Disney and other streaming players. $4. 99 was a massive aggressive price. In our opinion, it was a game changer for them to really go after share. We think 100 million consumers in the next three to four years is now with the goalpost.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's interesting. So iPhone prices aside, you're going straight in for the streaming $4.99 for Apple Plus. You know, I get it. I know it's cheap relative to Netflix and Amazon Prime, they are video offerings, too. But then I look at the content library of Amazon, of Disney, of Netflix and I go Apple may have the financial firepower, but it doesn't have the content. Really?</p><p>IVES: That's a good question. That's the missing piece of the puzzle and maybe this is just the first step toward ultimately what I think is going to be a larger acquisition of a studio for Apple. So I view from a content perspective, they're aggressively stepping up content, or again, it go to $6 billion to $7 billion a year.</p><p>But I do believe a larger studio, a Sony and MGM could be potentially in the mix as they go forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And so pricing here of $4.99 is smart because you go, \"What? What's $5.00? Add it in.\" And they basically continue to build the ecosystem here.</p><p>IVES: And it's the install base. That's the golden jewel, 900 million active iPhones. That's what the cooks in Cupertino are going after.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Tell me about the message is from the pricing now on iPhone 11 on some of the repricing, lower as well by $250.00 on some of the older models and they're not that old. You know? We are only you talking 2017 iPhone models? What's the message that Apple is sending here and is this this the way to try and build out, recapture market share in places like China?</p><p>[09:35:23]</p><p>IVES: Significant move by Apple. I think now is really the headline. It's them cutting prices, showing that they do a bit pricing hubris last year with the XR, swung and miss. It's going after China's 60 to 70 million iPhones in a window of an upgrade opportunity. That was an aggressive move, and it shows a change of tune in Cupertino.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, I've seen some analysts coming out and saying, \"Look, they already still have to pay a premium -- Chinese consumers -- if they want to buy the iPhone.\" Even with these price drops, you're talking between 10 percent and 12 percent on the iPhone 11, up to 23 percent on the Pro in the Pro Max for iPhone 11 is enough, it's is enough of a cut.</p><p>IVES: But it's a premium phone. Is Blue Yard going to cut their prices $200.00 a bag? So it just comes down to what they're doing on iPhone. It's a premium pricing, but this price cut does signal what they needed to do. And that's why China, given what you're seeing there, competition- wise, this was an important move. And I continue the overall -- a step in the right direction for Apple in terms of yesterday.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Particularly given the upgrade cycle and you keep talking about this. There's so many iPhone users out there that are getting into that window where they could potentially upgrade. They're being induced to do so.</p><p>IVES: A third off that install base in a window of an upgrade opportunity. That's why you buy the stock here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ha-ha-ha. So talk me through it because I was just saying just a few moments ago that actually the stocks barely budged as a result of this announcement. What are the investors seeing? Or is it just the case that we've made what? Forty percent gains over the last 12 months?</p><p>IVES: Yes. It's a digestion process. I think for the next step, they need to prove that you you'll see the managed cycle that's going to increase rather than decreases, ensure that services they come on with price, that's going to be the one-two punch to see a stock with new highs.</p><p>Also the tariffs. It's a $20.00 to $25.00 overhang on the stock as Apple continues to be the poster child of the U.S.-China trade war.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And this is key. You said, you were one of the first analysts to come out and actually quantify what you thought the impact would be of the additional tariffs and we've seen a few of them suspended, some of them will kick in in December. You were like, \"Look, this is going to have a material impact.\" And that is still overhanging Apple.</p><p>IVES: Tariffs happen on December 15th.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>IVES: It could potentially cut EPS about four to five percent. That's why right now, if tariffs ease $20.00 to $25.00, it will be overhang in the stock.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you're willing to gamble and say, \"Look, hang on in there, there's still value in the stock, even if that potentially kicks in in December.\"</p><p>IVES: Some of the parts and services $400 billion to $450 billion in upgrade cycle in my opinion, we're still pounding the table in Apple.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Don't panic. Amazon, the news this morning that reportedly the FTC is talking to individual sellers trying to understand if Amazon is abusing their marketplace.</p><p>We keep coming back to this and I've lost count of the number of investigations now that are going on for all of these big players. Do we need to be worried today? Or is this again years before we see action?</p><p>IVES: I think it's more of a political grandstanding going on. Barks worse than bite. I've seen it with Microsoft. I think, ultimately, it results in fines rather than business model tweaks where buyers are in any weakness here and I continue to think here, it's fines not any sort of business model changes. That's what the Street cares about.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No one is being broken up.</p><p>IVES: No.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nice. There are regulators and politicians in D.C. right now screaming. Great to have you on.</p><p>IVES: No, thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Dan Ives of WedBush Securities there. All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE. But coming up, full speed ahead to the Frankfurt Auto Show. We will take a look at what's putting the brakes on the auto industry. Stay with CNN.</p><p>[09:42:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the FIRST MOVE. The Frankfurt Auto Show kicked off in glamorous style. We've already seen the first electric Porsche, a hybrid Lamborghini and a brand new logo for Volkswagen, but one of the shiny new cars certainly take the spotlight as the threats lurking in the shadows that may also steal the show.</p><p>Anna Stewart is in Frankfurt, who better to send to a glamorous location, our intrepid reporter. Anna, talk us through it. It sounds like a tough gig.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, I mean, lots of shine and sparkle. You'll see the new Porsche Tycan all-electric vehicle behind me. But you're right, you pop open the hood in this sector, and you see all sorts of problems. Lots and lots of headwinds. German car production in decline. And this contributes five percent of German GDP. So it's a really big problem.</p><p>Now, from all the gloomy reports we've had this week from German economists, it looks like Germany is already in recession. So going through those headwinds. U.S.-China trade war, CO2 emissions regulations. Those are getting much, much tougher for the automakers to reach.</p><p>And then, of course, Brexit and that is really the heaven that looms very large at the moment, potentially, of course, at the end of next month if the Prime Minister of the U.K. gets his own way. Possibly a no deal.</p><p>And speaking to the Head of the German Automakers Association, they say that they are really worried about this. A no-deal Brexit will be absolutely dire. It's already having a hit on car production and exports. So I asked, what is he doing? Is he lobbying the German government? Is he trying to get a softer stance on Irish backstop? Here is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNHARD MATTES, PRESIDENT, GERMAN ASSOCIATION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY: We have a clear position and we have made this very clear to the Chancellor and the whole government here in Germany. Clearly, we do want to have a Brexit, the orderly Brexit based on a deal with good framework for our trade and for business on one hand.</p><p>On the other hand, we need to have the 27 remain as a market and unified because at the end, if we invite others to also leave the E.U., that will be even worse for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: He says that all the German carmakers are as ready as they can be for a potential hard Brexit and that actually echo comments we heard from the Chancellor, Angela Merkel this morning speaking to Parliament and she says they're going to do everything they can to reach a deal with the U.K., right up to the very last minute, but they are ready for a disorderly Brexit -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's just painful. I remember we spoke to the Aston Martin CEO recently. And he said, look for them, actually, Brexit has already happened. They've seen the detrimental effect. They've had to make changes. They've had to stockpile. It's a nightmare for these guys.</p><p>Interesting, though, to your point as well about what we're seeing in terms of the German economy itself. What are these guys saying about demand in the German economy and the outlook here? Because to your point to, there are fears that actually, the economy there is already in recession.</p><p>STEWART: Yes, and it's interesting, because if you look at the auto sector, it is in decline globally. You know, last year was the first year of global car sales actually declining since 2009. So this isn't just a German issue, but of course, it contributes so much the German economy.</p><p>[09:45:09]</p><p>STEWART: So it has heightened fears here. I think a lot of the car makers at the moment are most concerned with how much money they're putting into electric investments, how much they're going to settle on. You just look at this Porsche. How many people will actually buy? This is the problem.</p><p>First of this year, 90 percent of car sales all around the world was still combustion engines, people aren't buying electric. And car makers say it's the government's fault. The infrastructure isn't there. They've got these regulations they're trying to meet. They're investing billions. But if the infrastructure isn't there, customers simply will not buy them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point, investing for a future that's uncertain at a time when actually you probably need to be drawing your horns in. Anna Stewart, great, great story. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. We're going to take a quick break, but coming up, a crypto pioneer, who is making it as easy as ABC to get into Bitcoin. Meet the 30- year-old CEO of an exciting startup called, Lolli.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX ADELMAN, CEO, LOLLI: We've never been so connected, as we have with Bitcoin, like the internet connected us all socially. And then Bitcoin came in and connected us all through commerce.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: Crypto Crazy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If you've wanted to get into cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin for example, with minimal effort, I want to share one way of building some crypto savings with very little investment. Lolli -- it's like a shopper's loyalty rewards plan.</p><p>It lives as a browser extension and kicks in when you use a partner store. You pay for goods in dollars and get rewards back in Bitcoin. It's only available in the United States for now, but Lolli's co-founder, Alex Adelman told me it's an easy introduction for crypto newbies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADELMAN: The interesting thing about Lolli is that it turns every one, anyone who shops which is everybody into an investor in this scarce asset. So there's only 21 million Bitcoin and there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.</p><p>And a lot of people, I would say less than one percent of the world would consider themselves an investor. What Lolli does is it takes a shopper and it gives them the ability to get into Bitcoin without having to invest in it.</p><p>So if a consumer was to go on an exchange to buy Bitcoin, it would take a week, maybe more to go sign up, invest their hard-earned money, and then actually accumulate Bitcoin.</p><p>What we do is we take every single purchase that you make, and we let you earn Bitcoin when you make those purchases.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: For me, the key here is accessibility. Suddenly to someone who reads about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, hears about it, but just things I have no idea what's going on there. It perhaps starts to get them comfortable with the idea of owning a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and getting comfortable with maybe transferring it to dollars, maybe spending it if the retailer accepts Bitcoin, is that right? That's what you were trying to achieve here.</p><p>[09:50:03]</p><p>ADELMAN: Yes. So, Lolli makes it extremely easy and Lolli makes Bitcoin accessible to everybody.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you making money doing what you're doing right now?</p><p>ADELMAN: Yes. So our business model is very simple, and we make money from day one. And we make money when our user makes money. And so everyone is mutually benefiting in this business model.</p><p>So the merchants, when our users shop at our different merchant sites, the merchants pay us in U.S. dollars, and then we send that in Bitcoin to their Lolli wallet. So we take a portion of that. The merchants are paying us.</p><p>So one thing I like to think about is what everyone is optimizing for in exchange it is optimizing for you transferring Bitcoin to potentially other cryptocurrencies. We're optimizing to just share Bitcoin with everybody, and so everybody wins. It's a flywheel effect.</p><p>The consumer wins because they're earning Bitcoin, the merchant wins, because they are getting new customers that maybe would have shopped elsewhere. And then we win, because we're, you know, the middleware, that's like sharing Bitcoin with everybody and helping the merchants earn.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How many of the people that are doing this, are already comfortable with cryptocurrency versus people that are just learning new and then go on to accept perhaps more cryptocurrency as they continue to shop?</p><p>ADELMAN: So that's a great question, because a lot of what we're doing is we're trying to introduce new people into Bitcoin.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>ADELMAN: And into this space. So when we first started, it was a lot of Bitcoin maximalist, people who already had Bitcoin that wanted more. And it was almost entirely that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>ADELMAN: As we've continued to grow, we found that those people can finally share an application with their friends and their family for them to earn Bitcoin. So what we found is we're nearing 50 percent of our users are now new to Bitcoin, which is really, really exciting.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. So it is an on ramp, basically, to cryptocurrency use.</p><p>ADELMAN: Yes. And we're just getting started, so everyone can get in really, really early. We launched a year ago, and so we just started. We have almost a thousand merchant partners, and we have tens of thousands of users that are earning Bitcoin every day on their everyday purchases.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, one of the consistent push backs I hear is that Bitcoin, like other cryptocurrencies has been used for various nefarious activities, which has tarnished the brand to some degree. I asked Alex, whether there a specter of regulation is needed and necessary to keep the crypto craze under control and give it credibility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADELMAN: Regulators can work with it. And I think that regulation will come.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>ADELMAN: To make sure that people use it responsibly. And I want to be held accountable for being a company that uses it responsibly. I don't -- I just don't think that it needs -- Bitcoin itself does not need regulation. It just is.</p><p>Everyone in the entire world can see the source code, can see what it was - - how it was created, and so everyone can agree that it has value and that it is this like cryptographically secure like asset that everyone can own.</p><p>Regulators can actually look at it and say, \"Okay, I can either work with it or I can work against it.\" And the regulators that work against it, I think will be penalized, whereas the ones that work with it, it will increase economic activity. It will connect the entire world through commerce, and that is what makes it so powerful.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What does the future look like for Lolli? Talk to me about your plans? Expansion plans? What you're working on right now.</p><p>ADELMAN: So we've just started work on a mobile app, and that mobile app is going to let everybody earn so easily and on daily purchases. Right now, you can earn on all online purchases with about a thousand merchants all across the U.S.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>ADELMAN: Part of our expansion is going into mobile. And so you can have that that web wallet and your mobile wallet, and you can earn on daily purchases going and getting your coffee all the way to your flight for work or your office supplies whatever -- we want every single purchase to drive attention to Bitcoin and for you to be able to earn on everything similar two points.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is anyone else doing this?</p><p>ADELMAN: Not as well as us. We're the first and I'm biased, but I think we're the best.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You're pretty sure that you can continue to grow and not be challenged by any upcoming competitors?</p><p>ADELMAN: Well, I think our team -- so I started this with my old co- founder. We've been working together, his name is Matt Senter. We've been working together for about eight years now, and we reassembled our old team.</p><p>Our old team was acquired by eBay. It's the biggest cashback company in the U.S. and so we know the space I think better than most people and you know, we stay humble. We understand that competitors can come out. Incumbents can come in.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Amazon? MasterCard? I think these kind of people have an incentive to do something like this, too. Would they be a threat or you think you've got better technology and a better head start?</p><p>ADELMAN: I think we have a really good head start. Incumbents can come in. I think the more people that come in, the better because the tide rises all ships.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>ADELMAN: And because we're the first, I think we've created a really solid community and brand around Lolli that I think we will rise with them. I personally -- like I'm talking with MasterCard, I'm talking with Visa. I'm talking with Amazon. We want to work with all of these partners because it makes Lolli stronger.</p><p>[09:55:08]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you open to being bought?</p><p>ADELMAN: Not right now. Yes, I mean, I want to be here, IPO and I want to ring the bell with you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Really?</p><p>ADELMAN: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Really?</p><p>ADELMAN: Let's do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, the Lolli CEO there. Now we do have President Trump at the Pentagon this morning for a Memorial for September the 11th.</p><p>Speaking right now, he is being introduced by the Pentagon Secretary Mark Esper. We've also got the Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford there, an observance ceremony at the Pentagon Memorial, and we are of course 18 years after the Defense Building was attacked by terrorists on September the 11th.</p><p>We're going to see a name reading, plus remarks and a wreath laying ceremony. In fact, President Trump just being introduced as you can see him shaking hands there with the Pentagon Secretary. Let's listen in to what he has to say.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much, Secretary Esper. Today, our nation honors and mourns the nearly 3,000 lives that were stolen from us on September 11, 2001. On these grounds, 184 people were murdered when al Qaeda terrorists overtook American Airlines Flight 77 and crashed it into the Pentagon.</p><p>For every American to live through that day, the September 11th attack is seared into our soul. It was a day filled with shock, horror, sorrow, and righteous fury.</p><p>I vividly remember when I first heard the news. I was sitting at home watching a major business television show early that morning. Jack Welch, the legendary head of General Electric was about to be interviewed, when all of a sudden, they cut away.</p><p>At first, there were different reports. It was a boiler fire. But I knew that boilers aren't at the top of a building. It was a kitchen explosion in Windows on the World. Nobody really knew what happened. There was great confusion.</p><p>I was looking out of a window from a building at Midtown Manhattan directly at the World Trade Center. When I saw a second plane, at a tremendous speed go into the second tower. It was then that I realized the world was going to change.</p><p>I was no longer going to be and it could never ever be that innocent place that I felt that it was. Soon after I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could. We were not alone.</p><p>So many others were scattered around, trying to do the same. They were all trying to help. But for the families who join us, this is your anniversary of personal and permanent loss.</p><p>It is the day that has replayed in your memory a thousand times over, the last kiss, the last phone call, the last time hearing those precious words, \"I love you.\" Then the attack.</p><p>The anguish of knowing your family member had boarded one of these flights or was working in the World Trade Center or serving right here at the Pentagon.</p><p>You waited, you prayed, you answered that most dreaded call, and your life changed forever.</p><p>To each of you, the First Lady and I are united with you in grief. We come here in the knowledge that we cannot erase the pain or reverse the evil of that dark and wretched day.</p><p>But we offer you all that we have -- our unwavering loyalty, our undying devotion, and our eternal pledge that your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.</p><p>Eighteen years ago, the terrorists struck this citadel of power and American strength. But the enemy soon learned that they could not weaken the spirit of our people.</p><p>In times of distress, the heart of the American Patriot only grows stronger and more today determined. Even in the midst of the attack, the world witnessed the awesome power of American defiance.</p><p>[10:00:10]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019091101cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1M-81B1-JB20-G3SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Happy Friday.  The top  stories tonight, Wall Street crushed.  The stock market suffered a second  straight day of steep losses as establishment Red RINOs and Dems in  Congress went on a $1.3 trillion spending spree abandoning all restraint in  fiscal policy and the Federal Reserve doing its part to confound reason and  create more uncertainty by raising rates with no evidence of inflation.   Today's losses capping what was the worst week on Wall Street in more than  two years.  It was simply put, a bloodbath.  President Trump hesitated but  then did sign the spending bill to assure the largest funding in history  for our military and to avoid a government shutdown.  But President Trump  vows never again will he sign such a reckless and undisciplined spending  bill written by Ryan, and McConnell, and Schumer, and Pelosi ignoring the  Republican majority altogether.</p><p>Joining us tonight to examine the collapse of a fiscal and monetary policy  in the same week, one of the top economists in the country Moody's John  Lonski, Ed Rollins, one of the country's best political analyst.  Also  tonight, Facebook's feckless CEO Mark Zuckerberg will have to do more than  mumble unintelligibly to the media.  Facebook -- unintelligibly.  Facebook  is in crisis and its so-called leaders turn out to be mostly inept and  irresponsible.  We'll have a lot more from Mr. Zuckerberg here tonight.   Lawmakers of both parties in the House and Senate are no longer asking  Zuckerberg to testify.  They're ordering to come to Capitol Hill and to  explain his lack of leadership, integrity, and the disastrous policies that  lead to the mess that is now Facebook.</p><p>Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright, our Deirdre Bolton on what issue to be  a regime of regulation about to descend on Silicon Valley, technology,  social media in general.  We take all of that up here tonight.  Our top  story, President Trump says the never-ending cycle of budget brinkmanship  in the swamp ends today.  President Trump signed the $1.3 trillion spending  bill needed to keep the government running for the next six months, but not  before blasting lawmakers for wasting money on pet projects giving  themselves a raise playing politics with DACA recipients, lying about wall  funding, and endangering the U.S. military.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There are a lot of things  that I'm unhappy about in this bill.  There are a lot of things that we  shouldn't have had in this bill, but we were in a sense forced if we want  to build our military, we were forced to have.  There are some things that  we should have in the bill.  But I say to Congress, I will never sign  another bill like this again.  I'm not going to do it again.  Nobody read  it.  It's only hours old.  Some people don't even know what is in there,  $1.3 trillion.  It's the second largest ever.  President Obama signed one  that was actually larger which I'm sure he wasn't too happy with either.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Joining us tonight the best political mind in the business Ed  Rollins, former Reagan White House Political Director, Fox Business  Political Analyst, John Lonski, chief economist, Managing Director at  Moody's.  Great to have you both here and let me begin if I may, John, with  you.  Fourteen hundred points off the Dow.  It was a crushing trillion  dollar loss for the week and it is a direct result it seems to me for the  most of part a direct result of a fiscal policy that has just been  overturned.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MOODY:  That's a problem on the interest  rate front.  That's why we have a long-term bond yields of about a quarter  of a percentage point higher then where they ought to be at this point in  time and we don't want to forget about the problems we're having with  international trade.  Worry about a possible trade war with China.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  But markets hate uncertainty and if one thing these investors  should have been certain about, it was about the president who had told  them for two years that he was going to put punishing tariffs on China  particularly, on our trading partners who have taken advantage of us for 50  years.  I mean most people don't realize, for example, that the United  States hasn't run a trade surplus since 1975.  We have idiots at the  Chamber of Commerce and The Business Roundtable going around saying it's  not a zero sum game.  Tell that to the American people.  Tell that to the  American middle class bulk.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.  And that's why Donald Trump is president today and let's not  forget that one of the reasons for these actions taken against China is  because China engages in unfair trade practices.  I mean China --</p><p>DOBBS:  And they steal our technology.  They steal our most of advanced  innovations and they do so with front companies.  They're carrying out  daily 24/7 espionage against the United States with those front companies  in the United States.</p><p>LONSKI:  But we have a very close linkage with China.  Let's not forget.   Many U.S. companies manufacture their goods.  High technology,  telecommunication devices are manufactured in China for U.S. companies to  sell in the United States.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  And that's one of the biggest problems and that's one of the  big problems that this president intends to reverse.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, he has -- I applauded that in  fact.  He threatened a veto today.  He should have threatened a veto a  month ago and the reality is, you know, political system does not work when  it comes to budgets.  When you put four --</p><p>DOBBS:  But now you got scoreless dogs leading the Republican Party in both  Houses.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  But when you put four people in the room and two of them -- two  of them are the Democrat leaders in both sides -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  We've got the greatest political analyst in the country here.  I've  got to ask you.  How -- and I've got to believe every American who's paying  attention is wondering the same thing.  How in the hell does a party that  has -- the Republican Party with a majority in the Senate, the majority in  the House.  How the hell do they end up conferring with the two leading  Democrats and ignoring their entire conference?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, they shouldn't and they should be removed as leaders.  I  think Ryan's performance was unbelievable that fact that he would get in  the room 24 hours before was -- and make these deals with Pelosi.  As you  said last night, when Pelosi says it's a great robust bill and we blocked  all the Trump's priorities, I mean that got to be the greatest indictment  of all to the leadership.</p><p>DOBBS:  Here's another indictment.  When Paul Ryan says it's a great piece  of legislation, you know it the same -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  It's not a great piece of legislation.  It's a half a trillion  dollar increase in the debt.  And it's just -- and I think the president if  you're reading is serious about what he said today.  He's got to get  Mulvaney in the budget process.  This is only -- we're halfway into a new  fiscal year and we haven't begun that process.  We just -- we're six months  late in the budget and it's an atrocious budget.  It was trillion dollar  deficits from now for the foreseeable future. </p><p>DOBBS:  Trillion dollar deficits from now on folks, remember that number.   We're now back in trillion dollar deficits.  And we just added a trillion  to the national debt in the last six months.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.  Unfortunately, the Chinese bought a trillion dollars -- they  hold a trillion dollars' worth of U.S. government debt.  We need their  support.  But on the other hand of course if the Chinese threatened to  reduce their holdings of U.S Treasury and sell them to push --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  They going to reduced their holdings by about 10 percent.</p><p>LONSKI:  If they use this as part of a trade was strategy, the Federal  Reserve can respond in kind by adopting (INAUDIBLE) just buying the  treasuries and existing yields that the Chinese want to sell.  Why not?  </p><p>DOBBS:  And people don't want to acknowledge this but that four and a half  trillion dollars that the Fed put on the balance sheet and, Ed, is looking  at me like, what has this got to do with politics?  But the fact the matter  is they are setting here raising the rate for the repayment of that debt  when they recycle it off of -- cycle it off of the balance sheet.  They are  also and under -- we're under no obligation to sell our treasuries to the  Chinese.  That's a benefit for them, not for us.  We can gin up enough  money in perpetuity.  We've done it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  The next generation is going to pay a very heavy price on these  deficits getting politically active and neither party owns them and my  sense is the party that gives them a formula of how we're going to be  fiscally responsible is going to become the majority party.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why don't we send out McConnell and Ryan to every college  campus and have them recruit those millennials, what do you think?</p><p>ROLLINS:  We'll lose -- we'll lose overwhelming the support and we need --  we need to be -- we need to be fiscally sound.  We need to basically  convince these young people that there is a plan for them for the future  because what's going to happen is the interest on this debt is going to  become the biggest item in the budget in a very short order, and it's going  to take away lots of options for them and whatever the tax cuts we made  short-term will basically be offset by other additional things that they  have --</p><p>DOBBS:  Do you think the president meant when he said, never again?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, I hope so.  This is a big -- this is a big warning and I  hope -- I hope the -- he's going to be active all the way through and  Mulvaney has going to be very active all the way through this, the OMB  Director.</p><p>LONSKI:  Who is going vote to cut spending at the federal level?  Who's  going to vote to raise the retirement age and so on or reduce the  entitlements to the federal government --</p><p>DOBBS:  Did you say raise the retirement age?</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.  Well, they're going to have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LONSKI:  They're still working.  But I'm saying for the millennials, you  know, you could say that 25 years from now the retirement age might be 68  and going up to 70 since we do live longer.  At least that's been the case.</p><p>DOBBS:  So for -- we can vote --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Messaging for the Republican Party.  You're living longer, so you  should work harder.</p><p>LONSKI:  Well, that's the point and they can't -- they will not deliver  that political message if they want to stay in office and --</p><p>DOBBS:  One thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  These young people are going to find their -- it's their parents  that are going to be suffering, so you can't -- you can't cut it for them  but you have to have to have some strategic thought processes about where  we go 10 years --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  I'm sorry.  OK.</p><p>LONSKI:  Term the limits.  I mean that's basically what you're going to  need in Washington -</p><p>DOBBS:  Term limits?  You mean what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Paul Ryan won't be able to stay in office for 25 years.  McConnell  three and a half decade.</p><p>LONSKI:  That may not be a bad idea.  That maybe the only solution.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I think those term limits have some interesting appeal and  broadening of feel I'm sure.  Interest rates, why is it we have to give on  the job training to every Fed chairman whether he or she is just steps in  and they're new.  They get to raise rates and see what happens to an  economy in which there's no inflation and then we have to watch the little  dance that follows.  We're in the dance part now for Jerome Powell.  </p><p>LONSKI:  I think where the problem, you know, with the Federal Reserve is a  lot of people that provide information to the Fed Chairman are very  theoretically oriented economist.  OK.  They sit in their office by, you  know, computer all day long looking at numbers doing this, that, and yet  they do statistical analysis.  They have no connection with reality  whatsoever.  Look what happens during the housing crisis.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  And it's -- and it looks like it's a little like politics,  isn't it?  I mean who's advising Ryan, and McConnell, and Schumer, and  Pelosi?  Do they adviser? </p><p>ROLLINS:  They're about three staffers on the Hill that know what was in  the 2000 page bill and there's not a single member in the House and Senate  who voted for it had any clue what was in that bill.  That's irresponsible.</p><p>DOBBS:  But \"60 minutes\" is going to break this wide open.  The issues  collapsing fiscal policy and monetary policy simultaneously.  I understand  they got a whole segment on it.  It's called \"storm field.\"  What?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  High journalists.  Ed Rollins, John Lonski, thank you both.   Appreciate it.  Up next, lawmakers zeroing in on the zuck demanding answers  from Facebook over its absolute breach of public trust.  Deirdre Bolton,  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright joins us here next to take up the  fiasco, the crisis, the disaster for Facebook and soon Silicon Valley, and  big tech.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The Justice Department charged Iranian hackers in connection with a  mass of state-sponsored cyber-attack that targeted more than 140 American  universities.  The indictment charges the defendants was stealing more than  31 terabytes of academic date, intellectual property worth we're told  somewhere around $3 billion.  My guess is it's multiples of that.  The  Justice Department says all nine hackers are still in Iran.  They're  somewhat like Russian hackers.  They don't seem to be extraditable.  Well,  calls for embattle Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress  are growing more numerous and louder.  Both the Senate Commerce and House  Energy Commerce Committees today formally asking Zuckerberg to appear on  Capitol Hill.</p><p>Zuckerberg said he's open to testifying as he put it so quaintly and cutely  only if he is the correct person at Facebook to do so.  Only if he's the  correct person, how precious of the zuck?  Joining us tonight cybersecurity  expert Morgan Wright, Fox Business Correspondent Deirdre Bolton.  Great to  have you both here.  Deirdre, he waits five days to open his mouth and then  he says nothing, doesn't even apologize.  He has to do that day two of the  non-apology.  He and Sheryl Sandberg who is supposed to be this all big  time executive, these are two of the biggest losers I've ever seen at the  top of a company.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  So Lou, they make you feel  better that he lost about $10 million.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Not a bit.</p><p>BOLTON:  Not a bit?</p><p>DOBBS:  I really think is it the most appalling executive conduct I have  seen that the top two officials of any company in crisis --</p><p>BOLTON:  So one analyst that I speak with a lot who has a cell on the stock  said, you know, I never really thought I was going to have to question the  management of Facebook.  This week has really changed for me because really  this data breach let's call it with Cambridge Analytica was sort of the  second big strike for Facebook.  The first one of course being in the run  up to our presidential election.  More than half of the U.S. voting  population saw an ad that was either created by or manipulated by Russian  bots.  So we're --</p><p>DOBBS:  The only proved collaboration with the Russians belongs -- that  honor belongs to two companies, one is Facebook and the other is Twitter.   And by the way, I think issue number one was the 2012 election in which  Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and Facebook got behind the candidacy of Barack  Obama.  They took sides then and nobody said a word.</p><p>BOLTON:  Nobody said a word.  At this point though, their credibility as  business leaders is being questioned.  So it's in some ways a business  problem aside from an ethical problem as well.  But at this point they need  to hire more engineers.  They need to hire more humans that is going to eat  into their profit margins.  But I think at this point they must do it.  To  answer your point, he's going to go to Capitol Hill.  The New York A.G. has  started an investigation.  The Massachusetts A.G., there are two class  action lawsuits, one from users and one from investors.  So --</p><p>DOBBS:  This is early days.  </p><p>BOLTON:  This is early days.  So they have a big problem.</p><p>DOBBS:  This is -- Morgan, I want to bring you in now and you can tell us  what in the world would any company be thinking?  And I have to say to  folks that, you know, I think that it's probably -- we can find several  other examples of just heinously cowardly management.  But right now in  this moment Facebook is what's terrible.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Well, look, Lou, now, one thing I  will tell you.  From a security, just from a pure security standpoint  Facebook actually does an excellent job where they're failing it's -- they  can't engineer their way out of this.  This is a policy and a governance  issue and stealing with the privacy of our information, what other policies  and how do we enforce that?  What we've got is we've got a neophyte  organization.  By the way, it wasn't exactly a fair fight during the, you  know, during the election, we've got a Russian country that has 100 years  of influence operations but we've got the technical capability and where  was our own government sharing information, so we can prevent this  information of going on.  So technically, they're good.  But they suffer  big time because it's not about the technology.  It's about the policy and  governance and they failed on the privacy.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They failed on privacy, they failed on security, they failed on  integrity, they failed on basic courage that is required of any great  business leader.  Zuckerberg looks terrible here, Morgan.  You can't defend  that.  There's no way to rationalize it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  That's why leave the political conversation to you and Deirdre,  you know, I'm trying to stay on the technical side because you guys are far  more experienced than I am.  But I will tell you -- but I will tell you  absolutely, it doesn't matter what you engineer, you can engineer the best  thing in the world, and look, and Department of Defense one time, they've  engineered what was called total information awareness, Admiral Poindexter,  great program that's down to the Department of Justice at that time doing  some work on information sharing.  We thought it was the greatest thing.   Guess what?  It was great technology.  They couldn't solve the privacy  issues.  The ACLU came in and that program was killed off because of  privacy. </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's another technical issue here and I'd like you both to  address this and that is the users' data that is awash on the web as a  result to Facebook and it's whether you call them technical issues,  integrity issues, security issues.  The reality is those users' have  information that is being used for purposes never agreed to nor  contemplated.  And the fact is, Facebook was aware of that.  And this  business, Cambridge Analytica, come on third-party users, who's using what.   This just -- this is just one example of how this template got out of  control.</p><p>BOLTON:  One think I would like to remind people though, if you're not  paying for a service, you are the product, right?</p><p>DOBBS:  So said Steve Jobs.</p><p>BOLTON:  Right.  So you have --</p><p>DOBBS:  I think it's one of those great --</p><p>BOLTON:  People just have to remember --</p><p>DOBBS:  There aren't many analogs in business for -- if you're not paying  for a product, you're the product.  This is straight out.  A responsible --  I mean think about this, Morgan, and explain it to us.  How in the world  can Zuckerberg or any one of the Facebook folks sit there and say, you  know, we just couldn't manage this issue.  We're such clever innovators and  first movers that we just had to adjust to that.  They knew they had a  problem in 2016 during the election with the Russian agents and still  didn't move forward.  As a matter of fact, they were -- they were attacking  conservative groups, censoring conservative groups, and continuing to say  they really need, and Zuckerberg is dreaming of being president.  And they  weren't not even close to doing the responsible thing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Well, look, Lou, to build on what Deirdre was saying and you were  saying.  I don't know people notice but, you know, Facebook collects 48  separate data points about you everything from what you RSVP, what you  like, and it's part of a discipline called persuasive technology.  It's the  whole -- and it was created at Stanford actually.  Instagram was the first  students that created technology out of this.  It's designed to manipulate  people and it's not just Facebook.  It's done with online gaming.  </p><p>It's done with advertising.  So this persuasive technology, the more I know  about you, I get past demographic into what's called psychographic  information, what you do, what you're like, your attitude, and values, I  can now whole scale, upscale manipulate people.</p><p>DOBBS:  But I don't think we should go too far beyond that.  It's  psychographic.  And there are entire disciplines of psychometrics gauging  who you are, what you are, measuring it, and then deciding how they're  going to influence your future decision making and they are creating from  those profiles that maybe your friends or in the case of Facebook, people's  friends were being co-opted into the buckets of information by the  millions, and their influencing decision making.  And there is not even a  discussion in this country about it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  One thing I would just add and I'm not trying to defend anybody in  this.  But let me just state, the U.S. spends $50.3 billion a year on  national intelligence program.  So we have a program called the domestic  security council.  Where was your own government with all the information?   It was laid out in 2015 by a reporter in the U.K. about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You do not know where our government was?  Let me help you.   Morgan, you should know this.  16 agencies came together and made a  decision about collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians and  they've ignored everything that was happening in the electoral process at  the DNC for eight months.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Exactly, my point.  And we give them $50.3 billion to find the  obvious and they didn't.  But yet we want to throw it all onto the back of  tech companies and not just Facebook and Twitter but a lot of the other  folks out there, I think first, we've got to do a better job from a  government standpoint of using our money widely to defend our  infrastructure and our information systems. </p><p>DOBBS:  OK.  Very quickly.  It's got to be regulated and it's got to be  regulated by the government.  This nonsense of the wild frontier in Silicon  Valley is done as of now.  Would you not agree, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  They put themselves in this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WRIGHT:  No, no.  But I'll tell you.  From a regulatory standpoint, it's no  different than the way they dealt with cigarettes and its addictive  technology.  This is definitely addictive.  It's got to have some  intervention.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You get the last word.</p><p>BOLTON:  Again a hundred percent on board.  I think, yes, Zuckerberg in  front of Congress answering questions in front of subcommittees, yes, this  is a new page.</p><p>DOBBS:  But only, Deirdre, only if he's the right person.  He's merely the  CEO with all of those billions of dollars --</p><p>WRIGHT:  I'll take his 10 billion and testify.  </p><p>BOLTON:  There you go.  The 10 million he lose this week.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Let me negotiate that for you if a usual --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Your fee, yes.  </p><p>DOBBS:  A fee.  Morgan, thanks so much.  Deirdre, thanks so much.   Appreciate it.  Be sure to vote in our poll tonight.  The question is, do  you believe RINOs and Dems in Congress are incapable of creating a spending  bill that doesn't just simply blow up fiscal policy?  We'd like to hear  from you.  You're your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  Follow me on Twitter  @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbs Tonight.   On Wall Street, stocks selling off for the second straight session.  The  Dow plunging 425 point.  The S&amp;P down 55.  The Nasdaq dropping 174.  Volume  on the Big Board, 3.8 billion shares.  But that one is really child's play.  </p><p>For the week, stocks closing the worst week in more than two years.  The  Dow down more than 5 percent.  The S&amp;P down 6 percent and the Nasdaq  posting a loss of six and a half percent of the week.  Bye-bye more than a  trillion dollars.  The wish -- the Wilshire 5000, those losses, market cap  amount to for the week $1.8 trillion.  That's what we call a tough week.  A  reminder, listen to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the  Salem Radio Network.  Up next, President Trump blasting the Dems and the  RINOs in Congress for loading up an omnibus spending bill with just about  everything but the sink.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The last time we negotiated something like this and as you know  it's always been a problem for our country.  They get together and they  create a series of documents that nobody has been able to read because it  was just done.  You tell me who can read that quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  And who bothers to read after all.  A full report on the backlash  to the -- to the extraordinary amazing, awesome leadership of Paul Ryan and  Mitch McConnell.  We salute them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Coming up next, President Trump making moves on gun safety.  You  can bet the national left wing national media won't give him credit for.   We'll take up the bump stock ban, the Justice Department actually doing  something, they're moving ahead.  And they announced it late this  afternoon.  We'll take it up with our panel, Gina Loudon, Dom Giordano,  joining us right after these words.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The Justice Department taking action, announcing it's begun the  process to ban bump stocks.  The Department of Justice now amending federal  firearms regulations to clarify bump stocks fall into the technical  definition of machine gun.  President Trump today tweeted this, \"The Obama  administration legalized bump stocks.  Bad idea.  As I promised today, the  Department of Justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a  mandated comment period.  </p><p>We will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"   Good idea.  I added the good idea.  Joining me now, Gina Loudon, Political  Analyst, member of President's Trump Media Advisory Board, radio talk show  host, Dom Giordano.  Great to have you both with us.  Gina, I mean, this is  bump stocks.  What in the world was anybody in the Obama administration  thinking?  It's such a silly idea, Gina.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, DONALD J. TRUMP MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD:  It was such  silly Idea, but you see, the thing about is just, Lou, the people on the  left seem to never be interested in what works.  They don't want to deal  with data, they don't want to deal with research.  They wanted just to do  something that feels good.  They want to ban things that look scary instead  of actually worrying about what will save lives.  And for me, as a person  who has relied on data and research my whole life as a psychology  professional, I look at what actually works to help people.  And that's  where we need to start.  That's the conversation that we need to have.  I'm  very glad that our President certainly seems to want to have those  conversations as well.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dom, what do you think?</p><p>DOM GIORDANO, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, Lou, I think this is another  example of the real upside of President Trump is making a promise and then  following through and checking it off and then doing a good job, I think,  despite the media, at getting the word out that he's doing that, as we're  talking about right now.  And he's done this consistently on issue after  issue, after issue.  And that's why the base recognizes that and they're  still supportive.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And this idea of bump stocks, I got to tell you, I know a thing or  two about guns but I had never heard of a bump stock before Las Vegas.  I  mean, I really had never heard of it.  It makes no sense.  It is  ridiculous.  It has nothing to do, to me, with anything necessary for  defense or for sport.  It's just a nonsensical idea and as the President  points out, it does moves the semi-automatic weapons into the category of  machine gun with the rate of fire.  So, now, now let's see how long it  takes the idiots to try to take away handguns, rifles and shotguns.   Because you know, as Gina was alluding to, that's going to be the play.   Because there's no question that the left means to roll back our second  amendment rights in this country, period.</p><p>LOUDON:  But we need to be consistent.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Well, right.  And that's what the march -- that's what the march  is going to be about tomorrow, Lou.  As you know, I'm an educator and I see  these kids, the Parkland kids, a couple of them are out of control.</p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't that disgusting?  We're tuning in to high school assemblies.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  The aggregated wisdom of 18-year-olds.  I mean, this is really --</p><p>LOUDON:  Who by their own words, Lou, say that they shouldn't be able to  own guns even though they can go to war but they think that they should be  able to make laws.  I mean, none of this makes any sense at all.  And the  very fact, that we are giving such gravitas to people who just -- they  haven't had enough life experience yet, Lou, to be experts on much of  anything yet.  And I don't think, it's not insulting them to say that.  I  have children.  I respect them.  I love them.  I think my children are  brilliant but Lou, I'm not going to put them in charge of public policy as  opposed to somebody who study this their whole entire life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, George Clooney is.  I mean, we can just step aside.  And, you  know, it's -- we can't even get test scores rising in this country yet  we're watching two teachers unions move children into the street to pursue  their political aims.  I mean, it is outrageous what they're doing.  (INAUDIBLE) You get that question.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Well, exactly.  And as Gina just said, these are nuance  complicated issues where people studied the policy, they're actually  knowledgeable about this things.  And I have to say too, Lou, as an  educator, there's a couple of these kids that are just rude in the way that  they proceed here, as if they are bullet proof, so to speak, by -- the  media is almost wondering (INAUDIBLE) in to this kids.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's find another noun next time.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Well, I caught myself to that, but Lou, a couple of these kids  are legitimate, they're sincere about remembering their colleagues and all  that.  A couple of the others had just got and an almost (INAUDIBLE) this  media presence.</p><p>DOBBS:  Exploited.  No doubt about it.</p><p>LOUDON:  But Lou -- but Lou, they're not covering, I live here -- this is  where I live.  They're not covering the children like my children who go to  school close by where this happened and my children don't agree with these  students doing this march.  And where is the attention on them?  They come  to me in social media, I'm sure they've come to both of you too, because  they do understand our constitution and our bill of rights and our second  amendment.  And they want to make sure it's protected for their future.   But they're not listening to them, Lou.  They're only listening to the  radical -- more radical children who have a totally one-way slant.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Or they just happened to have parent who work with the teacher's  union or whatever.  </p><p>Here, let's turn to Facebook, because speaking of young people whose minds  are being really dramatically irresponsibly, in my opinion, managed by  these psychographic driven, algorithms and propositions on the technology  of Facebook and other social media.  This has really got to stop, Dom.  It  really does, it's got be regulated and it's got to happen now.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Lou, I would agree.  It's not just Facebook, it's Google, it's  all this other enterprises.  The amount of power, this is different.  And  that's why we haven't caught up with it.  And I think, you've been making a  great point early on about this.  This is not just economic power, this is  a power to actually influence our lives, somewhat in the deepest levels,  particularly with millennials and others that engage in this all day long.</p><p>DOBBS:  And particularly children -- and particularly children, Gina.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>LOUDON:  Yes, listen, if you want to use my information, let's make a deal.   Guys, I am all about the free market, Lou.  So, if they want to use my  data, how about they pay me for my data.  How about I'm a partner in the  things that I buy on Facebook and other places.  And there are ways to do  this where the disclosure is in place, people understand what they're  giving away and the free market --</p><p>DOBBS:  But even with that -- but even with that, Gina, the way in which  Facebook and other social media particularly are influencing children with  their -- with their business model, with their content is irresponsible, it  has to end now.  And if Congress doesn't move on this immediately, I can't  imagine that they won't even I mean within days.</p><p>LOUDON:  You're right and Lou, there are deeper darker consequences as  well.  The amount of depression is in children, especially because their  brains are a little bit less developed, the emotional senses of their  brain.  The amount of depression is directly relative to how much time they  spend with their face in that screen, Lou.  That's something nobody is  talking about right now.  It's a great concern, I'm sure -- I'm sure that  the teacher here knows all about this.  It's a great concern (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIORDANO:  Lou, what I was going to say is, this idea of Zuckerberg  testifying, again, we need people in Congress that are more fluent with  these things, you know --</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we need those people too.  But I want to see Zuckerberg  explaining to the American people, to Congress and to the Senate and to the  President what the hell he and his company have been doing and take  responsibility instead of doing that unintelligible blabber mumble jumble  that he has so far, treated the press to.  Dom Giordano, Gina Loudon, thank  you both for being here.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>LOUDON:  Thanks, Lou </p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you both.  Up next, RINO's Ryan and McConnell abandoning  conservatives.  Well they're doing more than that.  They're trying to back  the pickup over them and they've sold out to the Chamber of Commerce and,  well, every local U.S. multinational they can find.  We take that up.  And  the national left wing media mocking members of the Trump administration  over their faith.  I take that up with Pastor Robert Jeffers, here next.   Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump today declaring he will never again sign a budget  bill like the budget busting ominous spending bill.  President Trump with  curios veto threat and then grudgingly signed that spending bill.  He  called it a ridiculous situation.  Fox News Chief Congressional  Correspondent, Mike Emanuel, with the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We looked at the veto, I  looked very seriously at the veto.  I was thinking about doing the veto.   But because of the incredible gains that we've been able to make for the  military, that overrode any of our -- any of our thinking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Late night last  night on the Senate floor lawmakers voted 65-32 to approve the package and  sent it to President Trump for his signature.  Like the President, many who  supported it backed it for the additional $60 billion devoted to rebuilding  the military.  Today some Democrats blasted the President for being  inconsistent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA:  We've grown used to just complete  unpredictability.  So, you know, and then who knows what he'll do an hour  from now.  But I do know this.  This is a good deal.  It's a classic  compromise.  There are things I really like.  There were things I wish were  in the bill.  I wish that the dreamer deal that we put on the table for the  President, that he would have accepted it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Now there's plenty of blame game between the two parties over  which side could not get to the yes on the so-called dreamers.  Young  people brought this country illegally by their parents.  A key Democrat  challenged the President's ability to cut an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D), MARYLAND:  You've got a President that claims  he's the great negotiator, the art of the deal.  Where was he when the deal  was being made?  You know, wakes up the next day and says he wants  something different.  He's actually one of the worst negotiators I've ever  seen.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Part of the President's frustration is with the rules of the  Senate and the fact, 49 Democrats had a lot of leverage.  Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell has resisted calls to change the Senate filibuster rules.   Recognizing one day, the GOP will be the minority party again.  A veteran  Republican says there is merit to changing the budget process here in  Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHNNY ISAKSON (R) GEORGIA:  I'd rather see something like, I'll never  sign one of these again, so, from now and now, let's do appropriations  right or let's, you know, talk it out.  That's what we ought to be thinking  about the future, not trying to recreate the past.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  With the bill signed the threat of the government shutdown is  gone for at least six months, Lou?  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we'll take every six month we get.  Thank you Emanuel, thank  you.</p><p>Up next, the national left wing national media's on holy war against the  Trump administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Occasionally you bow the  head and bend the knee.  I encourage you to do that.  I'm someone that  believes that prayer changes things, so pray for America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  We're praying.  We'll take up the White House under fire for its  faith.  Pastor Robert Jeffress, our guest here next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Two members of the national left wing national media forced to  apologize for attacking the Trump administration and their faith.  \"MSNBC\"  host, Stephanie Ruhle, now says she meant no offense after she mocked Larry  Kudlow's faith.  And Joy Behar who is always just right near the very  essence of contrition publicly apologized for mocking Vice President  Pence's Christians faith.  Joining us tonight, Robert Jeffress Pastor of  the First Baptist Church in Dallas, a Fox Business contributor.  Great to  see you Pastor.  And I wanted to --  I wanted -- just I have never heard so  many people attacking Christians on whatever level.  What is -- there seems  to be just an insistence thing that they do so.</p><p>DR. ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, isn't that true?  And  isn't it also true that if Joy Behar or Stephanie Ruhle had attacked a  Muslim for their faith, they would have been fired by their networks in a  nanosecond.  But it's always open season on conservative Christians by the  media.  But let me tell you what's going on here, Lou.  </p><p>The reason this is happening is liberals know that conservative Christians  are the last speed bump on the road to the godless immoral society that  liberals dream of and that is exactly why they're attacking them.  And  isn't it ironic that it took a secular billionaire businessman from New  York City named Donald J. Trump to recognize that marginalization of  Christianity that was going on, he spoke up about it.  And got elected by  the largest margin of the evangelicals in history, that's the reason they  support him so much.</p><p>DOBBS:  And, you know, he spoke up about it, he spoke up early and he spoke  up alone on the campaign trail, talking about the persecution of Christians  around the world.  And to see the left do this, \"MSNBC\" going after, what's  her name, Ruhle, going after Larry Kudlow who worked at \"CNBC\", a sister  network.  I mean, there's not even a kinship in media.  How low have we  fallen?</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Well, that's right, Lou.  And they both have this in common, the  personalities you mentioned, Larry as well as Vice President Pence, they  claim that their faith has changed them -- has changed them.  And that, you  know, that's what we're declaring this Sunday night in our 'March for  Eternal Life'.  We're going to have thousands of people marching through  the streets of downtown Dallas carrying a giant illuminating cross saying  it is the gospel of Jesus Christ that can change people's heart.  And look,  you talked earlier about the march for your life rallies tomorrow for gun  control legislation.</p><p>DOBBS:  I'm not talking about them -- I'm not talking about them, I don't  care about them.  Let them be, if you're going to march a bunch of children  through the streets of the country, that's their business.  If they don't  find that exploitive and if they don't find that demeaning and graceless,  you know, that's their problem.  But I don't have to pay attention to them. </p><p>JEFFRESS:  But what we're saying is --  </p><p>DOBBS:  Unless you tell me to and then I'll pay attention.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  No, sir -- no, sir -- no, sir.  What I am saying though is look,  trying to depend upon legislation alone to end the violence epidemic is  like putting a band aid on a cancer.  It doesn't deal with the heart issue  and we're talking about what the heart issue is and that is our  relationship to Christ.  So, this is a positive way of saying we're not  ashamed of our faith.  We want to proclaim it. </p><p>DOBBS:  And you know, I think, marches and demonstrations and people  actually talking about Jesus Christ are wonderful things and we don't do  enough of it -- we don't do enough of it on television, we don't do enough  of it on radio, we don't do enough of it in the streets of Dallas or any  other community in this country.  And it's a wonderful thing you're doing.   I truly commend you and the good folks in Dallas.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Well, thank you very much.  And we invite people to tune in.   It's going to be live streamed.  And again, this is a new day in America, I  believe, Lou.  And we thank President Trump for creating a new atmosphere  where people feel emboldened to share their faith.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, emboldened to share their faith.  You know, I like the  words.  I guess I resist just a little thinking what we have to be bold to  share our faith.  But it is necessary to be bold, I believe, in this day  and age where there is so much oppression of the Christian faith here at  home and indeed around the world.  But always lifting us up is Pastor  Robert Jeffress.  And we thank you for so doing and share sharing your time  with us, Pastor.  Thank you so much.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Thank you Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  And have a great march.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for joining us.  Ann  Coulter, General Jack Keane among our guests here at Monday.  It makes the  weekend well, just worthwhile just to know we're going to have all of that  waiting for you on Monday.  Have a great weekend.  Thanks for being with us  tonight.  Good night from New York.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Happy Friday. The top stories tonight, Wall Street crushed. The stock market suffered a second straight day of steep losses as establishment Red RINOs and Dems in Congress went on a $1.3 trillion spending spree abandoning all restraint in fiscal policy and the Federal Reserve doing its part to confound reason and create more uncertainty by raising rates with no evidence of inflation. Today's losses capping what was the worst week on Wall Street in more than two years. It was simply put, a bloodbath. President Trump hesitated but then did sign the spending bill to assure the largest funding in history for our military and to avoid a government shutdown. But President Trump vows never again will he sign such a reckless and undisciplined spending bill written by Ryan, and McConnell, and Schumer, and Pelosi ignoring the Republican majority altogether.</p><p>Joining us tonight to examine the collapse of a fiscal and monetary policy in the same week, one of the top economists in the country Moody's John Lonski, Ed Rollins, one of the country's best political analyst. Also tonight, Facebook's feckless CEO Mark Zuckerberg will have to do more than mumble unintelligibly to the media. Facebook -- unintelligibly. Facebook is in crisis and its so-called leaders turn out to be mostly inept and irresponsible. We'll have a lot more from Mr. Zuckerberg here tonight. Lawmakers of both parties in the House and Senate are no longer asking Zuckerberg to testify. They're ordering to come to Capitol Hill and to explain his lack of leadership, integrity, and the disastrous policies that lead to the mess that is now Facebook.</p><p>Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright, our Deirdre Bolton on what issue to be a regime of regulation about to descend on Silicon Valley, technology, social media in general. We take all of that up here tonight. Our top story, President Trump says the never-ending cycle of budget brinkmanship in the swamp ends today. President Trump signed the $1.3 trillion spending bill needed to keep the government running for the next six months, but not before blasting lawmakers for wasting money on pet projects giving themselves a raise playing politics with DACA recipients, lying about wall funding, and endangering the U.S. military.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things that we shouldn't have had in this bill, but we were in a sense forced if we want to build our military, we were forced to have. There are some things that we should have in the bill. But I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what is in there, $1.3 trillion. It's the second largest ever. President Obama signed one that was actually larger which I'm sure he wasn't too happy with either.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight the best political mind in the business Ed Rollins, former Reagan White House Political Director, Fox Business Political Analyst, John Lonski, chief economist, Managing Director at Moody's. Great to have you both here and let me begin if I may, John, with you. Fourteen hundred points off the Dow. It was a crushing trillion dollar loss for the week and it is a direct result it seems to me for the most of part a direct result of a fiscal policy that has just been overturned.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MOODY: That's a problem on the interest rate front. That's why we have a long-term bond yields of about a quarter of a percentage point higher then where they ought to be at this point in time and we don't want to forget about the problems we're having with international trade. Worry about a possible trade war with China.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. But markets hate uncertainty and if one thing these investors should have been certain about, it was about the president who had told them for two years that he was going to put punishing tariffs on China particularly, on our trading partners who have taken advantage of us for 50 years. I mean most people don't realize, for example, that the United States hasn't run a trade surplus since 1975. We have idiots at the Chamber of Commerce and The Business Roundtable going around saying it's not a zero sum game. Tell that to the American people. Tell that to the American middle class bulk.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes. And that's why Donald Trump is president today and let's not forget that one of the reasons for these actions taken against China is because China engages in unfair trade practices. I mean China --</p><p>DOBBS: And they steal our technology. They steal our most of advanced innovations and they do so with front companies. They're carrying out daily 24/7 espionage against the United States with those front companies in the United States.</p><p>LONSKI: But we have a very close linkage with China. Let's not forget. Many U.S. companies manufacture their goods. High technology, telecommunication devices are manufactured in China for U.S. companies to sell in the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. And that's one of the biggest problems and that's one of the big problems that this president intends to reverse.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he has -- I applauded that in fact. He threatened a veto today. He should have threatened a veto a month ago and the reality is, you know, political system does not work when it comes to budgets. When you put four --</p><p>DOBBS: But now you got scoreless dogs leading the Republican Party in both Houses.</p><p>ROLLINS: But when you put four people in the room and two of them -- two of them are the Democrat leaders in both sides --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: We've got the greatest political analyst in the country here. I've got to ask you. How -- and I've got to believe every American who's paying attention is wondering the same thing. How in the hell does a party that has -- the Republican Party with a majority in the Senate, the majority in the House. How the hell do they end up conferring with the two leading Democrats and ignoring their entire conference?</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, they shouldn't and they should be removed as leaders. I think Ryan's performance was unbelievable that fact that he would get in the room 24 hours before was -- and make these deals with Pelosi. As you said last night, when Pelosi says it's a great robust bill and we blocked all the Trump's priorities, I mean that got to be the greatest indictment of all to the leadership.</p><p>DOBBS: Here's another indictment. When Paul Ryan says it's a great piece of legislation, you know it the same --</p><p>ROLLINS: It's not a great piece of legislation. It's a half a trillion dollar increase in the debt. And it's just -- and I think the president if you're reading is serious about what he said today. He's got to get Mulvaney in the budget process. This is only -- we're halfway into a new fiscal year and we haven't begun that process. We just -- we're six months late in the budget and it's an atrocious budget. It was trillion dollar deficits from now for the foreseeable future.</p><p>DOBBS: Trillion dollar deficits from now on folks, remember that number. We're now back in trillion dollar deficits. And we just added a trillion to the national debt in the last six months.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes. Unfortunately, the Chinese bought a trillion dollars -- they hold a trillion dollars' worth of U.S. government debt. We need their support. But on the other hand of course if the Chinese threatened to reduce their holdings of U.S Treasury and sell them to push --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: They going to reduced their holdings by about 10 percent.</p><p>LONSKI: If they use this as part of a trade was strategy, the Federal Reserve can respond in kind by adopting (INAUDIBLE) just buying the treasuries and existing yields that the Chinese want to sell. Why not?</p><p>DOBBS: And people don't want to acknowledge this but that four and a half trillion dollars that the Fed put on the balance sheet and, Ed, is looking at me like, what has this got to do with politics? But the fact the matter is they are setting here raising the rate for the repayment of that debt when they recycle it off of -- cycle it off of the balance sheet. They are also and under -- we're under no obligation to sell our treasuries to the Chinese. That's a benefit for them, not for us. We can gin up enough money in perpetuity. We've done it.</p><p>ROLLINS: The next generation is going to pay a very heavy price on these deficits getting politically active and neither party owns them and my sense is the party that gives them a formula of how we're going to be fiscally responsible is going to become the majority party.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, why don't we send out McConnell and Ryan to every college campus and have them recruit those millennials, what do you think?</p><p>ROLLINS: We'll lose -- we'll lose overwhelming the support and we need -- we need to be -- we need to be fiscally sound. We need to basically convince these young people that there is a plan for them for the future because what's going to happen is the interest on this debt is going to become the biggest item in the budget in a very short order, and it's going to take away lots of options for them and whatever the tax cuts we made short-term will basically be offset by other additional things that they have --</p><p>DOBBS: Do you think the president meant when he said, never again?</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, I hope so. This is a big -- this is a big warning and I hope -- I hope the -- he's going to be active all the way through and Mulvaney has going to be very active all the way through this, the OMB Director.</p><p>LONSKI: Who is going vote to cut spending at the federal level? Who's going to vote to raise the retirement age and so on or reduce the entitlements to the federal government --</p><p>DOBBS: Did you say raise the retirement age?</p><p>LONSKI: Yes. Well, they're going to have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LONSKI: They're still working. But I'm saying for the millennials, you know, you could say that 25 years from now the retirement age might be 68 and going up to 70 since we do live longer. At least that's been the case.</p><p>DOBBS: So for -- we can vote --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Messaging for the Republican Party. You're living longer, so you should work harder.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, that's the point and they can't -- they will not deliver that political message if they want to stay in office and --</p><p>DOBBS: One thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: These young people are going to find their -- it's their parents that are going to be suffering, so you can't -- you can't cut it for them but you have to have to have some strategic thought processes about where we go 10 years --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: I'm sorry. OK.</p><p>LONSKI: Term the limits. I mean that's basically what you're going to need in Washington -</p><p>DOBBS: Term limits? You mean what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Paul Ryan won't be able to stay in office for 25 years. McConnell three and a half decade.</p><p>LONSKI: That may not be a bad idea. That maybe the only solution.</p><p>DOBBS: I think those term limits have some interesting appeal and broadening of feel I'm sure. Interest rates, why is it we have to give on the job training to every Fed chairman whether he or she is just steps in and they're new. They get to raise rates and see what happens to an economy in which there's no inflation and then we have to watch the little dance that follows. We're in the dance part now for Jerome Powell.</p><p>LONSKI: I think where the problem, you know, with the Federal Reserve is a lot of people that provide information to the Fed Chairman are very theoretically oriented economist. OK. They sit in their office by, you know, computer all day long looking at numbers doing this, that, and yet they do statistical analysis. They have no connection with reality whatsoever. Look what happens during the housing crisis.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. And it's -- and it looks like it's a little like politics, isn't it? I mean who's advising Ryan, and McConnell, and Schumer, and Pelosi? Do they adviser?</p><p>ROLLINS: They're about three staffers on the Hill that know what was in the 2000 page bill and there's not a single member in the House and Senate who voted for it had any clue what was in that bill. That's irresponsible.</p><p>DOBBS: But \"60 minutes\" is going to break this wide open. The issues collapsing fiscal policy and monetary policy simultaneously. I understand they got a whole segment on it. It's called \"storm field.\" What?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: High journalists. Ed Rollins, John Lonski, thank you both. Appreciate it. Up next, lawmakers zeroing in on the zuck demanding answers from Facebook over its absolute breach of public trust. Deirdre Bolton, cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright joins us here next to take up the fiasco, the crisis, the disaster for Facebook and soon Silicon Valley, and big tech. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The Justice Department charged Iranian hackers in connection with a mass of state-sponsored cyber-attack that targeted more than 140 American universities. The indictment charges the defendants was stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic date, intellectual property worth we're told somewhere around $3 billion. My guess is it's multiples of that. The Justice Department says all nine hackers are still in Iran. They're somewhat like Russian hackers. They don't seem to be extraditable. Well, calls for embattle Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress are growing more numerous and louder. Both the Senate Commerce and House Energy Commerce Committees today formally asking Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Zuckerberg said he's open to testifying as he put it so quaintly and cutely only if he is the correct person at Facebook to do so. Only if he's the correct person, how precious of the zuck? Joining us tonight cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright, Fox Business Correspondent Deirdre Bolton. Great to have you both here. Deirdre, he waits five days to open his mouth and then he says nothing, doesn't even apologize. He has to do that day two of the non-apology. He and Sheryl Sandberg who is supposed to be this all big time executive, these are two of the biggest losers I've ever seen at the top of a company.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: So Lou, they make you feel better that he lost about $10 million.</p><p>DOBBS: Not a bit.</p><p>BOLTON: Not a bit?</p><p>DOBBS: I really think is it the most appalling executive conduct I have seen that the top two officials of any company in crisis --</p><p>BOLTON: So one analyst that I speak with a lot who has a cell on the stock said, you know, I never really thought I was going to have to question the management of Facebook. This week has really changed for me because really this data breach let's call it with Cambridge Analytica was sort of the second big strike for Facebook. The first one of course being in the run up to our presidential election. More than half of the U.S. voting population saw an ad that was either created by or manipulated by Russian bots. So we're --</p><p>DOBBS: The only proved collaboration with the Russians belongs -- that honor belongs to two companies, one is Facebook and the other is Twitter. And by the way, I think issue number one was the 2012 election in which Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and Facebook got behind the candidacy of Barack Obama. They took sides then and nobody said a word.</p><p>BOLTON: Nobody said a word. At this point though, their credibility as business leaders is being questioned. So it's in some ways a business problem aside from an ethical problem as well. But at this point they need to hire more engineers. They need to hire more humans that is going to eat into their profit margins. But I think at this point they must do it. To answer your point, he's going to go to Capitol Hill. The New York A.G. has started an investigation. The Massachusetts A.G., there are two class action lawsuits, one from users and one from investors. So --</p><p>DOBBS: This is early days.</p><p>BOLTON: This is early days. So they have a big problem.</p><p>DOBBS: This is -- Morgan, I want to bring you in now and you can tell us what in the world would any company be thinking? And I have to say to folks that, you know, I think that it's probably -- we can find several other examples of just heinously cowardly management. But right now in this moment Facebook is what's terrible.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT: Well, look, Lou, now, one thing I will tell you. From a security, just from a pure security standpoint Facebook actually does an excellent job where they're failing it's -- they can't engineer their way out of this. This is a policy and a governance issue and stealing with the privacy of our information, what other policies and how do we enforce that? What we've got is we've got a neophyte organization. By the way, it wasn't exactly a fair fight during the, you know, during the election, we've got a Russian country that has 100 years of influence operations but we've got the technical capability and where was our own government sharing information, so we can prevent this information of going on. So technically, they're good. But they suffer big time because it's not about the technology. It's about the policy and governance and they failed on the privacy.</p><p>DOBBS: They failed on privacy, they failed on security, they failed on integrity, they failed on basic courage that is required of any great business leader. Zuckerberg looks terrible here, Morgan. You can't defend that. There's no way to rationalize it.</p><p>WRIGHT: That's why leave the political conversation to you and Deirdre, you know, I'm trying to stay on the technical side because you guys are far more experienced than I am. But I will tell you -- but I will tell you absolutely, it doesn't matter what you engineer, you can engineer the best thing in the world, and look, and Department of Defense one time, they've engineered what was called total information awareness, Admiral Poindexter, great program that's down to the Department of Justice at that time doing some work on information sharing. We thought it was the greatest thing. Guess what? It was great technology. They couldn't solve the privacy issues. The ACLU came in and that program was killed off because of privacy.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, there's another technical issue here and I'd like you both to address this and that is the users' data that is awash on the web as a result to Facebook and it's whether you call them technical issues, integrity issues, security issues. The reality is those users' have information that is being used for purposes never agreed to nor contemplated. And the fact is, Facebook was aware of that. And this business, Cambridge Analytica, come on third-party users, who's using what. This just -- this is just one example of how this template got out of control.</p><p>BOLTON: One think I would like to remind people though, if you're not paying for a service, you are the product, right?</p><p>DOBBS: So said Steve Jobs.</p><p>BOLTON: Right. So you have --</p><p>DOBBS: I think it's one of those great --</p><p>BOLTON: People just have to remember --</p><p>DOBBS: There aren't many analogs in business for -- if you're not paying for a product, you're the product. This is straight out. A responsible -- I mean think about this, Morgan, and explain it to us. How in the world can Zuckerberg or any one of the Facebook folks sit there and say, you know, we just couldn't manage this issue. We're such clever innovators and first movers that we just had to adjust to that. They knew they had a problem in 2016 during the election with the Russian agents and still didn't move forward. As a matter of fact, they were -- they were attacking conservative groups, censoring conservative groups, and continuing to say they really need, and Zuckerberg is dreaming of being president. And they weren't not even close to doing the responsible thing.</p><p>WRIGHT: Well, look, Lou, to build on what Deirdre was saying and you were saying. I don't know people notice but, you know, Facebook collects 48 separate data points about you everything from what you RSVP, what you like, and it's part of a discipline called persuasive technology. It's the whole -- and it was created at Stanford actually. Instagram was the first students that created technology out of this. It's designed to manipulate people and it's not just Facebook. It's done with online gaming.</p><p>It's done with advertising. So this persuasive technology, the more I know about you, I get past demographic into what's called psychographic information, what you do, what you're like, your attitude, and values, I can now whole scale, upscale manipulate people.</p><p>DOBBS: But I don't think we should go too far beyond that. It's psychographic. And there are entire disciplines of psychometrics gauging who you are, what you are, measuring it, and then deciding how they're going to influence your future decision making and they are creating from those profiles that maybe your friends or in the case of Facebook, people's friends were being co-opted into the buckets of information by the millions, and their influencing decision making. And there is not even a discussion in this country about it.</p><p>WRIGHT: One thing I would just add and I'm not trying to defend anybody in this. But let me just state, the U.S. spends $50.3 billion a year on national intelligence program. So we have a program called the domestic security council. Where was your own government with all the information? It was laid out in 2015 by a reporter in the U.K. about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: You do not know where our government was? Let me help you. Morgan, you should know this. 16 agencies came together and made a decision about collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians and they've ignored everything that was happening in the electoral process at the DNC for eight months.</p><p>WRIGHT: Exactly, my point. And we give them $50.3 billion to find the obvious and they didn't. But yet we want to throw it all onto the back of tech companies and not just Facebook and Twitter but a lot of the other folks out there, I think first, we've got to do a better job from a government standpoint of using our money widely to defend our infrastructure and our information systems.</p><p>DOBBS: OK. Very quickly. It's got to be regulated and it's got to be regulated by the government. This nonsense of the wild frontier in Silicon Valley is done as of now. Would you not agree, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes. They put themselves in this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WRIGHT: No, no. But I'll tell you. From a regulatory standpoint, it's no different than the way they dealt with cigarettes and its addictive technology. This is definitely addictive. It's got to have some intervention.</p><p>DOBBS: You get the last word.</p><p>BOLTON: Again a hundred percent on board. I think, yes, Zuckerberg in front of Congress answering questions in front of subcommittees, yes, this is a new page.</p><p>DOBBS: But only, Deirdre, only if he's the right person. He's merely the CEO with all of those billions of dollars --</p><p>WRIGHT: I'll take his 10 billion and testify.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go. The 10 million he lose this week.</p><p>DOBBS: Let me negotiate that for you if a usual --</p><p>WRIGHT: Your fee, yes.</p><p>DOBBS: A fee. Morgan, thanks so much. Deirdre, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Be sure to vote in our poll tonight. The question is, do you believe RINOs and Dems in Congress are incapable of creating a spending bill that doesn't just simply blow up fiscal policy? We'd like to hear from you. You're your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs. Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbs Tonight. On Wall Street, stocks selling off for the second straight session. The Dow plunging 425 point. The S&amp;P down 55. The Nasdaq dropping 174. Volume on the Big Board, 3.8 billion shares. But that one is really child's play.</p><p>For the week, stocks closing the worst week in more than two years. The Dow down more than 5 percent. The S&amp;P down 6 percent and the Nasdaq posting a loss of six and a half percent of the week. Bye-bye more than a trillion dollars. The wish -- the Wilshire 5000, those losses, market cap amount to for the week $1.8 trillion. That's what we call a tough week. A reminder, listen to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network. Up next, President Trump blasting the Dems and the RINOs in Congress for loading up an omnibus spending bill with just about everything but the sink.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The last time we negotiated something like this and as you know it's always been a problem for our country. They get together and they create a series of documents that nobody has been able to read because it was just done. You tell me who can read that quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And who bothers to read after all. A full report on the backlash to the -- to the extraordinary amazing, awesome leadership of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. We salute them next.</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next, President Trump making moves on gun safety. You can bet the national left wing national media won't give him credit for. We'll take up the bump stock ban, the Justice Department actually doing something, they're moving ahead. And they announced it late this afternoon. We'll take it up with our panel, Gina Loudon, Dom Giordano, joining us right after these words.</p><p>DOBBS: The Justice Department taking action, announcing it's begun the process to ban bump stocks. The Department of Justice now amending federal firearms regulations to clarify bump stocks fall into the technical definition of machine gun. President Trump today tweeted this, \"The Obama administration legalized bump stocks. Bad idea. As I promised today, the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandated comment period.</p><p>We will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\" Good idea. I added the good idea. Joining me now, Gina Loudon, Political Analyst, member of President's Trump Media Advisory Board, radio talk show host, Dom Giordano. Great to have you both with us. Gina, I mean, this is bump stocks. What in the world was anybody in the Obama administration thinking? It's such a silly idea, Gina.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, DONALD J. TRUMP MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD: It was such silly Idea, but you see, the thing about is just, Lou, the people on the left seem to never be interested in what works. They don't want to deal with data, they don't want to deal with research. They wanted just to do something that feels good. They want to ban things that look scary instead of actually worrying about what will save lives. And for me, as a person who has relied on data and research my whole life as a psychology professional, I look at what actually works to help people. And that's where we need to start. That's the conversation that we need to have. I'm very glad that our President certainly seems to want to have those conversations as well.</p><p>DOBBS: Dom, what do you think?</p><p>DOM GIORDANO, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, Lou, I think this is another example of the real upside of President Trump is making a promise and then following through and checking it off and then doing a good job, I think, despite the media, at getting the word out that he's doing that, as we're talking about right now. And he's done this consistently on issue after issue, after issue. And that's why the base recognizes that and they're still supportive.</p><p>DOBBS: And this idea of bump stocks, I got to tell you, I know a thing or two about guns but I had never heard of a bump stock before Las Vegas. I mean, I really had never heard of it. It makes no sense. It is ridiculous. It has nothing to do, to me, with anything necessary for defense or for sport. It's just a nonsensical idea and as the President points out, it does moves the semi-automatic weapons into the category of machine gun with the rate of fire. So, now, now let's see how long it takes the idiots to try to take away handguns, rifles and shotguns. Because you know, as Gina was alluding to, that's going to be the play. Because there's no question that the left means to roll back our second amendment rights in this country, period.</p><p>LOUDON: But we need to be consistent.</p><p>GIORDANO: Well, right. And that's what the march -- that's what the march is going to be about tomorrow, Lou. As you know, I'm an educator and I see these kids, the Parkland kids, a couple of them are out of control.</p><p>DOBBS: Isn't that disgusting? We're tuning in to high school assemblies.</p><p>GIORDANO: Yes, that's right.</p><p>DOBBS: The aggregated wisdom of 18-year-olds. I mean, this is really --</p><p>LOUDON: Who by their own words, Lou, say that they shouldn't be able to own guns even though they can go to war but they think that they should be able to make laws. I mean, none of this makes any sense at all. And the very fact, that we are giving such gravitas to people who just -- they haven't had enough life experience yet, Lou, to be experts on much of anything yet. And I don't think, it's not insulting them to say that. I have children. I respect them. I love them. I think my children are brilliant but Lou, I'm not going to put them in charge of public policy as opposed to somebody who study this their whole entire life.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, George Clooney is. I mean, we can just step aside. And, you know, it's -- we can't even get test scores rising in this country yet we're watching two teachers unions move children into the street to pursue their political aims. I mean, it is outrageous what they're doing. (INAUDIBLE) You get that question.</p><p>GIORDANO: Well, exactly. And as Gina just said, these are nuance complicated issues where people studied the policy, they're actually knowledgeable about this things. And I have to say too, Lou, as an educator, there's a couple of these kids that are just rude in the way that they proceed here, as if they are bullet proof, so to speak, by -- the media is almost wondering (INAUDIBLE) in to this kids.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's find another noun next time.</p><p>GIORDANO: Well, I caught myself to that, but Lou, a couple of these kids are legitimate, they're sincere about remembering their colleagues and all that. A couple of the others had just got and an almost (INAUDIBLE) this media presence.</p><p>DOBBS: Exploited. No doubt about it.</p><p>LOUDON: But Lou -- but Lou, they're not covering, I live here -- this is where I live. They're not covering the children like my children who go to school close by where this happened and my children don't agree with these students doing this march. And where is the attention on them? They come to me in social media, I'm sure they've come to both of you too, because they do understand our constitution and our bill of rights and our second amendment. And they want to make sure it's protected for their future. But they're not listening to them, Lou. They're only listening to the radical -- more radical children who have a totally one-way slant.</p><p>DOBBS: Or they just happened to have parent who work with the teacher's union or whatever.</p><p>Here, let's turn to Facebook, because speaking of young people whose minds are being really dramatically irresponsibly, in my opinion, managed by these psychographic driven, algorithms and propositions on the technology of Facebook and other social media. This has really got to stop, Dom. It really does, it's got be regulated and it's got to happen now.</p><p>GIORDANO: Lou, I would agree. It's not just Facebook, it's Google, it's all this other enterprises. The amount of power, this is different. And that's why we haven't caught up with it. And I think, you've been making a great point early on about this. This is not just economic power, this is a power to actually influence our lives, somewhat in the deepest levels, particularly with millennials and others that engage in this all day long.</p><p>DOBBS: And particularly children -- and particularly children, Gina.</p><p>GIORDANO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>LOUDON: Yes, listen, if you want to use my information, let's make a deal. Guys, I am all about the free market, Lou. So, if they want to use my data, how about they pay me for my data. How about I'm a partner in the things that I buy on Facebook and other places. And there are ways to do this where the disclosure is in place, people understand what they're giving away and the free market --</p><p>DOBBS: But even with that -- but even with that, Gina, the way in which Facebook and other social media particularly are influencing children with their -- with their business model, with their content is irresponsible, it has to end now. And if Congress doesn't move on this immediately, I can't imagine that they won't even I mean within days.</p><p>LOUDON: You're right and Lou, there are deeper darker consequences as well. The amount of depression is in children, especially because their brains are a little bit less developed, the emotional senses of their brain. The amount of depression is directly relative to how much time they spend with their face in that screen, Lou. That's something nobody is talking about right now. It's a great concern, I'm sure -- I'm sure that the teacher here knows all about this. It's a great concern (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIORDANO: Lou, what I was going to say is, this idea of Zuckerberg testifying, again, we need people in Congress that are more fluent with these things, you know --</p><p>DOBBS: You know, we need those people too. But I want to see Zuckerberg explaining to the American people, to Congress and to the Senate and to the President what the hell he and his company have been doing and take responsibility instead of doing that unintelligible blabber mumble jumble that he has so far, treated the press to. Dom Giordano, Gina Loudon, thank you both for being here.</p><p>GIORDANO: Thank you very much.</p><p>LOUDON: Thanks, Lou</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you both. Up next, RINO's Ryan and McConnell abandoning conservatives. Well they're doing more than that. They're trying to back the pickup over them and they've sold out to the Chamber of Commerce and, well, every local U.S. multinational they can find. We take that up. And the national left wing media mocking members of the Trump administration over their faith. I take that up with Pastor Robert Jeffers, here next. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump today declaring he will never again sign a budget bill like the budget busting ominous spending bill. President Trump with curios veto threat and then grudgingly signed that spending bill. He called it a ridiculous situation. Fox News Chief Congressional Correspondent, Mike Emanuel, with the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We looked at the veto, I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto. But because of the incredible gains that we've been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our -- any of our thinking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Late night last night on the Senate floor lawmakers voted 65-32 to approve the package and sent it to President Trump for his signature. Like the President, many who supported it backed it for the additional $60 billion devoted to rebuilding the military. Today some Democrats blasted the President for being inconsistent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: We've grown used to just complete unpredictability. So, you know, and then who knows what he'll do an hour from now. But I do know this. This is a good deal. It's a classic compromise. There are things I really like. There were things I wish were in the bill. I wish that the dreamer deal that we put on the table for the President, that he would have accepted it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Now there's plenty of blame game between the two parties over which side could not get to the yes on the so-called dreamers. Young people brought this country illegally by their parents. A key Democrat challenged the President's ability to cut an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D), MARYLAND: You've got a President that claims he's the great negotiator, the art of the deal. Where was he when the deal was being made? You know, wakes up the next day and says he wants something different. He's actually one of the worst negotiators I've ever seen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Part of the President's frustration is with the rules of the Senate and the fact, 49 Democrats had a lot of leverage. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has resisted calls to change the Senate filibuster rules. Recognizing one day, the GOP will be the minority party again. A veteran Republican says there is merit to changing the budget process here in Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHNNY ISAKSON (R) GEORGIA: I'd rather see something like, I'll never sign one of these again, so, from now and now, let's do appropriations right or let's, you know, talk it out. That's what we ought to be thinking about the future, not trying to recreate the past.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: With the bill signed the threat of the government shutdown is gone for at least six months, Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, we'll take every six month we get. Thank you Emanuel, thank you.</p><p>Up next, the national left wing national media's on holy war against the Trump administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Occasionally you bow the head and bend the knee. I encourage you to do that. I'm someone that believes that prayer changes things, so pray for America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We're praying. We'll take up the White House under fire for its faith. Pastor Robert Jeffress, our guest here next. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Two members of the national left wing national media forced to apologize for attacking the Trump administration and their faith. \"MSNBC\" host, Stephanie Ruhle, now says she meant no offense after she mocked Larry Kudlow's faith. And Joy Behar who is always just right near the very essence of contrition publicly apologized for mocking Vice President Pence's Christians faith. Joining us tonight, Robert Jeffress Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, a Fox Business contributor. Great to see you Pastor. And I wanted to -- I wanted -- just I have never heard so many people attacking Christians on whatever level. What is -- there seems to be just an insistence thing that they do so.</p><p>DR. ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, isn't that true? And isn't it also true that if Joy Behar or Stephanie Ruhle had attacked a Muslim for their faith, they would have been fired by their networks in a nanosecond. But it's always open season on conservative Christians by the media. But let me tell you what's going on here, Lou.</p><p>The reason this is happening is liberals know that conservative Christians are the last speed bump on the road to the godless immoral society that liberals dream of and that is exactly why they're attacking them. And isn't it ironic that it took a secular billionaire businessman from New York City named Donald J. Trump to recognize that marginalization of Christianity that was going on, he spoke up about it. And got elected by the largest margin of the evangelicals in history, that's the reason they support him so much.</p><p>DOBBS: And, you know, he spoke up about it, he spoke up early and he spoke up alone on the campaign trail, talking about the persecution of Christians around the world. And to see the left do this, \"MSNBC\" going after, what's her name, Ruhle, going after Larry Kudlow who worked at \"CNBC\", a sister network. I mean, there's not even a kinship in media. How low have we fallen?</p><p>JEFFRESS: Well, that's right, Lou. And they both have this in common, the personalities you mentioned, Larry as well as Vice President Pence, they claim that their faith has changed them -- has changed them. And that, you know, that's what we're declaring this Sunday night in our 'March for Eternal Life'. We're going to have thousands of people marching through the streets of downtown Dallas carrying a giant illuminating cross saying it is the gospel of Jesus Christ that can change people's heart. And look, you talked earlier about the march for your life rallies tomorrow for gun control legislation.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm not talking about them -- I'm not talking about them, I don't care about them. Let them be, if you're going to march a bunch of children through the streets of the country, that's their business. If they don't find that exploitive and if they don't find that demeaning and graceless, you know, that's their problem. But I don't have to pay attention to them.</p><p>JEFFRESS: But what we're saying is --</p><p>DOBBS: Unless you tell me to and then I'll pay attention.</p><p>JEFFRESS: No, sir -- no, sir -- no, sir. What I am saying though is look, trying to depend upon legislation alone to end the violence epidemic is like putting a band aid on a cancer. It doesn't deal with the heart issue and we're talking about what the heart issue is and that is our relationship to Christ. So, this is a positive way of saying we're not ashamed of our faith. We want to proclaim it.</p><p>DOBBS: And you know, I think, marches and demonstrations and people actually talking about Jesus Christ are wonderful things and we don't do enough of it -- we don't do enough of it on television, we don't do enough of it on radio, we don't do enough of it in the streets of Dallas or any other community in this country. And it's a wonderful thing you're doing. I truly commend you and the good folks in Dallas.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Well, thank you very much. And we invite people to tune in. It's going to be live streamed. And again, this is a new day in America, I believe, Lou. And we thank President Trump for creating a new atmosphere where people feel emboldened to share their faith.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, emboldened to share their faith. You know, I like the words. I guess I resist just a little thinking what we have to be bold to share our faith. But it is necessary to be bold, I believe, in this day and age where there is so much oppression of the Christian faith here at home and indeed around the world. But always lifting us up is Pastor Robert Jeffress. And we thank you for so doing and share sharing your time with us, Pastor. Thank you so much.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Thank you Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And have a great march.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: That's it for us tonight. We thank you for joining us. Ann Coulter, General Jack Keane among our guests here at Monday. It makes the weekend well, just worthwhile just to know we're going to have all of that waiting for you on Monday. Have a great weekend. Thanks for being with us tonight. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Happy Friday.  The top  stories tonight, Wall Street crushed.  The stock market suffered a second  straight day of steep losses as establishment Red RINOs and Dems in  Congress went on a $1.3 trillion spending spree abandoning all restraint in  fiscal policy and the Federal Reserve doing its part to confound reason and  create more uncertainty by raising rates with no evidence of inflation.   Today's losses capping what was the worst week on Wall Street in more than  two years.  It was simply put, a bloodbath.  President Trump hesitated but  then did sign the spending bill to assure the largest funding in history  for our military and to avoid a government shutdown.  But President Trump  vows never again will he sign such a reckless and undisciplined spending  bill written by Ryan, and McConnell, and Schumer, and Pelosi ignoring the  Republican majority altogether.</p><p>Joining us tonight to examine the collapse of a fiscal and monetary policy  in the same week, one of the top economists in the country Moody's John  Lonski, Ed Rollins, one of the country's best political analyst.  Also  tonight, Facebook's feckless CEO Mark Zuckerberg will have to do more than  mumble unintelligibly to the media.  Facebook -- unintelligibly.  Facebook  is in crisis and its so-called leaders turn out to be mostly inept and  irresponsible.  We'll have a lot more from Mr. Zuckerberg here tonight.   Lawmakers of both parties in the House and Senate are no longer asking  Zuckerberg to testify.  They're ordering to come to Capitol Hill and to  explain his lack of leadership, integrity, and the disastrous policies that  lead to the mess that is now Facebook.</p><p>Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright, our Deirdre Bolton on what issue to be  a regime of regulation about to descend on Silicon Valley, technology,  social media in general.  We take all of that up here tonight.  Our top  story, President Trump says the never-ending cycle of budget brinkmanship  in the swamp ends today.  President Trump signed the $1.3 trillion spending  bill needed to keep the government running for the next six months, but not  before blasting lawmakers for wasting money on pet projects giving  themselves a raise playing politics with DACA recipients, lying about wall  funding, and endangering the U.S. military.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There are a lot of things  that I'm unhappy about in this bill.  There are a lot of things that we  shouldn't have had in this bill, but we were in a sense forced if we want  to build our military, we were forced to have.  There are some things that  we should have in the bill.  But I say to Congress, I will never sign  another bill like this again.  I'm not going to do it again.  Nobody read  it.  It's only hours old.  Some people don't even know what is in there,  $1.3 trillion.  It's the second largest ever.  President Obama signed one  that was actually larger which I'm sure he wasn't too happy with either.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Joining us tonight the best political mind in the business Ed  Rollins, former Reagan White House Political Director, Fox Business  Political Analyst, John Lonski, chief economist, Managing Director at  Moody's.  Great to have you both here and let me begin if I may, John, with  you.  Fourteen hundred points off the Dow.  It was a crushing trillion  dollar loss for the week and it is a direct result it seems to me for the  most of part a direct result of a fiscal policy that has just been  overturned.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MOODY:  That's a problem on the interest  rate front.  That's why we have a long-term bond yields of about a quarter  of a percentage point higher then where they ought to be at this point in  time and we don't want to forget about the problems we're having with  international trade.  Worry about a possible trade war with China.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  But markets hate uncertainty and if one thing these investors  should have been certain about, it was about the president who had told  them for two years that he was going to put punishing tariffs on China  particularly, on our trading partners who have taken advantage of us for 50  years.  I mean most people don't realize, for example, that the United  States hasn't run a trade surplus since 1975.  We have idiots at the  Chamber of Commerce and The Business Roundtable going around saying it's  not a zero sum game.  Tell that to the American people.  Tell that to the  American middle class bulk.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.  And that's why Donald Trump is president today and let's not  forget that one of the reasons for these actions taken against China is  because China engages in unfair trade practices.  I mean China --</p><p>DOBBS:  And they steal our technology.  They steal our most of advanced  innovations and they do so with front companies.  They're carrying out  daily 24/7 espionage against the United States with those front companies  in the United States.</p><p>LONSKI:  But we have a very close linkage with China.  Let's not forget.   Many U.S. companies manufacture their goods.  High technology,  telecommunication devices are manufactured in China for U.S. companies to  sell in the United States.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  And that's one of the biggest problems and that's one of the  big problems that this president intends to reverse.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, he has -- I applauded that in  fact.  He threatened a veto today.  He should have threatened a veto a  month ago and the reality is, you know, political system does not work when  it comes to budgets.  When you put four --</p><p>DOBBS:  But now you got scoreless dogs leading the Republican Party in both  Houses.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  But when you put four people in the room and two of them -- two  of them are the Democrat leaders in both sides -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  We've got the greatest political analyst in the country here.  I've  got to ask you.  How -- and I've got to believe every American who's paying  attention is wondering the same thing.  How in the hell does a party that  has -- the Republican Party with a majority in the Senate, the majority in  the House.  How the hell do they end up conferring with the two leading  Democrats and ignoring their entire conference?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, they shouldn't and they should be removed as leaders.  I  think Ryan's performance was unbelievable that fact that he would get in  the room 24 hours before was -- and make these deals with Pelosi.  As you  said last night, when Pelosi says it's a great robust bill and we blocked  all the Trump's priorities, I mean that got to be the greatest indictment  of all to the leadership.</p><p>DOBBS:  Here's another indictment.  When Paul Ryan says it's a great piece  of legislation, you know it the same -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  It's not a great piece of legislation.  It's a half a trillion  dollar increase in the debt.  And it's just -- and I think the president if  you're reading is serious about what he said today.  He's got to get  Mulvaney in the budget process.  This is only -- we're halfway into a new  fiscal year and we haven't begun that process.  We just -- we're six months  late in the budget and it's an atrocious budget.  It was trillion dollar  deficits from now for the foreseeable future. </p><p>DOBBS:  Trillion dollar deficits from now on folks, remember that number.   We're now back in trillion dollar deficits.  And we just added a trillion  to the national debt in the last six months.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.  Unfortunately, the Chinese bought a trillion dollars -- they  hold a trillion dollars' worth of U.S. government debt.  We need their  support.  But on the other hand of course if the Chinese threatened to  reduce their holdings of U.S Treasury and sell them to push --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  They going to reduced their holdings by about 10 percent.</p><p>LONSKI:  If they use this as part of a trade was strategy, the Federal  Reserve can respond in kind by adopting (INAUDIBLE) just buying the  treasuries and existing yields that the Chinese want to sell.  Why not?  </p><p>DOBBS:  And people don't want to acknowledge this but that four and a half  trillion dollars that the Fed put on the balance sheet and, Ed, is looking  at me like, what has this got to do with politics?  But the fact the matter  is they are setting here raising the rate for the repayment of that debt  when they recycle it off of -- cycle it off of the balance sheet.  They are  also and under -- we're under no obligation to sell our treasuries to the  Chinese.  That's a benefit for them, not for us.  We can gin up enough  money in perpetuity.  We've done it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  The next generation is going to pay a very heavy price on these  deficits getting politically active and neither party owns them and my  sense is the party that gives them a formula of how we're going to be  fiscally responsible is going to become the majority party.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why don't we send out McConnell and Ryan to every college  campus and have them recruit those millennials, what do you think?</p><p>ROLLINS:  We'll lose -- we'll lose overwhelming the support and we need --  we need to be -- we need to be fiscally sound.  We need to basically  convince these young people that there is a plan for them for the future  because what's going to happen is the interest on this debt is going to  become the biggest item in the budget in a very short order, and it's going  to take away lots of options for them and whatever the tax cuts we made  short-term will basically be offset by other additional things that they  have --</p><p>DOBBS:  Do you think the president meant when he said, never again?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, I hope so.  This is a big -- this is a big warning and I  hope -- I hope the -- he's going to be active all the way through and  Mulvaney has going to be very active all the way through this, the OMB  Director.</p><p>LONSKI:  Who is going vote to cut spending at the federal level?  Who's  going to vote to raise the retirement age and so on or reduce the  entitlements to the federal government --</p><p>DOBBS:  Did you say raise the retirement age?</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.  Well, they're going to have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LONSKI:  They're still working.  But I'm saying for the millennials, you  know, you could say that 25 years from now the retirement age might be 68  and going up to 70 since we do live longer.  At least that's been the case.</p><p>DOBBS:  So for -- we can vote --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Messaging for the Republican Party.  You're living longer, so you  should work harder.</p><p>LONSKI:  Well, that's the point and they can't -- they will not deliver  that political message if they want to stay in office and --</p><p>DOBBS:  One thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  These young people are going to find their -- it's their parents  that are going to be suffering, so you can't -- you can't cut it for them  but you have to have to have some strategic thought processes about where  we go 10 years --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  I'm sorry.  OK.</p><p>LONSKI:  Term the limits.  I mean that's basically what you're going to  need in Washington -</p><p>DOBBS:  Term limits?  You mean what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Paul Ryan won't be able to stay in office for 25 years.  McConnell  three and a half decade.</p><p>LONSKI:  That may not be a bad idea.  That maybe the only solution.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I think those term limits have some interesting appeal and  broadening of feel I'm sure.  Interest rates, why is it we have to give on  the job training to every Fed chairman whether he or she is just steps in  and they're new.  They get to raise rates and see what happens to an  economy in which there's no inflation and then we have to watch the little  dance that follows.  We're in the dance part now for Jerome Powell.  </p><p>LONSKI:  I think where the problem, you know, with the Federal Reserve is a  lot of people that provide information to the Fed Chairman are very  theoretically oriented economist.  OK.  They sit in their office by, you  know, computer all day long looking at numbers doing this, that, and yet  they do statistical analysis.  They have no connection with reality  whatsoever.  Look what happens during the housing crisis.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  And it's -- and it looks like it's a little like politics,  isn't it?  I mean who's advising Ryan, and McConnell, and Schumer, and  Pelosi?  Do they adviser? </p><p>ROLLINS:  They're about three staffers on the Hill that know what was in  the 2000 page bill and there's not a single member in the House and Senate  who voted for it had any clue what was in that bill.  That's irresponsible.</p><p>DOBBS:  But \"60 minutes\" is going to break this wide open.  The issues  collapsing fiscal policy and monetary policy simultaneously.  I understand  they got a whole segment on it.  It's called \"storm field.\"  What?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  High journalists.  Ed Rollins, John Lonski, thank you both.   Appreciate it.  Up next, lawmakers zeroing in on the zuck demanding answers  from Facebook over its absolute breach of public trust.  Deirdre Bolton,  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright joins us here next to take up the  fiasco, the crisis, the disaster for Facebook and soon Silicon Valley, and  big tech.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The Justice Department charged Iranian hackers in connection with a  mass of state-sponsored cyber-attack that targeted more than 140 American  universities.  The indictment charges the defendants was stealing more than  31 terabytes of academic date, intellectual property worth we're told  somewhere around $3 billion.  My guess is it's multiples of that.  The  Justice Department says all nine hackers are still in Iran.  They're  somewhat like Russian hackers.  They don't seem to be extraditable.  Well,  calls for embattle Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress  are growing more numerous and louder.  Both the Senate Commerce and House  Energy Commerce Committees today formally asking Zuckerberg to appear on  Capitol Hill.</p><p>Zuckerberg said he's open to testifying as he put it so quaintly and cutely  only if he is the correct person at Facebook to do so.  Only if he's the  correct person, how precious of the zuck?  Joining us tonight cybersecurity  expert Morgan Wright, Fox Business Correspondent Deirdre Bolton.  Great to  have you both here.  Deirdre, he waits five days to open his mouth and then  he says nothing, doesn't even apologize.  He has to do that day two of the  non-apology.  He and Sheryl Sandberg who is supposed to be this all big  time executive, these are two of the biggest losers I've ever seen at the  top of a company.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  So Lou, they make you feel  better that he lost about $10 million.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Not a bit.</p><p>BOLTON:  Not a bit?</p><p>DOBBS:  I really think is it the most appalling executive conduct I have  seen that the top two officials of any company in crisis --</p><p>BOLTON:  So one analyst that I speak with a lot who has a cell on the stock  said, you know, I never really thought I was going to have to question the  management of Facebook.  This week has really changed for me because really  this data breach let's call it with Cambridge Analytica was sort of the  second big strike for Facebook.  The first one of course being in the run  up to our presidential election.  More than half of the U.S. voting  population saw an ad that was either created by or manipulated by Russian  bots.  So we're --</p><p>DOBBS:  The only proved collaboration with the Russians belongs -- that  honor belongs to two companies, one is Facebook and the other is Twitter.   And by the way, I think issue number one was the 2012 election in which  Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and Facebook got behind the candidacy of Barack  Obama.  They took sides then and nobody said a word.</p><p>BOLTON:  Nobody said a word.  At this point though, their credibility as  business leaders is being questioned.  So it's in some ways a business  problem aside from an ethical problem as well.  But at this point they need  to hire more engineers.  They need to hire more humans that is going to eat  into their profit margins.  But I think at this point they must do it.  To  answer your point, he's going to go to Capitol Hill.  The New York A.G. has  started an investigation.  The Massachusetts A.G., there are two class  action lawsuits, one from users and one from investors.  So --</p><p>DOBBS:  This is early days.  </p><p>BOLTON:  This is early days.  So they have a big problem.</p><p>DOBBS:  This is -- Morgan, I want to bring you in now and you can tell us  what in the world would any company be thinking?  And I have to say to  folks that, you know, I think that it's probably -- we can find several  other examples of just heinously cowardly management.  But right now in  this moment Facebook is what's terrible.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Well, look, Lou, now, one thing I  will tell you.  From a security, just from a pure security standpoint  Facebook actually does an excellent job where they're failing it's -- they  can't engineer their way out of this.  This is a policy and a governance  issue and stealing with the privacy of our information, what other policies  and how do we enforce that?  What we've got is we've got a neophyte  organization.  By the way, it wasn't exactly a fair fight during the, you  know, during the election, we've got a Russian country that has 100 years  of influence operations but we've got the technical capability and where  was our own government sharing information, so we can prevent this  information of going on.  So technically, they're good.  But they suffer  big time because it's not about the technology.  It's about the policy and  governance and they failed on the privacy.  </p><p>DOBBS:  They failed on privacy, they failed on security, they failed on  integrity, they failed on basic courage that is required of any great  business leader.  Zuckerberg looks terrible here, Morgan.  You can't defend  that.  There's no way to rationalize it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  That's why leave the political conversation to you and Deirdre,  you know, I'm trying to stay on the technical side because you guys are far  more experienced than I am.  But I will tell you -- but I will tell you  absolutely, it doesn't matter what you engineer, you can engineer the best  thing in the world, and look, and Department of Defense one time, they've  engineered what was called total information awareness, Admiral Poindexter,  great program that's down to the Department of Justice at that time doing  some work on information sharing.  We thought it was the greatest thing.   Guess what?  It was great technology.  They couldn't solve the privacy  issues.  The ACLU came in and that program was killed off because of  privacy. </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's another technical issue here and I'd like you both to  address this and that is the users' data that is awash on the web as a  result to Facebook and it's whether you call them technical issues,  integrity issues, security issues.  The reality is those users' have  information that is being used for purposes never agreed to nor  contemplated.  And the fact is, Facebook was aware of that.  And this  business, Cambridge Analytica, come on third-party users, who's using what.   This just -- this is just one example of how this template got out of  control.</p><p>BOLTON:  One think I would like to remind people though, if you're not  paying for a service, you are the product, right?</p><p>DOBBS:  So said Steve Jobs.</p><p>BOLTON:  Right.  So you have --</p><p>DOBBS:  I think it's one of those great --</p><p>BOLTON:  People just have to remember --</p><p>DOBBS:  There aren't many analogs in business for -- if you're not paying  for a product, you're the product.  This is straight out.  A responsible --  I mean think about this, Morgan, and explain it to us.  How in the world  can Zuckerberg or any one of the Facebook folks sit there and say, you  know, we just couldn't manage this issue.  We're such clever innovators and  first movers that we just had to adjust to that.  They knew they had a  problem in 2016 during the election with the Russian agents and still  didn't move forward.  As a matter of fact, they were -- they were attacking  conservative groups, censoring conservative groups, and continuing to say  they really need, and Zuckerberg is dreaming of being president.  And they  weren't not even close to doing the responsible thing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Well, look, Lou, to build on what Deirdre was saying and you were  saying.  I don't know people notice but, you know, Facebook collects 48  separate data points about you everything from what you RSVP, what you  like, and it's part of a discipline called persuasive technology.  It's the  whole -- and it was created at Stanford actually.  Instagram was the first  students that created technology out of this.  It's designed to manipulate  people and it's not just Facebook.  It's done with online gaming.  </p><p>It's done with advertising.  So this persuasive technology, the more I know  about you, I get past demographic into what's called psychographic  information, what you do, what you're like, your attitude, and values, I  can now whole scale, upscale manipulate people.</p><p>DOBBS:  But I don't think we should go too far beyond that.  It's  psychographic.  And there are entire disciplines of psychometrics gauging  who you are, what you are, measuring it, and then deciding how they're  going to influence your future decision making and they are creating from  those profiles that maybe your friends or in the case of Facebook, people's  friends were being co-opted into the buckets of information by the  millions, and their influencing decision making.  And there is not even a  discussion in this country about it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  One thing I would just add and I'm not trying to defend anybody in  this.  But let me just state, the U.S. spends $50.3 billion a year on  national intelligence program.  So we have a program called the domestic  security council.  Where was your own government with all the information?   It was laid out in 2015 by a reporter in the U.K. about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You do not know where our government was?  Let me help you.   Morgan, you should know this.  16 agencies came together and made a  decision about collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians and  they've ignored everything that was happening in the electoral process at  the DNC for eight months.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Exactly, my point.  And we give them $50.3 billion to find the  obvious and they didn't.  But yet we want to throw it all onto the back of  tech companies and not just Facebook and Twitter but a lot of the other  folks out there, I think first, we've got to do a better job from a  government standpoint of using our money widely to defend our  infrastructure and our information systems. </p><p>DOBBS:  OK.  Very quickly.  It's got to be regulated and it's got to be  regulated by the government.  This nonsense of the wild frontier in Silicon  Valley is done as of now.  Would you not agree, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  They put themselves in this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WRIGHT:  No, no.  But I'll tell you.  From a regulatory standpoint, it's no  different than the way they dealt with cigarettes and its addictive  technology.  This is definitely addictive.  It's got to have some  intervention.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You get the last word.</p><p>BOLTON:  Again a hundred percent on board.  I think, yes, Zuckerberg in  front of Congress answering questions in front of subcommittees, yes, this  is a new page.</p><p>DOBBS:  But only, Deirdre, only if he's the right person.  He's merely the  CEO with all of those billions of dollars --</p><p>WRIGHT:  I'll take his 10 billion and testify.  </p><p>BOLTON:  There you go.  The 10 million he lose this week.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Let me negotiate that for you if a usual --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Your fee, yes.  </p><p>DOBBS:  A fee.  Morgan, thanks so much.  Deirdre, thanks so much.   Appreciate it.  Be sure to vote in our poll tonight.  The question is, do  you believe RINOs and Dems in Congress are incapable of creating a spending  bill that doesn't just simply blow up fiscal policy?  We'd like to hear  from you.  You're your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  Follow me on Twitter  @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbs Tonight.   On Wall Street, stocks selling off for the second straight session.  The  Dow plunging 425 point.  The S&amp;P down 55.  The Nasdaq dropping 174.  Volume  on the Big Board, 3.8 billion shares.  But that one is really child's play.  </p><p>For the week, stocks closing the worst week in more than two years.  The  Dow down more than 5 percent.  The S&amp;P down 6 percent and the Nasdaq  posting a loss of six and a half percent of the week.  Bye-bye more than a  trillion dollars.  The wish -- the Wilshire 5000, those losses, market cap  amount to for the week $1.8 trillion.  That's what we call a tough week.  A  reminder, listen to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the  Salem Radio Network.  Up next, President Trump blasting the Dems and the  RINOs in Congress for loading up an omnibus spending bill with just about  everything but the sink.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The last time we negotiated something like this and as you know  it's always been a problem for our country.  They get together and they  create a series of documents that nobody has been able to read because it  was just done.  You tell me who can read that quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  And who bothers to read after all.  A full report on the backlash  to the -- to the extraordinary amazing, awesome leadership of Paul Ryan and  Mitch McConnell.  We salute them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Coming up next, President Trump making moves on gun safety.  You  can bet the national left wing national media won't give him credit for.   We'll take up the bump stock ban, the Justice Department actually doing  something, they're moving ahead.  And they announced it late this  afternoon.  We'll take it up with our panel, Gina Loudon, Dom Giordano,  joining us right after these words.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The Justice Department taking action, announcing it's begun the  process to ban bump stocks.  The Department of Justice now amending federal  firearms regulations to clarify bump stocks fall into the technical  definition of machine gun.  President Trump today tweeted this, \"The Obama  administration legalized bump stocks.  Bad idea.  As I promised today, the  Department of Justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a  mandated comment period.  </p><p>We will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\"   Good idea.  I added the good idea.  Joining me now, Gina Loudon, Political  Analyst, member of President's Trump Media Advisory Board, radio talk show  host, Dom Giordano.  Great to have you both with us.  Gina, I mean, this is  bump stocks.  What in the world was anybody in the Obama administration  thinking?  It's such a silly idea, Gina.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, DONALD J. TRUMP MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD:  It was such  silly Idea, but you see, the thing about is just, Lou, the people on the  left seem to never be interested in what works.  They don't want to deal  with data, they don't want to deal with research.  They wanted just to do  something that feels good.  They want to ban things that look scary instead  of actually worrying about what will save lives.  And for me, as a person  who has relied on data and research my whole life as a psychology  professional, I look at what actually works to help people.  And that's  where we need to start.  That's the conversation that we need to have.  I'm  very glad that our President certainly seems to want to have those  conversations as well.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dom, what do you think?</p><p>DOM GIORDANO, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, Lou, I think this is another  example of the real upside of President Trump is making a promise and then  following through and checking it off and then doing a good job, I think,  despite the media, at getting the word out that he's doing that, as we're  talking about right now.  And he's done this consistently on issue after  issue, after issue.  And that's why the base recognizes that and they're  still supportive.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And this idea of bump stocks, I got to tell you, I know a thing or  two about guns but I had never heard of a bump stock before Las Vegas.  I  mean, I really had never heard of it.  It makes no sense.  It is  ridiculous.  It has nothing to do, to me, with anything necessary for  defense or for sport.  It's just a nonsensical idea and as the President  points out, it does moves the semi-automatic weapons into the category of  machine gun with the rate of fire.  So, now, now let's see how long it  takes the idiots to try to take away handguns, rifles and shotguns.   Because you know, as Gina was alluding to, that's going to be the play.   Because there's no question that the left means to roll back our second  amendment rights in this country, period.</p><p>LOUDON:  But we need to be consistent.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Well, right.  And that's what the march -- that's what the march  is going to be about tomorrow, Lou.  As you know, I'm an educator and I see  these kids, the Parkland kids, a couple of them are out of control.</p><p>DOBBS:  Isn't that disgusting?  We're tuning in to high school assemblies.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  The aggregated wisdom of 18-year-olds.  I mean, this is really --</p><p>LOUDON:  Who by their own words, Lou, say that they shouldn't be able to  own guns even though they can go to war but they think that they should be  able to make laws.  I mean, none of this makes any sense at all.  And the  very fact, that we are giving such gravitas to people who just -- they  haven't had enough life experience yet, Lou, to be experts on much of  anything yet.  And I don't think, it's not insulting them to say that.  I  have children.  I respect them.  I love them.  I think my children are  brilliant but Lou, I'm not going to put them in charge of public policy as  opposed to somebody who study this their whole entire life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, George Clooney is.  I mean, we can just step aside.  And, you  know, it's -- we can't even get test scores rising in this country yet  we're watching two teachers unions move children into the street to pursue  their political aims.  I mean, it is outrageous what they're doing.  (INAUDIBLE) You get that question.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Well, exactly.  And as Gina just said, these are nuance  complicated issues where people studied the policy, they're actually  knowledgeable about this things.  And I have to say too, Lou, as an  educator, there's a couple of these kids that are just rude in the way that  they proceed here, as if they are bullet proof, so to speak, by -- the  media is almost wondering (INAUDIBLE) in to this kids.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's find another noun next time.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Well, I caught myself to that, but Lou, a couple of these kids  are legitimate, they're sincere about remembering their colleagues and all  that.  A couple of the others had just got and an almost (INAUDIBLE) this  media presence.</p><p>DOBBS:  Exploited.  No doubt about it.</p><p>LOUDON:  But Lou -- but Lou, they're not covering, I live here -- this is  where I live.  They're not covering the children like my children who go to  school close by where this happened and my children don't agree with these  students doing this march.  And where is the attention on them?  They come  to me in social media, I'm sure they've come to both of you too, because  they do understand our constitution and our bill of rights and our second  amendment.  And they want to make sure it's protected for their future.   But they're not listening to them, Lou.  They're only listening to the  radical -- more radical children who have a totally one-way slant.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Or they just happened to have parent who work with the teacher's  union or whatever.  </p><p>Here, let's turn to Facebook, because speaking of young people whose minds  are being really dramatically irresponsibly, in my opinion, managed by  these psychographic driven, algorithms and propositions on the technology  of Facebook and other social media.  This has really got to stop, Dom.  It  really does, it's got be regulated and it's got to happen now.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Lou, I would agree.  It's not just Facebook, it's Google, it's  all this other enterprises.  The amount of power, this is different.  And  that's why we haven't caught up with it.  And I think, you've been making a  great point early on about this.  This is not just economic power, this is  a power to actually influence our lives, somewhat in the deepest levels,  particularly with millennials and others that engage in this all day long.</p><p>DOBBS:  And particularly children -- and particularly children, Gina.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>LOUDON:  Yes, listen, if you want to use my information, let's make a deal.   Guys, I am all about the free market, Lou.  So, if they want to use my  data, how about they pay me for my data.  How about I'm a partner in the  things that I buy on Facebook and other places.  And there are ways to do  this where the disclosure is in place, people understand what they're  giving away and the free market --</p><p>DOBBS:  But even with that -- but even with that, Gina, the way in which  Facebook and other social media particularly are influencing children with  their -- with their business model, with their content is irresponsible, it  has to end now.  And if Congress doesn't move on this immediately, I can't  imagine that they won't even I mean within days.</p><p>LOUDON:  You're right and Lou, there are deeper darker consequences as  well.  The amount of depression is in children, especially because their  brains are a little bit less developed, the emotional senses of their  brain.  The amount of depression is directly relative to how much time they  spend with their face in that screen, Lou.  That's something nobody is  talking about right now.  It's a great concern, I'm sure -- I'm sure that  the teacher here knows all about this.  It's a great concern (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIORDANO:  Lou, what I was going to say is, this idea of Zuckerberg  testifying, again, we need people in Congress that are more fluent with  these things, you know --</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we need those people too.  But I want to see Zuckerberg  explaining to the American people, to Congress and to the Senate and to the  President what the hell he and his company have been doing and take  responsibility instead of doing that unintelligible blabber mumble jumble  that he has so far, treated the press to.  Dom Giordano, Gina Loudon, thank  you both for being here.</p><p>GIORDANO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>LOUDON:  Thanks, Lou </p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you both.  Up next, RINO's Ryan and McConnell abandoning  conservatives.  Well they're doing more than that.  They're trying to back  the pickup over them and they've sold out to the Chamber of Commerce and,  well, every local U.S. multinational they can find.  We take that up.  And  the national left wing media mocking members of the Trump administration  over their faith.  I take that up with Pastor Robert Jeffers, here next.   Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump today declaring he will never again sign a budget  bill like the budget busting ominous spending bill.  President Trump with  curios veto threat and then grudgingly signed that spending bill.  He  called it a ridiculous situation.  Fox News Chief Congressional  Correspondent, Mike Emanuel, with the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We looked at the veto, I  looked very seriously at the veto.  I was thinking about doing the veto.   But because of the incredible gains that we've been able to make for the  military, that overrode any of our -- any of our thinking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Late night last  night on the Senate floor lawmakers voted 65-32 to approve the package and  sent it to President Trump for his signature.  Like the President, many who  supported it backed it for the additional $60 billion devoted to rebuilding  the military.  Today some Democrats blasted the President for being  inconsistent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA:  We've grown used to just complete  unpredictability.  So, you know, and then who knows what he'll do an hour  from now.  But I do know this.  This is a good deal.  It's a classic  compromise.  There are things I really like.  There were things I wish were  in the bill.  I wish that the dreamer deal that we put on the table for the  President, that he would have accepted it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Now there's plenty of blame game between the two parties over  which side could not get to the yes on the so-called dreamers.  Young  people brought this country illegally by their parents.  A key Democrat  challenged the President's ability to cut an agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D), MARYLAND:  You've got a President that claims  he's the great negotiator, the art of the deal.  Where was he when the deal  was being made?  You know, wakes up the next day and says he wants  something different.  He's actually one of the worst negotiators I've ever  seen.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Part of the President's frustration is with the rules of the  Senate and the fact, 49 Democrats had a lot of leverage.  Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell has resisted calls to change the Senate filibuster rules.   Recognizing one day, the GOP will be the minority party again.  A veteran  Republican says there is merit to changing the budget process here in  Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHNNY ISAKSON (R) GEORGIA:  I'd rather see something like, I'll never  sign one of these again, so, from now and now, let's do appropriations  right or let's, you know, talk it out.  That's what we ought to be thinking  about the future, not trying to recreate the past.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  With the bill signed the threat of the government shutdown is  gone for at least six months, Lou?  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we'll take every six month we get.  Thank you Emanuel, thank  you.</p><p>Up next, the national left wing national media's on holy war against the  Trump administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Occasionally you bow the  head and bend the knee.  I encourage you to do that.  I'm someone that  believes that prayer changes things, so pray for America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  We're praying.  We'll take up the White House under fire for its  faith.  Pastor Robert Jeffress, our guest here next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Two members of the national left wing national media forced to  apologize for attacking the Trump administration and their faith.  \"MSNBC\"  host, Stephanie Ruhle, now says she meant no offense after she mocked Larry  Kudlow's faith.  And Joy Behar who is always just right near the very  essence of contrition publicly apologized for mocking Vice President  Pence's Christians faith.  Joining us tonight, Robert Jeffress Pastor of  the First Baptist Church in Dallas, a Fox Business contributor.  Great to  see you Pastor.  And I wanted to --  I wanted -- just I have never heard so  many people attacking Christians on whatever level.  What is -- there seems  to be just an insistence thing that they do so.</p><p>DR. ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, isn't that true?  And  isn't it also true that if Joy Behar or Stephanie Ruhle had attacked a  Muslim for their faith, they would have been fired by their networks in a  nanosecond.  But it's always open season on conservative Christians by the  media.  But let me tell you what's going on here, Lou.  </p><p>The reason this is happening is liberals know that conservative Christians  are the last speed bump on the road to the godless immoral society that  liberals dream of and that is exactly why they're attacking them.  And  isn't it ironic that it took a secular billionaire businessman from New  York City named Donald J. Trump to recognize that marginalization of  Christianity that was going on, he spoke up about it.  And got elected by  the largest margin of the evangelicals in history, that's the reason they  support him so much.</p><p>DOBBS:  And, you know, he spoke up about it, he spoke up early and he spoke  up alone on the campaign trail, talking about the persecution of Christians  around the world.  And to see the left do this, \"MSNBC\" going after, what's  her name, Ruhle, going after Larry Kudlow who worked at \"CNBC\", a sister  network.  I mean, there's not even a kinship in media.  How low have we  fallen?</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Well, that's right, Lou.  And they both have this in common, the  personalities you mentioned, Larry as well as Vice President Pence, they  claim that their faith has changed them -- has changed them.  And that, you  know, that's what we're declaring this Sunday night in our 'March for  Eternal Life'.  We're going to have thousands of people marching through  the streets of downtown Dallas carrying a giant illuminating cross saying  it is the gospel of Jesus Christ that can change people's heart.  And look,  you talked earlier about the march for your life rallies tomorrow for gun  control legislation.</p><p>DOBBS:  I'm not talking about them -- I'm not talking about them, I don't  care about them.  Let them be, if you're going to march a bunch of children  through the streets of the country, that's their business.  If they don't  find that exploitive and if they don't find that demeaning and graceless,  you know, that's their problem.  But I don't have to pay attention to them. </p><p>JEFFRESS:  But what we're saying is --  </p><p>DOBBS:  Unless you tell me to and then I'll pay attention.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  No, sir -- no, sir -- no, sir.  What I am saying though is look,  trying to depend upon legislation alone to end the violence epidemic is  like putting a band aid on a cancer.  It doesn't deal with the heart issue  and we're talking about what the heart issue is and that is our  relationship to Christ.  So, this is a positive way of saying we're not  ashamed of our faith.  We want to proclaim it. </p><p>DOBBS:  And you know, I think, marches and demonstrations and people  actually talking about Jesus Christ are wonderful things and we don't do  enough of it -- we don't do enough of it on television, we don't do enough  of it on radio, we don't do enough of it in the streets of Dallas or any  other community in this country.  And it's a wonderful thing you're doing.   I truly commend you and the good folks in Dallas.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Well, thank you very much.  And we invite people to tune in.   It's going to be live streamed.  And again, this is a new day in America, I  believe, Lou.  And we thank President Trump for creating a new atmosphere  where people feel emboldened to share their faith.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, emboldened to share their faith.  You know, I like the  words.  I guess I resist just a little thinking what we have to be bold to  share our faith.  But it is necessary to be bold, I believe, in this day  and age where there is so much oppression of the Christian faith here at  home and indeed around the world.  But always lifting us up is Pastor  Robert Jeffress.  And we thank you for so doing and share sharing your time  with us, Pastor.  Thank you so much.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Thank you Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  And have a great march.</p><p>JEFFRESS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for joining us.  Ann  Coulter, General Jack Keane among our guests here at Monday.  It makes the  weekend well, just worthwhile just to know we're going to have all of that  waiting for you on Monday.  Have a great weekend.  Thanks for being with us  tonight.  Good night from New York.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know. Mission aborted. President Trump calling off a planned military strike on Iran. No slacking. The messaging platform shares do the work, soaring on the first day of trade; and taking on the trolls, Facebook and Twitter get set for the 2020 Democratic debates. It's Friday, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A warm welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Great to be back, and we've got a busy hour ahead. The focus, of course remains on the tensions in the Middle East following reports that President Trump approved a military strike against Iran and then decided to reverse that call. We will walk you through the latest on that and try to gauge the risk of direct military action, what of course that also means for investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let me give you a look. Right now, stocks around the globe are performing pretty well. It's always tough to price this kind of conflict and uncertainty on Wall Street. U.S. futures right now a touch softer. The S&amp;P 500 of course hitting record highs in Thursday's trading session.</p><p>The Dow now just half a percent away from making its own fresh record highs. It's a prospect, of course of fresh rounds of global stimulus that's clearly exciting investors at this moment into buying assets and having a bit of a tranquilizer effect, I'll call it that amid the heightened tensions in the Middle East.</p><p>Both factors, though, are playing into the rally that we're seeing in gold. Right now trading -- where are we now? Well, just below that $1,400.00 an ounce level that is near a six-year high.</p><p>Also giving you a look at what we're seeing for our 10-year bond yields just above that two percent figure, as you can see. What about oil prices? Front and center. Right now we can see solid gains more than one percent of Brent crude.</p><p>It's actually risen more than eight percent since the attacks last week on those two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The other recent catalyst for the escalation that we've seen. U.S. crude up some 10 percent over that period, too.</p><p>All right, that's exactly where we're going to begin the drivers. Let's get to it. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Iran, only to call it off again. That's according to a U.S. official.</p><p>The change of mind was first reported by \"The New York Times.\" It would have been an act of retaliation for the downing of a U.S. drone on Thursday. Sam Kiley in the Gulf of Oman in the UAE for us.</p><p>Sam, great to have you with us. What exactly do we know about this decision, this order of a military strike and the apparent U-turn? Walk us through it?</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it came last night, our time, when -- and I'm speaking to you from the Emirates when there was a decision taken in the White House to trigger this military retaliation. Before any weapons were launched, though, there was another decision taken, Julia, in the White House to stand that operation down.</p><p>Now, we're not exactly sure why that decision was taken. It is conceivable there may have been some diplomatic overtures or some level of intelligence that may have come through. But it's very clear that prior to that decision, Donald Trump was reaching for reasons not to take it when he said that he believed or that there was some chance that a rogue element within the Iranian administration, within the military had triggered the downing of the drone.</p><p>That has been rejected flatly by the Iranians, who say no, it was a very deliberate act to take down that drone because it was in Iranian airspace.</p><p>Of course, the Americans say it was in international airspace, but I think there is a real sigh of relief that has gone around the region because whatever people's attitudes on this side of what they call on this side, the Arabian Gulf, the Iranians call it the Persian Gulf, there is a sense that the retaliation, a military retaliation over the downing of what is a flying robot could be seen as something of an overreaction, and would certainly, in many people's view here trigger the chain reaction, which could have been really catastrophic.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and that's to the heart of the matter here at this stage, Sam. I mean, the President is caught between hawkish Republicans on the one side, Democrats like Chuck Schumer saying the risk carries is that we bumble into a war situation. What are the Iranian saying light of this news and what next? Because I think everybody here has to be very careful about how they handle what we're seeing here.</p><p>[09:05:09] KILEY: Well, the Iranians recently have said that they had the opportunity to shoot down a manned spy plane with some 20-plus crew members on board, and elected not to do it. Now, true or false, I think that indicates a degree to which the Iranians are calibrating how they're reacting, how they're putting low-level military pressure to try to achieve diplomatic ends.</p><p>And by that I mean, Julia, if the Iranians as the Americans and the U.K. suspect were behind the bombings of six super tankers behind me in the Gulf of Oman over the last few weeks, and then moreover, the downing as they admit of this drone, what they're doing is they're showing military capability without killing anybody.</p><p>The moment it comes into spilling a blood, all bets are off, and there is a real chance of a very rapid escalation, what they're trying to feel their way towards, and I think there are indications that the Americans who keep sending messages through third parties are also trying to do is to get to the point at which they can negotiate.</p><p>The problem there is that the Iranians won't negotiate effectively until the Americans come back on board and start recognizing the terms of the deal that they signed with the previous administration, and many other nations, but which the Trump administration abandoned last night and that, of course, was a deal to lift sanctions in return for suspending their nuclear program.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you're right, though. A catalyst here in the sequence of events. We'll talk more about this later on in the show. But for now, Sam Kiley, thank you so much for bringing us up to speed with the story.</p><p>The latest events, of course, in the Middle East, also impacting airlines around the world. The U.S. aviation regulators banned American carriers from flying through the airspace in the region it deems unsafe.</p><p>The FAA says a commercial plane was less than 90 kilometers away from the American drone that was shot down on Thursday. Anna Stewart joins us now, and she has been tracking all of the details.</p><p>So what exactly do we know about where the restrictions are? Because it's a whole host of different airlines that do operate in this airspace. And now obviously, we have to be very cautious.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: So of course, all morning, we've been contacting all the airlines trying to work out who has done what, so we knew from yesterday, very quickly, United Airlines suspended their flight from New York to Mumbai that flew through this bit of airspace.</p><p>Now, we can tell you that Emirates, KLM, Qantas, British Airways -- all rerouting some of their flights to avoid the area. It is very specific. As you see from the map, its Iranian controlled airspace over the Persian Gulf, over the Gulf of Oman. It's not hugely heavy traffic for international airlines. But obviously it now is an airspace that's got to be avoided. It's very complex, of course for the airlines in this area.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and we're showing you what you can see now and we see the dispute over where in the airspace it took place.</p><p>I mean, the two issues for me here; one, we didn't know how long this conflict, this standoff, the risks here that the FAA directly are citing here will continue? What about cost when you're talking about the extra miles to be traveled to avoid these specific areas now that are deemed unsafe?</p><p>STEWART: It's really hard to quantify. For instance, the United Airlines is spending a flight indefinitely that will have X amount cost.</p><p>However, when you're looking at all the other airlines that just have to reroute, as you say, it depends how far they have to. And this is the problem with the Middle East or airlines generally, it's very, very complex, plenty of international disputes, just between different countries, for instance, Qatari Airlines cannot fly over Saudi Arabia. Some of them reroute like a thousand kilometers -- very costly, indeed.</p><p>As I said, this area isn't hugely trafficked by international airlines. In fact, since the Iraqi conflict, that's when we saw lots through this area, now not so much. So it shouldn't have a huge impact for many international airlines. But these things always do have a cost in terms of how many hours for jet fuel, for staffing, and of course, the passengers, you have to have much longer flights as a result.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You remember that you mentioned that the Qataris, obviously, Etihad Airways, what are they specifically saying? Because even -- it's only been just about the actions that they take, it's about how they specifically respond when they're asked questions, so they are just avoiding the subject completely and just continuing with the routes that that they're going.</p><p>STEWART: Currently, the only flights that I can see in this airspace are Qatari airlines and Iranian airlines, and that is all I've got from the real time data. But I'll be watching that all through the day.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That you will. Anna Stewart, always great to have you with us. Thank you.</p><p>All right. We've had Donald Trump tweeting in the last few moments, several of them in fact here. In part he said, \"On Monday, they shot down an unmanned drone flying in international waters. We were cocked and loaded to retaliate last night on three different sites. When I asked how many will die, 'A hundred and fifty people, sir,' was the answer from a general. Ten minutes before the strike, I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.\"</p><p>\"I am in no hurry. Our military is rebuilt, new and ready to go. By far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting and more were added last night. Iran can never have nuclear weapons, not against the U.S.A. and not against the world.\"</p><p>[09:10:15] CHATTERLEY: So the President there suggesting that he was told lives would be lost, and that that was not proportional to taking down a drone that, of course, the United States believe Iran did, so any further tweets from the President, we will bring it.</p><p>But there you go, from the President himself and the decision last night to abort a mission to attack three different sites in Iran.</p><p>All right, let's move on to the next driver. Slack ready for another star turn on Wall Street set to open high on its second day of trade. The workplace messaging app is the latest tech unicorn to earn an ovation on the New York Stock Exchange. It's now worth more than $20 billion dollars after its stock rocketed more than 50 percent from its opening price on Thursday.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us now and has been watching the action. Paul, that is pretty stellar performance for a first day of trading, $20 billion valuation. I make that more than three times the valuation that it raised money at just what? Nine months ago in the private market. There are some very happy investors watching the price action over the last 24 hours.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, definitely. Slack, obviously, a success in its first day of trading, and there has been a steady stream of companies that cater to, you know, corporate customers that have done well as of late and in the IPO market.</p><p>And obviously, Slack is a bit of a different story here because it's not technically an IPO, it's a direct listing, which is different. They sold shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange. But make no mistake, Slack is doing extremely well, it has a lot of momentum. But I think there are going to be some concerns going forward that people have to look at.</p><p>The revenue growth is starting to slow a bit. They're not profitable. And then there's Microsoft in the background, which has its Teams collaborative software tool, and when you think about Microsoft, they've also got Office. They have LinkedIn. They have Skype. It's going to be interesting to see whether or not Slack can fend off competition from Microsoft. And if not, could Slack become an acquisition target down the road?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I love when we get worried about the prospect of revenue growth slowing to between 40 and 50, four zero and five zero percent here. But you also make a great point about the fact that the key difference here to what we've seen from other IPOs in recent weeks is that these guys didn't need to raise money.</p><p>So I know there's been a lot of commentary on whether or not this is perhaps a model for other tech giants. Perhaps you go direct rather than the traditional IPO model. But the point is, if you need more money, hey, you don't have a choice, Paul?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, you probably need to go public at some point. We've seen that obviously this year, Julia, with Uber and Lyft going public. A lot of these unicorns have been private for a long period of time and it is now you know, the point where they have to graduate to the public markets.</p><p>But if Slack can continue to do well as a publicly traded stock, I think it's going to be interesting to see the unicorns that are left out there. Companies like WeWork and Airbnb, will they now consider a direct listing as opposed to a traditional IPO?</p><p>Because for all the merits of you know, going public through Wall Street investment banks, it hasn't really helped Uber all that much, or Lyft for that matter. So one could take a step back and say, \"Hey, look at what Slack just did without the support of investment bankers and Wall Street, why not we try that route as well?\"</p><p>Of course, Spotify also did a direct listing and hasn't been as successful because they've had to face tough competition from Apple.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, do all your borrowing in the private market and then just go direct? It's an interesting question, isn't it but I have to say, each story and each individual name trades differently, and we just have to value them appropriately or at least try. Paul La Monica, thank you very much for that. All right. We'll see how it opens up today, too.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>Protesters in Hong Kong once again gathering in the central business district blocking the city's financial heart. Demonstrators a surrounding the police headquarters accusing officers of acting with brutality during earlier protests.</p><p>Let's bring in Ivan Watson who is in Hong Kong for us. It's not just about police brutality here. They want the Chief Exec Carrie Lam to step down and they want the permanent removal of this Extradition Bill. The question is, are they going to get it, Ivan? How did the executive here react?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, most of what we're hearing for the past two hours that we've been monitoring the situation is a lot of anger being vented at the police force here in Hong Kong.</p><p>This remarkable scene of thousands of protesters surrounding the headquarters of the Hong Kong Police chanting \"Shame,\" and if you can see right next to the sign there where the escalator is turning the facade there into an omelet with dozens of eggs being hurled at it.</p><p>[09:15:10] WATSON: The police throughout this have adopted a very passive, almost submissive posture, and even have slowly withdrawn while having eggs thrown at them.</p><p>So this is a dramatic turn from what we saw a week and a half ago here in Hong Kong on June 12th when police were very aggressive. They fired more than a hundred rounds of tear gas canisters, pepper spray, rubber bullets, baton charges, detained protesters, and there were violent clashes in these very streets.</p><p>It is that violence that has angered so many of the people here who are demanding their fellow protesters be released. They're calling for an investigation into allegations of excessive use of police force.</p><p>However, there are some questions being raised by members of society that were previously part of this coalition that was protesting against the extradition law that you mentioned, Julia, among them, the Catholic Church here, which had joined in opposition against the law.</p><p>But now we've had a prominent Bishop raising questions about these very tactics, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH HA CHI-SHING, BISHOP, CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF HONG KONG (through translator): You have all done a lot. You have all been very clear about your goal and demands, but I'm very worried about your safety.</p><p>I wish your actions would not affect the interests of the public. Because if so, you will turn the people against you. And this is not good to the entire development of the event.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON: So there we get a warning from a previously sympathetic voice to this grassroots opposition movement. It doesn't have one single leader. I've talked to people who are mobilizing the crowd. They say there's no one plan here because it is very grassroots, very young.</p><p>I talked to a 17-year-old girl who came here after school to join in the protest. The signs are is that the crowd grew as people got out of work. They also ground life in the center of this international commercial hub to a complete halt by stopping one of the main thoroughfare through the city.</p><p>As one of the opposition lawmakers has put it, there is this stalemate right now in Hong Kong between the protesters and the city authorities -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. I think if the authorities don't move more here, then we need to brace for some more disruption. We'll see. Ivan Watson, thank you so much for that update there. We can hear that chanting behind you.</p><p>All right, so let's move on. The British Prime Minister has suspended a member of her government after he was filmed grabbing a Greenpeace protester by the neck and marching her out of a dinner in London.</p><p>Mark Field, the Foreign Office Minister tackled the woman when she and other activists interrupted a speech by Finance Minister Philip Hammond. Greenpeace has accused Field of assault. He apologized for grabbing the woman, but said he did it because he thought she may have been armed.</p><p>A huge fire broke out an oil refinery in the American city of Philadelphia. At least one explosion shook the ground. Balls of gas and flame lit up the night sky. The blaze started in a vat of butane at America's 10th largest refinery. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up not so crude, oil markets making moves reacting to heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran. And the lesson in fearlessness, philanthropist Jean Case joins me in the \"Chatt Room.\" Stay with us, that's coming up.</p><p>[09:21:48] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. Global stocks are modestly lower amid the latest Middle East tensions. President Trump tweeting in just the past few minutes as I brought to you earlier that he called off the air strike against Iran when he learned that someone 150 people would die in the attack.</p><p>He says he is in no hurry to strike Iran, so clearly just trying to deescalate some of the noise surrounding this situation amid reports overnight, of course, of that military action, or at least the potential of it and the U-turn from the President.</p><p>Right now, we see futures pointing to modest losses at the open today in the United States. The S&amp;P 500 set to pull back slightly here from record highs hit yesterday.</p><p>Kit Juckes joins me now. He is the Global Head of FX Strategy at SocGen. Kit, fantastic to have you on the show. It's interesting amid the border tensions that we're seeing in the Middle East between Iran and the United States Pacific specifically, and yet we do have U.S. markets trading at record highs. We've got bonds being bought, rates coming down. Does this buying of assets that we're seeing right now make sense to you?</p><p>KIT JUCKES, GLOBAL HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, SOCIETE GENERALE: It does in a sense, you know, I mean, Alan Greenspan described the described the 1995 series of rate cuts that were put in the one-time leading indicators suggested there would be a recession, which then didn't materialize. This is the Feds finest moment under his watch.</p><p>The equity market went nuts for the rest of that decade for what it's worth and they're trying to do something like that -- stave off recession by acting fast -- because you can afford insurance when you've got this little inflation. And you have to decide whether you think they're going to succeed or not.</p><p>But at the moment, the market thinks they'll do whatever it takes to remove the risk of recession. And on that basis, let's go out and put some money in something that's got some returns.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right now, the bond market is saying it is 70 percent sure that we're going to get three cuts just by Christmas, but we're pricing in more cuts than that even.</p><p>Again, if we get some kind of trade agreement between the United States and China, suddenly, we're going to look at the situation surely and go, have the bond markets been a little bit too enthusiastic here about the support that's coming just from the Federal Reserve, never mind the other central banks around the world that are indicating that they're ready to ease?</p><p>JUCKES: For sure, though, though there have been five rate cutting cycles in the last 30 years, 49 cuts, do it yourself on that basis.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you can.</p><p>JUCKES: When they go, they go. Going against the start of a Federal easing cycle by betting that the market has priced in too much, too soon, is an easy and sometimes appealing trade. It has never worked in my career. So you have to be careful.</p><p>But yes, you know, if this is a new a new world where a stitch in time saves lives, or nine or as many rate cuts as you want, then everyone is going to feel slightly silly. But I suspect we've got further to go on rates.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's interesting. I was just trying to make a list this morning of all the central banks around the world because it's not just about the Federal Reserve here. There's far more.</p><p>I mean, the European Central Bank, the Australian Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, we've got Turkey, we've got India, we've got Korea, we've got South Africa -- everywhere. So many nations now is probably looking at easing and yet, you have a call in the United States for a recession in 2020? Circle that for me, please?</p><p>[09:25:07] JUCKES: Okay, so I think what drives the economic cycle is the earning cycle. So in a typical world, when companies run out of people, they start paying them more. That eats into their profits, the two biggest costs a company faces -- capital and people.</p><p>So you pay higher wages, that's lost profits and then interest rates go up in response, that's more lost profits. And then the cycle turns. We've avoided the cycle for a long time. But the danger in the last year is, President Trump gave the cycle a fiscal boost. So that accelerates you one way and then trying to get back under control is worse.</p><p>Imagine him giving -- I don't know, giving a young person some Red Bull while they're going out for their morning run. Perhaps that is okay. This is a middle aged cycle and I'll say it here on television. If you give me Red Bull before I go on my morning, run, please call a doctor soon. I'll start very fast, but I may fall in a heap quite quickly and I think that's what this economic cycle is in danger of looking like.</p><p>Now, you know, the Fed is very clever. They may stave this off, but it's a fine balance.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quickly. What does this mean for the U.S. dollar?</p><p>JUCKES: Well, the dollar will go down if we can find something for it to go down against. The Norwegian kroner is up because they raised rates. Gold is up because gold is not a currency. It's the alternative for dollar.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And the safe haven here as well if we're seeing border tensions elsewhere.</p><p>JUCKES: For sure. But shortage of alternatives is the only thing keeping the dollar from falling.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sterling?</p><p>JUCKES: Oh, for heaven's sake.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Don't talk about it. I always do that to you. I've only got 20 seconds, so I am going to thank you. Kit Juckes, saved by the bell, from SocGen. Thank you so much. Naughty. I had to try.</p><p>All right. We are counting down to the opening bell this morning. Big Tech preparing for the 2020 democratic debates. We've got a story on that which is fascinating. Plenty more to come. You're with FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. That was the opening bell back at the New York Stock Exchange Lending Club with smiling faces. They're ringing the opening bell. Now, we do have a modestly lower open for U.S. stocks this Friday as anticipated. The S&amp;P 500 pulling back from all-time highs hit in Thursday's session.</p><p>Right now, we're losing some seven tenths of one percent as you can see that for the S&amp;P 500. Context everything. Those stocks are on track for the third straight week of gains on hopes, of course, of the new global stimulus as we were just discussing.</p><p>We also saw President Trump seemingly deescalating the tensions with Iran. More on that in just a few moments.</p><p>But I do think that's very important for the session, too. The global movers for now. Slack moving higher for the second straight day after its successful direct listing yesterday. We saw the shares rising almost 50 percent in the first day of trade. It closed over $38.00 a share, well above its reference price of $26.00, adding just three tenths of one percent so far in the session, but bucking the broader trend.</p><p>Canopy Growth higher by some at 2.2 percent. The Canopy producer reporting a wider than expected fourth quarter loss. It says pot sales slowed during the quarter, but investors clearly prepared for that.</p><p>T-Mobile and Sprint are in focus, too. A little bit softer here for Sprint. The two telecom giants facing off in a Federal Court today against a number of powerful U.S. states that want to block the $26 billion merger, so we'll track developments on that throughout the day, too.</p><p>All right, let's bring it back to our top story today. Donald Trump says he pulled back from an attack on Iran because he thought it would cost too many lives. The President saying in a tweet just a few minutes ago that the U.S. was cocked and loaded quote \"to attack three different sites.\" But he changed his mind and called off the attack 10 minutes before it was due to begin when a general told him 150 people would die.</p><p>President Trump said that would not be proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. He also praised the U.S. Military and vowed never to let Iran have nuclear weapons. Oil trading higher in the session as the Iranian situation and the standoff between the two nations heats up.</p><p>This follows with the overnight spike of more than four percent of Brent and crude on news that Iran had downed an American drone.</p><p>Joining us, Jason Bordoff, he is Professor and Founding Director for the Center of Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. He served as White House Energy adviser to President Obama.</p><p>Jason, fantastic to have you with us on the show. What do you make of the intervention here by the President on social media just to point out exactly what happened. All sorts of rumors swirling about this apparent strike and the decision to U-turn after.</p><p>JASON BORDOFF, PROFESSOR AND FOUNDING DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER OF GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: Yes, it's a pretty extraordinary set of tweets this morning, and I think Trump is in a tough position. He sort of boxed himself in.</p><p>It is clear he wants to avoid military confrontation. That's directly what he said. But he also seeking a strategy of maximum pressure against Iran and it's hard to have both of those things at the same time. When you apply maximum pressure and try to take Iran's oil exports to zero and you push Iran up against the wall, they are going to lash out and respond.</p><p>And unless we have a pathway to get to a negotiating table, which seems hard to see right now, you're going to have these tit-for-tat escalatory things, and the more the U.S. doesn't respond to escalation like the drone attack, the more emboldened Iran will feel to continue that sort of action.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, that's the problem here, Jason. You called it tit- for-tat. But we haven't seen the tat yet because the United States was rumored to respond, and then hasn't. How do you deescalate the situation? As you said, what is the path to negotiation here when we've had a series of events here?</p><p>The United States have said they have been down to Iran here, but we've also gotten the other side that the nuclear deal that the United States has stepped away from, finding a pathway to negotiation is incredibly tough.</p><p>BORDOFF: It's very difficult and I don't think it's clear exactly what the criteria are for negotiation and exactly what the U.S. wants to see and how well that's been communicated to Iran.</p><p>So Iran again, when you have your back up against the wall, you're going to lash out. They were not able to take this sort of economic pressure going to zero for oil exports lying down. They had to lash out economically and try to get the U.S. out of its comfort zone that this status quo of zero or even close to zero oil exports was not sustainable from their point of view.</p><p>And then at some point, you're either going to have to find a pathway to the negotiating table or the next Iranian response to the one after that, you know, could really put the U.S. in a position where they have to respond.</p><p>If the U.S. is escorting a tanker through the Strait of Hormuz, and some Iranian military action affects a U.S. target, there's going to be no choice but to respond.</p><p>[09:35:08] CHATTERLEY: You know, we can debate whether that's the right way to act or the wrong way to act, but I just want to bring it back to the markets and what we're seeing.</p><p>In fact, the lack of response that we're seeing in the markets. I mean, a couple of weeks ago, we were talking about a bear market for Brent and crude right now, and we've seen them rally some eight to 10 percent since the two tankers were attacked here.</p><p>Is it just the macro backdrop and the rising in ventures that we're seeing that is nullifying the fact of these tensions and the importance of the region that we're talking about?</p><p>BORDOFF: Well, we've certainly seen the market respond a bit yesterday. I mean, things were muted at first. But oil prices jumped yesterday in response to some of this. And now I think there's more recognition about the geopolitical risk of that, it is in the market that the market is starting to take a little more seriously.</p><p>We see Trump say he is going to meet with Xi at the G20, and so the prospects for a resolution of the trade war, which would be bullish for oil demand are a little bit stronger.</p><p>And the fundamentals in the market are stronger. We see refinery crude runs up, U.S. inventory is starting to draw. So when you look at the fundamentals, as well as the geopolitical risk and the potential for resolution to trade conflict, things do look constructive, at least for the rest of this year, 2020 is still a little bearish just because there's so much supply coming online, especially from the U.S. shale revolution.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, there's so many angles here. What does this mean for OPEC and for the non-OPEC members here, too? I mean, it was struggling to even reach a date for negotiations. Now they have at least, assuming it goes ahead. What does it mean for these guys?</p><p>BORDOFF: OPEC is in a difficult position as again, trying to even reach agreement on what day they were going to meet was difficult; nevertheless, what's going to happen at the meeting. I expect like most people do, they will roll over the agreement. They know failure to reach an agreement would really be bearish for prices. And I think it'd be difficult to get any sort of agreement to do more.</p><p>They're going to have to message this in a way where the market knows that there's flexibility and they stand ready to move in either direction, depending on what happens that you clearly could see a circumstance in which there's resolution of trade conflict and some more geopolitical events in the Middle East, and prices could start to run up.</p><p>On the other hand, it's easy to see a scenario where prices take a down dive later in the year as well. So they're going to have to signal and Saudi Arabia in particular is going to have to signal that it's flexible and is ready to sort of do what's needed to manage the market for the rest of the year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and of course, we've got the European work around potentially coming for U.S. sanctions, too, as far as Iran is concerned. So lots of factors here to consider. Jason, fantastic to get your wisdom on this. Jason Bordoff joining us there. Thank you for joining us on the show.</p><p>BORDOFF: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right. We're going to take a quick break. But coming up on FIRST MOVE, for any startup, there's a balance between taking the risk and the fear of failure. We speak to someone who has lived it and find out what it takes to be fearless. Philanthropist Jean Case joins us in the \"Chatt Room.\" That's next. We're back in two.</p><p>[09:41:06] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously said, \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" In her new book, \"Be Fearless,\" Philanthropist and CEO of the Case Foundation, Jean Case tells the stories of the ordinary people who overcame fear and achieved huge success. I sat down with Jean and discussed what those individuals have in common.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEAN CASE, CEO, CASE FOUNDATION: The subhead is \"Five Principles for a Life of Breakthroughs and Purpose,\" and that really frames the book based on some research we did in 2012 at the Case Foundation looking at core qualities of entrepreneurs, change makers, and innovators.</p><p>And what we found, of course, was it doesn't take any special genius or any special quality, it really is just the application of these five simple principles that help people find tremendous success and breakthroughs.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, the book is a collection of stories of ...</p><p>CASE: It is.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: ... pretty ordinary people -- and I use the term carefully -- having wonderful success in achieving that. What was the common thread among these people? Because you've hinted at it?</p><p>CASE: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The ability to, I guess take a risk and take bets.</p><p>CASE: That's right, the principles really start with a big bet, then taking risks, making failure matter. You know, it turns out in every success story, there was kind of a failure road along the way. But the difference between those that breakthrough and those that don't, is they can look that fear and that failure in the face and push past it and apply those lessons.</p><p>And you know, you're right. I was born in a town called Normal -- Normal, Illinois, and really the message of the book is that it's ordinary people who end up doing extraordinary things.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, because it's kind of an advice book as well, for someone perhaps that is watching this that has a great idea that thinks, \"Look, I don't have the financing. I'm afraid to take my attention away from my family or my job or what I'm doing right now.\" And actually, that innovation and that idea gets lost.</p><p>CASE: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What's your message? And what's the message from the book to those kind of people?</p><p>CASE: Well, as we've talked about, you know, startups are at a 30-year low, and the first chapter of the book is called \"Start Right Where You Are.\" And I talked about, for instance, the Airbnb guys.</p><p>You know, when they got started, their backs were against the wall, they couldn't make rent. So what did they do? They rented out two air mattresses on their floor. They got started right where they were.</p><p>I don't think they were thinking that night, \"Let's disrupt the entire hospitality sector.\" But they took what they had to apply and then you know, slowly but surely built a big business out of that.</p><p>But this make a big bet is an important mindset as you get started. You might take small steps to get there, incremental steps, but the idea is aiming for something big.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Jean Case doesn't just write about being fearless, she has lifted to some degree while working in a secure job at GE, Case took a risk and joined a little known startup at the time called, AOL, a revolutionary company at the time that helped make the internet mainstream though admittedly, it went on to face its own disruption and struggle.</p><p>You just heard her mention that the number of startups in the U.S. right now is at a 30-year low. I asked her why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASE: Well, let me tell you the state of things right now, last year -- just some data to ground it. Last year in the United States, 75 percent of venture capital went to just three places -- New York, California, and Massachusetts. Florida is the third largest state now. It got less than two percent of venture capital.</p><p>Women got less than two percent -- women founders of venture capital last year, and African-American founders, less than one percent.</p><p>So when you take that very siloed, very limited kind of focus of where capital is going, it shouldn't be surprising that we're at a 30-year low.</p><p>What I say is, look, we need all the ideas and all the players on the field and we need to back them all no matter where they're from, no matter what they look like, or what they bring to the table.</p><p>If they have a great idea, let's get mentoring around and let's get support to build new businesses.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is that the fault of the people that want to set up the companies and the startups that they're not making connections or the right connections with venture capital? Or is it that venture capital is not looking outside of those mistakes?</p><p>[09:45:09] CASE: Yes, I think it's quite clear that venture capital is not looking outside, and you know, there's some data that also says, you know, a venture capitalist doesn't want to drive more than 50 or 100 miles from where -- or fly -- from where they are to go see deals, right?</p><p>But this is changing, you know, my husband has led something called rise of the rest, which really is putting the spotlight on innovation all over the nation, particularly between the coast.</p><p>And you know, Julia, we're here, you know, on the stock floor, the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies were founded between the coasts, not in the places that were sending the capital today.</p><p>So we just have to get back to being more diversified in terms of where we're sending capital, and I think it'll lead to more entrepreneurs and more great new businesses.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: There is a message in here for venture capital, though, too, but if we look at what we've seen, from a couple of companies that have just gone public, the likes of Uber, and it has created this big debate about whether actually, too much money is been chucked to these companies by private markets that you're there now, a bad judge of value, and then it comes to the private market, and there's this sort of rationalization and they go, \"Hang on a second, you guys are now underwater yourself because you were giving them money, and it was too expensive.\"</p><p>CASE: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So there's a benefit for both sides.</p><p>CASE: So I do think the valuations have been pretty high. We've seen that. We've also seen some outsized companies that in many cases create such great competition for new companies that are starting that sometimes venture capital says, \"Oh, I don't want to do that, that competes with Google,\" or, \"I don't want to do that, that competes with Facebook.\" And so in a weird way, it's really having a chilling effect on innovation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: As a veteran of a big tech company, Case understands the benefits, but also the drawbacks of potential government regulation. She says far more will be necessary if we don't see change soon.</p><p>But of course, there is a fine line between regulation that protects consumers without also suppressing innovation. I asked if regulators are capable of finding that balance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASE: It really was the breakup of the phone companies that started this whole internet revolution. I know, I spent my career in the internet, when we created AOL, you know, three percent of people were online and they were online one hour a week, okay.</p><p>But it really did take some regulatory support to make sure that the big companies that control all the access to consumers, allowed more competition and that's really what paved the way for AOL. That's really what paved the way for all of the companies that are really, you know, using the internet as the backbone of what they do today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: AOL was a pioneer at that point in the use of the internet, as you said, used at a fraction of the time now. Do you think ultimately, it is other companies, other forms of technology that disrupt the big players right now? Or do you think it is ultimately regulation that perhaps stems the rise of these players?</p><p>CASE: Yes, but it might be a combination, because as I said earlier, you know, we'd love to see new disruptors and that's of course, the trend in American business, the Fortune 500 turns over routinely, because upstarts are nipping at the heels of the big ones.</p><p>But if we have a situation where the big are so big, that now you know, investors don't even want to take a chance on a company that competes. That's a problem. And that's when I think we'll start -- if that continues, I think that's when we're going to see regulation step in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Jean says the ultimate message of her book, \"Be Fearless\" is not how to live without fear, but just how to push through it. I asked her how she finds that courage within herself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASE: I still feel like I live with fear all the time. What I've learned to do is push past it. And you know, I don't know, I credit my mom, really in the book. I was the youngest of four kids raised by a single mom. And I think she can get up every day with a smile on her face and make it all work and push past what I know must have been daily fear. And I think that was a real inspiration for me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Mom, and that is my case. All right, let's move on. Democrats assemble when they take the stage for next week for the first U.S. presidential debates, it will be a big night for politics, but maybe also Big Tech. We will explain after this. We're back in two.</p><p>[09:51:19] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show and a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Apple supplier, Foxconn is preparing for a new boss for the first time in 45 years.</p><p>Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou says he is stepping down preparing to run for the Presidency of Taiwan. Liu Yang-wei will take over operating the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer said Gou on Friday. Analysts say the handover is just a formality meaning Gou is likely to keep control of the company.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch is recovering from pneumonia and is now doing well according to two people familiar with the matter. The 88-year-old's health is a particular focus for investors as his companies enter a new phase after they sold a large part of the media empire 21st Century Fox to Disney last year.</p><p>Walmart has settled an international bribery investigation with the U.S. government paying nearly $218 million. The case involves the retailer's businesses in Brazil, China, India and Mexico.</p><p>The investigation accused Walmart of having a lack of oversight of anti- corruption measures.</p><p>Two nights, 20 Democrats, trolls and a Big Tech focus. Silicon Valley is bracing for the first U.S. presidential debates next week. We now know debate nights were heavily targeted by Russian trolls back in the 2016 campaign.</p><p>CNN Business has learned that Facebook and Twitter plan to watch their social media platforms like a hawk for any unusual activity.</p><p>Donie O'Sullivan is standing by with all the details. Donie, a fascinating story. I was reading this again earlier this morning. What exactly happened in 2016? And what measures are the Big Tech firms going to take to try and control the fallout this time around?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Julia, these tech companies desperately do not want to be the story next Thursday and Friday morning. They want the debate to -- the stories from the debates to be based on what the candidates are saying not is what is happening on Twitter and on Facebook.</p><p>We know in 2016 that Russia targeted the American political process. They had sent millions of tweets and Facebook posts over a number of years, and as part of all the investigations going into that activity, we have this huge trove of data -- the post, the tweets from 2016 -- and we can see on debate night, right from the start of the Democratic primaries and the GOP primaries in 2015, all the way to the final the presidential debates in October 2016 that Russian trolls loved debate nights, and they were particularly spreading messages that were really, I guess, seeking to undermine the whole concept of the debate.</p><p>A lot of, you know, reviewing the posts and a lot of it was sort of putting out, \"Well, what's the point of these debates. It doesn't even matter.\" And that sort of just trying to sow division I guess, but also questioning at the entire democratic process.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Speaking of undermining the case here. Facebook and Twitter are going to work together, but I just remind myself of the conversation we've been having about the Nancy Pelosi fake news video that Facebook wouldn't take down. YouTube, of course did so we should draw that distinction.</p><p>But how can you say, look, we're going to tackle one source of fake news, but not be willing to take down fake videos like that? I just -- I just see so many conflicts here and I'm not sure the message is clear. I don't really trust what they're doing here. Am I right? Or am I wrong here? Am I overanalyzing?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Well, I think they certainly have -- there's certainly a trust problem with these platforms with Silicon Valley. And Nancy Pelosi herself came out in the weeks after that video and said, you know, Facebook, essentially wittingly is aiding Russia or peddlers of disinformation by not removing this sort of content.</p><p>[09:55:02] O'SULLIVAN: I mean, this is sort of I think the nightmare situation for Facebook and Twitter as a business is that what if a fake video emerges after the debate that makes it look like candidates said something or is caught in some sort of way that is extremely misleading and it goes viral on Facebook on Wednesday or Thursday night? Will Facebook decide to remove that or will they do this thing where they say they down rank it, it is seen by less people, but it's still on the platform?</p><p>So there's going to be plenty of debates. There's going to be plenty of opportunity for this sort of stuff to happen, and I know that Facebook and Twitter at least are going to be watching it very closely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, tough to gauge what success looks like here. And yes, we shall see, Donie O'Sullivan, thank you so much for that story. Fantastic. Fantastic news gathering there.</p><p>All right, that just about wraps up the show. I'll give you a look once again in what we're seeing for markets under a bit of pressure, a lot going on of course with tensions in the Middle East.</p><p>I'll be back in a couple of hours' time to keep you abreast of all those stories, but for now that's it for the show.

And this is how things are looking. We are up, but barely. A roller coaster sort of session. The numbers involved aren't very large, but we are holding on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interesting to see if we hold those gains as we get to the closing bell, because those are the markets. And these are the reasons why. Donald Trump is en route to the G20 in Osaka. He's armed with threats for almost every one of his allies. Big tech companies don't escape the President's wrath. He is now calling for Federal lawsuits against them. And chip stocks are soaring. Micron finds a way to work with Huawei. We are live in the world's financial capital, New York City on Wednesday. It is the 26th of June. I am Richard Quest. Yes, I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Tonight, it's Donald Trump versus the world or so it would appear. The U.S. President is on his way to the most important Summit of the year. It's the G20 being held in Osaka in Japan. And the U.S. President has lashed out at his perceived enemies at home and abroad.</p><p>Despite a range of crises from Iran to the trade war into a public fight with the Fed, it's been the best June for the Dow in decades. And the President says countries around the world have been taking advantage of the U.S. He'll set them straight at the G20.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am meeting with Russia. I am meeting with China -- countries. We are meeting with many countries. We have many things -- we've been ripped off by everybody over the years. They're not ripping us off anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: \"They're not ripping us off anymore.\" The President was in a combative mood ahead of his flight to Japan. On China, he says he won't make a deal unless Beijing opens up. He will be meeting President Xi Jinping at the G20 and he blamed his predecessors, Obama and Bush for putting him in this situation in the first place. He says more tariffs are at the ready.</p><p>And then to Vietnam, which is benefiting from the trade war with China. He says the Vietnamese are almost the single worst abuser of everybody on trade.</p><p>Europe was next -- worse than China, according to the President. And Silicon Valley, well, Donald Trump says tech companies should be sued for trying to rig the 2016 election against him.</p><p>And finally, his nemesis, du jour, Jerome Powell at the Fed. \"I made him,\" Trump says, \"Now he's trying to prove how tough he is.\" The President says he can fire Powell if he wants to. All right, David Gergen.</p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hello, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Where do you want to start with that? First of all, I mean, that's a Vietnam only last week, two weeks ago, he was praising how companies would be going to Vietnam.</p><p>GERGEN: Yes or moving towards us, and he wanted to be the one man who runs a country. He has been trying to get rid of all of them or quiet down all the dissonance and take all the power to himself. Now, he wants to be the one man running the world. What you see is someone say, here's what -- here's what the future is, unless you do it, I'm going to blow you in one way or the other. I'm going to penalize you, you're going to get hurt, starting with China.</p><p>Now, you know, the fact is, he is -- he has got a lot of problems with the Fed in part because he has talked himself into a trade war with China.</p><p>QUEST: You've talked about the Fed, just listen to what he had to say about the Fed.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have a man that doesn't -- he doesn't do anything for us. Nobody ever heard of him before. And now, I made him and he wants to show how tough he is. Okay, let him show how tough he is. He's a -- he is not doing a good job. I have the right to demote him. I have the right to -- I have the right to fire him. I never suggested I was going to do that. I do have the right to do it. But let me just tell you, he has to lower interest rates for us to compete with China.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The President is obsessed by reminding everybody that he has the right to fire people.</p><p>GERGEN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>GERGEN: Because he wants to be the one man who runs the world. And if he can fire everybody, everybody is acting in key positions. Yes, he can brush them off and dismiss them. But let's come back to the Fed. This is pretty serious. I don't think most Americans yet appreciate how important the independence of the Fed has been to our economic performance.</p><p>You know, before we had the Fed, Congress made a monetary policy and we had boom and bust cycles. You know, we have boom periods, but we have terrible depressions that came along regularly. And that's why Congress, you know, over a century ago, created the Fed and made it an independent body.</p><p>QUEST: What is startling about this with the Fed is the divergence over previous Presidents who wouldn't even talk about it.</p><p>[15:05:08] GERGEN: That's right.</p><p>QUEST: If you ask the President, you give me the words, if you ask about the dollar or ask about the Fed, what would they say?</p><p>GERGEN: Yes, they would say nothing. They would basically say it's not my province. But I've been in a room, I've been in the Cabinet, in the Oval Office when Presidents have exploded about the Fed, but then they calm down, and what their economic adviser start to say to them, I remember Bob Rubin doing this very clearly with Bill Clinton, for example.</p><p>He said, \"If you go out and bang on the Fed, and say they've got a lower interest rates, the acoustic et cetera,\" you only challenge their manhood. There's only one way to respond to a challenge and that is to go the other direction.</p><p>And they will -- it will cost you basis points upon basis points. If you go out and publicly attack the Fed. That hasn't yet happened, but Powell is under pressure.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But is the President, do you think looking to create Powell the scape goat?</p><p>GERGEN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: So that he can turn to the public next year? And say it would have been fine. But for the man who can't answer that.</p><p>GERGEN: This is the question about. It's like -- he is setting up -- the most important things going on the White House right now is to win reelection. Everything else revolves around that.</p><p>And if he's got three percent growth, but he looks like he's still down 10 points, what does he want to get to? He wants to get four percent or to be able to say, Powell, the Federal Reserve, they they'd just done what I wanted them to do, we'd be at four percent growth, we'd be at five percent growth.</p><p>QUEST: It's a very persuasive argument.</p><p>GERGEN: It's a persuasive argument.</p><p>QUEST: Because the Fed probably did err on the side too much of caution in raising rates too high.</p><p>GERGEN: I agree with that. I agree with that. But the more you look like you're bullying the Fed, the less confidence people have in the natural arc. How do businesses plan if the President may be on the verge of firing the Fed Chairman? Not well.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Back to the G20. The G7, last year -- I think it was last year. I've lost track, the Canadian G7 where he stormed off a day earlier at the end. I mean, what's going to happen in Osaka? Do you think that they will -- is he going to chest beat and brow beat or will we see that other ability of Donald Trump, which is to become chameleon charming?</p><p>GERGEN: Yes. Well, you know, the biggest meeting he has got obviously with Xi on Saturday in Osaka, right? A 90-minute meeting he is going to have. And this is where they're going to get to trade talks back on track or not.</p><p>And I thought up until today that they'll reach an agreement. Trade talks will start again. It will be very, very difficult, but at least they'll be talking.</p><p>Today when he comes out and makes him bully Xi and bullies China that becomes less possible for Xi. His manhood has been challenged, too. You can't run the world by yourself.</p><p>QUEST: Is the situation deteriorating?</p><p>GERGEN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: With this President?</p><p>GERGEN: Well, I think what we're seeing now is accumulation of unsolved problems. Problems we thought we had a breakthrough with North Korea, we thought we'd have a breakthrough, you know, with the Chinese. We thought we'd have a breakthrough with Venezuela. We thought we'd have a breakthrough with Iran.</p><p>All of those things are not happening and now, to go after Europe, too? It's good to see you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you as always. Thank you, sir.</p><p>GERGEN: Okay, as always, sir.</p><p>QUEST: All right. To the markets, let me show you what's been happening over there. Well, first of all, we'll just stop on the way with the Dow. We are -- we've barely moved, two points since we started a few moments ago.</p><p>U.S. stocks are rising. They are rising on the optimism that there will be trade talk progress at the G20. Reports say the U.S. could suspend tariffs on China during any such negotiations.</p><p>Tech stocks are showing the biggest gains, and driving the gains -- look at this, Micron Technology at 12 percent, four and change. The memory chipmaker is up strongly after it announced it had found a way around the U.S. ban on Huawei and said it had resumed shipments to one of its largest customers. That boosted the rest of the chip sector as well.</p><p>Clare Sebastian is with me. We need to understand. We need to understand, Clare, what this work around is? But before we do, what do they supply?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: So they supply essentially -- they are a big supplier of microchips both in things like servers and in mobile phones and things like in China and China, of course, the world's biggest consumer of semiconductors.</p><p>QUEST: So how did they find this workaround?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So I think -- I wouldn't necessarily call it a workaround. There are exemptions to the restrictions of placing Huawei on the entity list. It's things like if a product is produced outside of the U.S. or if contains less than 25 percent U.S. made parts.</p><p>There is an attorney I spoke to today said, it's not up for interpretation. This is actually in the letter of the law, but it just takes a little bit of time for them to work out which of their products are actually exempt.</p><p>And there's a lot at stake here, Richard. The penalties, if it's civil penalties, it's up to $300,000.00 per violation. If it seems to be criminal, so if they knew what they were doing was wrong, then it could be up to -- it could be in the millions.</p><p>QUEST: Maybe I may have not been following as closely as one should. Just remind me what the U.S. restriction on the Huawei actually is at the moment?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So they have placed Huawei on what's called the entity list. This is a Commerce Department tool, which basically means that if U.S. companies want to supply them, want to export any of their products to Huawei, they need to get a license to do it.</p><p>[15:10:06] SEBASTIAN: Obviously, there are as I said, some exceptions to that. But essentially, that led to an industry wide and the semiconductor industry - an industry wide blockade. They all stopped suddenly, because as I said the risk of getting it wrong are so high, and they spent the last few weeks working out what they could do.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, so they've clearly found what they can do.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right.</p><p>QUEST: How easy would it be for the administration to close those -- I mean, loopholes, it sounds like they've done something crafty, but you know, what I mean. Tighten the restrictions, so that which is possible is no longer?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So they could. And in fact, the Micron CEO said on their earnings call last night that they say -- that they are not out of woods when it comes to uncertainty. There's still considerable uncertainty around this. They don't exactly know the volumes of product or the time span of things they're going to be able to ship to Huawei and they don't know when the administration is going to turn around and change its mind and add more restrictions.</p><p>There are other tools they can use, the Treasury Department for example, has the SDN list which is even tighter restriction than the entity listen from the Commerce Department.</p><p>QUEST: And in terms of Huawei's business, in terms of the sales it does in the United States, the phones that it might ship here?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right. Well, I mean, Huawei -- it was from the very beginning, it was defiant about this and said we will survive this blacklist, but it is starting to show the cracks. The sales were down from the middle of May to middle of June about 40 percent. They are losing potentially access to Facebook apps, to Google Apps. This is going to considerably reduce the attractiveness of their phones worldwide. And also 5G I think will be impacted by the U.S. entity list.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you very much indeed, as always.</p><p>Stay with technology and Blackberry wants to boost its business with Beijing. The former phone maker is walking the tightrope between its Five Eyes customers and trade tensions with China.</p><p>Eleni Giokos spoke to the Chief Executive earlier, John Chen. And Chen says there is room to grow in the software industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CHEN, CEO, BLACKBERRY: This year, we will do about a billion dollars -- a little bit over a billion in software, and it particularly cybersecurity and security software. And I think there's a lot of room to grow in that space.</p><p>Hardware is -- it is reasonably a difficult market, especially like you talk about the supply chain right now because of all the U.S. and Canada, U.S. and Mexico and U.S. and China, we have a lot of discussion on different part of the supply chain. And I think -- I'm actually a little bit glad that we are not in the hardware today because of the logistics and the supply chain thing part of the problem.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN BUSINESS AFRICA CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Okay, so national security, one of the big things that is playing out when it comes to negotiations between the U.S. and China regarding the trade negotiations, how do you see this playing out? And is it affecting your business in any way?</p><p>I know you're in the software game, but you've got customers around the world?</p><p>CHEN: Yes, good question. You know, because of the fact that Blackberry is a big supplier of mobile software and security software to the Five Eyes countries, the countries that share intelligence, and most of all the G20 countries, we don't do a lot in China, part of them was for export reasons, part of them is you know, the Chinese government also wanted to have a control of their own security system, which we respect.</p><p>I would like to do more with the Chinese government, but at this point in time, we haven't done that. And so given that, we're not really highly impacted at all.</p><p>GIOKOS: You said earlier that you want to get into China, you wouldn't like to work in China, how soon can you pull that off? And can you do it knowing that, you know, your home base is basically you know, going up against the Chinese in a sense? We are seeing retaliation on both sides?</p><p>CHEN: Yes, yes, of course, we will have to work, you know, collaborative with all my major customers and in U.S. and Canada, and U.K. and Australia, and so forth. So this is why we haven't been big in China or get any traction there.</p><p>But you know, I'm hoping somewhere around the world that we could work on things that are not -- that I don't know, maybe as sensitive. So this is just something that is that desire more than what we're doing today.</p><p>GIOKOS: We've had earnings out today, you're up 23 percent on revenue and coming through a transient $67 million, it largely was in line or slightly beat analyst expectations, but you still lost making -- you brought that down to around, you know, sitting at about $30 million. That's pretty good in the sense, but you're still lost making, how are you going to reverse these losses and get into profitability?</p><p>CHEN: We have been profitable for many, many years. And we actually are profitable on a non-GAAP basis by making a penny a share, but a big part of the reasons is because we are making a big investment in a company called Cylance, cybersecurity like artificial intelligence company at $1.4 billion a quarter ago. So we're just absorbing that that company and this is why when you said we have a loss, but on a non-GAAP basis, we are actually making money.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: John Chen over at Blackberry. Coming up next, Wayfair is shaken into action. Some of its workers have taken a stand against making a profit from selling to a migrant detention center. In a moment.</p><p>[15:18:16] QUEST: To the story, walking off the job in solidarity with asylum seekers. Workers at the online retailer, Wayfair took to the streets outside the company's Boston headquarters. They are not the only angry ones. Top Democrats including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren have criticized the online furniture company from profiting from selling beds to a migrant detention center.</p><p>CNN has learned the Wayfair plans to donate $100,000.00 to the American Red Cross. They are trying to address the employee backlash. It's become a much more urgent issue in the U.S. because part of this image.</p><p>A moment of silence is appropriate for the death of a father still holding his daughter face down in the waters of the Rio Grande as they tried to come to the United States for what they hoped and believed would be a safer life.</p><p>Cristina Alesci is with me. The juxtaposition, of course of the two is, what is the offensiveness about all of this, but you know, as a business program, I'm bound to ask you, what did Wayfair wrong?</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, that is up for debate right now. Clearly the employees feel like Wayfair did something wrong in actually selling these beds to a nonprofit that operated an immigrant facility. You know, one of these centers where they hold migrants where there's much debate on whether or not the conditions are safe and sanitary and whether these people being treated with respect.</p><p>[15:20:02] ALESCI: This is not an uncommon position for a company to be walking this line in this administration. We've seen a number of companies get caught in this controversial debate on immigration and how to handle migrants in this country.</p><p>I will say in the case of Wayfair, what happened was Wayfair, in response - - in immediate response to this was, look, we cannot prohibit selling based on the political beliefs of our employees and it issued a statement pretty much saying that yesterday.</p><p>This morning, I broke the news that it planned to donate $100,000.00 to the American Red Cross without mentioning by the way that it was profit from the sale of that bedroom furniture that was going to the migrant facility.</p><p>QUEST: You know, I can now -- I can see the argument both ways if Wayfair doesn't sell it, somebody else will. And if the beds and whatever it is that was not bought, then the conditions which are already appalling, would be worse.</p><p>ALESCI: Would be worse. Right, and that's certainly an argument you can make. The other argument that I've heard people make close to the company is where do you draw the line, if you allow your employees political leanings to determine what, who you can and cannot sell for? It's a slippery slope, you know, abortion is a big issue.</p><p>Do you start -- do you not sell to religious institutions that, you know, are anti-abortion? So the line becomes very gray, and it's arguably a slippery slope for companies.</p><p>On the flip side, this is such a controversial issue for --</p><p>QUEST: That's the point.</p><p>ALESCI: And the image that we -- that very disturbing image is haunting everyone today. So there are arguments to be made on both sides. At the end of the day, companies are going to have to figure this out.</p><p>I mean, last year, you remember, the airlines told the administration, please stop using our airplanes to transport migrant children. So the companies -- I hear this every day behind closed doors from CEOs and executives who are terrified that they're going to find one of these problems underneath their operations.</p><p>QUEST: But this is -- I mean, whenever you can talk about transgender bathrooms in the Carolinas --</p><p>ALESCI: I coverered that story, too.</p><p>QUEST: Right, there was a certain commonality of view amongst companies, then you go to the issue of say, the abortion issue, which is now of course taking place in one of the states. And finally, you end up at this one where there is real horror, the inhumane treatment. But if you're a CEO, what do you do?</p><p>ALESCI: Well, here's the thing. Yesterday, when this happened, customers took to Twitter basically with screenshots of their deleted Wayfair accounts. This stock price took a hit.</p><p>So when you have a backlash like that that's hitting your bottom line. Unfortunately, we're talking about profit here at the end of the day. So that is a motivating factor.</p><p>QUEST: I wonder whether it really matters if that's what motivates you in the end to do what's right.</p><p>ALESCI: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, as always, thank you. Excellent reporting. The border issue is likely to dominate the first debate of the 2020 primary season.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has already been to visit children in a U.S. detention center at the border with Mexico. She's among tonight's 10 White House hopefuls competing in the first event.</p><p>Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, along with Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris are among the heavy hitters on Thursday night's lineup.</p><p>The key topics in addition to the border crisis, taxes, including how to write off student debts, climate change, Green New Deal, and of course, universal healthcare. Gloria Borger is CNN's chief political analyst, she joins me now. Good to see you.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Good to see you.</p><p>QUEST: So, let's just wrap up if we may the border issue. And yes, I guess, you know, the Democrats will be united in condemning the administration for what it's doing. But will they actually have a plan? It's fine to say we don't like what you're doing. But if there are hundreds of thousands of people that are coming across the border, don't you have to have a plan?</p><p>BORGER: Well, the House today just passed a four and a half billion dollar bill, which deals with some of the issue, honestly, immigration reform, true comprehensive immigration reform, we do we deal with the entire issue. But you know, Congress and the President have not been able to agree on that. And the Senate will pass a separate bill.</p><p>The question is, will they be able to resolve their differences and do it quickly? The President spoke to the Speaker of the House today. They seem to be trying to work on it. The picture seems to be moving people, but I wish I could say, \"Oh, sure they're going to get it done tomorrow.\"</p><p>QUEST: So tonight in the debate, what do they do? What does each of those candidates do to try and distinguish and differentiate their position?</p><p>[15:25:06] BORGER: Well, I think the Democrats largely agree with each other about what to do when it comes to asylum and what to do when it comes to immigration. And what they will do this evening, I believe, is attack the President, which is why you see so many of them.</p><p>You mentioned Elizabeth Warren going down there to kind of look at the conditions and they will say, this is the President's fault, we haven't been able to get real reform, et cetera et cetera and building a wall is not the answer.</p><p>So they're not going to take on each other.</p><p>QUEST: So where will they take on each other?</p><p>BORGER: When will?</p><p>QUEST: Where? What will be the moment there are sparks?</p><p>BORGER: Well, don't forget, tonight, Elizabeth Warren is front and center. She is not on the stage with Bernie Sanders, whom she might disagree with, or Joe Biden, whom she might disagree with. They are on the next night.</p><p>So tonight, what each of these people have to do is introduce themselves to the American public, it's a job interview. A lot of people don't know who they are. And Congressman Ryan, the other day described it perfectly. He said, it is speed dating with the American public. And that's exactly what it is this evening.</p><p>I'm not so sure they're going to be attacking each other because when you do that early on, and if you're on the attack, you're the one who doesn't look good. So don't expect to see a lot of that.</p><p>QUEST: Will any of them have learned from the way Donald Trump behaved in -- because there were 17 of them and I always remember, Dan Quayle, after he got the nomination, saying, \"This man is a winner. He took on 17 of his party's best and beat them.\"</p><p>BORGER: Right. And maybe you would do that in the general or as it gets closer, and you have fewer candidates. But right now, right now, what a candidate has to do, who is not well known is say, \"Hello, this is who I am. This is what I stand for and this is what I can do.\"</p><p>For example, the Governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee, a lot of people don't know who he is, but he is a single issue candidate on climate change.</p><p>So a candidate like that would talk about what he stands for. And what these people have to do, what Warren is working on, we are told is kind of condensing all of her policies into a minute.</p><p>Don't forget, there is not a lot of time, she will get more speaking time tonight, because people might talk about her, and then she gets to respond. But I don't think they're going to attack her.</p><p>They might say, you know, I disagree with you on, on how you're approaching healthcare or education. But I don't think it's going to be frontal attack.</p><p>QUEST: As the process moves on, the Biden strategy of ignore your opponents and concentrate on the opponent. And I mean, you could end up with them old trying to do that couldn't you?</p><p>BORGER: Right, but I'm not so sure Biden can hold on to that strategy for very long. No, because, you know, they're trying to protect him, it seems to me, and you can't look like your campaign is trying to protect you. You have to look like you're going to go out there and fight.</p><p>So he doesn't want to inspire attacks from other Democrats, although he will get it on the second night. He will. He will, because they disagree with him on a lot of things. And he's had position changes.</p><p>But I think right now, the President has done a lot to elevate Joe Biden, but Biden has to come out there and prove that he is really working for this.</p><p>QUEST: So finally, and as we start with the process, we've covered a few elections.</p><p>BORGER: A few.</p><p>QUEST: What do you make of it? Do you get excited at this point? As it gets underway, just sort of --</p><p>BORGER: I do. Look, I love elections. I'm a political junkie. I have not yet seen the candidate at the Democratic side that pops out at me.</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>BORGER: No. That says this is the person to take on Donald Trump. That has to develop over time. It's not one of these things where Donald Trump stood out like a sore thumb during his primary, but it worked for him in the end, right?</p><p>It worked for him. We haven't seen that yet this time. So I'm looking forward to all these debates to see who comes out that way.</p><p>QUEST: I'm looking forward to having you help us.</p><p>BORGER: Thanks a lot. Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, President Trump wants to beat Europe to the punch. He's suing big tech. Busy day.</p><p>[15:30:00] RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. Facebook and Twitter send more executives to Capitol Hill. Donald Trump says they could face federal lawsuits. The companies, that is not the executives.</p><p>And everyone from Shake Shack to Taylor Swift wants a piece of the pride week. The CEO of GLAAD will be with me. Whether -- has Pride become too commercial, is it all about the money? And from companies that don't really stand for what's behind it, before all of that, this is CNN and here, the news always comes first.</p><p>Insulting, illegal and confrontational. Those are some of the things Iran's Foreign Minister has called the U.S. after President Trump threatened to retaliate for any attack on America with obliteration. Javad Zarif told CNN, the United States is in no position to obliterate Iran.</p><p>French prosecutors says there are no signs of criminal intent in the fire that devastated the world's famous Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

The companies -- though Europe doesn't get there first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You have a woman in Europe, I won't mention her name --</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Right --</p><p>TRUMP: But she's actually considered to take Jean-Claude's place --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh --</p><p>TRUMP: Because Jean-Claude at some point is retiring. She hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I've ever met.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>TRUMP: What she does to our country, she's suing all our companies, you know, look, we should be suing Google and Facebook and all that which perhaps we will, OK?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The person he's referring to is Margrethe Vestager who could well be still in the running to be the new president of the commission, but that's one side. The new threat comes at a tense time for the industry. Facebook and Twitter executives were grilled today on Capitol Hill about what they're doing to counter misinformation.</p><p>[15:35:00] It's the first public hearing since the release of a manipulated video featuring the house Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Donie O'Sullivan joins me. What would -- I mean, this idea of suing. Why does the president want to do it before Europe gets their first and what is he suing for?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, that's not entirely clear what the president would want to sue these companies for. Donald Trump sort of frames the argument against big tech and perceived conservative bias against conservatives in a first amendment free speech setting.</p><p>The fact is the first amendment does not apply to these companies. Facebook, Twitter, Google can all regulate and moderate these platforms as they see fit under current law. So, there is a broader conversation to have on the roll that these companies play as the modern public square. But the angle that Trump's coming at, it doesn't --</p><p>QUEST: But Europe also been -- Europe has also been aiming to at least enforce against these companies. So, are we likely to see a race to the courts?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: I don't think so. There's you know, I think here in the United States, we are seeing a bigger conversation even today. Conservatives saying to these platforms, you guys are suppressing our speech and we want to basically regulate you more. So, it's the conservatives, it's the Republicans who are saying we're going to enforce more regulation here whereby you guys can't run the platform as you see fit.</p><p>QUEST: And also this idea of suing them because of -- for damages over the 2016 election, how realistic is any of this?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: I mean, I think even with the president's comments this morning, it wasn't precisely clear what he was getting at. You know, these companies have been -- we're likely to see Facebook getting a big FTC fine because of privacy violations here. They're obviously going to -- they have a lot of challenges when it comes to anti-trust on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>But when it comes to the freedom of speech issue, that seems further down the road. And in fact, Mark Zuckerberg actually wants these -- wants the government to step in and give them some more guidance on speech. He says we shouldn't in Silicon Valley --</p><p>QUEST: No, why should they take all the blame when the government can shoulder some of it too. But at the end of the day, wasn't all of this inevitable? The speed with which these social media networks grew, nothing had ever been seen like this before. So, it was inevitable that regulatory environment would lag the actual reality.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes, I mean, I think we saw a certain euphoria with all new tech, but particularly with this -- with these social media platforms since the Arab Spring, and that was seen as a good thing -- good thing initially, and then we started to see how social media could be used in ways that weren't so positive.</p><p>So definitely, I think there's -- the regulators are very far behind on this, we're now seeing that Facebook is really staffing up in D.C. and in Brussels, they want to -- they want to now be a part of the regular framework --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: They want to be able to help right this.</p><p>QUEST: And if we look at Nick Clegg of course, his first major speeches, he's the chief spokesman now for Facebook. If we look at those first speeches, have -- we're in Brussels.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: That's correct, yes, and he's -- yes, they are engaging in Europe, but also as much in D.C. Clegg has an interesting approach when it comes to Facebook. He's out there very much on these sort of offensive sort of saying that the media and others are blowing out of proportion the sort of bad things that Facebook has been responsible for.</p><p>But then when you start to scratch the surface, you see that they have a lot of cleaning up to do in house, so it will be interesting to see how Clegg's language changes.</p><p>QUEST: Good to have you with us, thank you very much --</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Indeed. Now though, our next guest left Silicon Valley, he wants to help companies that make things for regular people. The new chief experience officer at Publicis Sapient joins me next. What does a chief experience officer actually do? That's one of the first questions we need to establish in a moment.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Well, welcome back. Mark Zuckerberg is due to speak at the Aspen Ideas Festival in the next hour with his company facing crisis on many fronts. He'll discuss government regulation and privacy. Now, the next guest turned his back on Silicon Valley, now, he wants to work with the next generation of tech companies at one of the world's most famous advertising houses.</p><p>John Maeda is in the C-suite joining me now, good to see you sir, thank you. He is the --</p><p>JOHN MAEDA, CHIEF EXPERIENCE OFFICER, PUBLICIS SAPIENT: Good to be here --</p><p>QUEST: New chief experience officer at Publicis Sapient. What does the chief experience officer do?</p><p>MAEDA: Well, the best way to understand it is to understand what a Publicis Sapient does, which is, it takes technology and brings experience to it. Kind of like this set, it's a full experience, but it's only as good as a technology inside it. And so my job is to be able to melt those two together with the fluency that I bring.</p><p>QUEST: The -- one thing a Publicis is being a very traditional conservative French advertising and consultancy group. So, this is to some extent a different -- not a different direction but an advancement.</p><p>MAEDA: Well, it's the -- it's the part of the Publicis' network, Publicis Sapient, that is the technology company. And a simple example is how I hadn't heard of it until last year, but I know that I was in the airports, and the airports I see McDonald's getting more technologically fluent. Screens everywhere, mobile app, et cetera.</p><p>I was like, how did they transform themselves? That's the kind of thing a Publicis Sapient does.</p><p>QUEST: One of the fascinating areas of your work is the opposite of the start-up, isn't it?</p><p>MAEDA: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: You have a name for that.</p><p>MAEDA: The End-Up.</p><p>QUEST: The End-Up. Now, I love this, explain.</p><p>MAEDA: Well, you know, a start-up wants to grow up and end up successful. A company that's established has ended up successful but wants to know how a start-up does its stuff.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and the danger is the End Up ends up looking like your parent's disco dancing.</p><p>MAEDA: Oh my gosh, you say that so perfectly. You want to be the cool parent is my point. And so to be a cool parent end up, you have to inject yourself with start-up technology.</p><p>QUEST: How -- which traditional companies do you think have done that best? Name some companies that you're really impressed with the way, you know, whether it'd be a GE or a McDonald's that you say, that has managed to give itself the cachet of a start-up entrepreneurial spirit?</p><p>MAEDA: Well, they are trying really hard. And it's hard --</p><p>QUEST: Too hard.</p><p>MAEDA: And it's hard because innovation in a big company is a bad word. When you're in a big company and your title is innovation, it means you might like go away during a recession. So, the challenge for the End-Ups is to embrace transformation, the technology as not a risk, but a core essential competence.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think that makes a difference if technology is already part of your -- you know, the company's DNA? For example, airlines --</p><p>MAEDA: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: You know, airlines, they're obsessed by data, they're obsessed by technology and obviously obsessed by safety. But even airlines are having difficulty understanding how these new technologies and new distribution channels can benefit them.</p><p>MAEDA: Right, well, you know, airlines are technology-oriented, but I learned in the process of about living with Publicis Sapient is that this company was the one that figured out how to do the online reservation seating thing.</p><p>[15:45:00] That came from Publicis Sapient a long time ago. So, technology -- airplane company can -- has to fly airplanes, but the systems have to come in, you need a turbo assist and that's where this kind of company comes into play.</p><p>QUEST: Do you prefer working with end or start-ups, End-Ups or start ups?</p><p>MAEDA: Oh, I love end-ups because that's the way most of our economy was built, and they're having a hard time playing the start-up game.</p><p>QUEST: And when it comes to working with companies --</p><p>MAEDA: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Do you prefer pure tech app based or some of that -- or a company that makes something or a table, a garment --</p><p>MAEDA: Indeed --</p><p>QUEST: A suit --</p><p>MAEDA: Right --</p><p>QUEST: That has to adapt technology into it?</p><p>MAEDA: I'm so glad you asked that question because the reality is that an app is not enough, it's the entire experience. Like your beautiful studio here, every piece of it is technology but also experience. So, it isn't just about what you can see here, it's also the infrastructure of this studio. So, it's the whole stack.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed for coming in, much appreciate it --</p><p>MAEDA: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much --</p><p>MAEDA: OK.</p><p>QUEST: Look, you can see our wonderful studio here, magnificent now. Coming up, the world's biggest brands show their colors, it is pride week. World Pride in New York, 50th anniversary of the stonewall uprisings. The problem is the critics say the event that was once a force for social change has become a corporate cash grab. The CEO of GLAAD is with us after the break.</p><p>QUEST: You can't miss it wherever you are in New York -- in fact around the world in London, Singapore, Sydney and suddenly here in New York in the last week. In store windows and shop fronts around the world, and it is rainbow flags everywhere. And the reason, of course, it's -- June is always pride month.</p><p>But June this year, well, the celebrations are much greater because they culminate this weekend with parades planned in major cities around the world, and here in New York there, of course, it is World Pride. The celebrating -- we're commemorating the 50th anniversary of the stonewall uprisings in the city.</p><p>This year more than ever, major corporations are going out to show their support the LGBTQ-plus community. So, what have you got? You've got fast- food chain, the Shake Shack is adorning its drinks with rainbow toppings. Colgate is encouraging customers to smile with pride and Spotify is releasing special playlists celebrating LGBT artists.</p><p>[15:50:00] Even as I came in today from New York Airport, the ground on the floor of the carpet had all been painted in rainbow. Not everyone is happy that the corporates cash-in. Critics say Pride has become too commercialized, a rival march is being staged here in New York, its organizers called the main event of corporate extravaganza.</p><p>Joining me in the C-suite, Sarah Kate Ellis is the CEO of the LGBT right GLAAD. Corporate extravaganza. How do you balance the inclusion, you need corporations on board because that brings acceptance within society. How do you balance it?</p><p>SARAH KATE ELLIS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GLAAD: So, I think it's important that you're not just using the community as a marketing tactic. This is about joining -- being a good citizen and joining a movement and not just marketing to a community for the month of June. What are you doing the other 11 months of the year?</p><p>What have you done internally? What are you policies? So, you have to look internally first and foremost and see, do you support your own LGBTQ employees and then go external.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but that -- I mean, let's say Google, for example, in San Francisco which is asking -- I mean, Google is -- in the company are asking for Pride to delist Google over various problems because they say exactly that, the company is not walking the walk.</p><p>ELLIS: Well, many companies -- we work with many companies and we evaluate whether or not they're walking the walk and talking the talk. And I think a lot are trying to -- it's also really important, P&amp;G is a great example. They explored their history on being LGBTQ inclusive. And what they discovered was they actually weren't. And they put a film together with CNN specials about that and exposing themselves.</p><p>QUEST: If you walk through the mole here at Hudson Yards where we are or anywhere, the places are wash with rainbows. Does it -- does it satisfy you? Does it please you or does it somewhat frustrate you that these are just jumping on the bandwagon? Which is it?</p><p>ELLIS: I think it pleases me overall because I know that as corporates embrace the LGBTQ community, they're embracing us as employees and they are embracing us outwardly and that builds acceptance.</p><p>QUEST: That acceptance, there're some serious issues about that. Your latest numbers suggest that amongst the youngsters, the level of acceptance is down. Why is this the case?</p><p>ELLIS: So we went back after we got, that was shocking news, and we went back into the field and we did focus groups and we found two reasons for that. One is the Trump effect. We're seeing, you know, since he came into power, we've had 114 attacks on the LGBTQ community from his administration both in rhetoric and actual policy rollbacks.</p><p>And our youth are impressionable. That's leaving an impression on them. So, we're losing them that way. The other way that we're losing them is that more and more LGBTQ youth are saying that they are LGBTQ, right?</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ELLIS: So, it's a 20 percent. And what we're finding is that that's confusing to the non-LGBTQ youth. They're coming into more contacts, so that's education.</p><p>QUEST: So when straights come up against the community, they tend to be questioning and wary rather than accepting. Not the norm, but it's the gist of it.</p><p>ELLIS: Well, it's also different identities than we've seen before --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>ELLIS: Right? We've seen lesbian and gay primarily, and now we're seeing more bisexual, pan-sexual, transgender, gender non-conforming and those are confusing to people who aren't identifying that way.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think that creates an even greater confusion for corporations as well because it's almost to the point where, right, we've got our policies in place for the gays and the lesbians. We know what we're doing over there, that's a safe policy, we can get away with doing this stuff.</p><p>But now there's an entire raft of things that we have to clamp on to that, and we don't know what to do.</p><p>ELLIS: I don't think so. I think it's treating people as human. It's really kind of essential and normal to do, and it's just seeing people as individuals and that's what we have, a revolution of individuality.</p><p>QUEST: We need to talk finally about international issues. I mean, Kenya's Supreme Court voted, decided not to decriminalize, Botswana recently did. I travel, again, more than most, the discrepancy between say, the U.S. and Europe and other parts of the world, particularly in Africa, is dramatic.</p><p>ELLIS: Yes, and I think that is why corporates embracing Pride in the LGBTQ community is so important because it's still criminal in 70 countries, right? And these global companies can have a true impact and a lot of these companies also -- it's the only safe haven for LGBTQ people when they are international.</p><p>QUEST: Listen to this, Taylor Swift, have a listen.</p><p>[15:55:00] (MUSIC)</p><p>QUEST: So clear, you're glad.</p><p>ELLIS: Yes, well, it's a surprise.</p><p>QUEST: Was it really?</p><p>ELLIS: It was, we worked with --</p><p>QUEST: Girl, come on!</p><p>ELLIS: We worked with her for years and she's been an avid supporter of the community, but we did not know that we were going to be in her next song.</p><p>QUEST: Well, it can't go wrong with that, can you?</p><p>ELLIS: No, and that helps with our youth, right, and building acceptance because she's a pop culture icon, a living legend, and so many youngsters look up to her. So, I was very excited for that.</p><p>QUEST: Happy Pride, good day --</p><p>ELLIS: Happy Pride, thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much. We'll turn to our agenda of ordinary matters, thank you. Let's look at the markets, how they are closing -- over here, look at that. A nice balance sort of market, anyway, we've given back the gains, we were up 38 points, so we're just barely positive I doubt -- I don't know, it's too touch and go to say.</p><p>Intel is at the top, Travelers is at the bottom, Boeing has put on a bit of a few good gains, that's the way the markets are looking at the moment, and overall, here you have a roller coaster of a session, essentially, what they've been looking at is whether or not anything is going to come out of the G-20. We'll take a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, we brought you two stories that shows the position of companies. Wayfair which of course is in trouble over selling furniture to a migrant detention center. And our last discussion on Pride, corporations globbing on to the Pride LGBTQ agenda, and then wondering why it all goes wrong when the actual policies of the company for their staff, employees and products don't actually meet that which they say.</p><p>It's all about knowing where your value and where your moral compass is. We've talked about this so often, it's one of the things we really look at closely here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Whether it's Wayfair which seemingly has done nothing wrong, but gets into terrible trouble, but then makes good by providing -- giving the profits away or companies plastering everything they can with rainbows and wondering why the gay community don't love them because they otherwise aren't following through for the rest of the year.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>The bell is ringing, oh, we're down, we're down on the Dow, the day is done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019062601cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF7-5BM1-DXH2-6140-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Javad Zarif</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Notre Dame Cathedral</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001040</classCode><className>LITIGATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

Trump Calls For Tougher Republican Response To 'Political War'In an Oval Office interview with The Federalist's Ben Domenech, President Trump calls on Republicans to stand strong and unite against lawlessness. By Ben Domenech, June 27, 2020: In a wide-ranging interview in the Oval Office Friday, President Donald J. Trump said that the country is in the midst of 'a political war where the left will use anything to win, including the culture.' [1]The president said that to restore order and win in 2020, his Republican allies 'need to be stronger' in standing up to rioters and those who would tear down statues. </p><p>'They've got to get much tougher,' Trump said, drawing comparisons to moments when Republicans stood together on impeachment and in battles over judicial nominees. 'They have to be stronger, have to come together,' or risk losing politically and worse. While acknowledging the 'horrible' scene that played out in Minnesota with the death of George Floyd, Trump argued that the Floyd-related protest movement has since morphed into an 'anti-cop, defund the police, anti-American' movement that puts American communities at risk. 'Police never get the credit they deserve by politicians, who are being weak,' Trump said, positing that fear of criticizing the excesses of rioters and violent protesters is driven by political correctness and the danger of being called 'racist.' Trump referred to the Black Lives Matter political organization as having an 'extremist' agenda and criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for wanting to close Fifth Avenue to paint the group's titular slogan on the street. 'Republicans need to be fighting,' Trump said, citing the ideology of the more radical agitators in the streets as 'vicious' and 'seditious.' As the president recognizes, the goals of those sowing the seeds of unrest are clear. 'You see their leaders on TV saying 'give us what we want, or we'll burn down this system and replace it.' That's almost terrorism.' White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is coordinating the response to the ongoing violent riots, which includes connecting with the anti-terror task force and the Department of Justice. According to Attorney General Bill Barr, there are over 500 current investigations in process. 'We have, right now, about 500 investigations underway, so it's picking up pace. We are committed to holding accountable the people who engaged in this,' Barr told Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and host Michael Knowles in a podcast released Thursday. 'State and local are not doing their jobs.' For his part, the president seemed frustrated that he was being called in to deal with problems within Democratic-represented states and Democratic-run cities. 'This should be about the mayor, and then the governor, before it even gets to the president,' Trump said, noting that while he has made the National Guard available to restore order in many cities, 'they haven't called for them.' 'But you look at a place like Seattle, and if I had to go in there, I will,' Trump said, referring to the autonomous zone that has taken over several blocks of the city for weeks.Trump Expects To Be Banned By TwitterIn response to a question on whether he expects to soon be banned by Twitter \u2014 where he has over 82 million followers \u2014 Trump said: 'Yes, I do.' The president believes the ban from the popular platform will happen in the fall before the 2020 election, an opinion shared by others in the White House. For Trump and those close to him, Twitter's reaction to two recent tweets \u2014 including one where he warned rioters against breaking the law \u2014 are being taken as warning shots. 'Some people say I should join Parler,' Trump said. 'Maybe. We do have over 194 million followers, though, across multiple sites.' Trump complimented Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, saying he had been far more open and less biased in his treatment. But as for a Twitter ban: 'I expect it will hurt them more than they realize.' Regarding regulation of the big tech industry, the president raised the prospect of reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as being a potential approach to dealing with frustrations. He offered his compliments and support to Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who has been pushing the issue. 'Section 230 is a double-edged sword,' Trump said, but 'would be a much bigger problem for these companies than even just breaking them up because you would have to be fighting lawsuits all the time. And believe me, I know a little about that.' 'But I want these companies to be successful, and to be based here in America because if you go too far, they end up looking at what is being offered by China instead,' Trump added. 'And I don't want that.'Trump Decries 'Corrupt' MediaDescribing the media as 'worse than fake news', Trump expressed derision for prize-winning journalism which ultimately proved false. 'The Pulitzer Prize is a joke,' Trump said. 'Giving the Pulitzer to the New York Times, the Washington Post for wrong coverage, false coverage? Years of it on Russia? They should all have to give them back.' Trump expressed particular disdain for New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. 'She likes to pretend as if she's on the inside,' Trump said, 'she has a picture with me like so many people do, but I haven't talked to her in over a year, maybe even longer.'Trump Views Court As Key to 2020 SuccessDespite facing serious political headwinds as well as some cautionary recent polling data, Trump's mood was confident and relaxed. Acknowledging the challenge of proving he can lead the country out of a global pandemic and an economic funk, he said that re-election looked easy 'as recently as three, four months ago' before the coronavirus pandemic hit. 'We proved what we could do, cutting taxes, cutting regulations, job numbers like nothing before,' Trump said. The key, he acknowledged, was to convince voters he can repeat that success. Trump emphasized the importance of judicial appointments and the Supreme Court as central to his appeal in 2020. 'It's maybe not the majority we thought it was,' Trump said, raising the court's decisions on DACA and the census among other examples. 'We're just one justice away from losing the court, and the next four years, you get two, maybe three, maybe even four. You just need one, and then we lose the court and the country as we know it.' Referring to Joe Biden as 'a Trojan Horse' for leftist policy, Trump said that he fully expects the left flank of the Democratic Party, represented by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to push Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer to deploy the 'nuclear option,' banning the filibuster to jam radical, far-left policies through the Senate. 'Schumer will go 'nuclear option' on day one if we lose,' Trump said. Despite the current political challenges, Trump's enduring popularity among Republicans is still a source of strength for the president. Touting his success in primary endorsements, Trump mildly tweaked Meadows, who the president said had advised backing the eventual loser in the Congressman's former seat, where newcomer 24-year-old Madison Cawthorn beat out Lynda Bennett. 'I told Mark I've gone 80-something and 1 with endorsements, and that's the one,' Trump said with a smile.Next Week, Mount RushmoreTrump plans to head to Mount Rushmore in the coming week to deliver remarks and take in the first fireworks display held at the famed destination in a decade, on July 3rd. A survey[2] released this week by academic Eric Kaufmann, author of Whiteshift, found that 44 percent of liberal respondents and 58 percent of very liberal respondents agreed that Mount Rushmore should be eliminated. 'I do wonder sometimes if Democrats love our country,' Trump said in response to the figures. 'That maybe 44 percent of liberals, but I assure you there's a lot more the other way.'

The earnings,  obviously, confirming what a lot of people were worried about, that we're  seeing a slowdown, and expectations of a slowdown as some of these  companies lower guidance.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Girls, will see you in a little while.  Thank you so much and good morning,  everyone.  Happy Friday, thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And today is Friday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now just at 6:00  a.m. on the button on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Markets in selloff mode again this morning. </p><p> Dow Jones Industrials average expected to be down better than 255 points,  that's about one percent lower at the open.  </p><p> The NASDAQ, sharply lower, down 175 points right now, that is a decline of  two and a half percent right now.  This after the markets posted strong  gains on Wall Street yesterday.  We had a nice rally bouncing back after  the selloff the day before.  </p><p> The Dow Industrials, at the close yesterday, up 400 points, that was one  and two-thirds percent at the close yesterday.  The S&amp;P 500 was up almost  two percent, 50 points higher.  And the NASDAQ, at the close, up three  percent, 210 points higher on the NASDAQ at the close yesterday.</p><p> It's been a wild week for the markets, for sure.  Right now, the Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 are down nearly two percent on the week, as you can see there.</p><p> Global markets this morning look like this.  European indices down across  the board.</p><p> FT-100 down one and two-thirds percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris down two and  a quarter percent, and the DAX Index in Germany down almost two percent.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  To report worst performer  there was in Korea.  The KOSPI Index down one and three-quarters percent.   Hong Kong down better than one percent.  </p><p> Technology earnings in focus, once again, Amazon and Snap, among the names  report after the bell last night.  Look at Amazon sliding after revenue  missed expectations.  The stock down 10 and a quarter percent right now at  1600 and change.</p><p> Snap down almost 13 percent.  Investors are watching Google parent,  Alphabet.  The company's profit soared, but sales slowed down, the revenue  not as what people expected.  </p><p> The bombshell report also here, sexual misconduct Ad Google weighing on the  stock as well.  We got a lot to tell you about going on at Google.  That  stock is down five and a half percent right now.</p><p> The caravan crisis, hundreds more National Guard troops making their way  toward the border, as President Trump calls on the group of illegal  immigrants to turn around.  We will take you to Mexico live later this  hour.</p><p> Then a view from the top, the CEO of Oracle, Mark Hurd, and the cofounder,  Larry Ellison, weighing in on everything, from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  Cloud's -- modern cloud is constantly  under attack by what are called botnets.  Some are state actors, some are,  you know, cyber criminals, and we're building modern robotic defenses to  protect our customers' data.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down together for an  interview.  We will bring you that coming up.  All the stories coming up  this Friday morning.  </p><p> And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News  Contributor, Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Another messy morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is another messy morning.  Good way to put it there.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This is -- this is because of  revenue, which is what we've been warning our viewers about for weeks and  weeks and weeks, Lindsey Bell, and the like.  </p><p> Overall of the half of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, 43 percent  of the companies have missed revenue estimates, and that is getting worse  and worse as the days wear on.  </p><p> And the headlines this morning, Amazon, another profit, but sales  underwhelm.  Alphabet, Google parent, delivers surging profit, but slowing  sales growth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, slowing sales growth, but also the guidance is troubling,  right?  Because they're basically saying, looking forward in the next  quarter in the next year, we want to pull down the expectations a bit.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Amazon's forecast for the holiday quarter was -- for revenue  was below expectations as well.</p><p> So, again, it's disappointing.  These valuations, you got to deliver and  better.  Yes.  </p><p> PEEK:  That's the problem.  That's the problem.  Narrow market, narrow  segment.  We've all been looking at these stocks for so long and estimates  kind of got ahead of reality, I think a little bit.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And yet the backdrop still feels strong.  </p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, in a backdrop like this, where we're about to get the GDP  this morning in two and a half hours, and we're expecting a number above  three percent.</p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Yes.  We'll see  about that.  </p><p> You know, the thing I will say here, you know, I have to look at Amazon's  guidance in particular and wonder if they're sand-bagging, but the other  thing I'll point out in the revenue side is, we had Alphabet's CFO blaming  the stronger dollar here and that's been a theme we've been looking at.   Trade of stronger dollar, what effect is it having, it's -- is it all  coming home to roost here.</p><p> And as I said to my clients, you wanted volatility, well, now you have the  volatility.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you sure do.  We're going to get a lot of conversation  this this morning.  </p><p> Joining the conversation, Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is here this  morning, along with the Chairman of the RNC, Donna Romney McDaniel is here.  </p><p>Arizona Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member, Andy Biggs,  joining me as well with -- look at the border.  </p><p> And my exclusive joint interview with Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, and  Oracle CEO, Mark Hurd, both of those coming up as well.  Big show ahead.   Don't a miss moment of it.</p><p> But first, let's take a look at technology earnings and the tumble going on  this morning.  Global stocks extending declines, following disappointing  third-quarter revenue from internet giants, Amazon and Alphabet.</p><p> That put a dent in a solid earning season certainly for technology, and  that is what it's weighing on markets this is morning.</p><p> Both industry leaders beat on earnings, but fell short of Wall Street  revenue.  Amazon forecasts its weakest profit growth in two years, that's  what was one of the issues with Amazon, down 10 percent this morning.  </p><p> And, of course, the expectations, as you mentioned, on Amazon way up here.  </p><p> PEEK:  Totally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Company just passed a trillion dollars in terms of its own  market value that's --</p><p> PEEK:  And they're raising costs.  I mean they put through a big wage  increase and so that's weighing a little bit on margins.  That's the other  story, I think, is a lot of companies are talking about cost pressures from  either wages going up or the tariff or whatever.  </p><p> But, you know, it's a little bit of a margin squeeze we're seeing for the  first time in a long time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.  </p><p> PEEK:  And it -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And some of that isn't -- because the $15 minimum wage from  amazon was -- it's going to cost them about $3 billion next year according  to one estimate from Morgan Stanley, but this was in reaction.  </p><p> Again, the government is factoring into these companies as well that Amazon  likely raised the minimum wage for its employees because, remember, Senator  Bernie Sanders introduced the BEZOS Act, trying to tax big companies.  </p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Those employees rely on government services, so that -- that's  government.  And then also the government likely going to crack down on  Google's business.  You've seen that.  That showed up in the stock.</p><p> Alphabet's stock had already lost a sixth -- one-sixth of its market value  in the last months.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And so this was on top of the pressure we've have seen in recent  months.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We pointed out that Google has 90 percent market share when it  comes to surge.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And so that, you question whether or not that's going to be too  big for regulation.</p><p> BLOCK:  The other issue is, you know, Microsoft had very strong numbers in  their cloud business, we see what Amazon did in cloud business.  </p><p> Alphabet, a little disappointing on that side, and if that was supposed to  be a growth area for them beyond the search business, not -- it didn't  quite deliver what people wanted to -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you, when I was talking to Larry Ellison the other  day, I was just struck at how competitive he is with Amazon.  </p><p> I mean, after everything -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- that he said and all of his accomplishments, he said, \"Oh,  yes,\" and then \"We will beat Amazon in their database services.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was my personal favorite part of the interview, is him just  slamming these companies that try to tacitly dismiss Oracle's database.  </p><p> PEEK:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's like, 'What do you think they're using?\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \"They're using Oracle database.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're on Oracle.  </p><p> BLOCK:  It's always been -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But one thing I did want to point out because we mentioned the  sexual harassment issue with Google.  Google said that it's fired 48 staff  members over the past two years for sexual harassment.  That's out of more  than 80,000 employees.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's clearly in response to this New York Times story that was  saying Google protected three senior executives over the last 10 years, one  of whom was dismissed, accused of sexual misconduct, and given a $90  million exit package.  </p><p> But Sundar Pichai said in a memo that the Wall Street Journal obtained that  none of those fired in the last two years got an exit package.  And he  said, \"We're dead serious about making sure that we provide a safe and  inclusive workplace.\"  I wanted to point that out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He didn't say something about that $90 million, as that he's  walking out with $90 million.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes, right, exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I mean, it begs the question.  But, again, 48 people out of  80,000.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good -- yes.  Good point.  Let's put this in context right  here.  Let's talk more about what's going on this morning with Synovus  Trust Portfolio Manager, Dan Morgan, joining us right now.  </p><p> Dan, good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p> DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR MANAGER, TRUST PORTFOLIO:  Hi, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Assess the backdrop for us.  We're seeing revenue warnings here  and technology obviously was all the way up here and it is coming down last  week or so.  What's going on?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, Maria, you know, the overall view of the market in terms of  technology, obviously, has kind of turned negative, but we have to bear in  mind these stocks have had huge runs over the last two or three years.  I  think it's only natural that we get a bit of a pullback.</p><p> I'm not as concerned as maybe the Street is on these most earnings -- most  recent earnings report that have come out.</p><p> I get it, their revenue guidance going in the next quarter was a little bit  light, but if we kind of parse through some of these businesses within the  big umbrella of these companies, they actually did pretty well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They did pretty well, but people are worried about costs going  up and we're hearing the expectations that revenue estimates are too high,  so they may be doing well, but are they doing well enough for what the  market is expecting?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, for example, we look at Amazon, Maria, in terms of the most  recent quarter, we actually saw operating profit double, you know, with 6.6  percent.  They showed tremendous strength in -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Strength.  </p><p>MORGAN:  -- some of their, you know, newer businesses, like AWS and also  other revenues, which is our advertising business.</p><p> So, yes, maybe the estimates have to come back a little bit, maybe everyone  got a little too euphoric in terms of the expectations, but I don't think  we're at the point now where we hit the panic button and say, \"Hey, we got  to get out of tech and move on.  The sector's going down the tubes, like,  let's say back in 2008 or 2000.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p> PEEK:  Dan, question for you, what kind of multiples are we looking at now  factoring in these assessments, reassessments of next year's prospects  maybe, where is Amazon selling and where is Google selling in terms of  P.E.?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, there's no doubt Amazon carries a huge multiple, as does  Netflix.  I mean you're looking at, you know, 150 plus times earnings.  </p><p> Even if you go out to 2019, you're looking at huge multiples on Amazon.   Now Google, though, is much more priced better.  You're looking at probably  20 to 25 times earnings going into fiscal year '19.</p><p> So, there is some big differences between Apple and you look at Amazon or  Apple versus Google and so forth.  I mean, Apple trades at 15 times  earnings.  So -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MORGAN:  -- we can't take a blanket statement and say, you know, \"These  stocks are all trading way too high.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes, Netflix and Amazon are huge multiples, but Apple and Google,  and some of these other players are not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point, Michael.</p><p> BLOCK:  Dan, I know we're talking about tech today.  It's the middle of  earning season.  But are there other sectors you're looking to where you're  steering investors towards in terms of trying to find growth?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, you know, in terms of growth for the S&amp;P 500, as you guys  have reported, I mean the third quarter is probably going to be 20 percent,  you know, right now.  Going forward in terms of areas that I think are  interesting, like biotech, is still interesting.  That's a sector that's  been under the weather recently because of issues with patents and so  forth.  </p><p> But I think there's some good valuations there, Biogen, MGEN, and so forth.   So there are other sectors away from just tech that I think are  interesting.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you want to put money to work in this market even though  things are so nervous?  I mean would you buy today with a market that's  likely going to open down about 200 points?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, Maria, I haven't really been buying a lot of stocks in the  last three or four months to be quite honest with you, with all these new  highs and trillion dollar marks with, you know, Amazon and Apple, so I'm  looking for opportunities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MORGAN:  I have money on the sideline right now, Maria, I'm ready to put to  work, so I'll watch these valuations that no one's going to guess the  bottom, but eventually some of these stocks are going to start to really  make sense again.  </p><p> And I don't think the -- I don't think the backdrop has really changed.  I  really think we're going through correction right now that we got to be  patient.</p><p> I don't think it's a time where we change the entire preface behind  investing in equities at this point.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But, you know, you got a -- you got a backdrop where interest  rates are going up and you do have alternatives now in the short end of  fixed income, 3 percent on the two-year, do you think this is an  allocation-shift going on, broadly speaking, in this market?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, Maria, if we continue to see the Federal Reserve raise rates  the way that they've guided to going forward, which is going to put us at,  what, two and a quarter, two and a half, on Fed funds -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>MORGAN:  -- going into the December meeting and then maybe two and three  and quarters and three percent?  </p><p> If that happens, obviously, that's got ta huge negative effect on the  equity markets, but we're still OK -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- I think, at this point, but anything beyond this is really  going to be detrimental.  </p><p> And obviously, President Trump has come out and commented on that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right.  We will leave it there.  I mean Dan says that  the -- that nothing has changed in terms of the storyline, but we know that  we're getting revenue misses, so -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Major revenue misses.  </p><p> PEEK:  And -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And in terms of overall percentage of companies missing revenue,  it's been growing as we moved on in the season, and this will be the  biggest revenue miss overall for the S&amp;P potentially this year so far, and  expectations for the fed have been coming down for December, I wanted to  point that out.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  OK.  We will -- we will watch that.  Dan Morgan, thank  you very much.  </p><p> Coming up, searching for answers this morning, Saudi Arabia now says the  killing of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was premeditated.  The intense  investigation coming next.  </p><p> And then more of my exclusive interview with the Co-Founder of Oracle,  Larry Ellison, also Oracle's CEO, Mark Hurd.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p> Markets are under pressure this morning, take a look.  </p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial average expected to be down 240 points right out  of the gate this morning, that's one percent lower.  </p><p> The NASDAQ fairing even worst this morning.  It is down two and a half  percent right now.  That is a decline of 175 points at the open this  morning. </p><p> We want to get to the growing caravan crisis right now.</p><p> President Trump is considering blocking entry at the southern border as  over a thousand migrants make their way toward the United States right now.</p><p> Griff Jenkins is at the Mexico border this morning, he's got the very  latest.  Griff, good morning to you.</p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p> We're about 120 miles north of the Guatemalan-Mexico border in Pijijiapan,  which is a town where the migrants mostly spend the night, and you see  hundreds of them marching behind me.</p><p> Let me just give you a look here, it's really quite compelling, a mother  and her child making this trek.  They marched early, Maria, because of the  heat of the day can get so brutal.  It's just very, very difficult.</p><p> But look, come with me for one second.</p><p> We'll actually ask the -- ma'am, hola.  Buenas Dias.  Habla Ingles?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  </p><p> JENKINS:  No?  OK.  We're trying not to really bother them, but, you know,  when you hear the President say -- tweeting to turn around, you hear DHS  Secretary Nielsen saying that they won't be allowed in.  They just won't  stop from continuing their march.  </p><p> In fact, we talked to a Honduran man earlier about a hour ago and he said  he's coming because of the conditions in his country are the result of the  Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, and they said when the  President Trump says he's cutting off aid on -- to Honduras, he says,  \"We've never seen any of the aid anyway, it won't affect us,\" because of  their President.  </p><p> But most of them come because of the conditions, they come for work,  trabajo, that's the word we keep hearing, the Spanish word for \"work\" and  many of them will continue from here on a trek towards Tijuana.  </p><p> But, Maria, where we are, it would be about 800 miles from this very point  to McAllen, Texas, where we were earlier this week, but yet about twice  that, about 1,600 miles, if they're going to go to Tijuana, although they  typically, migrants in these caravans, like the last one in April, go to  California to Tijuana because they perceive California as much more  friendly to asylum-seekers and migrants than say the State of Texas.  </p><p> But we have seen at least more than a thousand of migrants turn away  because they've been at this since October 13th, very, very difficult  conditions.</p><p> I don't have a car coming through now because those are going southbound,  but as we -- see, when cars come through and come northbound, you see them  hopping on any cars that they can.  </p><p> We've seen little stations along this road of church groups from Mexico and  others that have set up food, water, clothes, supplies, this is just one of  the checkpoints just above the town of Pijijiapan as they go along.  </p><p> It looks like a lot of them tell me that their destination -- today, their  goal is about 80 to 100 kilometers north to a jungle of Arriaga, where  they've usually gotten on a train, but we're told the trains are not  running, it's been suspended for the time.  </p><p> So very interesting morning, already very busy.  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Incredible, Griff.  We'll get back to you as news  develops.  Thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins in Mexico this morning,</p><p> Well, the son of Jamal Khashoggi has arrived in the United States.  Cheryl  Casone with the details there.  He had just come from Saudi Arabia, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The eldest son of  the murdered post-journalist is now in the U.S. with his family.  </p><p> He'd previously been unable to leave Saudi because of Jamal Khashoggi's  criticism of the Saudi government.</p><p> State department says the U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow  Khashoggi's son to leave the country.</p><p> Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again, now saying the  killing was premeditated.  Saudi officials say Turkey's evidence shows that  the murder was planned contradicting their earlier claim that rogue  officials killed Khashoggi by mistake during a fistfight.</p><p> Well, job cuts coming to Nokia.  The telecom company announcing it's  launching a round of global layoffs as they gear up for fifth generation  networks.  No specific number has been put on these job losses, but Nokia  says they are going to be part of a plan to save about 800 million a year  by the end of 2020.</p><p> Shares of Nokia are higher in the premarket.</p><p> All right.  We got a lot more coming up on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  </p><p> The hunt is on, right, Maria?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they sure are.  The feds are turning their focus on  Florida as they search for who sent at least 10 suspicious packages to  President Trump's critics.  We will have that next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The search for a suspect and a motive in a  string of 10 suspicious packages sent to prominent democrats.</p><p> Authorities zeroing in on Florida this morning, investigators are searching  a mail facility there, they have been doing that overnight.  There could be  more coming out there.</p><p> Meanwhile, President Trump taking on critics of his response to the  incidents tweeting this overnight.  \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and others  can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of bombs  and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City  bombing, yet when I criticize them, they go wild and scream, 'It's just not  presidential.'\"</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Washington Examiner  Columnist, Philip Wegmann.  </p><p> Philip, good to see you.  Thanks so much for being here.  </p><p> PHILIP WEGMANN, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to all of this?</p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, I think that this can be explained by President Trump's  initial reaction to the bombings.  He said two things, first he called for  unity, and the second was that he was very angry that this attack had  happened, and that explains this 3:00 a.m. tweet because presumably the  President is doing everything he can to get federal agents to get to the  bottom of this.  </p><p> Meanwhile, he turns on CNN and looks elsewhere and sees that, you know,  before we know the name of the attacker, before we know their motivation,  before we have anything besides a general profile, he's being blamed.</p><p> And so I think what this is going to show us going forward is that, you  know, with two weeks ahead of the elections, the President isn't going to  moderate his tone and the President isn't going to entertain any arguments  that he's responsible for this in any way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, by the way, we should point out that CNN has been  criticizing this President for two years, bringing John Brennan on so that  they could make these false claims about any Russia collusion, which never  materialized, and there's absolutely zero evidence about it.</p><p> So, I mean, to be fair, the, you know, the media has been against this  President and criticizing him, and attacking him, and not reporting any of  his accomplishments for two years.</p><p> WEGMANN:  Yes, to be certain, I mean, we've seen the President go to bat  against this media in the past and he's been critical of them, they've been  critical of him.</p><p> There's been a back and forth that hasn't been pleasant.  But, you know,  like, we're all professionals here, we're all adults, and we can deal with  people calling us names.</p><p> I think it is a very large leap to assume that because a president is  calling someone out, because he's calling out an industry and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> WEGMANN:  -- I don't think that he should do it, but it's -- I think it's a  leap to say that because of that rhetoric that somehow is going to incite  people to violence.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> WEGMANN:  I mean, I'm young, but I do remember President Obama saying, you  know, that when there's a knife fight, you bring a gun, and no one was  saying that, you know, President Obama was somehow responsible for any of  the violence that we've seen subsequently against -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great point.  Is there any indication of what this meant for  the polling as we approach the midterms?  I mean any kind of sentiment read  that you -- that you're aware of?  </p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, you know, I really expect President Obama, when he's in  Wisconsin today, I think he's going to echo a lot of the rhetoric from  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who they certainly hope that they can argue  that this President, because of his tone and because of his rhetoric, has  somehow inspired some of these attacks.</p><p> I haven't seen polling that has changed anything significantly yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> WEGMANN:  But I think that you're going to have a problem when you try to  compare this to Oklahoma City or pin this on the right like the Clintons  did during the '90's for two reasons.  </p><p> First, no one was hurt, thank God, and second, it's going to be very  difficult the left to lecture the right on civility when just -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> WEGMANN:  -- a couple of news cycles ago, you had Hillary Clinton saying  that civility wasn't required.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and then you had -- or called or -- </p><p> WEGMANN:  You had Maxine Waters, yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, when they go low, let's just kick them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get in real quick before you go, this fallout from  the Kavanaugh Confirmation.  </p><p> Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, Chuck Grassley, is referring Michael  Avenatti and his client, Julie Swetnick, for possible criminal prosecution.   Criminal prosecution over the allegations of making false statements to  Congress, because we know, Dagen, throughout this whole Kavanaugh circus,  she comes out and starts calling gang rape with no -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  With nothing to back it up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That one NBC interview that she gave fell apart in her first  breath literally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That she couldn't even explain the timeline of why she came  forward and when.</p><p> This is equal application of the law.  It'll be interesting to see if the  Justice Department follows through on this.  Jeff Sessions has not been  great at doing that in terms of going after people who say didn't show up  for subpoenas in front of Congress.  </p><p> If they were members, you know, associated with Hillary Clinton -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- this would be interesting, but this is -- again, you can't  come in front of Congress and lie.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  And remember when Jeff Sessions first  started, he said he had all these leak investigations going on.  Remember  that one?  </p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  Whatever happened to that?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What happened to that?  </p><p> PEEK:  Good question.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was referring to Bryan Pagliano because he didn't show up for  two subpoenas in front of Jason Chaffetz's congressional committee and they  wanted the Justice Department to go after him for not showing up for the  subpoenas and Sessions did nothing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll keep watching that because Grassley is referring Swetnick  and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal charges.</p><p> Philip Wegmann, good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much -- </p><p> WEGMANN:  Thank you so much.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- for weighing in on all of the above.  </p><p> Coming up, user-friendly no more, Snapchat's revenue blew past  expectations, but look at the stock, sliding this morning over concerns  about active user growth slowing down.  Then, more of my exclusive  interview with both Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd of Oracle, where we talk  growth and opportunities.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Friday, it is Friday, October  26th, your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Markets are selling off again this morning, we've got a serious decline  underway, Dow Industrials down 228 points, that's one percent, the NASDAQ  is down 152 points, that's 2-1/4 percent lower, on the NASDAQ.</p><p> Stocks under pressure amid weak results from the technology sector,  particularly, Alphabet, parent of Google, and Amazon, last night, talking  about weaker than expected sales.</p><p> In Europe this morning, markets down across the board, FT-100 down 1-1/2  percent, CAC Quarante in Paris, down 2-1/4 percent, DAX Index in Germany,  down almost two percent.  In Asia overnight, similar story, worst performer  there, was Korea, down one and three quarter's percent.</p><p> One stock to watch today, Snap, the stock plunging ahead of the open, down  14 percent, Snapchat loses millions of users in the last quarter, and it  does see more, leaving.</p><p> First though, a Fox Business exclusive this morning, Oracle CEO Mark Hurd  and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison, sitting down for an interview side- by-side, for the first time, ever.  We discussed the company's growth  prospects, competition in the tech sector.</p><p> We began with this historic relationship and how they coexist and thrive,  while piloting one of the world's most influential technology companies.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  We get along.</p><p> ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  We talk through a lot of things.  We don't agree on everything.   But, yes, we talk through them.  And I think we have a great relationship.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Larry, you felt one of the greatest technologies -- most  important technology companies of our time.  You're still leading its  direction.  Tell us where you prioritize your interests, in Oracle, as  you've got Mark, at the helm, as CEO?</p><p> ELLISON:  Well, I think, from the very beginning at Oracle, I've ran  engineering and, I guess, when I'm back, back again, running -- all of it,  engineering.  So, I work on our product development, whether it's database  product development, the foundation of our business, or our latest and  greatest Cloud applications.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, that's where the growth is, in the whole industry today.   Tell us where you find the growth stories within Oracle in the industry,  what's the most exciting right now?</p><p> ELLISON:  Well, in terms of growth, I mean, if you're looking at the  numbers, to me, it's two separate questions, what do you think the coolest  new technology is that you are working on, which might not have shown up in  the numbers yet, and then, what, you know, what's showing up in the  numbers.  What have we been doing well for a while?  So, you can actually  see it through the financial results.</p><p> And that's our SAS applications.  We are, by far and away, the largest  provider of Cloud applications for financial accounting, for supply chain,  for manufacturing.  We have now 6,000 ERP customers for our Fusion suite,  another 15,000 for our next suite ERP customers, financial accounting  customers.</p><p> Our closest competitor claims to have a couple of hundred customers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A couple of hundred customers.</p><p> ELLISON:  Couple of hundred customers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, OK.  And Mark, you're seeing the ups and downs of the  business in terms of running the operations, a lot of worry out there,  about growth and whether it's slowing down.  Are your customers wanting to  transition into the Cloud?  How fast are they doing that and what can you  tell us about growth?</p><p> HURD:  You know, going (INAUDIBLE) applications business, we've got most of  our customers looking and moving to Cloud.  About 10 percent of our base  has actually moved their core applications to the Cloud, about another 40  percent have bought some product in the Cloud that they are using with  their existing On-Premise product.</p><p> But our entire base will move to the Cloud, over the next several years,  all of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you made the point, that you can -- when you're -- when  you're looking specifically at the applications business, you can actually  transition your existing customers and double revenue in that business.</p><p> HURD:  Exactly right, so just one more time, our total applications  revenue, when all of our existing On-Premise customers moved to the Cloud,  that revenue will double.</p><p> ELLISON:  I think about starting over again, I go into Biotech.  I think  that's where all -- almost all the excitement is going to be, into  robotics.  We're seeing a tremendous amount of robotics in our specific  industry.  You know, we have all of this autonomous systems built in to the  latest generation of our Cloud.</p><p> So, our database is completely robotic.  There are no human beings involved  in operating our database.  Our Cloud has robotic, you know, Star Wars-like  cyber defenses, where these cyber robots find security threats and kill  them.</p><p> So, Clouds, modern Cloud is constantly under attack by, what are called  botnets, some are state actors, some are cyber criminals, and we are  building modern robotic defenses to protect our customers' data.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  I want to go back to what you said about  Biotech, but to touch on what you just said, you made the point in your  keynote, earlier this week, that the approach Amazon and AWS has taken, it  means it runs AWS Cloud control code on the same machines that it actually  stores the corporate data, possibly leaving that data, vulnerable.  Can you  tell us more about that?</p><p> ELLISON:  Not possibly.  I mean, we've seen headlines, you know, cyber  break-ins at Google, at Facebook and Amazon, big government agencies.  It  is happening because these architectures, these old Cloud architectures  really were designed for security, security was an afterthought.</p><p> We have separated our Cloud control code and put it in a network of  computers that are entirely separate from the computers we rent to  customers.  Amazon, if a customer comes in and rents a computer from  Amazon, in that same computer, is Amazon code.</p><p> That means, that customer, if they're smart, can hack the Amazon code, take  control of that computer, and then go out to other computers in the Amazon  Cloud, and steal data.</p><p> That is impossible to do with the architecture we have, in our Generation 2  Cloud, where user computers, customer computers, only has customer code in  it.  And our control or security computers are Cloud control computers has  only our code in it.  There is no way a customer can get at our Cloud  control code, hack it, and take control of the Cloud.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this confirms the idea of what you've been talking about,  for years, and that is staying with one integrated company which is away  from the open public Cloud.  Is that right?</p><p> ELLISON:  No.  I mean, our Cloud -- our Cloud is available on the internet.   So, I mean, you come in on the internet, and you can use our SAS  applications, you can use our database, you can use all of that.  So, it is  completely -- it's not a walled garden.</p><p> Every -- all of our customers can get -- can get at our Clouds, very easy  to do, in fact, getting at our Cloud and getting at Amazon's Cloud, looks  kind of the same.  The difference is, if you take, you know, if you look  very closely, you'll see, we give customers a set of computers that they  can rent, just like Amazon does. </p><p> We have our control code, the code that controls the Cloud, and that's on a  completely separate set of computers.  We would never let our control code,  you know, be in the same computer as our customers' code, because the  customer might be someone you don't know from the Ukraine, who is really,  really smart, hacks your code.</p><p> And then, has able to, you know, hacks your control code, and is able to  take over that computer or take over a big chunk of the Cloud.</p><p> So, it's just as easy to access our Cloud, as to access the Amazon Cloud.   But when you access our code -- Cloud, you are -- we create this  impenetrable barrier around our users, so they can't get through.  You know  what?  They can't get through to our Cloud control code, which is on a  completely separate network of Cloud control computers.</p><p>Amazon does not have a separate network of Cloud controlled computers.   They share the same computer.  That's a terrible security vulnerability.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More from Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd, coming up.  Meanwhile,  stall recall, Ford says it needs to fix more than 1 million Focus cars.  We  will tell you what's going wrong there, right after this break.</p><p> Then, munch on this, this photo of Justin Bieber eating a burrito, leaving  the internet divided over this technique.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another rough day at the office this morning.   Take look at markets right now, Dow Industrials expected to be better than  200 points today, that's one percent.  The S&amp;P is 1-1/4 percent; NASDAQ and  technology stocks, worst-performing in terms of earnings this morning.   NASDAQ down 2-1/3 percent, we've got a number of pre-announcements as well  as revenue weaknesses within the tech sector after the close last night,  and that is weighing on this market hard this morning.  Meanwhile, there's  this, a nor'easter, about to slam the northeast.  Cheryl Casone with the  details there.  Not again, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  You probably didn't think I was going to say the word  northeastern.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, I didn't.</p><p> CASONE:  And it's still October, right?  Yes, here we go.  A major storm  that came from the south is going to be turn into a nor'easter as it  approaches this area.  The storm is going to bring heavy rain, powerful  wind to this region starting later today, gusty winds expected to be as  high as 30 to 40 miles-per-hour.  Utility companies say that trees are  still full of leaves and that increases the chance of power outages caused  by those falling branches and, of course, that is danger to people as well.   Coastal flooding is possible throughout the northeast this morning -- no,  this weekend, excuse me.  </p><p>Ford is announcing a recall of its focus cars in North America.  The  company says 1-1/2 million vehicles have a fuel tank defect that could  cause them to stall and have problems restarting.  Ford says, customers  should keep their fuel tanks at least half-full until dealers can correct  this problem.  Ford shares down 43 percent this year.  </p><p> Well, shares of Snap sharply lower in the premarket.  They're reporting  that they lost two million daily active users in the quarter.  They beat  Wall Street revenue expectations bringing in over $297 million but the  company still hasn't turned a profit, something the CEO Evan Spiegel hopes  to achieve sometime in 2019, he says.  Shares of Snap are down more than 12  percent in the premarket.  The stock is at $6.00 and change.  That is not  where it IPO-ed, folks.  </p><p> Well, people on the Internet can't get over this photo that allegedly shows  popstar, Justin Bieber, eating a burrito.  A lot of people are pointing  out, he's biting his burrito in the middle, rather than from the sides,  which is how you do it.  Some think the person eating the burrito might not  even be Bieber.  They say that his hair color is different.  This was taken  in a West Hollywood Park.  He does live by there, Maria, but it could very  well be just more of his strange burrito eating techniques that he wants to  go viral.  Either way, it did.  We don't know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know why certain things go viral.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, but, it's because -- well, it's Justin Bieber and they find  it offensive that he doesn't know how to eat a burrito properly.  </p><p> PEEK:  It's like eating a hotdog in the middle, right?  I mean, imagine  taking a bite of a hotdog in the middle, it would look ridiculous.  </p><p> BLOCK:  I mean, music stars used to show some decorum.  I mean, Ozzy  Osbourne would never eat a burrito that way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  All right, coming up, the holiday shopping  season is right around the corner.  We are putting the estimates out there;  what retailers are doing to keep their employees working through the  busiest time of the year, that's next.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The holiday season, fast approaching, employers  are taking a number of steps to retain labor including more company perks.   Joining us now is Branch Messenger CEO and the Founder of Branch, Atif  Siddiqui.  Atif, good to see you.  </p><p> ATIF SIDDIQUI, CEO AND FOUNDER, BRANCH MESSENGER:  Good to see you as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  The trends going into the  holidays, what are they? </p><p> SIDDIQUI:  Yes, so, you know, I think one of the things we've seen is an  increase in seasonal hiring, about 10 percent increase since last year, so  about 650,000 new employees these retailers are hiring.  And they are  feeling the crunch now because unemployment at an all-time low, low as it's  been since 1969.  And the other thing is that retailers are still having a  tough time retaining these employees, about 100 percent turnover year over  year.  So, they're doing everything they can to incentivize to bring them  in.  </p><p> BLOCK:  Atif, we hear a lot about some of the pressures that companies are  having trying to fund qualified workers.  What sectors are we seeing -- and  I hear it a lot in trucking -- what are other sectors that you see that  might surprise some of our viewers?  Is there just, kind of, squeeze? </p><p> SIDDIQUI:  Yes, so it's not just retail stores, right?  When you look at  omnichannel and the rise of online shopping, there's also distribution  centers, fulfillment centers, manufacturing facilities.  So, yes, it's  across the spectrum here on not just, you know, store employees but  everything to service that store or put product on the shelves.  </p><p> BLOCK:  And what skills are in demand there? </p><p> SIDDIQUI:  Yes.  So, you know, in general, the skills that are in demand  are it's a lot of manual labor, right?  So, unloading shelves, unloading  boxes, things like that.  So, yes, that's still a transferable skill that  can apply across --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are the retailers opening these fulfillment centers, though, in  areas where unemployment might be a little higher, because I can pinpoint  areas across the country that these places need more jobs versus around  metropolitan areas? </p><p> SIDDIQUI:  Yes.  No, that is true.  I think, you know, it goes into the  retail strategy or where these distribution centers and fulfillment centers  are opening up.  But yes, to give you an idea of what they're doing to  attract some of these workers; you know, we're seeing an increase in wages  for this workforce, we're seeing incentives like gift cards or deep  employee discounts, right?  But one of the things that we've really seen is  by leveraging technology, you can utilize their current workforce to do  more and continue to attract and retain the best, by providing them, you  know, additional incentives like same-day payments, for example.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We should point out that Amazon is raising the minimum wage for  the warehouse workers starting next week.  The wage hike goes in next week.   They also recently announced 100,000 jobs for the holiday.  But of course,  in yesterday's earnings report, the company sales growth slowed down in the  third quarter, and that's moving the stock this morning.  But as you  mentioned, technology and how it's being used.  </p><p> PEEK:  Yes, a lot of these companies, and certainly in the warehouse and  distribution field are using a lot more robots and so forth, I presume.   One question for you, it seemed to us like that people start hiring for the  holidays much earlier than usual this year, maybe anticipating that there  is a crunch workers availability.  I mean, is that still going on?  Or, you  know, it didn't seem like the calendar kind of moved forward there.  </p><p> SIDDIQUI:  Yes, that's a good point.  Actually, the amount of employers  hiring as early as August doubled since last year.  So, they were  definitely anticipating this growth as well as, you know, they're seeing  strong consumer confidence in this sector.</p><p> PEEK:  We were surprised that Amazon talked a little bit down about their  fourth quarter.  Are there any other signals out there that maybe the  holiday season won't justify all this hiring and stuff? </p><p> SIDDIQUI:  Yes, I think, you know, from what we've seen, there is a strong  consumer confidence in the holiday season, so coming into this, I think  we're going to see a strong retail sector.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you're still expecting a good holiday season.  </p><p> SIDDIQUI:  I'm still expecting a good holiday season, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got the GDP coming up this morning, so that certainly  will impact markets.  Atif, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much.</p><p> SIDDIQUI:  Likewise, thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Atif Siddiqui joining us there.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, we are watching futures this morning, markets are selling off  once again at the opening of trading.  We're expecting the Dow Industrials  to be down 250 points and the NASDAQ even harder hit down 165 points,  that's 2-1/3 percent.  Then this, workplace scandals at Google and Netflix  revealed.  More on those bombshell report, next hour right here in MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p> Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p> Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p> In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p> Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p> For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p> Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p> Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p> Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p> Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p> All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p> PETE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p> BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p> The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p> We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p> Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p> Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p> And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p> LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p> HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p> Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p> But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p> And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p> But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p> You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p> What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p> I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p> They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p> NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p> Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p> One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p> So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p> I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p> PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p> HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p> So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p> PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p> BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p> Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p> Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p> Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p> HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p> I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p> So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p> So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p> But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p> HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p> Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p> HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p> Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p> Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p> This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p> Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p> Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p> Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p> And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p> It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p> CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p> Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p> CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p> PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p> CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p> CASONE:  I know.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p> CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p> All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p> Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p> Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the Saudi OPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p> RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p> PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p> With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p> So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p> So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p> The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p> PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p> When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p> So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p> All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p> Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p> PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p> PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p> Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p> Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p> PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p> Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p> PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p> PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p> The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p> PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p> PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p> Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p> Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p> We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p> PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p> PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p> Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p> And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p> We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p> And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p> Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p> It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p> The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p> So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p> Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p> LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p> But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p> This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p> ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p> The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p> We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p> There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p> The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p> HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p> ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p> So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p> So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p> ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p> Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p> Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p> HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p> And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p> HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p> HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p> Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p> I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p> And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p> Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p> The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p> Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p> And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p> CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p> All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p> And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p> So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p> We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p> The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p> Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p> MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p> Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   Happy Friday.  It is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the button right now, stocks are in sell-off mode once again.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to be down 220 points right out of  the gate.  That's one percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 down 31 points.  That's  better than one percent right now. </p><p> And the NASDAQ with a decline of 145 points right.  That's down better than  two percent right out of the gate.  It has everything to do with earnings.   We are awaiting the first look at the GDP for the third quarter.  The  expectation calls for growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent.  We are  going to bring you that number as soon as it hits the tape.  That's at 8:30  a.m. and we will have the smartest analysis in the morning right here once  the number hits.  We will bring that to you. </p><p> Global markets this morning under selling pressure once again.  The FT-100  down better than one percent.  The CAC Quarante down almost two percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a half percent right now.  Declines  across the board overnight in Asia.  As you can see worst performer Korea.   Technology earnings are in focus this morning.  That's because last night  Amazon and Snap among the names reporting and Amazon is down better than  eight percent because revenue missed expectations zeroing in on revenue  across technology this morning. </p><p> Snap shares are down almost 12 percent.  We're watching Google parent  Alphabet, the company's profit was up.  Sales were down.  Well, it was  slowing down lower than people expected and as a result the stock is down  five percent on Alphabet.  Plus, there's a bombshell report this morning  out of Google over sexual misconduct.  That's also playing into things  here.  So we'll have more on that coming up.  And then this, the caravan  crisis continues. </p><p> Hundreds more National Guard troops making their way toward the border  right now as President Trump calls on the group of illegal immigrants to  turn around.  That was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen  Nielsen last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  This  caravan cannot come to the United States.  They will not be allowed in.   They will not be allowed to stay.  If they come here illegally with no  legitimate reason to stay, they absolutely will be apprehended and remove  immediately. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll have the very latest developments this morning on that.   Stay with us on that.  All stories coming up this Friday morning.  And  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News  Contributor Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning. </p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Yes.  It does gets worst  and worst as we're watching this open.  But it's important to note that all  those sell-offs overseas we're in the wake of Amazon's report and Google's  report, and so forth.  I mean it was a tech problem in those markets as  well.  So, you know, the question is the GDP number going to make a  difference? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.  I mean the estimate is 3.3 percent growth.  I  don't know if there's a good outcome here, Dagen, because if we get a  strong number on GDP, that basically keeps the Federal Reserve's plan in  place to raise interest rates in December, and then another three times  next year, if their GDP is worse than expected, that perpetuates the story  that the economy is slowing. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And there's a story  in The Wall Street Journal today that trade and manufacturing numbers point  to slower fourth quarter growth.  Many forecasters expect the growth rate  to slip below three percent in the -- of the fourth quarter of the current  -- the quarter that we're currently in because the trade deficit and goods  has widened four months in a row. </p><p> That's a problem and then also you saw the durable goods report yesterday,  big increase in military aircraft orders, but excluding defense durable  goods orders fell, and so that's another thing to worry about was for the  month of -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think we also have to talk about some technical things.  You  mentioned the lack of companies in the market buying those stocks.  There's  also tax loss selling going on.  This also could be part of this because  mutual funds and hedge funds have a fiscal year-end of October 31, so there  could be some tax loss selling and as you said earlier companies are not  buying back those stock -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  And they're quiet periods.  They're not allowed to sort of --  there's a sort of, you know, there's this back vacancy there where they  have been in pretty powerful force a lot of these stocks -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All of these plays into -- in addition to the fundamentals. </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  There's --  there's a (INAUDIBLE) going on in one another tax loss selling this  volatility gets more volatility and more losses and more pain.  One thing I  want to point we're talking about tech earnings and there are some short  falls there.  But overall growth in tech, Goodyear just reported this  morning in industrial space.  I've been negative on this space.  I just  want to point out. </p><p> They're citing -- they're lowering guidance and they're citing raw material  costs escalating.  They're blaming China.  They're blaming economic  uncertainty in Brazil.  There's a lot of things they're throwing out there,  but these are all other issues that are impacting these markets even if the  big tech companies are insulated somewhat from that. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just one more statistic as we've been talking about the revenue  misses.  That's in the headlines of the Amazon numbers that sales  underwhelm Alphabet delivering slowing sales growth.  Here's a statistic,  43 percent of companies half of the S&amp;P has reported so far roughly half 43  percent of the companies have missed expectations, same period, second  quarter.  It was only 28 percent missing.  So it's a much larger percentage  for the current reporting period in terms of missing -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  -- a lot of companies lower their guidance which of course is also a  problem for the market and for these shares. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's why you've got tech tumbling this morning.  It is  about revenue.  It is about expectations of slowdown.  Global stocks  extending declines following disappointing third quarter earnings from  internet giants Amazon and Alphabet.  That puts a dent in the solid  earnings season for technology.  Both industry leaders beat on earnings,  but fell short on Wall Street revenue expectations as Dagen just mentioned.   Amazon also forecast the weakest profit growth in two years. </p><p> And let's not forget the cost side of this because amazon just raised  wages, $15 an hour.  That's going to take effect next week.  A number of  input cost have been going up.  Joining us right now on the phone EndPoint  Technologies Associates Founder and President, Roger Kay.  Roger, good to  have you on the program.  Thanks for weighing in here.  What do you think  is going on within technology? </p><p> ROGER KAY, FOUNDER, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES:  Yes.  Good morning,  Maria.  Well, so basically, we're on a -- the end of a 10-year boom market,  so it's not surprising to think they're slowing down.  The other thing is,  of course, there's just a lot of volatility after all.  It's up hundreds of  points yesterday.  It's going to open probably off, you know, at least 100  points this morning, and it's been doing that back-and-forth for quite a  while. </p><p> I think volatility scares away investors.  It invites speculators that also  like to play volatility.  But I think that ordinary people are spooked when  the market moves several percent a day -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You mentions -- you mentioned that the length of this bull  market, that's something that AlphaOne Capital Partners Founding Pattern  Dan Niles mentioned as well.  He summed it up this way. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain and during a bull market since World War  II.  But if you look at the big picture around growth, you got a lot of  concerns.  You got China starting to slow down, auto sales in China went  from being up 15 percent year-over-year in April to down 10 percent in the  most recent month. </p><p> That's a pretty big change.  We got concerns over Italy and Brexit in  Europe.  And in the U.S., interest rates are going up.  They're at the  highest levels in seven years.  What you see in general during this  earnings season with Boeing being a pretty big exception is that a lot of  companies are guiding much lower.  I'll give you an example.  Texas  Instruments reported last night and I think they're one of the best  indicators in terms of global health. </p><p> They do about 16 billion in revenues, a hundred billion in market cap.   They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology? </p><p> NILES:  I think you absolutely are and this is exacerbated by the fact that  you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest company  in the world, Apple for example, that 89 percent inventory growth year- over-year in the June quarter that they reported.  Their revenues were up  17 percent.  What if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have  to barn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, there you go, Roger.  And the iPhone's thousand dollars  for the iPhone X may not sell very well.  What do you think? </p><p> KAY:  Well, right.  So, you know, often in the technology industry  particularly when you're talking about goods as opposed to service in this  because after all part (INAUDIBLE) inventory of services.  But it certainly  there has been in the past channel stopping where the managers of a  company, you know, the main company are motivated to move product at the  end of the quarter.  They push it to distribution and then let the  distribution worry about working it off. </p><p> That's their problem next quarter.  But that of course comes home to roost  within a quarter and you realize that the, you know, the mother ship isn't  get anymore sales.  So I think, you know, that kind of -- it happens, you  know, in a badly management situation, you know, Tim Cook is not known for  bad management, so it's unusual that they had stop inventory at purpose.   But it's possible that normal inventories well went in and that the sales  were slowing at the far end of the feds while there was inventory still. </p><p> But that's indicative of I think across the board this question (INAUDIBLE)  of growth that we come through this long period of growth and everybody has  been just climbing and climbing and then that's your -- that speak under  reported section there was saying there's just a lot of different sources  headwind including rising interest rates.  I think -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- people, you know, they sell first and think alter, Michael. </p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  You know, Roger, we're here looking at this sea of red this  morning maybe lost in the clouds here is Intel which, you know, having a  rough quarter last time around with their core business, and didn't quite  do what they wanted to do in the data room so to speak.  Yet, yesterday,  really came in better than that lower bar and their core business actually  pretty good and they were talking pretty confidentially about the move down  in (INAUDIBLE) what do you think of that, you know, are there bright spots  here?  You know, is everything really -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KAY:  Yes.  What's interesting is I mean the Intel is off a little bit in  premarket, but now as much as the others.  So, you know, if you look at a  handful of big name stocks, you'll see that most of the tech stocks are off  in the two percent range some as high as four percent in premarket.  But  Intel is only a slight decline and I think that reflects the positive  attitude that Intel may have been getting back together with respect to the  process in technology. </p><p> So it's interesting that the (INAUDIBLE) the other side of the shop, you  know, the non-Intel part of the Silicon industry.  It's already basically  talking about (INAUDIBLE) but what's interesting is if you look a  transistor density rather than the sort of (INAUDIBLE) which is what the  (INAUDIBLE) it turns out that Intel's pen is kind of similar to (INAUDIBLE)  and so that actually that puts Intel not as far behind as people had  thought they were. </p><p> So if they pull it together on their 10, they're kind of in the game  against (INAUDIBLE) and that's good news for them, so I think people  interpreting that and conversely they're interpreting the AMD side of that  that's both negative. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> PEEK:  So Roger, what could turn this group around?  What could get the  tech stocks going again? </p><p> KAY:  You know, finding another planet to colonize.  There's got to be some  way to get more growth out of this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Citing more growth?  Yes, sure. </p><p> BLOCK:  Isn't Elon Musk doing that? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) is boring into one.  Roger, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  Thanks for calling in, sir.  Roger Kay  joining us there.  Coming up, the search for a sender is intensifying this  morning.  Authorities are now zeroing in on Florida after locating a 10th  suspicious package.  The very latest on that investigation next.  And then  Saudi Arabia changing its story again about what happened to journalist  Jamal Khashoggi inside its Istanbul interment - embassy.  Khashoggi's son  has arrived in the United States.  He was barred from leaving Saudi for a  while.  Details there next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are lower this morning.  Take a look at  the sell-off going on right now.  Dow Industrials down almost one percent,  221 points lower.  The S&amp;P 500 down 32 points, better than one percent  lower and the NASDAQ is down two percent.  That's 146 points lower.  This  perpetuating view that things are slowing down last night because Amazon  and Google disappointed on revenue.  Meanwhile, there's this, the son of  the murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, his son has now  arrived in the United States.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl? </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria.  This  is the eldest son that is now in the United States with his family.  He  previously had been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because of his father's  criticism of the Saudi government.  Well, the State Department says that  U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow Khashoggi's son to leave  that country.  Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again now  saying the killing was premeditated. </p><p> Saudi officials say that Turkey's evidence shows the murder was planned  contradicting their earlier claim that rouge officials killed Khashoggi by  mistake during a fist fight.  Well, after an intense nationwide manhunt  under -- is underway after 10 pipe bomb packages were sent to prominent  Democrats.  Some new details for you it.  Federal investigators has  searched a mail facility in South Florida.  That happened last night.   Several of the packages actually went through that facility. </p><p> Investigators also focusing on New York City after one of the bombs was  sent to actor Robert De Niro.  Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting, funny  how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for  the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September  11th and the Oklahoma City bombings, yet when I criticize them they go wild  and scream, it's not just presidential.  </p><p> Well, corporate travel trends are changing and so are companies expense  reports, shocker.  Lyft made the top 10 list of the most frequently  expensed business cost in the U.S. for the first time.  This was during the  third quarter, certified track all stuff.  They're a traveling expense  software company.  Lyft was number six on the list with Uber in the top  spot.  Amazon coming in third, interesting.  Both Uber and Amazon had been  moving up the ranks over the last three years. </p><p> And then speaking at people getting paid, Sofia Vergara extending her reign  as queen of television.  The Modern Family actress topping Forbes list of  highest paid T.V. actresses for the seventh year in a row whopping 42.5  million was her take.  That's only twice the 24-1/2 million that Big Bang  Theory actress Kaley Cuoco made.  Coming in third place, Grace Anatomy's  Ellen Pompeo with 23-1/2 million rounding out the top five, Law &amp; Order's  Mariska Hargitay, and then Sofia Vergara's Modern Family co-star, Maria,  Julie Bowen which has got lots of money and she's married to a tall drink  of water -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  Wow.  Lucky to be her. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, caravan crisis, hundreds more  National Guard troops are making their way toward the border right now.   President Trump is calling on the group of illegal immigrants to turn  around.  He says they're not coming in the country.  The very latest there.   Then we are waiting the first read on third quarter GDP.  We have the  number.  The expert analysis as soon as it crosses 3.3 percent growth is  the estimate.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Caravan crisis, President Trump is demanding the  thousands of Central American migrants headed to the United States make a  U-turn.  The warning coming as the administration deploys hundreds of  troops to the southern border.  Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs and member of the House Judiciary Committee.  Congressman, it's  good to see you.  Thank you for being here.  Arizona, obviously, a border  state. </p><p> You recent tweeted that you support sending the troops to the border.   Assess the situation for us.  Tell us what it looks like today and what can  be done. </p><p> REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, it's pretty bleak in some respects  because the drug cartels control the border putting more military in the  border actually gives a show of force even though they're not going to be  en0gaged in normal typical military issues.  But we're looking at a convoy  of people that are going to try to overturn the border for the purpose of  the organizers who are (INAUDIBLE) they want to -- they don't want to board  -- they don't want a border between Mexico and the U.S. </p><p> And so it's pretty rough right down there on the border right now. </p><p> PEEK:  Quick - congressman, question.  What can the military actually do?   You hear different reports on this whether they can actually engage with  these marchers or how ever -- this caravan, what role can they play really?  </p><p> BIGGS:  Well, they're going to be a supportive role and what that means  they'll be able to help track people who are coming across the borders to  free up the border patrol agents to actually interdict the people.  They  all need to be -- they should be armed so they can protect themselves  because you got the cartels all armed.  You know, they've got the watchers  and so they are going to be supportive I think and I think that will be a  benefit.  But we got so much more to do on the border than just this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the president -- are you going to  vote for Kevin McCarthy's bill and the president's border wall? </p><p> BIGGS:  Well, you knowledge what, I actually introduced my own bill which I  think is a bill if that's the -- if that's the only bill that comes out --  if it's Kevin's bill, I'll vote for Kevin's bill.  I think mine is better - - </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- bill differ from that bill? </p><p> BIGGS:  My bill actually provides funding sources off general funds to pay  for that bill.  It also restores money to the border patrol agents that  were had their pay reduced under the Obama administration and provides  equipment for the men and women of the border patrol. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And let me switch gears and ask you about the fallout from the  Kavanaugh confirmation, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is  referring Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick for possible  criminal prosecution over these allegations of making false statements to  Congress, your reaction, sir. </p><p> BIGGS:  Long overdue.  I'm glad to see that Chairman Grassley is out there  doing that because I think Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick, they really tried  to throw gas on to a fire that was already there for whatever purposes, and  it looks like they made false statements and then they should held -- be  held accountable for that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks very much. </p><p> BIGGS:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Andy Biggs joining us there.  We want to take a  short break and then we are just moments away from getting the first look  at the third quarter GDP.  We are going to bring you those numbers as soon  as it hits the tape.  That is at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  That is in four  minutes from now, 3.3 percent growth is what's expected for the first read  on the third quarter GDP, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th, your  top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast, we are a  minute way away from third quarter GDP number.  The expectation calls for  growth of 3.3 percent.  This will be the first reading of growth for the  third quarter.  It comes after the second quarter generated growth of 4.2  percent. </p><p> Ahead of the release, markets are selling-off again this morning.  A  negative tone for stocks, Dow Industrials expected to be down 200 points  almost one percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is down better than one percent and the  NASDAQ down better than two percent right now all because of disappointing  earnings reports.  You had revenue misses.  Google parent company Alphabet  and Amazon -- a sell-off this -- with Amazon down better than eight  percent.  Alphabet down five percent. </p><p> The worry here guidance is weaker than expected and revenue is coming in  weaker than expected within tech.  In Europe, similar story, down across  the board in European indices today.  The FT 100 down better than one  percent.  The CAC quarante in Paris down one and three-quarters percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a third percent.  Asian markets  overnight in the red across the board.  We are waiting on the first look of  third quarter GDP this morning. </p><p> We are in the middle of earnings season.  For the GDP, the expectation  calls for 3.3 percent growth and we are expecting earnings to be up 21  percent for the quarter year-over-year.  Joining us right now is Jon  Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor.  And Jon,  we're going to get the number momentarily.  We know that your often focused  on the consumer.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what consumer is showing within this GDP number, the expect  -- 3.5 percent is the number, Jon.  3.5 percent is better than expected.   We were expecting 3.3 percent, and we are watching markets for any  reaction.  Your expectations and your reaction to a 3.5 percent number,  Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, that's a strong number.  What I want -- what I want to  do is break this down a little bit and see where it comes from.  I think  trade was probably a drag for the quarter.  I think we also have to look  very carefully in addition to the consumer at government.  There's been a - - as we've reported today in The Wall Street Journal, there's been a big  pickup in military spending, government spending is contributing a lot to  growth right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Consumer spending is up four -- consumer spending is doing well  within this, up four percent?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Correct, four percent in the third quarter.  The strongest rate  of growth in almost four years on the consumer side.</p><p> BLOCK:  Street was looking for up 3.3 on that as well, so that's a big  beat.</p><p> PEEK:  That's big.  That's a big beat.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Jon?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  And that -- I mean, that makes sense.  You've got an  unemployment rate that's down under four percent, lowest levels since the  1960s.  And you also have tax cuts that are making their way through the  system, so we should be seeing strong consumer spending right now.  We also  have to look at what's going on on the business investment side, you know,  for this growth to be sustainable in the long run, we need to see more  business investment, and I want to see how that breaks down as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investment by companies was weak, Jon, non-residential, fixed- investment, spending on commercial construction equipment, intellectual  property products like software rose only eight-tenths of one percent in  the third quarter.  That was after rising in an 8.7 percent rate in the  second quarter and 11-1/2 in the first.</p><p> BLOCK:  Inflation is also light here, core PCE came in up 1.6 percent  quarter over quarter, street was looking for up 1.8, so there's not some  runaway inflation story here.  It looks like consumption is strong.  As  Dagen points out, investment weak -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And just one --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Markets improving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  One more thing, private inventories which is something  that Liz was talking about, private inventories added more than two  percentage points to the third-quarter growth rate, reversing that trend  that you saw in the second quarter when companies were drawing down their  stockpiles ahead of the tariffs.</p><p> PEEK:  That has been sort of an offset on going quarter-to-quarter with the  trade -- the widening trade deficit.  It seems to me that consumer news  here is very important, because the fourth quarter is all about holiday  sales, all about consumer spending, the fact that that's held up and  actually beat by such a wide margin, I think teases up for less pessimism  if you want to look at it that way about the fourth quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And interesting, there's no revisions on the second quarter,  Jon.  The second quarter was really strong at 4.2 percent, that is not  being revised downward, so that stays in place with the better-than- expected initial or advanced reading, the first reading for the third  quarter at 3-1/2 percent, Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, so I'd say a few things here based on these breakdowns  that you've given me.  One is let's go back and talk about that inflation  number, the market has been very concerned and the President has been very  concerned about the Fed continuing to raise interest rates going into next  year.  You know, the inflation numbers have come in kind of soft over the  last couple of months, and I think the Fed is going to have to start paying  attention to that and factor in that into how far they want to go on  interest rate increases.</p><p> On the inventory piece that you talked about, that's a volatile number, it  doesn't fundamentally have much to do with economic growth in the long run.   So, the fact that it added a lot to growth in third quarter I think becomes  a potential drag on growth in the second quarter.  A lot of the estimates  that we get at The Wall Street Journal for fourth quarter is that it's  going to slow down a little bit on overall growth, and it's going to slow  down -- growth is going to slow down going into 2019, that inventory piece  plays into that.</p><p> PEEK:  It seems to me it's almost a percent number for people who are Fed  watchers, though, right?  Because it isn't really high enough to spur alarm  at the Fed, any kind of acceleration, or you know, incremental rate hikes  next year neither is it low enough to kind of take them off their paths.   So, it seems to me that's sort of a neutral. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Although, I will add looking at this report, higher borrowing  costs have hurt housing and auto sales.</p><p> PEEK:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Spending on motor vehicles and parts added just 0.09 percentage  points, so third quarter growth, and in terms of residential-fixed  investment fell at a four percent annual rate in the third quarter.  So, is  --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  You know, residential has been -- residential has been a  really big drag for several quarters now, and that's continuing.  It's a  little puzzling because there's under supply in the housing market, but  builders (INAUDIBLE) building because labor is short, and land supply is  short, and costs are going up, so, you know, we should be seeing more  building and we're just not getting it right now. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, Jon, there is -- during the summer, there was a plentiful  amount of inventory coming on the market in many housing markets that were  already weak.  There are a lot of pockets of weakness in housing in this  country that are overlooked because we tend to focus on the metropolitan  areas.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, and supply, actually, has been going up in some of these  metrics.  I think I saw a 7.1 month supply in one of the -- one of the  metrics this week on existing home sales.  The only thing I'll point out  is, even in the Fed minutes, it was pointed out that higher rates might be  crimping residential investments to your point, Jon.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I also think that it's, you know, understandable that the  third quarter rate of business investment was weak.  And this is actually  the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2016, spending on structures down,  7.9 percent.  You would expect companies to pull back in terms of spending  with the uncertainties of tariffs, with the uncertainties of the demand  picture on the horizon, because there is all of this worry, this narrative  that things slow down a bit.  So, I'm not surprised that the level of  investment spending is weak in this report, Jon, particularly after we've  seen animal spirits these last two years, spending has been up.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, there are three things going on in the business  investment side we have -- we have to look at.  One is you mentioned  structure is down, structures has been very strong because there's been a  lot of investment going on in oil and gas rates as oil prices came up.   They've stabilized so maybe that spurred a growth that we've gotten that's  also stabilized.  </p><p> The other thing you just mentioned, you know, with tariffs coming on, a lot  of companies are talking about slowing their investment plans because  they're just so uncertain about what the trade landscape is going to look  like.  And then the third piece is tax cuts.  You know, the Trump  administration, Republicans in Congress cut taxes, corporate tax rates very  aggressively to try to spur business investment.  But it looks like this  tariff uncertainty is taking away some of the boom that they were hoping to  get on the business investment side. </p><p> You know, again, if these growth rates are going to be sustainable, it's  going to have to show up in business investment, and I'd say, the soft  number there has got to be a little disappointing today.</p><p> PEEK:  I would say politically, too, that's a problem, because Democrats  have really made the case that the tax cuts for corporations are really  just going into stock buybacks, they're not going to have any impact on  workers, and we need investment to get productivity up, so that wages will  go up, so I do think it's a disappointing number.  And probably is a result  of the uncertainty.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, Jon, the other day, you know, we're starting to hear some  noises about the yield curve, there were some comments a few weeks ago  saying, well, it's kind of a relief.  It was even in the minutes as well  that with rates backing up and along the curve may be there's not so much  risk of inversion.  We see what the 10-year is doing now.  Look, my call  was actually -- we're going to see the 10-year back below three.  You can  write that down, I'm saying it right now.  Are we going to get the Fed more  concerned now about the possibility of inversion and what that can mean?   Do they care about that?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And let's point out this op-ed in The Journal today written by  Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari titled \"Pause Interest  Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow.\"  Kashkari writes, \"With the Fed  funds rate at two to 2-1/4 percent, monetary policy is now close to  neutral, neither stimulating nor restricting the economy.  Prematurely  tapping the brakes could restrain wage growth and keep many Americans from  participating in the economic recovery.\"  You expect the 10-year to go back  down below three percent.  Is it partly because you think that they are  going to see a pause in the rate hikes?</p><p> BLOCK:  I think we're going to see a slowdown and I think we are going to  see that happen.  And, you know, look, I'm going to say it right now, I  think next year, I think two hikes max.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Two hikes max.</p><p> BLOCK:  That's where I am right now.  I've been there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're at three hikes for next year, Jon, isn't that right?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  And it all comes down to the inflation numbers.  The --  you know, you're talking about the yield curve and long-term interest  rates, and I think long-term interest rates are a signal of how concerned  the long-term investors are in the outlook for inflation.  And if the  inflation numbers come -- continue to come in in soft, and it sounds like  they were soft in this number, then I think the Fed has going to have to  think about maybe slowing down the pace of rate increases.  You know, I  just wanted to ask you all, we've talked about a lot of different  components if this, if anyone has the government spending numbers, I'd love  to know what they are, because they -- military spending is a really big  impact on growth right now, there's a lot -- there's a lot of --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, here it is.  We got it, Jon.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Government expenditures were up at 3.3 percent annual rate, and  the third-quarter defense spending rising in an annual rate of 4.6 percent,  Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  Yes, that's a big driver, and that one is going to  continue.  So, the two things I think we have driving economic growth right  now are consumers and government, ironically.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, the last time we didn't mention explicitly here is that  exports were down 3.5 percent in Q3 and imports rose at 9.1 percent.  It  just plays into this whole rising deficit thing.  Look, I don't think the  bottom market cares but it's part of it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But we -- but we would know that watching these trade deficit  numbers coming in, in the third quarter, Jon, that the trade deficit has  widened throughout the third quarter.  Again, there were some pull forward  in the second quarter where you had, say, soybeans exporters really pushing  inventory overseas ahead of those tariffs between the United States and  China that went into place over the summer, so, again, that reversed course  and showed up in this GDP figure.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's exactly right, Dagen, you have to look at what happened  with trade in the second and third quarter combined, there was a lot of  anticipatory reaction in the second quarter, particularly in agricultural  goods, and that looks like it reversed.  But, you know, with the tariffs  that we have going on, we have to think about trade being a potential drag  for the economy -- for the global economy in the months ahead. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what we were -- we're also expecting companies  to start pulling back as we have seen in this report, because of the  uncertainty of it.  You know, what will the impact of these tariffs be in  this quarter and into 2019?  That's one reason that you --</p><p> PEEK:  That's a little ironic, right?  I mean, basically, under Obama, the  uncertainty all had to do with regulation and changes that the business  community faced day-to-day, now it is so unfortunate that we have that  deregulatory cloud sort of lifting, but in its place, we have uncertainty  about the tariff policies. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, we switched -- we switched from one form of government  swappiness to another.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes, that's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That it's government intervention in business, where if you use  steel in this country, you have to go to the Commerce Department hat in  hand and beg for waivers.</p><p> PEEK:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There have been thousands of waivers.</p><p> BLOCK:  And there is a huge backlog at the Commerce Department right now  for these applications for waivers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  So, there is a lot of red tape on the trade front. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, Jon, we leave it there.  Great to see you this  morning, Jon, thanks so much.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Great.  Thanks a lot. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great analysis, as always, from Jon Hilsenrath from The Wall  Street Journal.  Once again, the GDP is out, this is the first reading of  the third quarter, it came in better-than-expected, up 3.5 percent versus  an estimate of 3.3 percent.</p><p> Coming up next, Microsoft on track to pass Amazon in market cap after  earnings.  We will tell you where that market cap stands.  We break down  the latest numbers right after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We told you the breaking news earlier.  The GDP  out moments ago.  The economy grew at a -- at a rate of 3-1/2 percent in  the third quarter.  This is the first take on the third quarter.  GDP is  better than the expectation which calls for 3.3 percent.  </p><p> Futures came off of their lows, then, went back down again.  We're still  looking at a decline at the start of trading, although, we are off of the  lows.  Dow Industrials down 160 points, NASDAQ down 116.  </p><p> \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney weighs in.  And Stu, what I think is  really a good takeaway is the fact that the consumer part of this report -- </p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- consumer spending up four percent, Stu.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, the -- what is it?  Consumption, that's the proper  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right. </p><p> VARNEY:  Consumption of, what, four percent.  Now, that's a big number.   That is a very bright spot in this report.  You know, Maria, I was the  party pooper about the Mega Million jackpot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know you are.</p><p> VARNEY:  Well, I'm not -- I thought I might be the party pooper over GDP  because I was really hoping for a four percent number as growth in that  quarter.  OK, so, we got 3-1/2 percent.  I still think that's pretty good.   I'm a little disappointed because I was looking for four and more, because  that's what we've been promised if we get the tax cut.  But, look, I'll  take 3.5 percent, especially coming on the back of a 4.2 percent growth  rate in the second quarter.  That's the best back-to-back quarter  performance that we've seen in four years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  So, the trend is still very strong and if we keep this up, we're  going to have a much better than three percent gain for the full calendar  year, 2018.  I'll take it, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'll take it.  And let's not forget that the second  quarter that you just mentioned, 4.3 percent, no revision there, Stu.</p><p> VARNEY:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right?  So, we still got the 4.2 percent in the second quarter  and now, 3-1/2 percent for the third quarter.  I know you're going to dig  deep into these numbers in about 10 minutes.  We will see you top of the  hour.</p><p> VARNEY:  You got it, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Stu.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour, 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his  great team there.  </p><p> First, though, Microsoft makes a move, the technology giant now on track to  pass Amazon's market cap.  We've got those numbers.  Microsoft's shares  today down two percent, Amazon down eight percent.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have breaking news right now.  An 11th  suspicious package has been found.  This one from an Opa-locka, Florida  facility.  The FBI is confirming that this package was addressed to New  Jersey Senator, Cory Booker.  This is an 11th package coming out of the  Florida facility and we are following that and other things this morning.   We'll bring you the latest there.  </p><p> Meanwhile, we want to look at market, we've got technology earnings have  been leading this market sell-off, disappointing revenue numbers last night  from a number of high-profile companies.  </p><p> Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now  with those details.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   So, we're off of the lows of the morning on that better-than-expected GDP  number.  But we're looking at Amazon which had that revenue miss and the  guidance on revenue, obviously, less than expected.  So, some concerns  potentially about the holiday season, that's one thing, but the other  areas, such as cloud and advertising units continue to grow, have been the  area of growth.  And you've had a mixed bag, some analysts actually raising  their target, some pulling back, and some that are raising still like the  long-term growth story on Amazon.  And those FANG stocks are up 37 percent  annually over the last -- since 2014. </p><p> By the way, as Amazon pulls back, we might see Microsoft move higher in  that closer to the trillion-dollar market.  Remember when Apple crossed it,  didn't close there, but Microsoft now may be getting closer, may surpass  Amazon today with Amazon sell-offs.  So, we'll watch for the market cap  battle.</p><p> And then, there's Alphabet, Google.  The one area that people were  concerned about is people are looking to Amazon to search for products  instead of Google.  So, we've seen, obviously, they've had surging profit  with the slower sales growth.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  And of course, it's been  an incredibly volatile and busy week for stocks.  We had a really busy week  on this program as well.  Take a look at some of the top moments with the  program.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) business with the Pentagon.  Amazon wants it, too,  but Google walks away from the business with the DOD, and yet, they are  all-in on going into China.</p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  I hear Jeff  Bezos and I absolutely agree.  I think U.S. tech companies who say we will  not -- we will not support the U.S. military.  You know, we will not -- we  will not work on any technology that helps our military.  But yet, goes  into China and facilitates the Chinese government, surveilling their  people, is pretty shocking.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Larry.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, the Oracle of Oracle.  What a pleasure.  Nice to  see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tony Stark, I -- did you influence that character?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've heard that.  I didn't know Stanley is (INAUDIBLE)  so I guess -- I guess Tony Stark was invented before (INAUDIBLE) so, I  guess no.</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Part of why the President  would like to continue cut tax with the middle class is because it has gone  so well.  He sees the fruits of that tax cut and jobs act which passed last  December without a single Democratic vote.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This can't possibly happen before the midterms.  The midterms  are 13 days away and this has to be voted on and Congress is -- the House  is not even in session.</p><p> CONWAY:  Well, Washington moves a little bit too slowly for the sheer  volume and velocity of the Trump agenda.</p><p> REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Obviously, it was so important to  get tax reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually  very sad, and I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.</p><p> MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISOR TO THE CLINTONS:  I've seen the biggest buildup  and turnout to a midterm election that we've ever seen, which classically  has fairly low turnout.  And I think we've seen the blue wave become a blue  edge, now, I think fairly it's a blue tossup.</p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC  COMMUNICATIONS:   President Trump has been talking to the -- to Saudi Arabia, to the King, as  well as to the Crown Prince.  There's a continual dialogue there.  Our eyes  are wide-open when it comes to what we've seen to be this horrific tragedy.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  If he's found  to have his fingers on this in any way, I think he is likely to be removed  by his -- by his father.</p><p> LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  This is in complete violation of  human rights.  We cannot continue to allow this to happen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The migrant caravan from Honduras has swelled to at least 7,000  people now as it makes its way north.</p><p> KEANE:  We've got to protect our borders, and we have got to protect our  sovereignty.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  We're seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how  chaotic and really anarchistic the border situation has become.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Violence and intimidation now on both sides of the aisle.</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Individual through a  great big boulder through -- entered the office and another person entered  as well, and they stole equipment.  The one thing about America we believe  in civil discourse.  I mean, you could -- you could agree -- disagree with  someone and not be disagreeable, but then now it's in your face.</p><p> WEST:  We should not be politicizing political terrorism or violence such  as this.  And I would say to those people that are seeking to do so, you  know, this is a crazy unhinged individual, this is not acceptable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks, your view.</p><p> STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  We've had five months to  digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian news is already priced into the  market.  The market has shown us over the summer that it's capable of  handling the current situation.</p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  I  didn't win the Mega Millions this morning, so here I am joining you from  (INAUDIBLE) from New York.</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I haven't checked my numbers yet,  but since I didn't buy a ticket, I'm probably not going to win, that's my  guess.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hi, welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.   Liz Peek?</p><p> PEEK:  Well, I don't think that the GDP report did much for the markets,  but let's -- if the market doesn't completely tank today, I think we're  going to be in a rebuilding phase next week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still a good number, 3-1/2 percent growth --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  Yes, it definitely was.  And teas up the fourth quarter pretty well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes, personal consumption was good, investment is challenged, trade  is challenged.  Let's see what happens after midterms.  And longer-term,  I'm going to be -- I'm going to stay optimistic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's unusual.  And I will be, too.  So, we have about  half of the S&amp;P 500 is still yet to report, so let's hope for better  revenue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  See the glass half full.  There you go.   Seize the day, everybody.  Have a great weekend, Dagen McDowell, Michael  Block, and Liz Peek, good to see you.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.

The earnings,  obviously, confirming what a lot of people were worried about, that we're  seeing a slowdown, and expectations of a slowdown as some of these  companies lower guidance.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Girls, will see you in a little while.  Thank you so much and good morning,  everyone.  Happy Friday, thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And today is Friday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now just at 6:00  a.m. on the button on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets in selloff mode again this morning. </p><p>Dow Jones Industrials average expected to be down better than 255 points,  that's about one percent lower at the open.  </p><p>The NASDAQ, sharply lower, down 175 points right now, that is a decline of  two and a half percent right now.  This after the markets posted strong  gains on Wall Street yesterday.  We had a nice rally bouncing back after  the selloff the day before.  </p><p>The Dow Industrials, at the close yesterday, up 400 points, that was one  and two-thirds percent at the close yesterday.  The S&amp;P 500 was up almost  two percent, 50 points higher.  And the NASDAQ, at the close, up three  percent, 210 points higher on the NASDAQ at the close yesterday.</p><p>It's been a wild week for the markets, for sure.  Right now, the Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 are down nearly two percent on the week, as you can see there.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this.  European indices down across  the board.</p><p>FT-100 down one and two-thirds percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris down two and  a quarter percent, and the DAX Index in Germany down almost two percent.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  To report worst performer  there was in Korea.  The KOSPI Index down one and three-quarters percent.   Hong Kong down better than one percent.  </p><p>Technology earnings in focus, once again, Amazon and Snap, among the names  report after the bell last night.  Look at Amazon sliding after revenue  missed expectations.  The stock down 10 and a quarter percent right now at  1600 and change.</p><p>Snap down almost 13 percent.  Investors are watching Google parent,  Alphabet.  The company's profit soared, but sales slowed down, the revenue  not as what people expected.  </p><p>The bombshell report also here, sexual misconduct Ad Google weighing on the  stock as well.  We got a lot to tell you about going on at Google.  That  stock is down five and a half percent right now.</p><p>The caravan crisis, hundreds more National Guard troops making their way  toward the border, as President Trump calls on the group of illegal  immigrants to turn around.  We will take you to Mexico live later this  hour.</p><p>Then a view from the top, the CEO of Oracle, Mark Hurd, and the cofounder,  Larry Ellison, weighing in on everything, from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  Cloud's -- modern cloud is constantly  under attack by what are called botnets.  Some are state actors, some are,  you know, cyber criminals, and we're building modern robotic defenses to  protect our customers' data.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down together for an  interview.  We will bring you that coming up.  All the stories coming up  this Friday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News  Contributor, Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Another messy morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is another messy morning.  Good way to put it there.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This is -- this is because of  revenue, which is what we've been warning our viewers about for weeks and  weeks and weeks, Lindsey Bell, and the like.  </p><p>Overall of the half of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, 43 percent  of the companies have missed revenue estimates, and that is getting worse  and worse as the days wear on.  </p><p>And the headlines this morning, Amazon, another profit, but sales  underwhelm.  Alphabet, Google parent, delivers surging profit, but slowing  sales growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, slowing sales growth, but also the guidance is troubling,  right?  Because they're basically saying, looking forward in the next  quarter in the next year, we want to pull down the expectations a bit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Amazon's forecast for the holiday quarter was -- for revenue  was below expectations as well.</p><p>So, again, it's disappointing.  These valuations, you got to deliver and  better.  Yes.  </p><p>PEEK:  That's the problem.  That's the problem.  Narrow market, narrow  segment.  We've all been looking at these stocks for so long and estimates  kind of got ahead of reality, I think a little bit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet the backdrop still feels strong.  </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, in a backdrop like this, where we're about to get the GDP  this morning in two and a half hours, and we're expecting a number above  three percent.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Yes.  We'll see  about that.  </p><p>You know, the thing I will say here, you know, I have to look at Amazon's  guidance in particular and wonder if they're sand-bagging, but the other  thing I'll point out in the revenue side is, we had Alphabet's CFO blaming  the stronger dollar here and that's been a theme we've been looking at.   Trade of stronger dollar, what effect is it having, it's -- is it all  coming home to roost here.</p><p>And as I said to my clients, you wanted volatility, well, now you have the  volatility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you sure do.  We're going to get a lot of conversation  this this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is here this  morning, along with the Chairman of the RNC, Donna Romney McDaniel is here.  </p><p>Arizona Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member, Andy Biggs,  joining me as well with -- look at the border.  </p><p>And my exclusive joint interview with Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, and  Oracle CEO, Mark Hurd, both of those coming up as well.  Big show ahead.   Don't a miss moment of it.</p><p>But first, let's take a look at technology earnings and the tumble going on  this morning.  Global stocks extending declines, following disappointing  third-quarter revenue from internet giants, Amazon and Alphabet.</p><p>That put a dent in a solid earning season certainly for technology, and  that is what it's weighing on markets this is morning.</p><p>Both industry leaders beat on earnings, but fell short of Wall Street  revenue.  Amazon forecasts its weakest profit growth in two years, that's  what was one of the issues with Amazon, down 10 percent this morning.  </p><p>And, of course, the expectations, as you mentioned, on Amazon way up here.  </p><p>PEEK:  Totally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Company just passed a trillion dollars in terms of its own  market value that's --</p><p>PEEK:  And they're raising costs.  I mean they put through a big wage  increase and so that's weighing a little bit on margins.  That's the other  story, I think, is a lot of companies are talking about cost pressures from  either wages going up or the tariff or whatever.  </p><p>But, you know, it's a little bit of a margin squeeze we're seeing for the  first time in a long time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.  </p><p>PEEK:  And it -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And some of that isn't -- because the $15 minimum wage from  amazon was -- it's going to cost them about $3 billion next year according  to one estimate from Morgan Stanley, but this was in reaction.  </p><p>Again, the government is factoring into these companies as well that Amazon  likely raised the minimum wage for its employees because, remember, Senator  Bernie Sanders introduced the BEZOS Act, trying to tax big companies.  </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Those employees rely on government services, so that -- that's  government.  And then also the government likely going to crack down on  Google's business.  You've seen that.  That showed up in the stock.</p><p>Alphabet's stock had already lost a sixth -- one-sixth of its market value  in the last months.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And so this was on top of the pressure we've have seen in recent  months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We pointed out that Google has 90 percent market share when it  comes to surge.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so that, you question whether or not that's going to be too  big for regulation.</p><p>BLOCK:  The other issue is, you know, Microsoft had very strong numbers in  their cloud business, we see what Amazon did in cloud business.  </p><p>Alphabet, a little disappointing on that side, and if that was supposed to  be a growth area for them beyond the search business, not -- it didn't  quite deliver what people wanted to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you, when I was talking to Larry Ellison the other  day, I was just struck at how competitive he is with Amazon.  </p><p>I mean, after everything -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that he said and all of his accomplishments, he said, \"Oh,  yes,\" and then \"We will beat Amazon in their database services.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was my personal favorite part of the interview, is him just  slamming these companies that try to tacitly dismiss Oracle's database.  </p><p>PEEK:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's like, 'What do you think they're using?\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"They're using Oracle database.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're on Oracle.  </p><p>BLOCK:  It's always been -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But one thing I did want to point out because we mentioned the  sexual harassment issue with Google.  Google said that it's fired 48 staff  members over the past two years for sexual harassment.  That's out of more  than 80,000 employees.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's clearly in response to this New York Times story that was  saying Google protected three senior executives over the last 10 years, one  of whom was dismissed, accused of sexual misconduct, and given a $90  million exit package.  </p><p>But Sundar Pichai said in a memo that the Wall Street Journal obtained that  none of those fired in the last two years got an exit package.  And he  said, \"We're dead serious about making sure that we provide a safe and  inclusive workplace.\"  I wanted to point that out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He didn't say something about that $90 million, as that he's  walking out with $90 million.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes, right, exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, it begs the question.  But, again, 48 people out of  80,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good -- yes.  Good point.  Let's put this in context right  here.  Let's talk more about what's going on this morning with Synovus  Trust Portfolio Manager, Dan Morgan, joining us right now.  </p><p>Dan, good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR MANAGER, TRUST PORTFOLIO:  Hi, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Assess the backdrop for us.  We're seeing revenue warnings here  and technology obviously was all the way up here and it is coming down last  week or so.  What's going on?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, Maria, you know, the overall view of the market in terms of  technology, obviously, has kind of turned negative, but we have to bear in  mind these stocks have had huge runs over the last two or three years.  I  think it's only natural that we get a bit of a pullback.</p><p>I'm not as concerned as maybe the Street is on these most earnings -- most  recent earnings report that have come out.</p><p>I get it, their revenue guidance going in the next quarter was a little bit  light, but if we kind of parse through some of these businesses within the  big umbrella of these companies, they actually did pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They did pretty well, but people are worried about costs going  up and we're hearing the expectations that revenue estimates are too high,  so they may be doing well, but are they doing well enough for what the  market is expecting?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, for example, we look at Amazon, Maria, in terms of the most  recent quarter, we actually saw operating profit double, you know, with 6.6  percent.  They showed tremendous strength in -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Strength.  </p><p>MORGAN:  -- some of their, you know, newer businesses, like AWS and also  other revenues, which is our advertising business.</p><p>So, yes, maybe the estimates have to come back a little bit, maybe everyone  got a little too euphoric in terms of the expectations, but I don't think  we're at the point now where we hit the panic button and say, \"Hey, we got  to get out of tech and move on.  The sector's going down the tubes, like,  let's say back in 2008 or 2000.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>PEEK:  Dan, question for you, what kind of multiples are we looking at now  factoring in these assessments, reassessments of next year's prospects  maybe, where is Amazon selling and where is Google selling in terms of  P.E.?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, there's no doubt Amazon carries a huge multiple, as does  Netflix.  I mean you're looking at, you know, 150 plus times earnings.  </p><p>Even if you go out to 2019, you're looking at huge multiples on Amazon.   Now Google, though, is much more priced better.  You're looking at probably  20 to 25 times earnings going into fiscal year '19.</p><p>So, there is some big differences between Apple and you look at Amazon or  Apple versus Google and so forth.  I mean, Apple trades at 15 times  earnings.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MORGAN:  -- we can't take a blanket statement and say, you know, \"These  stocks are all trading way too high.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes, Netflix and Amazon are huge multiples, but Apple and Google,  and some of these other players are not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point, Michael.</p><p>BLOCK:  Dan, I know we're talking about tech today.  It's the middle of  earning season.  But are there other sectors you're looking to where you're  steering investors towards in terms of trying to find growth?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, you know, in terms of growth for the S&amp;P 500, as you guys  have reported, I mean the third quarter is probably going to be 20 percent,  you know, right now.  Going forward in terms of areas that I think are  interesting, like biotech, is still interesting.  That's a sector that's  been under the weather recently because of issues with patents and so  forth.  </p><p>But I think there's some good valuations there, Biogen, MGEN, and so forth.   So there are other sectors away from just tech that I think are  interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to put money to work in this market even though  things are so nervous?  I mean would you buy today with a market that's  likely going to open down about 200 points?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, Maria, I haven't really been buying a lot of stocks in the  last three or four months to be quite honest with you, with all these new  highs and trillion dollar marks with, you know, Amazon and Apple, so I'm  looking for opportunities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MORGAN:  I have money on the sideline right now, Maria, I'm ready to put to  work, so I'll watch these valuations that no one's going to guess the  bottom, but eventually some of these stocks are going to start to really  make sense again.  </p><p>And I don't think the -- I don't think the backdrop has really changed.  I  really think we're going through correction right now that we got to be  patient.</p><p>I don't think it's a time where we change the entire preface behind  investing in equities at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, you got a -- you got a backdrop where interest  rates are going up and you do have alternatives now in the short end of  fixed income, 3 percent on the two-year, do you think this is an  allocation-shift going on, broadly speaking, in this market?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, Maria, if we continue to see the Federal Reserve raise rates  the way that they've guided to going forward, which is going to put us at,  what, two and a quarter, two and a half, on Fed funds -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>MORGAN:  -- going into the December meeting and then maybe two and three  and quarters and three percent?  </p><p>If that happens, obviously, that's got ta huge negative effect on the  equity markets, but we're still OK -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- I think, at this point, but anything beyond this is really  going to be detrimental.  </p><p>And obviously, President Trump has come out and commented on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right.  We will leave it there.  I mean Dan says that  the -- that nothing has changed in terms of the storyline, but we know that  we're getting revenue misses, so -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Major revenue misses.  </p><p>PEEK:  And -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And in terms of overall percentage of companies missing revenue,  it's been growing as we moved on in the season, and this will be the  biggest revenue miss overall for the S&amp;P potentially this year so far, and  expectations for the fed have been coming down for December, I wanted to  point that out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  OK.  We will -- we will watch that.  Dan Morgan, thank  you very much.  </p><p>Coming up, searching for answers this morning, Saudi Arabia now says the  killing of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was premeditated.  The intense  investigation coming next.  </p><p>And then more of my exclusive interview with the Co-Founder of Oracle,  Larry Ellison, also Oracle's CEO, Mark Hurd.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning, take a look.  </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial average expected to be down 240 points right out  of the gate this morning, that's one percent lower.  </p><p>The NASDAQ fairing even worst this morning.  It is down two and a half  percent right now.  That is a decline of 175 points at the open this  morning. </p><p>We want to get to the growing caravan crisis right now.</p><p>President Trump is considering blocking entry at the southern border as  over a thousand migrants make their way toward the United States right now.</p><p>Griff Jenkins is at the Mexico border this morning, he's got the very  latest.  Griff, good morning to you.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p>We're about 120 miles north of the Guatemalan-Mexico border in Pijijiapan,  which is a town where the migrants mostly spend the night, and you see  hundreds of them marching behind me.</p><p>Let me just give you a look here, it's really quite compelling, a mother  and her child making this trek.  They marched early, Maria, because of the  heat of the day can get so brutal.  It's just very, very difficult.</p><p>But look, come with me for one second.</p><p>We'll actually ask the -- ma'am, hola.  Buenas Dias.  Habla Ingles?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  </p><p>JENKINS:  No?  OK.  We're trying not to really bother them, but, you know,  when you hear the President say -- tweeting to turn around, you hear DHS  Secretary Nielsen saying that they won't be allowed in.  They just won't  stop from continuing their march.  </p><p>In fact, we talked to a Honduran man earlier about a hour ago and he said  he's coming because of the conditions in his country are the result of the  Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, and they said when the  President Trump says he's cutting off aid on -- to Honduras, he says,  \"We've never seen any of the aid anyway, it won't affect us,\" because of  their President.  </p><p>But most of them come because of the conditions, they come for work,  trabajo, that's the word we keep hearing, the Spanish word for \"work\" and  many of them will continue from here on a trek towards Tijuana.  </p><p>But, Maria, where we are, it would be about 800 miles from this very point  to McAllen, Texas, where we were earlier this week, but yet about twice  that, about 1,600 miles, if they're going to go to Tijuana, although they  typically, migrants in these caravans, like the last one in April, go to  California to Tijuana because they perceive California as much more  friendly to asylum-seekers and migrants than say the State of Texas.  </p><p>But we have seen at least more than a thousand of migrants turn away  because they've been at this since October 13th, very, very difficult  conditions.</p><p>I don't have a car coming through now because those are going southbound,  but as we -- see, when cars come through and come northbound, you see them  hopping on any cars that they can.  </p><p>We've seen little stations along this road of church groups from Mexico and  others that have set up food, water, clothes, supplies, this is just one of  the checkpoints just above the town of Pijijiapan as they go along.  </p><p>It looks like a lot of them tell me that their destination -- today, their  goal is about 80 to 100 kilometers north to a jungle of Arriaga, where  they've usually gotten on a train, but we're told the trains are not  running, it's been suspended for the time.  </p><p>So very interesting morning, already very busy.  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Incredible, Griff.  We'll get back to you as news  develops.  Thanks so much.  Griff Jenkins in Mexico this morning,</p><p>Well, the son of Jamal Khashoggi has arrived in the United States.  Cheryl  Casone with the details there.  He had just come from Saudi Arabia, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The eldest son of  the murdered post-journalist is now in the U.S. with his family.  </p><p>He'd previously been unable to leave Saudi because of Jamal Khashoggi's  criticism of the Saudi government.</p><p>State department says the U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow  Khashoggi's son to leave the country.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again, now saying the  killing was premeditated.  Saudi officials say Turkey's evidence shows that  the murder was planned contradicting their earlier claim that rogue  officials killed Khashoggi by mistake during a fistfight.</p><p>Well, job cuts coming to Nokia.  The telecom company announcing it's  launching a round of global layoffs as they gear up for fifth generation  networks.  No specific number has been put on these job losses, but Nokia  says they are going to be part of a plan to save about 800 million a year  by the end of 2020.</p><p>Shares of Nokia are higher in the premarket.</p><p>All right.  We got a lot more coming up on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  </p><p>The hunt is on, right, Maria?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they sure are.  The feds are turning their focus on  Florida as they search for who sent at least 10 suspicious packages to  President Trump's critics.  We will have that next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The search for a suspect and a motive in a  string of 10 suspicious packages sent to prominent democrats.</p><p>Authorities zeroing in on Florida this morning, investigators are searching  a mail facility there, they have been doing that overnight.  There could be  more coming out there.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump taking on critics of his response to the  incidents tweeting this overnight.  \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and others  can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of bombs  and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City  bombing, yet when I criticize them, they go wild and scream, 'It's just not  presidential.'\"</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Washington Examiner  Columnist, Philip Wegmann.  </p><p>Philip, good to see you.  Thanks so much for being here.  </p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to all of this?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, I think that this can be explained by President Trump's  initial reaction to the bombings.  He said two things, first he called for  unity, and the second was that he was very angry that this attack had  happened, and that explains this 3:00 a.m. tweet because presumably the  President is doing everything he can to get federal agents to get to the  bottom of this.  </p><p>Meanwhile, he turns on CNN and looks elsewhere and sees that, you know,  before we know the name of the attacker, before we know their motivation,  before we have anything besides a general profile, he's being blamed.</p><p>And so I think what this is going to show us going forward is that, you  know, with two weeks ahead of the elections, the President isn't going to  moderate his tone and the President isn't going to entertain any arguments  that he's responsible for this in any way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, by the way, we should point out that CNN has been  criticizing this President for two years, bringing John Brennan on so that  they could make these false claims about any Russia collusion, which never  materialized, and there's absolutely zero evidence about it.</p><p>So, I mean, to be fair, the, you know, the media has been against this  President and criticizing him, and attacking him, and not reporting any of  his accomplishments for two years.</p><p>WEGMANN:  Yes, to be certain, I mean, we've seen the President go to bat  against this media in the past and he's been critical of them, they've been  critical of him.</p><p>There's been a back and forth that hasn't been pleasant.  But, you know,  like, we're all professionals here, we're all adults, and we can deal with  people calling us names.</p><p>I think it is a very large leap to assume that because a president is  calling someone out, because he's calling out an industry and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>WEGMANN:  -- I don't think that he should do it, but it's -- I think it's a  leap to say that because of that rhetoric that somehow is going to incite  people to violence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>WEGMANN:  I mean, I'm young, but I do remember President Obama saying, you  know, that when there's a knife fight, you bring a gun, and no one was  saying that, you know, President Obama was somehow responsible for any of  the violence that we've seen subsequently against -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great point.  Is there any indication of what this meant for  the polling as we approach the midterms?  I mean any kind of sentiment read  that you -- that you're aware of?  </p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, you know, I really expect President Obama, when he's in  Wisconsin today, I think he's going to echo a lot of the rhetoric from  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who they certainly hope that they can argue  that this President, because of his tone and because of his rhetoric, has  somehow inspired some of these attacks.</p><p>I haven't seen polling that has changed anything significantly yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>WEGMANN:  But I think that you're going to have a problem when you try to  compare this to Oklahoma City or pin this on the right like the Clintons  did during the '90's for two reasons.  </p><p>First, no one was hurt, thank God, and second, it's going to be very  difficult the left to lecture the right on civility when just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>WEGMANN:  -- a couple of news cycles ago, you had Hillary Clinton saying  that civility wasn't required.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and then you had -- or called or -- </p><p>WEGMANN:  You had Maxine Waters, yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when they go low, let's just kick them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get in real quick before you go, this fallout from  the Kavanaugh Confirmation.  </p><p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, Chuck Grassley, is referring Michael  Avenatti and his client, Julie Swetnick, for possible criminal prosecution.   Criminal prosecution over the allegations of making false statements to  Congress, because we know, Dagen, throughout this whole Kavanaugh circus,  she comes out and starts calling gang rape with no -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  With nothing to back it up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That one NBC interview that she gave fell apart in her first  breath literally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That she couldn't even explain the timeline of why she came  forward and when.</p><p>This is equal application of the law.  It'll be interesting to see if the  Justice Department follows through on this.  Jeff Sessions has not been  great at doing that in terms of going after people who say didn't show up  for subpoenas in front of Congress.  </p><p>If they were members, you know, associated with Hillary Clinton -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this would be interesting, but this is -- again, you can't  come in front of Congress and lie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  And remember when Jeff Sessions first  started, he said he had all these leak investigations going on.  Remember  that one?  </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  Whatever happened to that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happened to that?  </p><p>PEEK:  Good question.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was referring to Bryan Pagliano because he didn't show up for  two subpoenas in front of Jason Chaffetz's congressional committee and they  wanted the Justice Department to go after him for not showing up for the  subpoenas and Sessions did nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll keep watching that because Grassley is referring Swetnick  and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal charges.</p><p>Philip Wegmann, good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much -- </p><p>WEGMANN:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for weighing in on all of the above.  </p><p>Coming up, user-friendly no more, Snapchat's revenue blew past  expectations, but look at the stock, sliding this morning over concerns  about active user growth slowing down.  Then, more of my exclusive  interview with both Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd of Oracle, where we talk  growth and opportunities.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Friday, it is Friday, October  26th, your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are selling off again this morning, we've got a serious decline  underway, Dow Industrials down 228 points, that's one percent, the NASDAQ  is down 152 points, that's 2-1/4 percent lower, on the NASDAQ.</p><p>Stocks under pressure amid weak results from the technology sector,  particularly, Alphabet, parent of Google, and Amazon, last night, talking  about weaker than expected sales.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets down across the board, FT-100 down 1-1/2  percent, CAC Quarante in Paris, down 2-1/4 percent, DAX Index in Germany,  down almost two percent.  In Asia overnight, similar story, worst performer  there, was Korea, down one and three quarter's percent.</p><p>One stock to watch today, Snap, the stock plunging ahead of the open, down  14 percent, Snapchat loses millions of users in the last quarter, and it  does see more, leaving.</p><p>First though, a Fox Business exclusive this morning, Oracle CEO Mark Hurd  and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison, sitting down for an interview side- by-side, for the first time, ever.  We discussed the company's growth  prospects, competition in the tech sector.</p><p>We began with this historic relationship and how they coexist and thrive,  while piloting one of the world's most influential technology companies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  We get along.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  We talk through a lot of things.  We don't agree on everything.   But, yes, we talk through them.  And I think we have a great relationship.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, you felt one of the greatest technologies -- most  important technology companies of our time.  You're still leading its  direction.  Tell us where you prioritize your interests, in Oracle, as  you've got Mark, at the helm, as CEO?</p><p>ELLISON:  Well, I think, from the very beginning at Oracle, I've ran  engineering and, I guess, when I'm back, back again, running -- all of it,  engineering.  So, I work on our product development, whether it's database  product development, the foundation of our business, or our latest and  greatest Cloud applications.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, that's where the growth is, in the whole industry today.   Tell us where you find the growth stories within Oracle in the industry,  what's the most exciting right now?</p><p>ELLISON:  Well, in terms of growth, I mean, if you're looking at the  numbers, to me, it's two separate questions, what do you think the coolest  new technology is that you are working on, which might not have shown up in  the numbers yet, and then, what, you know, what's showing up in the  numbers.  What have we been doing well for a while?  So, you can actually  see it through the financial results.</p><p>And that's our SAS applications.  We are, by far and away, the largest  provider of Cloud applications for financial accounting, for supply chain,  for manufacturing.  We have now 6,000 ERP customers for our Fusion suite,  another 15,000 for our next suite ERP customers, financial accounting  customers.</p><p>Our closest competitor claims to have a couple of hundred customers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A couple of hundred customers.</p><p>ELLISON:  Couple of hundred customers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, OK.  And Mark, you're seeing the ups and downs of the  business in terms of running the operations, a lot of worry out there,  about growth and whether it's slowing down.  Are your customers wanting to  transition into the Cloud?  How fast are they doing that and what can you  tell us about growth?</p><p>HURD:  You know, going (INAUDIBLE) applications business, we've got most of  our customers looking and moving to Cloud.  About 10 percent of our base  has actually moved their core applications to the Cloud, about another 40  percent have bought some product in the Cloud that they are using with  their existing On-Premise product.</p><p>But our entire base will move to the Cloud, over the next several years,  all of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you made the point, that you can -- when you're -- when  you're looking specifically at the applications business, you can actually  transition your existing customers and double revenue in that business.</p><p>HURD:  Exactly right, so just one more time, our total applications  revenue, when all of our existing On-Premise customers moved to the Cloud,  that revenue will double.</p><p>ELLISON:  I think about starting over again, I go into Biotech.  I think  that's where all -- almost all the excitement is going to be, into  robotics.  We're seeing a tremendous amount of robotics in our specific  industry.  You know, we have all of this autonomous systems built in to the  latest generation of our Cloud.</p><p>So, our database is completely robotic.  There are no human beings involved  in operating our database.  Our Cloud has robotic, you know, Star Wars-like  cyber defenses, where these cyber robots find security threats and kill  them.</p><p>So, Clouds, modern Cloud is constantly under attack by, what are called  botnets, some are state actors, some are cyber criminals, and we are  building modern robotic defenses to protect our customers' data.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  I want to go back to what you said about  Biotech, but to touch on what you just said, you made the point in your  keynote, earlier this week, that the approach Amazon and AWS has taken, it  means it runs AWS Cloud control code on the same machines that it actually  stores the corporate data, possibly leaving that data, vulnerable.  Can you  tell us more about that?</p><p>ELLISON:  Not possibly.  I mean, we've seen headlines, you know, cyber  break-ins at Google, at Facebook and Amazon, big government agencies.  It  is happening because these architectures, these old Cloud architectures  really were designed for security, security was an afterthought.</p><p>We have separated our Cloud control code and put it in a network of  computers that are entirely separate from the computers we rent to  customers.  Amazon, if a customer comes in and rents a computer from  Amazon, in that same computer, is Amazon code.</p><p>That means, that customer, if they're smart, can hack the Amazon code, take  control of that computer, and then go out to other computers in the Amazon  Cloud, and steal data.</p><p>That is impossible to do with the architecture we have, in our Generation 2  Cloud, where user computers, customer computers, only has customer code in  it.  And our control or security computers are Cloud control computers has  only our code in it.  There is no way a customer can get at our Cloud  control code, hack it, and take control of the Cloud.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this confirms the idea of what you've been talking about,  for years, and that is staying with one integrated company which is away  from the open public Cloud.  Is that right?</p><p>ELLISON:  No.  I mean, our Cloud -- our Cloud is available on the internet.   So, I mean, you come in on the internet, and you can use our SAS  applications, you can use our database, you can use all of that.  So, it is  completely -- it's not a walled garden.</p><p>Every -- all of our customers can get -- can get at our Clouds, very easy  to do, in fact, getting at our Cloud and getting at Amazon's Cloud, looks  kind of the same.  The difference is, if you take, you know, if you look  very closely, you'll see, we give customers a set of computers that they  can rent, just like Amazon does. </p><p>We have our control code, the code that controls the Cloud, and that's on a  completely separate set of computers.  We would never let our control code,  you know, be in the same computer as our customers' code, because the  customer might be someone you don't know from the Ukraine, who is really,  really smart, hacks your code.</p><p>And then, has able to, you know, hacks your control code, and is able to  take over that computer or take over a big chunk of the Cloud.</p><p>So, it's just as easy to access our Cloud, as to access the Amazon Cloud.   But when you access our code -- Cloud, you are -- we create this  impenetrable barrier around our users, so they can't get through.  You know  what?  They can't get through to our Cloud control code, which is on a  completely separate network of Cloud control computers.</p><p>Amazon does not have a separate network of Cloud controlled computers.   They share the same computer.  That's a terrible security vulnerability.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More from Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd, coming up.  Meanwhile,  stall recall, Ford says it needs to fix more than 1 million Focus cars.  We  will tell you what's going wrong there, right after this break.</p><p>Then, munch on this, this photo of Justin Bieber eating a burrito, leaving  the internet divided over this technique.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another rough day at the office this morning.   Take look at markets right now, Dow Industrials expected to be better than  200 points today, that's one percent.  The S&amp;P is 1-1/4 percent; NASDAQ and  technology stocks, worst-performing in terms of earnings this morning.   NASDAQ down 2-1/3 percent, we've got a number of pre-announcements as well  as revenue weaknesses within the tech sector after the close last night,  and that is weighing on this market hard this morning.  Meanwhile, there's  this, a nor'easter, about to slam the northeast.  Cheryl Casone with the  details there.  Not again, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You probably didn't think I was going to say the word  northeastern.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I didn't.</p><p>CASONE:  And it's still October, right?  Yes, here we go.  A major storm  that came from the south is going to be turn into a nor'easter as it  approaches this area.  The storm is going to bring heavy rain, powerful  wind to this region starting later today, gusty winds expected to be as  high as 30 to 40 miles-per-hour.  Utility companies say that trees are  still full of leaves and that increases the chance of power outages caused  by those falling branches and, of course, that is danger to people as well.   Coastal flooding is possible throughout the northeast this morning -- no,  this weekend, excuse me.  </p><p>Ford is announcing a recall of its focus cars in North America.  The  company says 1-1/2 million vehicles have a fuel tank defect that could  cause them to stall and have problems restarting.  Ford says, customers  should keep their fuel tanks at least half-full until dealers can correct  this problem.  Ford shares down 43 percent this year.  </p><p>Well, shares of Snap sharply lower in the premarket.  They're reporting  that they lost two million daily active users in the quarter.  They beat  Wall Street revenue expectations bringing in over $297 million but the  company still hasn't turned a profit, something the CEO Evan Spiegel hopes  to achieve sometime in 2019, he says.  Shares of Snap are down more than 12  percent in the premarket.  The stock is at $6.00 and change.  That is not  where it IPO-ed, folks.  </p><p>Well, people on the Internet can't get over this photo that allegedly shows  popstar, Justin Bieber, eating a burrito.  A lot of people are pointing  out, he's biting his burrito in the middle, rather than from the sides,  which is how you do it.  Some think the person eating the burrito might not  even be Bieber.  They say that his hair color is different.  This was taken  in a West Hollywood Park.  He does live by there, Maria, but it could very  well be just more of his strange burrito eating techniques that he wants to  go viral.  Either way, it did.  We don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know why certain things go viral.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, but, it's because -- well, it's Justin Bieber and they find  it offensive that he doesn't know how to eat a burrito properly.  </p><p>PEEK:  It's like eating a hotdog in the middle, right?  I mean, imagine  taking a bite of a hotdog in the middle, it would look ridiculous.  </p><p>BLOCK:  I mean, music stars used to show some decorum.  I mean, Ozzy  Osbourne would never eat a burrito that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  All right, coming up, the holiday shopping  season is right around the corner.  We are putting the estimates out there;  what retailers are doing to keep their employees working through the  busiest time of the year, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The holiday season, fast approaching, employers  are taking a number of steps to retain labor including more company perks.   Joining us now is Branch Messenger CEO and the Founder of Branch, Atif  Siddiqui.  Atif, good to see you.  </p><p>ATIF SIDDIQUI, CEO AND FOUNDER, BRANCH MESSENGER:  Good to see you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  The trends going into the  holidays, what are they? </p><p>SIDDIQUI:  Yes, so, you know, I think one of the things we've seen is an  increase in seasonal hiring, about 10 percent increase since last year, so  about 650,000 new employees these retailers are hiring.  And they are  feeling the crunch now because unemployment at an all-time low, low as it's  been since 1969.  And the other thing is that retailers are still having a  tough time retaining these employees, about 100 percent turnover year over  year.  So, they're doing everything they can to incentivize to bring them  in.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Atif, we hear a lot about some of the pressures that companies are  having trying to fund qualified workers.  What sectors are we seeing -- and  I hear it a lot in trucking -- what are other sectors that you see that  might surprise some of our viewers?  Is there just, kind of, squeeze? </p><p>SIDDIQUI:  Yes, so it's not just retail stores, right?  When you look at  omnichannel and the rise of online shopping, there's also distribution  centers, fulfillment centers, manufacturing facilities.  So, yes, it's  across the spectrum here on not just, you know, store employees but  everything to service that store or put product on the shelves.  </p><p>BLOCK:  And what skills are in demand there? </p><p>SIDDIQUI:  Yes.  So, you know, in general, the skills that are in demand  are it's a lot of manual labor, right?  So, unloading shelves, unloading  boxes, things like that.  So, yes, that's still a transferable skill that  can apply across --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are the retailers opening these fulfillment centers, though, in  areas where unemployment might be a little higher, because I can pinpoint  areas across the country that these places need more jobs versus around  metropolitan areas? </p><p>SIDDIQUI:  Yes.  No, that is true.  I think, you know, it goes into the  retail strategy or where these distribution centers and fulfillment centers  are opening up.  But yes, to give you an idea of what they're doing to  attract some of these workers; you know, we're seeing an increase in wages  for this workforce, we're seeing incentives like gift cards or deep  employee discounts, right?  But one of the things that we've really seen is  by leveraging technology, you can utilize their current workforce to do  more and continue to attract and retain the best, by providing them, you  know, additional incentives like same-day payments, for example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We should point out that Amazon is raising the minimum wage for  the warehouse workers starting next week.  The wage hike goes in next week.   They also recently announced 100,000 jobs for the holiday.  But of course,  in yesterday's earnings report, the company sales growth slowed down in the  third quarter, and that's moving the stock this morning.  But as you  mentioned, technology and how it's being used.  </p><p>PEEK:  Yes, a lot of these companies, and certainly in the warehouse and  distribution field are using a lot more robots and so forth, I presume.   One question for you, it seemed to us like that people start hiring for the  holidays much earlier than usual this year, maybe anticipating that there  is a crunch workers availability.  I mean, is that still going on?  Or, you  know, it didn't seem like the calendar kind of moved forward there.  </p><p>SIDDIQUI:  Yes, that's a good point.  Actually, the amount of employers  hiring as early as August doubled since last year.  So, they were  definitely anticipating this growth as well as, you know, they're seeing  strong consumer confidence in this sector.</p><p>PEEK:  We were surprised that Amazon talked a little bit down about their  fourth quarter.  Are there any other signals out there that maybe the  holiday season won't justify all this hiring and stuff? </p><p>SIDDIQUI:  Yes, I think, you know, from what we've seen, there is a strong  consumer confidence in the holiday season, so coming into this, I think  we're going to see a strong retail sector.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're still expecting a good holiday season.  </p><p>SIDDIQUI:  I'm still expecting a good holiday season, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the GDP coming up this morning, so that certainly  will impact markets.  Atif, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much.</p><p>SIDDIQUI:  Likewise, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Atif Siddiqui joining us there.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, we are watching futures this morning, markets are selling off  once again at the opening of trading.  We're expecting the Dow Industrials  to be down 250 points and the NASDAQ even harder hit down 165 points,  that's 2-1/3 percent.  Then this, workplace scandals at Google and Netflix  revealed.  More on those bombshell report, next hour right here in MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.

Good Friday  morning, everybody -- thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th.  </p><p>Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Stocks are in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at futures  indicating a sharp decline at the start of trading.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average down 250 points right now.  That's 1 percent lower.  The  S&amp;P 500 is down 1.25 percent.  And the Nasdaq, even harder hit with a 165- point selloff expected at the open for the Nasdaq.  That is two and a third  lower right out of the gate.</p><p>Global markets also under selling pressure this morning.  Take a look at  European indices where you see the FT 100 down 1.5 percent, 100 points  lower.  The CAC 40 in Paris down two and a third percent, 121 points lower.   And the DAX index in Germany down 2 percent, that's 220 points lower on the  DAX.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board -- fractional moves in some  cases.  But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down better than 1 percent and  the Kospi in Korea down 1.75 percent.</p><p>Technology earnings are in focus -- that is what's driving markets this  morning.  Take a look.  Amazon shares are down 9.25 percent, weighing on  the entire technology sector, as the company's revenue missed expectations  last night.</p><p>For Intel, bucking the trend however, the stock is actually higher this  morning by a fraction.  It had better than expected results and also better  than expected guidance from Intel.</p><p>Semiconductors got slammed this week as Texas Instruments led the whole  group lower.</p><p>Investors are watching Google parent Alphabet as well.  The company's  profit was soaring but sales slowed down and that's what's impacting the  stock.  Sales revenue under pressure and the stock is down 6 percent right  now on Alphabet.</p><p>Then a bombshell report over sexual misconduct at Alphabet, that's also  weighing on the stock.  We're going to tell you what happened there at  Google in that regard.</p><p>Netflix is under fire this morning as well.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is  out with a startling report about the streaming giant's corporate culture.   The stock is down 4 percent on Netflix.  Details coming up.</p><p>Then a view from the top -- Oracle CEO Mark Hurd and Oracle co-founder  Larry Ellison weighing in on everything from growth to artificial  intelligence and data security in my exclusive interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  -- to fully automate discovery, and the  second is discovery to get robots.  Discovery to get robots (INAUDIBLE)  because if they have robot attacks on our clouds and robot attacks on our  data centers and our government agencies, you better have robotic defenses  or cyber defenses that are Star Wars-ish.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time they've ever sat down for an interview  together.  We're going to bring that to you coming up.</p><p>All that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox  Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors market strategist  Michael Block is here, and Fox News contributor Liz Pete joining us as  well.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PETE, FOX NEWS CTR:  Good morning.  Nice to be here, I think.  We have  a lot to talk about, none of it good right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tough market this morning.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Big morning.   President Trump imposed tariffs on China and China wished us interesting  times.  We're seeing it in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting times.</p><p>PETE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been bullish on this market pretty much.  Has anything  changed?  </p><p>BLOCK:  I've gotten bullish down here.  I wasn't that bullish to start out  with.  I've always been growth over value.  Right now, my premise is this.   Longer term I think it's a great time to be buying stocks.</p><p>The analogy I keep using is markets are damaged.  You can go out and break  your leg, even if you're feeling good a particular morning, a week later  you probably don't want to run outside and try to kick a field goal in the  30-degree weather.  It takes time for things to heal.</p><p>We're in for some volatility and choppiness.  But I think over time when  you start buying these big tech stocks you're going to be happy in the long  term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk about this because we want to  zero in on what's troubling the sector importantly this morning.  </p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got the Energy Secretary here, Rick Perry  joining us this morning; along with the chairwoman of the RNC, Ronna Romney  McDaniel, just 12 days away from the midterm elections; Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs weighs in on the border crisis; and more of my exclusive  interview with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>Futures pointing to another big selloff this morning -- it has been  obviously a volatile week even with yesterday's gain at the close.</p><p>Dow industrials this morning set to be down 218 points.  Technology's  leading the downward trend this morning because of disappointing earnings  last night.  The Nasdaq down 150 points, that's 2.5 percent lower on the  Nasdaq.</p><p>And here's some of the damage in the premarket as you can see.  Facebook  down 3 percent, Amazon is down 9 percent right now, Apple's down 1.5  percent, Netflix down 4 percent, and Alphabet parent of Google down 5.67  percent.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is LJH Investment Advisors  managing director, media and entertainment analyst Larry Haverty.  Larry --  it's good to see you.  Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has anything changed in terms of the backdrop for the large  media technology companies that we're talking about today, like Google for  example.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I absolutely think it has -- Maria.  You look at these stocks and  they've been almost a religion.  And I think some of the people are getting  out of church.</p><p>Putting that in financial terms, if you look at -- and I think Amazon's the  easiest place to start.  If you look at their report on the surface, it  looks terrific.  They had a very, very strong revenue growth, stronger  EBITD growth, the margin's improved, there's a lot of free cash flow.</p><p>But if you look below the surface, you can see the beginning of some warts  developing.  I think the thing that struck me was that the foreign growth  was only 15 percent.</p><p>And you have a stock that's up in the neighborhood of $250 billion of sales  and it sells at these multiples, you have to have foreign growth.  And you  look at India as a foreign market and is used to having more or less things  for themselves and Wal-Mart is going to compete very vigorously in India.   They just bought a local guy and they told their shareholders that they  weren't going to make a whole lot of money there for the next couple years  and the shareholders sent the stock up.  So that's a warning sign to  Amazon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAVERTY:  The second warning sign, Maria -- I think you talked about it  earlier and I'm concerned about it -- is I think there's going to be margin  pressure from this shortage of employees.  You go down to Florida and there  are so many help wanted signs.  I just don't think there are any legal  workers available in most markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And they've got to find 100,000 people at a time when the  seasonal pressure of employers to add workers is very high.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  So I think it's going to have some inefficiencies in the fourth  quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are a lot of things coming together to sort of create  this uncertainty.  Earlier this week we spoke with AlphaOne Capital  Partners founding partner Dan Niles and he summed it up this way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain during a bull market since World War II.</p><p>But if you look at the big picture around growth, you've got a lot of  concerns.  You've got China starting to slow down.  Auto sales in China  went from being up 15 percent year over year in April to down 10 in the  most recent month.  That's a pretty big change.</p><p>You've got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe.  And in the U.S.  interest rates are going up.  They're at the highest levels in seven years.</p><p>What you've seen in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a  pretty big exception, is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower.</p><p>I'll give you an example.  Texas Instruments reported last night and I  think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.  They  do about $16 billion in revenues, $100 billion in market cap.</p><p>They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?  </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are.  And this is exacerbated by the fact  that you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest  company in the world -- Apple, for example.  They have 89 percent inventory  growth year over year in the June quarter that they reported.  The revenues  are up 17 percent.</p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  And that's why we're seeing revenue under  pressure -- Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Right.  Dan Niles was  mentioning the Texas Instruments revenue but Larry -- 43 percent of the S&amp;P  500 companies that have reported so far have missed revenue expectations.   That is a big number and certainly the biggest percentage that we've seen  this year.</p><p>One viewer noted on Twitter, \"Don't the earnings matter more than the  revenue?\"  And I said well, you can get to earnings by cutting costs  because your taxes are lower.  Ultimately if you're a growth company, you  better be growing that revenue and faster and faster every quarter.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, if you didn't like the third quarter, you're for sure not  going to like the fourth quarter because the dollar's strengthening.  And  in the fourth quarter sales are seasonally stronger so the mountain's  higher.</p><p>So you're looking at a fourth quarter where just because of this labor  thing, you're going to have employment shortages and margin pressure.   You're going to have interest expense going up way more than it has in past  years.</p><p>I think it's really been 30 years since we've had a good interest rate  cycle and we've got a good interest rate cycle going, at least until the  last couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And it doesn't look like you're going to get any help from China.   China's being very difficult and I think the political situation there is  scary.  So there's plenty of room for causes personally since stocks aren't  -- I think stocks are reasonable now.  I don't think they're expensive.   But they certainly aren't cheap.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PETE:  I was going to say, I mean earnings are growing at 20 percent and  after all, that does bring the multiples down.  I'm not talking about tech  necessarily but overall it seems to me valuations are pretty good.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think right now you're at a point where most of the  companies can't be buying the stock in the market because they're -- </p><p>PETE:  Right -- which is another big factor -- </p><p>HAVERTY:  -- in reporting mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>HAVERTY:  The market is usually bottomed in October and another thing that  doesn't get a lot of press is mutual fund tax loss selling.  Most mutual  fund companies try to minimize their tax liabilities by selling their  losers.</p><p>So there's a lot of pressure seasonally on the market.  And that pressure  is going to erode.  And I think people will be looking at the 10-year at  3.08 percent and saying \"Oh my gosh, let's buy a couple stocks, I can get a  5 percent plus yield in the telephone company and Verizon.\"  You know,  what's so bad about that now that they have media exposure to make them  grow a little faster.  </p><p>PETE:  Actually that's a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think we're close to the bottom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michael -- you know, what Dan Niles said the other day,  the average dividend yield within the S&amp;P 500 is 1.8 percent.  So can you  get 3 percent in the two-year versus 1.8 percent in the stock market,  that's -- there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  We'll see.  There's a tradeoff there.</p><p>Larry -- one thing really quickly here, you know, we're talking about wage  pressures and the effect that they have on margins.  I heard this argument  six months ago.  Retailers were supposedly going to go down on this.  Banks  were out pitching hedge funds on baskets of stocks they should short  because of wage pressure.</p><p>Well guess what, those retailers were able to pass on price increases.   That was spelled out in the Beige Book in another evidence we got.  And  those retailer stocks continue to rally.</p><p>Do you think that scenario could be repeated here?  Can retailers pass on  price increases in the holiday season?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think the retail stocks rallied because they were trading at  six to eight times EBITD versus 30 plus times for Amazon and close to 20  plus times for Google.  So the stocks were very undervalued.</p><p>I think there's going to be margin pressure -- there can't not be.  The  world is just very, very competitive and rates are up and wage costs are  going to be up and you can see this in the macroeconomic statistics.</p><p>So I think the seas are going to be rough but we're at a level where  there's still a lot of free cash flow, the world certainly doesn't need  more retail stores.</p><p>Google's really the only company that I can see that is really sharply  accelerating their capital spending.  And we'll see how that works later  on.  And I think a lot of that's related to Waymo which I think is going to  be potentially a big proposition.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  But I  think we're very close to where it's going to get better and there are a  lot of good things going on and I think the -- they're going to be  recognized.</p><p>But first we've got to get through this seasonal pain and some stock- specific pain when margins go down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So much money is being managed now by machines and machines have  been programmed not to like margin pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And you need to get out of the way of the machines when they're  doing their thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Humans don't like margin pressure also.  Machines and humans --  they don't like margin pressure.</p><p>Larry -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for your  insights.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very much appreciated.  Larry Haverty joining us there. </p><p>Coming up -- the search for a sender intensifies with authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package.  The very  latest details there.</p><p>Then President Trump tackling high drug prices -- we will tell you about  the plan to lower the cost of your medications, right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're watching markets lower this morning.  Take a look at what we're  expecting at the start of trading.  Dow Industrial down 220 points, almost  1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 is down better than 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq with a  decline of better than 2 percent, 148 points lower.</p><p>This happens to be off of the lows of the morning I should point out.  But  this has everything to do with earnings last night within the tech sector  and revenue misses specifically.</p><p>Meanwhile there is an intense nationwide manhunt underway after 10  suspicious packages were sent to prominent Democrats this week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well Maria -- federal  investigators are now increasingly focusing on south Florida.  They  searched a mail facility in the region, that was last night.  Several pipe  bomb packages went through that facility.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden was one of those targets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These pipe bombs  being mailed might wake everybody in my business up a little bit and  realize that we have to begin to put this country back together again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile President Trump tweeting, \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN and  others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of  bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma  City bombing.  Yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just  not presidential.\"</p><p>Well, speaking of President Trump, he is taking action to address the  rising cost of health care.  Trump unveiling a test plan to lower Medicare  drug prices by matching them to their prices in other countries.  If  approved this could ultimately save taxpayers billions but the proposal  expected to face opposition from drug makers.</p><p>And just in time for Halloween, Starbucks has a new brew.  It's called the  Witch's Brew frappuccino.  Even though it is mostly purple, it's pretty  much an orange creamsicle.  Not to give this away, I'm sorry.  But that's  basically what this is.</p><p>It's got orange cream flavoring, green swirl, but there's chia seeds on top  and then it's got vanilla whipped cream on it and then matcha powder which  is green.  They posted it to Facebook with the poem that says \"Wart of bat,  breath of toad, howl of cat, yum bestowed\".  There you go -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Weird.  That's weird.</p><p>CASONE:  The stock is lower -- Starbucks is lower in the premarket.</p><p>Yes, we have them on set.  And so these are -- and, you know, it's limited  time.  This goes -- remember, we had the Franken Frappuccino.  And last  year, Maria -- we brought you the Zombie Frappuccino.  Now we're getting  the Witch's Brew Frappucino.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What color was the zombie?  Do you remember?  Was it the same  color? </p><p>CASONE:  No it wasn't purple as this one.  The Zombie was more green.  It's  funny because this is like -- they should put this in a new cup.  I'm like  yes, it's only good for about a week and then it's over.</p><p>PETE:  Wow, with orange or -- I don't know.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But they also come -- they're going to serve mummy cake pops  and they're going to serve raccoon sugar cookies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do these just work?  Do these gimmicks work?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they get people in?  </p><p>CASONE:  The Zombie Frappucino last year they ran out of ingredients for  the Zombie Frappuccino because they were so popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which were zombies, of course.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  This is really goo.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we don't talk calories on the show.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  It's gluten free.  It's keto-friendly.  Don't worry about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  None of the above.  </p><p>CASONE:  Diet November 1st, people, come on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, markets are under pressure this morning --  disappointing results from Amazon and Google.  Those stocks lower and that  is dragging on the Nasdaq, that's for sure.  The Dow Industrials down 200  points.  The Nasdaq down 141.  We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Then oil prices headed for a third weekly decline as well.  The Energy  Secretary Rick Perry is joining us exclusively next to talk about the state  of the U.S. energy sector.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching oil and the energy sector.  Oil prices falling as  oversupply becomes a concern.  As you could see, crude oil now at $66.47.</p><p>Reuters is reporting that the SaudiOPEC governor says a potential oil glut  could become an issue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Secretary -- it's  good to see you.  </p><p>RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY:  It's good to be here -- Maria.  Thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So your reaction to that?   Are we looking at a glut now?  </p><p>PERRY:  It's a snapshot in time and we know that stable supply is really  the most important issue to us so we don't get these spikes and ups and  downs.  So right now, there's a bit more than what the market is using but  that can vanish in a hurry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've been talking so much about the U.S. becoming a bigger and  bigger producer.  So with all of the headlines around Saudi Arabia right  now, with Jamal Khashoggi news -- does the U.S. need Saudi Arabia oil?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, the world market does.  And, you know, this is a global  market.  The United States is now the number one oil and gas producing  country in the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>PERRY:  By 2020 we will be a net oil exporter.  I mean it's just  fascinating what's happened in a decade.  It shows what innovation and  technology can do.</p><p>With all of that said, the world market is going to need this energy -- all  kinds of energy.  When you think about the European market, the American  LNG that's going in there now, the geopolitics of that, where no longer  does Poland or Romania have to -- or Germany for that matter be relying  upon Russian gas singularly.</p><p>So the world is really reliant now on American energy but we're also  obviously relying upon other countries.  You've got problems in Venezuela.   You've got problems in Angola.  The sanctions on Iran are out there.</p><p>So the market is -- it's critical that we keep the supply up and that's the  reason that infrastructure is so important in the United States oilfields.</p><p>The limiting factor in the Permian Basin, which is the third largest  oilfield in the world -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- is pipeline capacity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about that?  What do we need to do in terms of  infrastructure to build up this pipeline, that one and others?  </p><p>PERRY:  The President is really focused on this.  He understands that  you've got to get this to market and pipelines are one of the key issues  there.  And when you talk about infrastructure, it's not just pipelines.</p><p>When you think about midland Odessa out in West Texas, it's about hospitals  and schools and roads and being able to have places for people to live  literally.  That's all part of this infrastructure because this is a  generational change that's occurring in America and in turn affecting the  world.</p><p>So the President has basically said we're going to go try to build this  infrastructure as fast as we can.  That means FERC has got to be moving and  moving quickly.  That means that agencies that have regulatory control over  all of these different things, it may be the Corps of Engineers, it may be  the DOE.</p><p>All of those need to be on point, that as we build this infrastructure you  need your regulatory climate to be one that is very nimble and very  expeditious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>Before I get to your event-- the Iran sanctions, going into effect next  week or -- </p><p>PERRY:  Correct, in November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next week -- in November.  What's the impact on the oil market?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well obviously, we don't know completely.  I suggest that the  market's already been impacted by it, people knew they were coming in,  those contracts were already been forwarded by then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anticipated.  </p><p>PERRY:  Anticipated -- yes, ma'am.  So I don't think there will be much in  the market standpoint.  Hopefully it will send the appropriate message to  Iran.  Listen, be a decent neighbor in the neighborhood and you don't have  to face these kind of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.</p><p>Your event, you'll be touring the Brookhaven Lab on Long Island today.   Tell us about that.  Why is this facility important?  Why are you going  there?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well we have 17 national labs.  And these are the most fascinating  -- it's what makes my job as cool as it is -- Maria.  These national labs,  all across the country, you know, the Manhattan Project out at Los Alamos,  through Sandia through Pacific Northwest Lab -- I mean fascinating work  they produce.</p><p>Brookhaven -- things that you don't necessarily connect with Department of  Energy.  early work was done on Parkinson's disease at the Brookhaven Lab.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So these are medical labs?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, they're energy labs but we do a host of different things across  the -- I mean all of the nuclear weapons work is done at our national labs.   But they also -- we delve into things like into water.  I mean these are  where a lot of ideas get thrown out and tested in the federal government to  see, you know, what is the next big thing.</p><p>Something -- the first video game was developed at Brookhaven Lab out on  the end of Long Island.  So this is my 17th lab to go to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>PERRY:  This gets me -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this really -- this shows us the innovation of America,  right, what's really going on.  </p><p>PERRY:  And that's what national labs are really about, you know.  You've  got Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA over at DOD.  They do  like types of work but the national labs -- if there are a set of crown  jewels in America, I would suggest to you our national labs are them.</p><p>The men and women who work there are brilliant.  They're fascinating men  and women who across the board -- we're working on issues of traumatic  brain injury and post traumatic stress at our national labs as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that.  </p><p>PERRY:  It's fascinating work that's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we don't he know enough about the brain --  Alzheimer's and autism.</p><p>PERRY:  Correct.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is really important work.</p><p>Real quick before you go, obviously coming from Texas, your thoughts on  this migrant caravan?  I mean President Trump is maintaining this hard  stance with reports that indicate he is prepared to sign an executive  order, barring those illegal immigrants from entering the United States.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated that last night.   What do you see?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'll give you an interesting -- we've had these challenges  while I was the governor in the state of Texas.  I asked for -- I requested  800 federal troops to come to assist us along the border back with the  previous administration.</p><p>We finally have a president, who is willing to protect, defend the border  of the United States.  And as a Texan, as a former governor, I say thank  God.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Especially since you have a  whole long line of people that are doing it legally, that are waiting on  line to get in legally.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got this people trying to get to the front of the line.   So --</p><p>PERRY:  You've never had anybody send a message of listen, this border is  going to be sacrosanct.  If you want to come in the United States, you come  in legally -- you come in legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  And Donald Trump, the first president who's been able to stand up  and say, we're going to stop it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>PERRY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Secretary Rick Perry joining us.</p><p>Coming up, markets are under pressure once again this morning,  disappointing results from Amazon and Google setting the tone for markets.   We've got more on that coming up after this.  </p><p>And then my exclusive sit-down interview with Larry Ellison and Mark Hurd.   The two weigh in on Oracle's R&amp;D spending, cyber security and a lot more.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  S&amp;P 500 is down by better than one percent and the NASDAQ with  a 137 point selloff right now, good for a two percent selloff right at the  opening of trading this morning.  </p><p>We had weak results in the technology sector, that's putting pressure on  markets this morning because revenue was light.  Look at Amazon, down nine  percent.  Look at Alphabet, parent of Google, up -- down five percent.   Investors are watching out for that.  </p><p>And Amazon, after the technology giants released disappointing sales  numbers last night.  And it is digging through the tech sector this  morning.  Techs instruments of course, was down big this week as well.   Semi-conductors rolling over.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board with the FT-100  down one percent, the CAC Quarante down two percent and the DAX Index down  1-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, markets were down across the board.  </p><p>It is the busiest week of earnings season so far coming to a close this  morning.  Some big names still reporting earnings, Colgate Palmolive is  down better than one -- it is down in the premarket rather, after less than  Stellar earnings as well.  We were just watching the price of oil which is  down about one percent.  </p><p>Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Mark Hurd sitting down for  their first joined interview ever in a Fox Business exclusive.  The leaders  weighed in on their competition and why Oracle Cloud technology they say is  the best in the business.  CEO Mark Hurd revealing a huge bump in R&amp;D  spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  It was six, seven years ago, we spent $3.7 billion  in R&amp;D.  We'll spend over $6 billion in R&amp;D this year, so you get a context  of how much we've invested into these new cool products, all the stuff  we've got that's now available in the Cloud.  </p><p>The customers expect, they've got a lot of issues, I mean, they spent 25  years building up these extremely heterogeneous architectures.  Almost like  a Lego set as we talked a bit yesterday, very complicated.  Hard for a  customer to even know what they have in their inventory of applications and  tools and middleware, etcetera.  </p><p>So, this is a very hard environment to modernize, to upgrade, to secure, to  Larry's point.  And so, what you you can't -- one thing with our customers  is that they probably on average have hundreds of configurations.  And our  Cloud, we have one, one configuration.  </p><p>Well, it's scaled.  Much easier for us to upgrade, modernize and to secure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand.  I mean, and the reason I said unlimited spend, I  was speaking to some financial services executives the other day.  Jamie  Dimon told me that they will spend almost $1 billion on securing their  data, on cyber in the next year.  Which is -- that's what I'm saying.   These companies cannot afford to have any slip-ups.  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  Well, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To have any vulnerabilities.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, and first of all, I love Jamie Dimon.  I think he's the  world's preeminent banker (INAUDIBLE).  I probably made some enemies by  saying that.  He's an incredible guy, incredible executive.  </p><p>But if Google can't protect their network, if Facebook can't protect their  network, it's challenging for J.P.  Morgan -- you know Chase to protect  their network.  </p><p>This is not -- this is not a trivial exercise.  They can spend $1 billion.   We spend more than $1 billion securing our network.  So does Facebook.  So  does Google.  It's a hard problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who are the bad actors?  What do they want?  Do they want to  just -- what, they want anything, steal money?  What do they want?  And who  are the bad actors?  </p><p>ELLISON:  There are two -- there are two classes.  There are people who  want to steal a lot of credit cards and just make money.  And then there  are state actors who want to gain intelligence.  </p><p>The -- a government agency that -- basically the Ministry for Personnel in  the United States was hacked by a government actor who was able to get all  of the resumes for everyone in the White House, all of the -- all of the --  Office of Personnel Management it's called.  And the state actor took all  of that information with all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I remember that (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, all the government agencies and took it all and they were  able to analyze it.  And they -- for example, they did something very  clever.  They said these are the people who work for the government.  These  are all the people that work at this embassy and our capital city.  How  come there are some people that work on the -- in the embassy, in the  capital city that aren't in the list of government employees?  Maybe they  all work for CIA.  </p><p>We -- they were able to find out a lot of things about our intelligence  agencies by hacking into the office of Personnel Management and just  comparing data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>ELLISON:  So, it was an extraordinary setback for us and we have to do a  much better job of securing -- of securing data.  </p><p>There are plenty of -- you know, financial services firms, you read about  that don't secure their databases and you end up -- they end up above the  fold on the New York Times report and the CEO gets fired because they don't  patch their databases in a timely fashion.  </p><p>The only way you can handle that -- the only way you can handle that, is to  fully automate the database patching.  You have to fully automate threat  discovery and the second is discover, your robots.  Discover your robots  have to patch it.  Because if they have robot attacks on our Clouds and  robot attacks on our data centers and our government agencies, you better  have a robotic defenses or so, you know, cyber defenses that are Star Wars- ish.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, this is a moment in time where there's -- aren't many  things more important than this.  </p><p>HURD:  Well, this is at the CEO level now, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  So, I mean, this is not a conversation that people like just Larry  and I have.  I mean, this is a conversation that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  -- is at the CEO level.  The example that Larry just brought up,  there's a customer that actually bought encryption to their database.</p><p>ELLISON:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  And actually didn't implement it.  </p><p>So, to my knowledge, no customer -- nobody has ever de-encrypted an  encrypted Oracle database.  Less, you talked about unlimited spending.   Less than one percent and I'm sure I'm roughly right, of our databases are  encrypted.  Of the people that bought our encryption, half of actually not  implemented it.  </p><p>So, that -- and that's just one of the things we can do.  By the way, in  our Cloud, all of the customers' data is encrypted.  </p><p>ELLISON:  Yes, there's no option.  Right now -- historically, the customers  were they've given a choice, encryption, optional.  You can turn it on.   Some people thinks -- you know, think encryption slows performance a little  bit.  In our Cloud, we have no options, everything is encrypted.  It's  encrypted at rest, it's encrypted in transit.  </p><p>Inside of different customers, as I say, the big -- the hardest thing is to  know what you even have.  This one big customer who -- you know, had to go  to the CEO, found that they had patched some that they had a database  called Apache Struts.  And they -- there was a big security vulnerability.   And they patched about 80 percent of their Apache Struts databases.  They  couldn't even find all their databases.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the ones they didn't patch lost millions and millions of you  know, consumer financial records.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a lot of competitors at your -- at your heels.  We  know that.  So, let me ask you about that, Mark, because these markets are  nervous, another 600 point selloff today because people are worried about  growth.  Does this even become part of the conversation?  You cannot -- you  know, give up or give in on this kind of spend in terms of securing your  data.  </p><p>HURD:  First of all, in points to Larry's bringing it up, we're the only  one that has this capability.  So, when you look at the market depending on  which competitors you're talking about.  You know, we invest in technology.   I think the core of Oracle -- I mean, we have our founder's DNA in the  entire company which is to continue to innovate.  </p><p>And for us, when you talk about these things we just talked through,  patching, whether it's encryption, all of these now are inherent.  The  separation and segregation of data on the control plan from where the  customer's data is, these are all fundamentals of what we're bringing to  market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HURD:  And frankly we're highly differentiated in this area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any change in terms of the global outlook that  would warrant this kind of nervousness in terms of growth?  </p><p>HURD:  I told you what I thought yesterday.  I mean, I think the U.S.  economy is going fine.  And when we look particularly at mid-market and I  gave you the example of some of our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Net suite.  </p><p>HURD:  -- our net suite business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HURD:  Which has had an unbelievable run.  </p><p>Now, some of that is caused by things we've done, frankly, to add more  salespeople, to add more engineers.  But at the same time, our net suite  business grew over 70 percent in our fiscal Q4, grew over 40 percent in our  fiscal Q1 in bookings.  </p><p>I think that's indicative (INAUDIBLE).  Most of that growth was in the  United States.  And that's indicative of where we think the mid-market is  in the U.S. it's growing.  It's investing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures are under pressure this morning, markets are  selling off once again, disappointing results last night from Amazon and  Google parent Alphabet.  We've got more on those numbers and the outlooks  coming up.  </p><p>And then, a sweet surprise, one kindergarten class bringing their deaf  custodian to tears by signing happy birthday.  The amazing video, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are troubled this morning.  Take a look,  we're expecting a decline at the start of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial  average down 227 points, that's about one percent lower right now on the  Dow.  S&amp;P is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ with a decline of  147 points, that's better than two percent.  NASDAQ getting hit as  technology rolls over this morning on the heels of revenue misses within  tech.  </p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Russian President Vladimir Putin may soon be  headed to Washington.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting this news this  morning, Maria.  National security advisor John Bolton is now saying the  White House has extended an invite to Putin but no word on whether he's  accepted.  President Trump and Putin have only held one bilateral summit  that was in Helsinki, Finland, that was back in July.  Trump was criticized  after the summit, accused of failing to stand up to Putin regarding  election meddling.  Russia continues to deny that they interfered in the  2016 election.  </p><p>The two leaders will meet in November on the sidelines of events in Paris  commemorating the end of World War I.  </p><p>Well, Tobacco giant Altria trying to combat teen vaping.  The maker of,  yes, Marlboro cigarettes, has announced it's pulling its e-cig pods from  their store shelves.  They're also removing exotic flavors from the market.   This comes after the drug -- Food and Drug Administration -- excuse me,  called underage use of e-vaping products an epidemic.  Those flavors of  course, very popular with kids.  Altria stock is down 12 percent so far  this year.  </p><p>And then finally there is this, on a different note, a kindergarten class  in Tennessee gave a very special gift to a school teacher.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday dear James.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) He works at the school.  The Hickerson Elementary  Kindergarten class surprised their friend.  He's the custodian there known  as Mr. James, he is deaf and the kids had only sang happy birthday but as  you can see, they signed it as well.  And I don't know, Maria, I think he's  holding back tears in this video.  It's kind of hard to see.  But it was  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is beautiful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm crying.  </p><p>CASONE:  (INAUDIBLE) they just want a surprise for him you know, and how  sweet that all those kids learned it.  That's tough.  Sign language is  hard, right, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I taught myself sign language, a lot of it.  I still know  the Alphabet, the ASL Alphabet.  I taught myself out of the encyclopedia  Britannic when I was five.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That was so sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>All right, we want to get into the GDP when we come back.  </p><p>And then there's this, a search for the sender intensifies, authorities now  zeroing in on Florida after locating a tenth suspicious package sent to a  prominent Democrat.  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is here to weigh  in.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dualing rallies, President Trump is headed to North Carolina  this evening, his predecessor, President Obama is in Wisconsin around the  same time, this with what, 11 days to go before the midterm elections now.   I want to bring in RNC chairman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Ronna, it's good  to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good  to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how are you feeling 11 days out?  Tell us -- set the stage  for us for these midterm elections.  What's most important and what has  changed?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the most important thing obviously, is turning out your  vote, making sure that your base has energy to go out and actually vote.   And that's why the president is so instrumental as he's traveling from  state to state and having these huge epic rallies like the one he had in  Texas the other day, like the one he's going to have in North Carolina.  He  reminds voters not only go vote, talk to your family, sign up at Vote.GOP.   We need to get these candidates over the finish line so I can keep this  majority and keep this comeback going for the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the money has been an issue, right?  The last time we  spoke, we talked about a couple of very deep pocketed Democrats who were  putting a lot of money into the Dimms and these Congressional races, like  Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million to the Democrats.  Tom Steyer in  California $120 million.  How are the Republicans doing on the money end of  thing?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, well, the progressive Democrat billionaires are trying to  buy this election.  And so, we know what this congressional members would  do if they come to Washington.  They'll be withhold unto the special  interest.  But the RNC has raised record money.  We just passed $269  million raised.  We're putting it into the ground game in all these states.   We've been building it for two years.  </p><p>So, we've made 60 million voter contacts, that's more than we did in 2016.   And that's going to help really propel and drive out our vote as we're  knocking doors, making calls, using digital and mail to talk to voters and  we have something to say.  </p><p>We've done things in Washington, four million new jobs, 4.2 percent GDP.   Our country is on the rise.  What are Democrats going to say?  We've  obstructed and resisted at every turn?  They have nothing to run on except  stopping this comeback that the American people are feeling in their  pocketbooks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've denounced this hate and these packages, the hunt is  on this morning for whoever sent at least 10 suspicious packages to the  presidents' most vocal critics.  </p><p>The Feds turning their attention to Florida and New York this morning.   Very early this morning President Trump tweeted this.  Funny how lowly  rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the  current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th  and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Yet, when I criticize them they go wild and  scream it's just not presidential.  Your reaction?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the president has led the way on this when he has  said this is a time to unify.  He has condemned obviously these heinous  acts by these cowardly individuals.  And the Democrats did the exact  opposite.  They play the blame game.  They continue to divide.  You saw the  head of CNN make a ridiculous statement, blaming this on the president and  Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>Once again, the Democrats cannot unify with this president and that is why  we need more Republicans in Washington.  We need to reject the Democrat  playbook of resist, obstruct, divide, and the only way they rewrite the way  they do business in Washington is if they lose and then we will get unity  in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there was Philippe Reines on Tucker the other night.   He works -- obviously, he used to work with Hillary Clinton.  And he  basically said look, I'm very comfortable with Sarah Sanders getting kicked  out of a restaurant, very comfortable with Kirstjen Nielsen getting kicked  out of restaurants because they lie.  So, I mean, it's almost like they  continue to have this dog whistles.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes, it's shameful.  It's not good for our country.  And the  president has stepped up and led.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Ronna, it's good to see you.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ronna Romney McDaniel.  </p><p>Still ahead, markets are under pressure.  We've got a lot more ahead of the  GDP report out in 30 minutes, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   Happy Friday.  It is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the button right now, stocks are in sell-off mode once again.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to be down 220 points right out of  the gate.  That's one percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 down 31 points.  That's  better than one percent right now. </p><p>And the NASDAQ with a decline of 145 points right.  That's down better than  two percent right out of the gate.  It has everything to do with earnings.   We are awaiting the first look at the GDP for the third quarter.  The  expectation calls for growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent.  We are  going to bring you that number as soon as it hits the tape.  That's at 8:30  a.m. and we will have the smartest analysis in the morning right here once  the number hits.  We will bring that to you. </p><p>Global markets this morning under selling pressure once again.  The FT-100  down better than one percent.  The CAC Quarante down almost two percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a half percent right now.  Declines  across the board overnight in Asia.  As you can see worst performer Korea.   Technology earnings are in focus this morning.  That's because last night  Amazon and Snap among the names reporting and Amazon is down better than  eight percent because revenue missed expectations zeroing in on revenue  across technology this morning. </p><p>Snap shares are down almost 12 percent.  We're watching Google parent  Alphabet, the company's profit was up.  Sales were down.  Well, it was  slowing down lower than people expected and as a result the stock is down  five percent on Alphabet.  Plus, there's a bombshell report this morning  out of Google over sexual misconduct.  That's also playing into things  here.  So we'll have more on that coming up.  And then this, the caravan  crisis continues. </p><p>Hundreds more National Guard troops making their way toward the border  right now as President Trump calls on the group of illegal immigrants to  turn around.  That was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen  Nielsen last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  This  caravan cannot come to the United States.  They will not be allowed in.   They will not be allowed to stay.  If they come here illegally with no  legitimate reason to stay, they absolutely will be apprehended and remove  immediately. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll have the very latest developments this morning on that.   Stay with us on that.  All stories coming up this Friday morning.  And  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News  Contributor Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning. </p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Yes.  It does gets worst  and worst as we're watching this open.  But it's important to note that all  those sell-offs overseas we're in the wake of Amazon's report and Google's  report, and so forth.  I mean it was a tech problem in those markets as  well.  So, you know, the question is the GDP number going to make a  difference? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.  I mean the estimate is 3.3 percent growth.  I  don't know if there's a good outcome here, Dagen, because if we get a  strong number on GDP, that basically keeps the Federal Reserve's plan in  place to raise interest rates in December, and then another three times  next year, if their GDP is worse than expected, that perpetuates the story  that the economy is slowing. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And there's a story  in The Wall Street Journal today that trade and manufacturing numbers point  to slower fourth quarter growth.  Many forecasters expect the growth rate  to slip below three percent in the -- of the fourth quarter of the current  -- the quarter that we're currently in because the trade deficit and goods  has widened four months in a row. </p><p>That's a problem and then also you saw the durable goods report yesterday,  big increase in military aircraft orders, but excluding defense durable  goods orders fell, and so that's another thing to worry about was for the  month of -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think we also have to talk about some technical things.  You  mentioned the lack of companies in the market buying those stocks.  There's  also tax loss selling going on.  This also could be part of this because  mutual funds and hedge funds have a fiscal year-end of October 31, so there  could be some tax loss selling and as you said earlier companies are not  buying back those stock -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  And they're quiet periods.  They're not allowed to sort of --  there's a sort of, you know, there's this back vacancy there where they  have been in pretty powerful force a lot of these stocks -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of these plays into -- in addition to the fundamentals. </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  There's --  there's a (INAUDIBLE) going on in one another tax loss selling this  volatility gets more volatility and more losses and more pain.  One thing I  want to point we're talking about tech earnings and there are some short  falls there.  But overall growth in tech, Goodyear just reported this  morning in industrial space.  I've been negative on this space.  I just  want to point out. </p><p>They're citing -- they're lowering guidance and they're citing raw material  costs escalating.  They're blaming China.  They're blaming economic  uncertainty in Brazil.  There's a lot of things they're throwing out there,  but these are all other issues that are impacting these markets even if the  big tech companies are insulated somewhat from that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just one more statistic as we've been talking about the revenue  misses.  That's in the headlines of the Amazon numbers that sales  underwhelm Alphabet delivering slowing sales growth.  Here's a statistic,  43 percent of companies half of the S&amp;P has reported so far roughly half 43  percent of the companies have missed expectations, same period, second  quarter.  It was only 28 percent missing.  So it's a much larger percentage  for the current reporting period in terms of missing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  -- a lot of companies lower their guidance which of course is also a  problem for the market and for these shares. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why you've got tech tumbling this morning.  It is  about revenue.  It is about expectations of slowdown.  Global stocks  extending declines following disappointing third quarter earnings from  internet giants Amazon and Alphabet.  That puts a dent in the solid  earnings season for technology.  Both industry leaders beat on earnings,  but fell short on Wall Street revenue expectations as Dagen just mentioned.   Amazon also forecast the weakest profit growth in two years. </p><p>And let's not forget the cost side of this because amazon just raised  wages, $15 an hour.  That's going to take effect next week.  A number of  input cost have been going up.  Joining us right now on the phone EndPoint  Technologies Associates Founder and President, Roger Kay.  Roger, good to  have you on the program.  Thanks for weighing in here.  What do you think  is going on within technology? </p><p>ROGER KAY, FOUNDER, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES:  Yes.  Good morning,  Maria.  Well, so basically, we're on a -- the end of a 10-year boom market,  so it's not surprising to think they're slowing down.  The other thing is,  of course, there's just a lot of volatility after all.  It's up hundreds of  points yesterday.  It's going to open probably off, you know, at least 100  points this morning, and it's been doing that back-and-forth for quite a  while. </p><p>I think volatility scares away investors.  It invites speculators that also  like to play volatility.  But I think that ordinary people are spooked when  the market moves several percent a day -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentions -- you mentioned that the length of this bull  market, that's something that AlphaOne Capital Partners Founding Pattern  Dan Niles mentioned as well.  He summed it up this way. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain and during a bull market since World War  II.  But if you look at the big picture around growth, you got a lot of  concerns.  You got China starting to slow down, auto sales in China went  from being up 15 percent year-over-year in April to down 10 percent in the  most recent month. </p><p>That's a pretty big change.  We got concerns over Italy and Brexit in  Europe.  And in the U.S., interest rates are going up.  They're at the  highest levels in seven years.  What you see in general during this  earnings season with Boeing being a pretty big exception is that a lot of  companies are guiding much lower.  I'll give you an example.  Texas  Instruments reported last night and I think they're one of the best  indicators in terms of global health. </p><p>They do about 16 billion in revenues, a hundred billion in market cap.   They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology? </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are and this is exacerbated by the fact that  you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest company  in the world, Apple for example, that 89 percent inventory growth year- over-year in the June quarter that they reported.  Their revenues were up  17 percent.  What if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have  to barn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there you go, Roger.  And the iPhone's thousand dollars  for the iPhone X may not sell very well.  What do you think? </p><p>KAY:  Well, right.  So, you know, often in the technology industry  particularly when you're talking about goods as opposed to service in this  because after all part (INAUDIBLE) inventory of services.  But it certainly  there has been in the past channel stopping where the managers of a  company, you know, the main company are motivated to move product at the  end of the quarter.  They push it to distribution and then let the  distribution worry about working it off. </p><p>That's their problem next quarter.  But that of course comes home to roost  within a quarter and you realize that the, you know, the mother ship isn't  get anymore sales.  So I think, you know, that kind of -- it happens, you  know, in a badly management situation, you know, Tim Cook is not known for  bad management, so it's unusual that they had stop inventory at purpose.   But it's possible that normal inventories well went in and that the sales  were slowing at the far end of the feds while there was inventory still. </p><p>But that's indicative of I think across the board this question (INAUDIBLE)  of growth that we come through this long period of growth and everybody has  been just climbing and climbing and then that's your -- that speak under  reported section there was saying there's just a lot of different sources  headwind including rising interest rates.  I think -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- people, you know, they sell first and think alter, Michael. </p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  You know, Roger, we're here looking at this sea of red this  morning maybe lost in the clouds here is Intel which, you know, having a  rough quarter last time around with their core business, and didn't quite  do what they wanted to do in the data room so to speak.  Yet, yesterday,  really came in better than that lower bar and their core business actually  pretty good and they were talking pretty confidentially about the move down  in (INAUDIBLE) what do you think of that, you know, are there bright spots  here?  You know, is everything really -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KAY:  Yes.  What's interesting is I mean the Intel is off a little bit in  premarket, but now as much as the others.  So, you know, if you look at a  handful of big name stocks, you'll see that most of the tech stocks are off  in the two percent range some as high as four percent in premarket.  But  Intel is only a slight decline and I think that reflects the positive  attitude that Intel may have been getting back together with respect to the  process in technology. </p><p>So it's interesting that the (INAUDIBLE) the other side of the shop, you  know, the non-Intel part of the Silicon industry.  It's already basically  talking about (INAUDIBLE) but what's interesting is if you look a  transistor density rather than the sort of (INAUDIBLE) which is what the  (INAUDIBLE) it turns out that Intel's pen is kind of similar to (INAUDIBLE)  and so that actually that puts Intel not as far behind as people had  thought they were. </p><p>So if they pull it together on their 10, they're kind of in the game  against (INAUDIBLE) and that's good news for them, so I think people  interpreting that and conversely they're interpreting the AMD side of that  that's both negative. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>PEEK:  So Roger, what could turn this group around?  What could get the  tech stocks going again? </p><p>KAY:  You know, finding another planet to colonize.  There's got to be some  way to get more growth out of this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Citing more growth?  Yes, sure. </p><p>BLOCK:  Isn't Elon Musk doing that? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) is boring into one.  Roger, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  Thanks for calling in, sir.  Roger Kay  joining us there.  Coming up, the search for a sender is intensifying this  morning.  Authorities are now zeroing in on Florida after locating a 10th  suspicious package.  The very latest on that investigation next.  And then  Saudi Arabia changing its story again about what happened to journalist  Jamal Khashoggi inside its Istanbul interment - embassy.  Khashoggi's son  has arrived in the United States.  He was barred from leaving Saudi for a  while.  Details there next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are lower this morning.  Take a look at  the sell-off going on right now.  Dow Industrials down almost one percent,  221 points lower.  The S&amp;P 500 down 32 points, better than one percent  lower and the NASDAQ is down two percent.  That's 146 points lower.  This  perpetuating view that things are slowing down last night because Amazon  and Google disappointed on revenue.  Meanwhile, there's this, the son of  the murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, his son has now  arrived in the United States.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl? </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria.  This  is the eldest son that is now in the United States with his family.  He  previously had been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because of his father's  criticism of the Saudi government.  Well, the State Department says that  U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow Khashoggi's son to leave  that country.  Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again now  saying the killing was premeditated. </p><p>Saudi officials say that Turkey's evidence shows the murder was planned  contradicting their earlier claim that rouge officials killed Khashoggi by  mistake during a fist fight.  Well, after an intense nationwide manhunt  under -- is underway after 10 pipe bomb packages were sent to prominent  Democrats.  Some new details for you it.  Federal investigators has  searched a mail facility in South Florida.  That happened last night.   Several of the packages actually went through that facility. </p><p>Investigators also focusing on New York City after one of the bombs was  sent to actor Robert De Niro.  Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting, funny  how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for  the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September  11th and the Oklahoma City bombings, yet when I criticize them they go wild  and scream, it's not just presidential.  </p><p>Well, corporate travel trends are changing and so are companies expense  reports, shocker.  Lyft made the top 10 list of the most frequently  expensed business cost in the U.S. for the first time.  This was during the  third quarter, certified track all stuff.  They're a traveling expense  software company.  Lyft was number six on the list with Uber in the top  spot.  Amazon coming in third, interesting.  Both Uber and Amazon had been  moving up the ranks over the last three years. </p><p>And then speaking at people getting paid, Sofia Vergara extending her reign  as queen of television.  The Modern Family actress topping Forbes list of  highest paid T.V. actresses for the seventh year in a row whopping 42.5  million was her take.  That's only twice the 24-1/2 million that Big Bang  Theory actress Kaley Cuoco made.  Coming in third place, Grace Anatomy's  Ellen Pompeo with 23-1/2 million rounding out the top five, Law &amp; Order's  Mariska Hargitay, and then Sofia Vergara's Modern Family co-star, Maria,  Julie Bowen which has got lots of money and she's married to a tall drink  of water -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  Wow.  Lucky to be her. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, caravan crisis, hundreds more  National Guard troops are making their way toward the border right now.   President Trump is calling on the group of illegal immigrants to turn  around.  He says they're not coming in the country.  The very latest there.   Then we are waiting the first read on third quarter GDP.  We have the  number.  The expert analysis as soon as it crosses 3.3 percent growth is  the estimate.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Caravan crisis, President Trump is demanding the  thousands of Central American migrants headed to the United States make a  U-turn.  The warning coming as the administration deploys hundreds of  troops to the southern border.  Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs and member of the House Judiciary Committee.  Congressman, it's  good to see you.  Thank you for being here.  Arizona, obviously, a border  state. </p><p>You recent tweeted that you support sending the troops to the border.   Assess the situation for us.  Tell us what it looks like today and what can  be done. </p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, it's pretty bleak in some respects  because the drug cartels control the border putting more military in the  border actually gives a show of force even though they're not going to be  en0gaged in normal typical military issues.  But we're looking at a convoy  of people that are going to try to overturn the border for the purpose of  the organizers who are (INAUDIBLE) they want to -- they don't want to board  -- they don't want a border between Mexico and the U.S. </p><p>And so it's pretty rough right down there on the border right now. </p><p>PEEK:  Quick - congressman, question.  What can the military actually do?   You hear different reports on this whether they can actually engage with  these marchers or how ever -- this caravan, what role can they play really?  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, they're going to be a supportive role and what that means  they'll be able to help track people who are coming across the borders to  free up the border patrol agents to actually interdict the people.  They  all need to be -- they should be armed so they can protect themselves  because you got the cartels all armed.  You know, they've got the watchers  and so they are going to be supportive I think and I think that will be a  benefit.  But we got so much more to do on the border than just this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the president -- are you going to  vote for Kevin McCarthy's bill and the president's border wall? </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, you knowledge what, I actually introduced my own bill which I  think is a bill if that's the -- if that's the only bill that comes out --  if it's Kevin's bill, I'll vote for Kevin's bill.  I think mine is better - - </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- bill differ from that bill? </p><p>BIGGS:  My bill actually provides funding sources off general funds to pay  for that bill.  It also restores money to the border patrol agents that  were had their pay reduced under the Obama administration and provides  equipment for the men and women of the border patrol. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let me switch gears and ask you about the fallout from the  Kavanaugh confirmation, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is  referring Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick for possible  criminal prosecution over these allegations of making false statements to  Congress, your reaction, sir. </p><p>BIGGS:  Long overdue.  I'm glad to see that Chairman Grassley is out there  doing that because I think Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick, they really tried  to throw gas on to a fire that was already there for whatever purposes, and  it looks like they made false statements and then they should held -- be  held accountable for that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks very much. </p><p>BIGGS:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Andy Biggs joining us there.  We want to take a  short break and then we are just moments away from getting the first look  at the third quarter GDP.  We are going to bring you those numbers as soon  as it hits the tape.  That is at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  That is in four  minutes from now, 3.3 percent growth is what's expected for the first read  on the third quarter GDP, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th, your  top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast, we are a  minute way away from third quarter GDP number.  The expectation calls for  growth of 3.3 percent.  This will be the first reading of growth for the  third quarter.  It comes after the second quarter generated growth of 4.2  percent. </p><p>Ahead of the release, markets are selling-off again this morning.  A  negative tone for stocks, Dow Industrials expected to be down 200 points  almost one percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is down better than one percent and the  NASDAQ down better than two percent right now all because of disappointing  earnings reports.  You had revenue misses.  Google parent company Alphabet  and Amazon -- a sell-off this -- with Amazon down better than eight  percent.  Alphabet down five percent. </p><p>The worry here guidance is weaker than expected and revenue is coming in  weaker than expected within tech.  In Europe, similar story, down across  the board in European indices today.  The FT 100 down better than one  percent.  The CAC quarante in Paris down one and three-quarters percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a third percent.  Asian markets  overnight in the red across the board.  We are waiting on the first look of  third quarter GDP this morning. </p><p>We are in the middle of earnings season.  For the GDP, the expectation  calls for 3.3 percent growth and we are expecting earnings to be up 21  percent for the quarter year-over-year.  Joining us right now is Jon  Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor.  And Jon,  we're going to get the number momentarily.  We know that your often focused  on the consumer.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what consumer is showing within this GDP number, the expect  -- 3.5 percent is the number, Jon.  3.5 percent is better than expected.   We were expecting 3.3 percent, and we are watching markets for any  reaction.  Your expectations and your reaction to a 3.5 percent number,  Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, that's a strong number.  What I want -- what I want to  do is break this down a little bit and see where it comes from.  I think  trade was probably a drag for the quarter.  I think we also have to look  very carefully in addition to the consumer at government.  There's been a - - as we've reported today in The Wall Street Journal, there's been a big  pickup in military spending, government spending is contributing a lot to  growth right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Consumer spending is up four -- consumer spending is doing well  within this, up four percent?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Correct, four percent in the third quarter.  The strongest rate  of growth in almost four years on the consumer side.</p><p>BLOCK:  Street was looking for up 3.3 on that as well, so that's a big  beat.</p><p>PEEK:  That's big.  That's a big beat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And that -- I mean, that makes sense.  You've got an  unemployment rate that's down under four percent, lowest levels since the  1960s.  And you also have tax cuts that are making their way through the  system, so we should be seeing strong consumer spending right now.  We also  have to look at what's going on on the business investment side, you know,  for this growth to be sustainable in the long run, we need to see more  business investment, and I want to see how that breaks down as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investment by companies was weak, Jon, non-residential, fixed- investment, spending on commercial construction equipment, intellectual  property products like software rose only eight-tenths of one percent in  the third quarter.  That was after rising in an 8.7 percent rate in the  second quarter and 11-1/2 in the first.</p><p>BLOCK:  Inflation is also light here, core PCE came in up 1.6 percent  quarter over quarter, street was looking for up 1.8, so there's not some  runaway inflation story here.  It looks like consumption is strong.  As  Dagen points out, investment weak -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets improving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  One more thing, private inventories which is something  that Liz was talking about, private inventories added more than two  percentage points to the third-quarter growth rate, reversing that trend  that you saw in the second quarter when companies were drawing down their  stockpiles ahead of the tariffs.</p><p>PEEK:  That has been sort of an offset on going quarter-to-quarter with the  trade -- the widening trade deficit.  It seems to me that consumer news  here is very important, because the fourth quarter is all about holiday  sales, all about consumer spending, the fact that that's held up and  actually beat by such a wide margin, I think teases up for less pessimism  if you want to look at it that way about the fourth quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And interesting, there's no revisions on the second quarter,  Jon.  The second quarter was really strong at 4.2 percent, that is not  being revised downward, so that stays in place with the better-than- expected initial or advanced reading, the first reading for the third  quarter at 3-1/2 percent, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, so I'd say a few things here based on these breakdowns  that you've given me.  One is let's go back and talk about that inflation  number, the market has been very concerned and the President has been very  concerned about the Fed continuing to raise interest rates going into next  year.  You know, the inflation numbers have come in kind of soft over the  last couple of months, and I think the Fed is going to have to start paying  attention to that and factor in that into how far they want to go on  interest rate increases.</p><p>On the inventory piece that you talked about, that's a volatile number, it  doesn't fundamentally have much to do with economic growth in the long run.   So, the fact that it added a lot to growth in third quarter I think becomes  a potential drag on growth in the second quarter.  A lot of the estimates  that we get at The Wall Street Journal for fourth quarter is that it's  going to slow down a little bit on overall growth, and it's going to slow  down -- growth is going to slow down going into 2019, that inventory piece  plays into that.</p><p>PEEK:  It seems to me it's almost a percent number for people who are Fed  watchers, though, right?  Because it isn't really high enough to spur alarm  at the Fed, any kind of acceleration, or you know, incremental rate hikes  next year neither is it low enough to kind of take them off their paths.   So, it seems to me that's sort of a neutral. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Although, I will add looking at this report, higher borrowing  costs have hurt housing and auto sales.</p><p>PEEK:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Spending on motor vehicles and parts added just 0.09 percentage  points, so third quarter growth, and in terms of residential-fixed  investment fell at a four percent annual rate in the third quarter.  So, is  --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know, residential has been -- residential has been a  really big drag for several quarters now, and that's continuing.  It's a  little puzzling because there's under supply in the housing market, but  builders (INAUDIBLE) building because labor is short, and land supply is  short, and costs are going up, so, you know, we should be seeing more  building and we're just not getting it right now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Jon, there is -- during the summer, there was a plentiful  amount of inventory coming on the market in many housing markets that were  already weak.  There are a lot of pockets of weakness in housing in this  country that are overlooked because we tend to focus on the metropolitan  areas.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, and supply, actually, has been going up in some of these  metrics.  I think I saw a 7.1 month supply in one of the -- one of the  metrics this week on existing home sales.  The only thing I'll point out  is, even in the Fed minutes, it was pointed out that higher rates might be  crimping residential investments to your point, Jon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I also think that it's, you know, understandable that the  third quarter rate of business investment was weak.  And this is actually  the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2016, spending on structures down,  7.9 percent.  You would expect companies to pull back in terms of spending  with the uncertainties of tariffs, with the uncertainties of the demand  picture on the horizon, because there is all of this worry, this narrative  that things slow down a bit.  So, I'm not surprised that the level of  investment spending is weak in this report, Jon, particularly after we've  seen animal spirits these last two years, spending has been up.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, there are three things going on in the business  investment side we have -- we have to look at.  One is you mentioned  structure is down, structures has been very strong because there's been a  lot of investment going on in oil and gas rates as oil prices came up.   They've stabilized so maybe that spurred a growth that we've gotten that's  also stabilized.  </p><p>The other thing you just mentioned, you know, with tariffs coming on, a lot  of companies are talking about slowing their investment plans because  they're just so uncertain about what the trade landscape is going to look  like.  And then the third piece is tax cuts.  You know, the Trump  administration, Republicans in Congress cut taxes, corporate tax rates very  aggressively to try to spur business investment.  But it looks like this  tariff uncertainty is taking away some of the boom that they were hoping to  get on the business investment side. </p><p>You know, again, if these growth rates are going to be sustainable, it's  going to have to show up in business investment, and I'd say, the soft  number there has got to be a little disappointing today.</p><p>PEEK:  I would say politically, too, that's a problem, because Democrats  have really made the case that the tax cuts for corporations are really  just going into stock buybacks, they're not going to have any impact on  workers, and we need investment to get productivity up, so that wages will  go up, so I do think it's a disappointing number.  And probably is a result  of the uncertainty.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, Jon, the other day, you know, we're starting to hear some  noises about the yield curve, there were some comments a few weeks ago  saying, well, it's kind of a relief.  It was even in the minutes as well  that with rates backing up and along the curve may be there's not so much  risk of inversion.  We see what the 10-year is doing now.  Look, my call  was actually -- we're going to see the 10-year back below three.  You can  write that down, I'm saying it right now.  Are we going to get the Fed more  concerned now about the possibility of inversion and what that can mean?   Do they care about that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's point out this op-ed in The Journal today written by  Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari titled \"Pause Interest  Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow.\"  Kashkari writes, \"With the Fed  funds rate at two to 2-1/4 percent, monetary policy is now close to  neutral, neither stimulating nor restricting the economy.  Prematurely  tapping the brakes could restrain wage growth and keep many Americans from  participating in the economic recovery.\"  You expect the 10-year to go back  down below three percent.  Is it partly because you think that they are  going to see a pause in the rate hikes?</p><p>BLOCK:  I think we're going to see a slowdown and I think we are going to  see that happen.  And, you know, look, I'm going to say it right now, I  think next year, I think two hikes max.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two hikes max.</p><p>BLOCK:  That's where I am right now.  I've been there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're at three hikes for next year, Jon, isn't that right?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  And it all comes down to the inflation numbers.  The --  you know, you're talking about the yield curve and long-term interest  rates, and I think long-term interest rates are a signal of how concerned  the long-term investors are in the outlook for inflation.  And if the  inflation numbers come -- continue to come in in soft, and it sounds like  they were soft in this number, then I think the Fed has going to have to  think about maybe slowing down the pace of rate increases.  You know, I  just wanted to ask you all, we've talked about a lot of different  components if this, if anyone has the government spending numbers, I'd love  to know what they are, because they -- military spending is a really big  impact on growth right now, there's a lot -- there's a lot of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, here it is.  We got it, Jon.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Government expenditures were up at 3.3 percent annual rate, and  the third-quarter defense spending rising in an annual rate of 4.6 percent,  Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  Yes, that's a big driver, and that one is going to  continue.  So, the two things I think we have driving economic growth right  now are consumers and government, ironically.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, the last time we didn't mention explicitly here is that  exports were down 3.5 percent in Q3 and imports rose at 9.1 percent.  It  just plays into this whole rising deficit thing.  Look, I don't think the  bottom market cares but it's part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we -- but we would know that watching these trade deficit  numbers coming in, in the third quarter, Jon, that the trade deficit has  widened throughout the third quarter.  Again, there were some pull forward  in the second quarter where you had, say, soybeans exporters really pushing  inventory overseas ahead of those tariffs between the United States and  China that went into place over the summer, so, again, that reversed course  and showed up in this GDP figure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's exactly right, Dagen, you have to look at what happened  with trade in the second and third quarter combined, there was a lot of  anticipatory reaction in the second quarter, particularly in agricultural  goods, and that looks like it reversed.  But, you know, with the tariffs  that we have going on, we have to think about trade being a potential drag  for the economy -- for the global economy in the months ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what we were -- we're also expecting companies  to start pulling back as we have seen in this report, because of the  uncertainty of it.  You know, what will the impact of these tariffs be in  this quarter and into 2019?  That's one reason that you --</p><p>PEEK:  That's a little ironic, right?  I mean, basically, under Obama, the  uncertainty all had to do with regulation and changes that the business  community faced day-to-day, now it is so unfortunate that we have that  deregulatory cloud sort of lifting, but in its place, we have uncertainty  about the tariff policies. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, we switched -- we switched from one form of government  swappiness to another.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That it's government intervention in business, where if you use  steel in this country, you have to go to the Commerce Department hat in  hand and beg for waivers.</p><p>PEEK:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There have been thousands of waivers.</p><p>BLOCK:  And there is a huge backlog at the Commerce Department right now  for these applications for waivers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, there is a lot of red tape on the trade front. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, Jon, we leave it there.  Great to see you this  morning, Jon, thanks so much.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Great.  Thanks a lot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis, as always, from Jon Hilsenrath from The Wall  Street Journal.  Once again, the GDP is out, this is the first reading of  the third quarter, it came in better-than-expected, up 3.5 percent versus  an estimate of 3.3 percent.</p><p>Coming up next, Microsoft on track to pass Amazon in market cap after  earnings.  We will tell you where that market cap stands.  We break down  the latest numbers right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We told you the breaking news earlier.  The GDP  out moments ago.  The economy grew at a -- at a rate of 3-1/2 percent in  the third quarter.  This is the first take on the third quarter.  GDP is  better than the expectation which calls for 3.3 percent.  </p><p>Futures came off of their lows, then, went back down again.  We're still  looking at a decline at the start of trading, although, we are off of the  lows.  Dow Industrials down 160 points, NASDAQ down 116.  </p><p>\"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney weighs in.  And Stu, what I think is  really a good takeaway is the fact that the consumer part of this report -- </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- consumer spending up four percent, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the -- what is it?  Consumption, that's the proper  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. </p><p>VARNEY:  Consumption of, what, four percent.  Now, that's a big number.   That is a very bright spot in this report.  You know, Maria, I was the  party pooper about the Mega Million jackpot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you are.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, I'm not -- I thought I might be the party pooper over GDP  because I was really hoping for a four percent number as growth in that  quarter.  OK, so, we got 3-1/2 percent.  I still think that's pretty good.   I'm a little disappointed because I was looking for four and more, because  that's what we've been promised if we get the tax cut.  But, look, I'll  take 3.5 percent, especially coming on the back of a 4.2 percent growth  rate in the second quarter.  That's the best back-to-back quarter  performance that we've seen in four years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  So, the trend is still very strong and if we keep this up, we're  going to have a much better than three percent gain for the full calendar  year, 2018.  I'll take it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'll take it.  And let's not forget that the second  quarter that you just mentioned, 4.3 percent, no revision there, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right?  So, we still got the 4.2 percent in the second quarter  and now, 3-1/2 percent for the third quarter.  I know you're going to dig  deep into these numbers in about 10 minutes.  We will see you top of the  hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  You got it, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Stu.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour, 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his  great team there.  </p><p>First, though, Microsoft makes a move, the technology giant now on track to  pass Amazon's market cap.  We've got those numbers.  Microsoft's shares  today down two percent, Amazon down eight percent.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have breaking news right now.  An 11th  suspicious package has been found.  This one from an Opa-locka, Florida  facility.  The FBI is confirming that this package was addressed to New  Jersey Senator, Cory Booker.  This is an 11th package coming out of the  Florida facility and we are following that and other things this morning.   We'll bring you the latest there.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we want to look at market, we've got technology earnings have  been leading this market sell-off, disappointing revenue numbers last night  from a number of high-profile companies.  </p><p>Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now  with those details.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   So, we're off of the lows of the morning on that better-than-expected GDP  number.  But we're looking at Amazon which had that revenue miss and the  guidance on revenue, obviously, less than expected.  So, some concerns  potentially about the holiday season, that's one thing, but the other  areas, such as cloud and advertising units continue to grow, have been the  area of growth.  And you've had a mixed bag, some analysts actually raising  their target, some pulling back, and some that are raising still like the  long-term growth story on Amazon.  And those FANG stocks are up 37 percent  annually over the last -- since 2014. </p><p>By the way, as Amazon pulls back, we might see Microsoft move higher in  that closer to the trillion-dollar market.  Remember when Apple crossed it,  didn't close there, but Microsoft now may be getting closer, may surpass  Amazon today with Amazon sell-offs.  So, we'll watch for the market cap  battle.</p><p>And then, there's Alphabet, Google.  The one area that people were  concerned about is people are looking to Amazon to search for products  instead of Google.  So, we've seen, obviously, they've had surging profit  with the slower sales growth.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  And of course, it's been  an incredibly volatile and busy week for stocks.  We had a really busy week  on this program as well.  Take a look at some of the top moments with the  program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) business with the Pentagon.  Amazon wants it, too,  but Google walks away from the business with the DOD, and yet, they are  all-in on going into China.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  I hear Jeff  Bezos and I absolutely agree.  I think U.S. tech companies who say we will  not -- we will not support the U.S. military.  You know, we will not -- we  will not work on any technology that helps our military.  But yet, goes  into China and facilitates the Chinese government, surveilling their  people, is pretty shocking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Larry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, the Oracle of Oracle.  What a pleasure.  Nice to  see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tony Stark, I -- did you influence that character?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've heard that.  I didn't know Stanley is (INAUDIBLE)  so I guess -- I guess Tony Stark was invented before (INAUDIBLE) so, I  guess no.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Part of why the President  would like to continue cut tax with the middle class is because it has gone  so well.  He sees the fruits of that tax cut and jobs act which passed last  December without a single Democratic vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This can't possibly happen before the midterms.  The midterms  are 13 days away and this has to be voted on and Congress is -- the House  is not even in session.</p><p>CONWAY:  Well, Washington moves a little bit too slowly for the sheer  volume and velocity of the Trump agenda.</p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Obviously, it was so important to  get tax reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually  very sad, and I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISOR TO THE CLINTONS:  I've seen the biggest buildup  and turnout to a midterm election that we've ever seen, which classically  has fairly low turnout.  And I think we've seen the blue wave become a blue  edge, now, I think fairly it's a blue tossup.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC  COMMUNICATIONS:   President Trump has been talking to the -- to Saudi Arabia, to the King, as  well as to the Crown Prince.  There's a continual dialogue there.  Our eyes  are wide-open when it comes to what we've seen to be this horrific tragedy.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  If he's found  to have his fingers on this in any way, I think he is likely to be removed  by his -- by his father.</p><p>LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  This is in complete violation of  human rights.  We cannot continue to allow this to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The migrant caravan from Honduras has swelled to at least 7,000  people now as it makes its way north.</p><p>KEANE:  We've got to protect our borders, and we have got to protect our  sovereignty.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  We're seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how  chaotic and really anarchistic the border situation has become.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Violence and intimidation now on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Individual through a  great big boulder through -- entered the office and another person entered  as well, and they stole equipment.  The one thing about America we believe  in civil discourse.  I mean, you could -- you could agree -- disagree with  someone and not be disagreeable, but then now it's in your face.</p><p>WEST:  We should not be politicizing political terrorism or violence such  as this.  And I would say to those people that are seeking to do so, you  know, this is a crazy unhinged individual, this is not acceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks, your view.</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  We've had five months to  digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian news is already priced into the  market.  The market has shown us over the summer that it's capable of  handling the current situation.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  I  didn't win the Mega Millions this morning, so here I am joining you from  (INAUDIBLE) from New York.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I haven't checked my numbers yet,  but since I didn't buy a ticket, I'm probably not going to win, that's my  guess.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hi, welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.   Liz Peek?</p><p>PEEK:  Well, I don't think that the GDP report did much for the markets,  but let's -- if the market doesn't completely tank today, I think we're  going to be in a rebuilding phase next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still a good number, 3-1/2 percent growth --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  Yes, it definitely was.  And teas up the fourth quarter pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes, personal consumption was good, investment is challenged, trade  is challenged.  Let's see what happens after midterms.  And longer-term,  I'm going to be -- I'm going to stay optimistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's unusual.  And I will be, too.  So, we have about  half of the S&amp;P 500 is still yet to report, so let's hope for better  revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  See the glass half full.  There you go.   Seize the day, everybody.  Have a great weekend, Dagen McDowell, Michael  Block, and Liz Peek, good to see you.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.

Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff says televised public hearings will begin Wednesday.</p><p>The testimony will mark a new phase in the inquiry, as Democrats try to prove the president abused to his power by withholding military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden. CNN's Phil Mattingly has more now on what to expect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: When you look at the big picture of what we're going to see next week, Democrats are going to attempt to paint a picture of a U.S. foreign policy that was essentially operated through rogue channels, outside the traditional way foreign policy is run, with a heavy emphasis on Rudolph Giuliani, the personal attorney for the president and an acknowledgment that, based on what they are seeing, they believe they already have enough evidence for an impeachable offense.</p><p>You're also going to see Republicans make very clear some of the defenses we have seen over the last couple of days, that they don't believe any of the witnesses, no matter how damning their testimony, have a direct link to President Trump.</p><p>There will be a lot of that as we look forward, but bigger than anything else, Wolf, this is spilling into the public sphere, which means, more than anything, while impeachment is obviously part of what Congress has in its set of duties, it is also very much a public sentiment type of exercise.</p><p>You talk to Republicans and Democrats, they acknowledge that fact, the public hearings a real opportunity to start to sway public opinion, which has largely broken down on partisan lines, into their favor as they move forward in this process.</p><p>And also worth noting, the public hearings making clear this is moving forward and it's moving forward quickly. After those public hearings, likely a full report. Then it gets kicked over the Judiciary Committee. Those articles of impeachment will come and then a House vote before it moves to the Senate. Very clear Democrats are moving forward and moving forward fast.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: CNN's Phil Mattingly reporting there.</p><p>The first witness to testify in public will be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor. We have a preview of what he'll say on Wednesday. CNN's Alex Marquardt has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): It's among the most explosive testimonies yet in the impeachment inquiry. Now the transcript of the deposition of Ambassador Bill Taylor, the most senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, gives a damning on-the-ground perspective.</p><p>[02:05:00]</p><p>MARQUARDT (voice-over): Taylor told lawmakers it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until Ukrainian President Zelensky committed to pursue the investigation, meaning into the Bidens and the 2016 election.</p><p>Taylor added, \"It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Rudy Giuliani.\" It was also Giuliani, according to Taylor, who came up with the idea of demanding that President Zelensky publicly declare he would investigate the Ukrainian company Burisma that Joe Biden's son Hunter had been on the board of.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I think you will see in the transcript what a dedicated public servant Ambassador Taylor is, someone who graduated from West Point, someone who served in Vietnam, someone who is, I think, performing another vital service for the country in relating the facts that came to his attention.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Taylor testified that he was told about a meeting on September 1 between the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland and a top aide to President Zelensky, in which Sondland told the aide: \"The security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation. Everything was dependent on such an announcement.\"</p><p>Days prior, Taylor had written a rare so-called first-person cable to his boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, \"describing the folly I saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government.\"</p><p>Taylor was embarrassed he couldn't tell the Ukrainians why the aid was being held up and he prepared to resign. Despite these concerns, Taylor admitted he had never talked to the president.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Taylor's testimony is full of references to what Giuliani activists said the Ukrainian officials listen to him because they knew that he was working at the president's direction.</p><p>We've also learned that Giuliani has hired himself a team of lawyers tweeting up the names of three of them to the any clearly feeling the heat at this inquiry ramps up -- Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: Mr. Trump isn't saying much about the growing list of witnesses who accused him of a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He has called some of them \"never Trumpers\" but he is being more focused on demanding that the original whistleblower's identity be revealed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The whistleblower, before they knew I was going to release, he came out with a whistleblower. You know, like he's some wonderful person. Take a look at the whistleblower. But the whistleblower came out with this horrible statement about this call. So I really had no choice. I said immediately, talk about transparency. I said release it. Release it immediately.</p><p>And then the whistleblower saw it and Shifty Schiff saw it, is a total crook, Schiff saw it, Pelosi saw it and they said, we got a problem. We don't want to have anything to do with the whistleblower anymore. And the whistleblower disappeared.</p><p>You know who else disappeared?</p><p>The second whistleblower.</p><p>And you know who else disappeared?</p><p>The informer to the whistleblower, if there was such a person, which I doubt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Donald Trump reportedly wanted the U.S. attorney general William Barr to hold a news conference, declaring the president did not break any laws in his phone calls with Ukraine's leader. That is according to \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post.\"</p><p>Barr declined the request. President Trump calls these stories \"fake news\" and the U.S. Justice Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment.</p><p>So let's talk more about all of this with Linda Feldmann. She is the Washington bureau chief for \"The Christian Science Monitor.\"</p><p>Thanks for joining us.</p><p>LINDA FELDMANN, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR\": Hi, my pleasure.</p><p>CHURCH: So the publicly released testimony of top U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor confirms not only the existence of a quid pro quo of military aid for Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into the president's political rival but also the second quid pro quo involving a meeting at the White House for Ukraine's president.</p><p>Is this the most significant of all testimony so far and where does this take the impeachment inquiry do you think?</p><p>FELDMANN: I think it is the most significant not only because of what Bill Taylor is saying but also because of who he is. He is a career diplomat highly respected, was the acting U.S. ambassador in Ukraine. Has no political connections to the president and therefore he brings a lot of credibility to the table.</p><p>CHURCH: And Taylor's testimony like others puts the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, once again right at the center of the Ukraine quid pro quo. What might that reveal about Trump's role in all of this do you think?</p><p>FELDMANN: Well, that's an interesting question because by having it all go through Rudy Giuliani it insulates Donald Trump just a little bit. It doesn't prove that Donald Trump wasn't behind all of this but it doesn't go directly to the president.</p><p>But given that Donald Trump has said and told people go to -- go to Rudy on this, one can assume but you know, it's just sort of part of this whole larger scene of a shadow foreign policy run by the president's professional lawyer which completely bypasses the formal foreign policy structures of Washington. And it made a lot of people nervous here and it's not illegal.</p><p>I mean, this sounds kind of devious undoubtedly but in fact, the president has a lot of leeway in how he conducts foreign policy and even if it doesn't look good, it's that in of itself isn't illegal.</p><p>CHURCH: Right. And Democrats announced Wednesday they planned to hold public impeachment hearings next Wednesday and Taylor will be the first to testify signaling the significance of all of this.</p><p>[02:10:00]</p><p>CHURCH: Of course, his testimony has already undermined the president's assertion of no quid pro quo existing.</p><p>So how will Taylor play out in this public appearance? And you've mentioned his standing --</p><p>FELDMANN: Exactly.</p><p>CHURCH: -- in -- as a diplomat. So talk to us about how this is going to look and why it's so valuable to the Democrats.</p><p>FELDMANN: Well, this is, we are now moving into the public phase of all of this. We've have all the -- we've gone through a lot of fact- finding, all these depositions behind closed doors which allowed the Republicans to claim a lack of due process and that there was something secret and devious about what the Democrats were doing, even though there are, of course, Republicans in the room for these closed doors depositions.</p><p>Now it's all out in the open and we can all watch this and we get into the big spin war. We'll have the Democrats and the Republicans duking it out trying to spin their own narratives. Of course, the Republicans will be trying to poke holes in what Taylor is saying.</p><p>They'll say, for example, that he wasn't on that infamous telephone call between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25th. So they are trying to poke holes in his credibility. But I think allowing Americans to see it for themselves, look him in the eye and see who do they believe, I think that will be actually very powerful for the Democrats.</p><p>CHURCH: Right. And the Republican senator and staunch Trump supporter Lindsey Graham vowed Tuesday he would not read any of the publicly released transcripts. Then Wednesday he said this. Let's just bring up his words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): What I can tell you about the Trump policy toward the Ukraine it was incoherent. It depends on who you talk to. They seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo, so, no. I find the whole process to be a sham and I'm not going to legitimize it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: It's certainly a unique difference, isn't it? Essentially saying the trump administration still do this organized to being able to form a quid pro quo. Will anyone buy that defense?</p><p>FELDMANN: So that's an interesting argument because that's what -- that's kind of what I was saying about the whole conspiracy theories around the Mueller investigations that they couldn't possibly have been colluding with the Russians because they weren't organized enough.</p><p>In the case of Ukraine, it's actually quite simple the president asking the Ukrainian president to do something in exchange for something else. It's not some big giant complicated conspiracy.</p><p>So I -- my message to Lindsey Graham is, nice try but I'm not sure people are really buying that.</p><p>CHURCH: All right. Linda Feldmann, thank you for joining us. We do appreciate it.</p><p>FELDMANN: Sure. Happy to be here.</p><p>CHURCH: Well, in the coming hours, funerals are to be held for the nine victims of a brutal massacre in Mexico. Three women and six children, all members of the same Mormon family, were killed in the what appears to be an ambush. Some relatives believe the victims were deliberately targeted by a drug cartel.</p><p>But Mexican officials say they were caught in a crossfire of a turf war.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENERAL HOMERO MENDOZA, MEXICAN NATIONAL DEFENSE (through translator): As a result of that ongoing confrontation in the border area, between the two states, they decided to send a unit and we assume this unit which was sent to prevent the entrance of any criminal gain of the salazar towards (ph) Chihuahua, who are the ones being blamed for carrying out this attack towards the LeBaron and Langford families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: An aide survive the hundreds of bullets that rained down on them and we're learning new details about the horrific aftermath of that attack. Brian Todd has our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Security forces descend on the grisly scene where three women and six children were murdered. A manhunt is under way tonight for the killers suspected to be affiliated with organized crime and Mexico's top officials are promising they'll solve this. One suspect was arrested then ruled out and relatives of the victims are frustrated.</p><p>OMAR LEBARON, VICTIMS' RELATIVE: There needs to be justice here.</p><p>TODD: Tonight, dramatic accounts from the extended family of the victims of how some of the surviving children carried wounded children to safety and how one of the mothers, Donna Ray Langford, saved the babies in her car before she died in a hail of bullets.</p><p>LAFE LANGFORD, VICTIMS' RELATIVE: She turned around and yelled at all her children to duck down immediately and they started grabbing the babies and putting them under the dash and trying to hide them and all of a sudden bullets just reigned from above. She had saved her baby by pulling it off the seat and tucking it down on the floor and she covered her baby up with a blanket. And how her nursing infant stayed there for eight -- nine hours or something is a miracle.</p><p>TODD: A U.S. official tells CNN some of the evidence may indicate that those members of an extended family of a fundamentalist Mormon group were deliberately targeted.</p><p>[02:15:00]</p><p>TODD (voice-over): The official points to the burning of evidence at the scene and accounts that the gunfire continued even after women and children got out of the cars.</p><p>MALCOLM BEITH, AUTHOR, \"THE LAST NARCO\": The message that is clearly received is no one is -- no one is safe really.</p><p>TODD: Analysts say the LeBaron family has a history of tension with local drug cartels.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WILSON, MEXICO INSTITUTE, THE WOODROW WILSON CENTER: Actually about a decade ago formed a group called SOS Chihuahua, an activist organization trying to draw government attention and pressure the government to do more to fight criminal organizations in the region and they had received some pushback from the cartels.</p><p>TODD: Pushback like the murders of two LeBaron family members who had led protests against the cartels after a relative was kidnapped. Still, one relative says the only thing those mothers were activists for was their children.</p><p>Tonight, a stunning admission by Mexico's president that the family and other law abiding residents of that region of northern Mexico were left vulnerable by their own government.</p><p>ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR, PRESIDENT OF MEXICO (through translator): Not enough policemen. Completely abandoned. Everything related to public safety. We are working on that.</p><p>TODD: Experts say the outmanned, outgunned Mexican Security Forces are up against a maelstrom of violence and chaos in that northern region of northern Mexico, a brutal war between drug gangs some of which are splinters of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was run by now imprisoned kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. BEITH: And you have newer groups, some of them formerly related to those cartels, who are trying to establish their own dominance through violence usually, through hyperviolence. So this family was basically caught off in the middle of that.</p><p>TODD: Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has ordered the formation of a new commission to investigate the murders, a commission consisting of Mexico's foreign minister and top military officials. The police are not even mentioned as being part of that commission.</p><p>Analysts say there's still a lack of complete trust in Mexico's national police and especially in local police forces since they have been corrupted by those cartels for decades -- Brian Todd, CNN, Washington</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: We'll take a short break here, still to come, Turkey says one of the wives of late ISIS leader Abu Baker al-Baghdadi has been captured. We will look at how this could help forces find other members of the terror group.</p><p>Plus CNN obtains exclusive new video of key U.S. allies secretly funneling U.S. made weapons into Yemen.

He told us that she had moved into the town about six months ago. She was posing as a refugee. The family came into the town with fake documents. They tried to blend into the local population. They're concerned there could be many more who are trying to do the same, former ISIS members, the family members of ISIS members.

This footage filmed surreptitiously that CNN was able to obtain and verify shows U.S. weaponry arriving in the southern Yemeni port of Aden.</p><p>This is not illegal. This Saudi delivery is not illegal. What it is, it is incredibly controversial, you can see that in the way that this delivery came about. The ship delivering this weaponry did not have its tracking device on, in spite of that being the norm under international maritime regulations.</p><p>And it was only through CNN's work of looking through port documents and speaking to whistleblowers that we were able to ascertain they left the port of Jeddah and arrived in Yemen on October 29th.</p><p>This latest delivery will come as a blow for U.S. lawmakers, who have been trying for months to stem that tide of heavy U.S. weaponry to the chaos in Yemen. If I had not been for President Trump's multiple vetoes, they would have succeeded so far.</p><p>And our understanding is that lawmakers are, after this recent report, seeking answers from the Trump administration.

And the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor will be first to testify. Transcripts of his previous testimonies show repeated demands from the Trump administration for Ukraine to open political investigations in exchange for military aid.</p><p>And the White House is getting ready for those hearings by beefing up its legal staff, adding two new advisors. And President Trump isn't missing an opportunity to call the process, a scam. CNN's Kaitlan Collins has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): We will begin our open hearings in the impeachment inquiry next week.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: With a date set for the first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry, the White House is bracing itself.</p><p>SCHIFF: We will be beginning with the testimony of Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Kent on Wednesday.</p><p>COLLINS: All three witnesses on the schedule have already testified behind closed doors. But now, Democrats will be making their case for impeaching President Trump in public. Sources tell CNN, White House officials appear the most concerned about Bill Taylor, the Top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who told lawmakers there was an explicit quid pro quo, according to a transcript released today. The President has tried to dismiss Taylor's word before.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's a Never Trumper and his lawyers are Never Trumper.</p><p>COLLINS: But there's no proof of that. Some say it will be difficult to discredit the West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran who is still on the job, though some allies are trying.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Now, who in the heck can follow that? Someone told someone that I told someone that someone else knew about this in a different meeting.</p><p>COLLINS: The President's allies are also seeking to discredit his ambassador to the European Union, a Republican donor turned diplomat who gave a million dollars to Trump's inauguration. Gordon Sondland revised his testimony to reveal a September conversation where he told a top Ukrainian aide, \"The resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement.\" Instead, the President and his allies are now relying on special envoy, Kurt Volker, who told lawmakers, he \"didn't know there was a quid pro quo.\"</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA): Sondland, in his statement, not even sure why he has the opinion he has, and Volker was completely read in on everything that everybody was doing.</p><p>COLLINS: The White House believes the release of the transcripts is good for them.</p><p>STEPHANIE GRISHAM, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: So, these transcripts are actually, they're good for the President.</p><p>COLLINS: Now, CNN has also learned that the White House has added two new staffers to its ranks, as they are fighting House Democrats over this impeachment battle. Tony Sayegh is a former senior advisor to the Treasury Secretary who left the administration a few months ago; and Pam Bondi is the former Attorney General for Florida.</p><p>Both are expected to come on in a temporary capacity to help with the messaging and strategy. Two things that Republicans on Capitol Hill say the White House really needs to bolster as they are getting ready to go up against these House Democrats in public hearings.

It will be their third general election in four years. But this time is different. The voting comes after more than three years of Brexit deadlock. CNN's Bianca Nobilo explains how the major parties hope to shift the balance of power in Parliament.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, Britain is heading back to the polls on December the 12th for the third time in four years. They will vote in a general election and one thing will dominate.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN: To get Brexit done -- and there is only one way to get Brexit done --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop the deal because it's not Brexit.</p><p>JEREMY CORBYN, LEADER, U.K. LABOUR PARTY: Labour will get Brexit sorted within six months.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Catastrophic cliff edge of a no deal Brexit.</p><p>NOBILO: Britain was supposed to leave the E.U. in March and April and again, in October, but it's in the midst of another extension, and political parties are hoping a majority will unlock the parliamentary paralysis. Here's why.</p><p>[02:35:06]</p><p>There are 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom from Orkney and Shetland in the north to St. Ives in the south. To get a majority in Parliament, you need 326 seats. And that is where the problem has been for Theresa May and Boris Johnson since 2017, neither have had a majority on their own, meaning getting anything done was a problem.</p><p>Theresa May relied on the support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party, while Boris Johnson had even less the majority after taking the whip of M.P.s who rebelled over Brexit.</p><p>Here is where the big parties stand, Boris Johnson's Conservative Party have a simple message, get Brexit done. They were the biggest party in 2017. But we'll be hoping for a clear majority this time, to push the Prime Minister's Brexit deal through. In 2017, Labour did unexpectedly well, but they still ended up the minority party. Their Brexit policy is less clear cut than others, they now support a second referendum. And they're trying to thread the needle with their support base, some of whom are remainders and others who are leavers.</p><p>The Scottish National Party currently has 35 seats, but that could rise because of Boris Johnson's relative on popularity, and Scotland's votes remain in 2016. And that is precisely what the SNP will campaign for, remain and Scottish independence. The Liberal Democrats had a tumultuous political decade, they were coalition partners from 2010 to 2015. And that decimated their political support. Now, they're standing on a clear platform of remaining in the E.U., and they're polling in double digits.</p><p>Now, one party, not even in Parliament, but who could play a huge role in the election is the Brexit party. It didn't exist in 2017, but they won the most votes in May's European elections. Led by Nigel Farage, their Brexit policy is clear. They went out and they want a clean break from Europe. Britain is going through one of the most volatile political moments in its history. And the last few votes have shown that elections are just that. In short, no one knows how Parliament will look on December the 30th.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: Bianca Nobilo with that.

I tried my best, but sometimes I could not.</p><p>FLORES: These images of his children captured by his wife nearly broke him. Yusuf, emotionless, Zahra, pretending to eat.</p><p>Did they have enough to eat?</p><p>B. SHIKDER: No, they were making soup with grasses. No fruits, no food, nothing is there.</p><p>FLORES: And then, there were the sounds of war. So frightening that Yusuf packed his toys.</p><p>B. SHIKDER: He's telling his mom that my daddy is coming to pick me up.</p><p>FLORES: He wanted to come back to Miami?</p><p>B. SHIKDER: Yes.</p><p>FLORES: His wife asked for money for the children.</p><p>RASHIDA SUMAIYA, WIFE OF BASHIRUL SHIKDER WHO JOINED ISIS: Send a very good amount, like at least 3,000.</p><p>B. SHIKDER: I really wanted, but in the same time, I didn't want to ruin anything that I will disrespect the law, so.</p><p>FLORES: Under U.S. law, wiring cash could equate to funding a terrorist organization. Under ISIS law, Shikder's punishment was spelled out in this document.</p><p>B. SHIKDER: The court is nullifying our marriage because I live in America.</p><p>FLORES: And just when he thought the situation couldn't get worse ...</p><p>B. SHIKDER: So many days past that no contact, no inputs.</p><p>FLORES: His wife was killed in an airstrike, the children suffered burns to their faces and were in the care of ISIS.

There, a boy said he saw Yusuf, but he was too late.</p><p>Shikder, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Bangladesh was confident U.S. commandos would save his children. Then, U.S. forces began exiting Syria, leaving his American children behind.</p><p>Do you feel let down by the U.S. government?</p><p>B. SHIKDER: Yes.</p><p>FLORES: Let down, but not defeated.

According to a court documents filed on Wednesday, more than 1,500 additional children and parents were separated from each other from July 2015 to June 2018.</p><p>A court forced the U.S. government to comb through the records to get an accurate count about 2,700 families who are known to have been separated under President Trump's controversial zero-tolerance immigration policy when it went into effect.

Let's go to our meteorologist Derek Van Dam, who's been keeping a very close eye on all of this. Are there any improvements being gauged at this point?</p><p>DEREK VAN DAM, CNN INTERNATIONAL WEATHER ANCHOR: You know, unfortunately, we thought there would be today, but that is just not the case because we've seen some of the images coming out of New Delhi, and it is equally as bad as it's been all week, if not worse.</p><p>In fact, we continually try to think of new ways to talk about this story. It seems like a broken record but it comes another day, another day of bad pollution in New Delhi and across northern sections of India.</p><p>This picture though was striking, at least, to me. Worshipers in northern India placed masks on some other deities to protect them from pollution. So, that just shows you incredible amount of -- you know, protection that they have. Even towards their religious figures, they are trying to protect them from the pollution that is taking place there.</p><p>And if you just look at the progression of the pollution over the past several days, how it's backed up across the Himalayan mountains, it really just has not improved. In fact, New Delhi at the moment with an air quality index of 308, that is in the purple category hazardous for people with -- let's say, asthma, for instance -- young children, the elderly, very difficult conditions.</p><p>We've been talking about how the smog from some of the winter burning takes place across northern India, it backs up onto the Himalayas, and it starts to pollute these cities. We talk about Lucknow and into the Patna region. There's New Delhi, all AQI index above 300 which is the hazardous category.</p><p>And you can see from Copernicus, the forecast from the smog not improving today across northeast India even though, we have an approaching tropical cyclone, which I'll show you in just one moment.</p><p>We have 18 or 17 of the world's most polluted cities across northern India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan with the other three of the world's top polluted cities across parts of Africa and into China.</p><p>Here's the Tropical Cyclone Matmo, this is across the Bay of Bengal. So, approaching India, unfortunately, this isn't going to do much to help circulate the air. The pollution index will continue across northeast India regardless of an approaching tropical storm.

That massive hit to the Vision Fund led Softbank to report its first quarterly loss in more than a decade, according to Reuters.</p><p>Softbank bailed out WeWork last month with a rescue package that included a big payout for controversial founder Adam Newman.

Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we're going to bring you the debate behind tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>First up, President Trump standing tough. Canceling a meeting with Russian  President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit, citing the Ukraine conflict.  And separate from that, the president says he does think China wants to  make a trade deal. </p><p>Blake Burman is live at the G20 in Buenos Aires. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Liz. President Trump  steps the land here in Buenos Aires, Argentina within the next two to three  hours. After that it's a couple days' worth of meeting with a handful of  world leaders culminating Saturday evening a dinner sit-down with the  Chinese President Xi Jinping to talk about several topics none more  important than trade.</p><p>The president, though, when he left the White House to come to Argentina  earlier this morning cast some doubt though, on whether or not there would  be a breakthrough as it relates to a possible trade deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think we are very close to doing something with China. But I  don't know that it wants to do it. Because what we have right now is  billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form  of tariffs or taxes. So, I really don't know.</p><p>But I will tell you that I think China wants to make a deal. I'm open to  making a deal. But frankly, I like the deal we have right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The president will not be meeting with Vladimir Putin. President  Trump canceled that meeting via Twitter on board Air Force One after being  briefed by his Chief of Staff, John Kelly, the Secretary of State, Mike  Pompeo, and his National Security Advisor, John Bolton about Russia's  recent aggressive action against Ukraine in the waters of Crimea. </p><p>The State Department today defending that decision. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT PALLADINO, DEPUTY SPOKESMAN, STATE DEPARTMENT:  What's clear is, the  president's tweets on the subject were quite clear what we looked for. And  that is the return of the Ukrainian sailors and the vessels. </p><p>The aggression that we witnessed this week is unacceptable, and a strong  message has been sent. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  A spokesperson for the Kremlin said that they were not made aware  of the president's tweet, the president's decision before he signed off on  that tweet. Saying in a statement earlier today, quote, \"If this is so, the  president will have a couple, speaking of Putin, a couple of additional  hours on the program for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\"  Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Blake. And Rudy Giuliani and President  Trump's lawyers are now slamming the decision to file charges against  Michael Cohen during this G20 trip. </p><p>Let's get to the border. President Trump declaring, quote, \"a very possible  government shutdown if we don't get the wall money.\" </p><p>This, as the U.S. officials saying no criminal charges have been filed  against the 42 migrants who were arrested for illegally crossing the border  during that caravan protest that ended in tear gas. He says the press  reports charges were not filed because the accused had things like medical  problems or issues with having children alongside them. Or they are  accompanying.</p><p>And there is an issue on whether or not they were actually deported. We are  staying to getting the facts of that story. </p><p>Let's bring in Republican Texas Congressman Michael Burgess. Great to see  you, sir.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS, (R) TEXAS:  Thanks for having me on, Liz. I  appreciate it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What is the holdup in Congress over getting money for the  border wall? </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, the deadline is the 7th of December. There was a continuing  resolution passed at the end of September that gave us until December. It  is possible that there will be required another very short-term extension.  But I believe that an agreement can be reached and I believe the president  needs to get the money for the wall that he's asked. </p><p>We all saw last weekend the images of people coming to the fence, literally  coming through the fence. The fence is not secure. The infrastructure needs  to exist to secure the border and the president is exactly correct. And he  needs to get the money to do the job. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, our border authority says a border wall would help them  back them up in their efforts at the border. You make an important point.  Now the president -- this is a story that's coming fast next week. He is  saying he will shut down the government. Do you think a deal can get done  here, sir? </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, the actual -- the actual mechanics of a government shutdown  would come from the lapse of appropriations if an agreement can't be  reached on the 7th or if there is indeed a short-term extension of whatever  point after that. </p><p>So, it's not actually an action by the White House that shuts the  government down. It would be failure to reach an agreement an appropriation  lapse that occurs in homeland security. </p><p>Do bear in mind that a number of the appropriations bills did pass by  September. So, unlike in 2013 when a similar situation existed, the United  States military has been funded. </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Right.</p><p>BURGESS:  The Department of Health and Human Services had been funded. So,  there are significant funding bills that have already passed. Homeland  security is one of the ones that remains, it needs to be done. The  president needs to get his money. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Sir, it will be a partial shutdown. I hear what you are  saying. So, what do you in -- what dollar figure do you have in your mind  that you think is the correct number? </p><p>BURGESS:  Well, the president has said he needs $25 billion to build the  wall and that this year a $5 billion installment is what is required. I  believe that is correct. And that is -- that's what the Congress should  provide the president. I think that the votes are there on the House side  to get that done. </p><p>The difficulty is always on the Senate side with a 60-vote, a 60-vote  margin that's required. This is one of those times that I believe that the  Senate majority leader should forgo the 60-vote rule and just simply pass  the bill with 51 votes. This is too important. It needs to protect--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Can he do that? Can he-- </p><p>BURGESS:  Yes. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Under on what grounds?</p><p>BURGESS:  Well, it happened before and in fact, it happened of course with  the Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch. Where they suspended the 60-vote rule of  this. That obviously we challenge on that. But he sustained some of the  simple majority. </p><p>So, there would also be the possibility of doing another quick  reconciliation bill that would only require 51 votes to pass. So, there are  avenues to get this done. It is unconscionable that the Senate leader on  the Democratic side would shut down the government because he doesn't want  to defend our southern border. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Congressman Burgess, thank you so much. We'll have you back on  again soon, sir. </p><p>BURGESS:  Great.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you.</p><p>BURGESS:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks again.</p><p>Bill and Hillary Clinton on their 13-city speaking tour. Now in -- they  were in Montreal. Bill Clinton saying America should be more like Canada  when it comes to the border security there. </p><p>To National Diversity Coalition for Trump, Madison Gesiotto. Madison, great  to see you.</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, MEMBER, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  Good to  be with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Madison, Bill Clinton he likes Canada's system for  immigration. Doesn't Canada have a merit-based immigration system which  Trump says the U.S. should do? It sounds like he may be agreeing with him  on that front. </p><p>GESIOTTO:  Yes, Canada does have a partially merit-based system. But the  one thing to note about Canada is that I think the majority are close to 50  percent of their immigrants that come in don't come on the merit-based  system. They come in other pathways. So, their pathways are still open in  Canada and a lot of immigrants have come through that way.</p><p>But when it comes to merit-based, the president has been pushing that. He  thinks it's a great, of great option and will be a wonderful policy for our  country. And I think it very much mirrors and goes back to what President  John F. Kennedy said in his 1961 address which we all have heard so many  times. Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for  your country. </p><p>And I think that's what the heart of this policy really is, and why the  president has been pushing for that. What can these immigrants do to  produce the United States of America to make our country better. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Democrats in 2013 were for what President Trump is  now saying, right? It was Chuck Schumer who signed off on it. Dozens of  other Democrats. Obama supported merit-based systems, so did Joe Biden.</p><p>You know, Madison, it's pretty striking for Bill Clinton to say what he's  saying now about Canada, you know, having a good system. Because Clinton  was the one who signed in 1996 the toughest immigration reform bill that is  still with us today. It essentially invented the immigration enforcement  and increased deportations, right? </p><p>GESIOTTO:  Well, I think over the years it's been bipartisan in terms of  support for securing our borders and to making sure that we improve our  immigration system but the problem was no one ever came to an agreement on  what to get done. </p><p>Now President Trump is in office and people hate for this president, really  has, you know, overcome their desire to get things done for the American  people and to make our system better. They know. They know that it's  broken. They know we need to get things done. But they really would prefer  to go against and obstruct the agenda of President Trump, then they want to  accomplish this. </p><p>And so, I think a lot of them are backtracking and really flipflopping on  this issue. And as you know, it's not just 2013, it's not just the 1990's.  There's been many cases over the past 20 or 30 years where a lot of these  Democrats still in Congress today have supported man of the things  President Trump and his administration are talking about now. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Madison, you are an astute observer of what's going on in  the media and how the media covers things. Tell us what happened over the  last five years. Because all of a sudden, you know, the media and their  coverage, critics are saying there is kind of a 180 in perspective on what  is needed to do border security. This was as of five years ago. There was  very tough, tough coverage. And now, all of a sudden, it's open borders.  That's how it feels. </p><p>GESIOTTO:  Yes. I mean, and I think when we look at the media coverage of  this issue specifically, it's actually quite appalling. Journalism is so  very important. Making sure that we have people out there being fair and  covering the facts are so important. And it's not happening. </p><p>People are letting their personal biases come into their stories. And  they're not reporting the facts. So, people out there that are watching the  mainstream media or reading articles online aren't getting the information  that they are here to receive and that's very disappointing. And I hope  that we can turn things around. Because I want fair coverage even if it's  not always what I want to hear. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Madison Gesiotto, you're great. Thank you so much for  joining us. We really appreciate it.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to a market check of your money. The Dow closing  slightly lower today. But the blue chip index is on pace for it best week  since the 2016 election. </p><p>To prices at the pump. The national average for regular gas is $2.51 a  gallon. That is down 50 days straight. That's money in your pocket. And 21  states now have gas stations selling gas for less than $2 a gallon and that  trend is growing. </p><p>In other headlines. New information about that murderous Boston mobster  Whitey Bulger. Bulger reportedly wrote to a friend that he hoped to die  peacefully in his sleep. Those letters sent right before he was brutally  murdered in prison. </p><p>Manhattan U.S. attorney announcing a new distribution of more than $695  million to the victims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. It is the third  payout, it will be sent to 27,000 victims worldwide. Bernie Madoff  sentenced to 150 years in prison.</p><p>Now in honor of the 50th anniversary -- anniversary of the Beatles white  album the hash tag Beatles songs for millennial's on fire today trending  worldwide on Twitter. Look at this. Tweeters including millennials are  rewriting the titles of famous Beatles songs, it's all about poking fun at  millennials.</p><p>Look these titles. Strawberry field. Whatever. I get by with a little help  from my parents while my iPhone gently tweets. It's pretty funny stuff. </p><p>And look at this cute video. A 6-year-old boy upstages Pope Francis during  the post weekly speech. The young boy ran on stage, he shook the hand of a  security guard along the way. He got a lot of laughs at the pope. The pope  let the child continue to play around them. And that was totally cute.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump still going after General Motors. The president  saying, he is just trying to protect American jobs. We got the mayor of one  Ohio town at the center of this fight. He is now fearing economic disaster  right before Christmas, but we've got breaking details on something we were  first in telling you could be coming. Possible tax race to keep those G.M.  jobs.</p><p>We're going to be right back. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. President Trump again slamming General Motors on  twitter saying quote. \"G.M. is very counter to what other auto and other  companies are doing big steel opening plants all over the country, auto  companies pouring into the U.S., including BMW.\" </p><p>Let's bring in by phone the mayor of one of the towns where G.M. is  planning to cut jobs. He is the mayor of Lordstown, Ohio. He's Mayor Arno  Hill. Mayor, how serious is this for your town? We want to hear about the  human pain behind the story. Can you tell us what's going on?</p><p>MAYOR ARNO HILL, LORDSTOWN, OHIO:  I will tell you. You know, we just had  our third layoff in the last two years. Two years ago, we were running  three shifts. Lost the third shift, lost the second shift, lost the third  shift, lost by the town of (Inaudible) we lost over 3,000 jobs. </p><p>You know, the biggest thing is, you know people who have lost jobs whose  benefits are starting to run out. I'm sure the people from the third lay  off their benefits have run out. The second lay off I believe theirs would  be running out by the end of the year. And by the people at the first  shift, you know, they may be able to ride it out and settle on employment  for a while. </p><p>But, you know, the village has taken a pretty good hit. And we're doing  what we can. You know, we've been adjusting every time there is a layoff,  so it would be OK. You know, the village would be OK for a while. But the  small business as every business, which came in they figured it had seven  people there's been a ripple effect is what we're looking at. </p><p>And I know a lot of those restaurants, stores, gas station, all of  businesses, you know, they are the ones who are feeling it already.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Mayor, what's your take on how the president has been  reacting to the story?</p><p>HILL:  I think the president is trying to get General Motors' attention.  You know, the General Motors they get bailed out many years ago, and you  know, he ran on those, in fact, today, in Northeast Ohio, we're going to  bring the jobs back. You know, the Northeast Ohio part of the state were  the first one to go down. And to downturn, the last one to come up. He did  campaign. He did turn (Inaudible) where we're at grab during the last  presidential election.</p><p>And you know, right now, only then I could say I'm glad that they said they  weren't permanently shuttering the plant. it's just that they are going to  see its production and I think that we still have a pulse in our heartbeat. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mayor, we're hearing the president may try to get tax breaks to  keep those G.M. jobs including jobs from going overseas. That's what Ohio  Senator Sherrod Brown is saying. We're also hearing about how Ford says it  figured how to keep jobs by rearranging shifts at factories in Kentucky and  Michigan. What's your take on the possible tax breaks and what's your take  on what Ford is doing.</p><p>HILL:  As far as the possible tax break -- you know, I talked to Sherrod  Brown. I talk to governor and lieutenant governor-elect Mike DeWine.  They've all talked, they said, you know, we have to know what G.M. wants  what G.M. needs to remain competitive. My phone has been ringing off the  hook. I do believe that long-term I feel we'll get the product.</p><p>As far as what General Motors is doing and God, General Motors is  reshuffling some of their laid off plant workers to other plants that all  the (Inaudible) will do (Inaudible) whether it be in Spring Hill, Tennessee  or Arlington, Texas. You know, if there's an opening I'm sure that several  people may move on. I appreciate that. I'm sure that if we get another  product a lot of those people will want to come back home.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, you're saying that hopefully G.M. will put an SUV or truck  manufacturing capabilities in the factory in Lordstown. Is that a  possibility?</p><p>HILL:  I'm hoping that the crossover and SUV, a truck, a hybrid, an  autonomous vehicle--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Can they do that. Can G.M. do that? Forgive me for  interrupting. Can G.M. recalibrate their factories to do that? </p><p>HILL:  The factory was set up for a smaller car. But I do know when they  came on the 90's they had to posture the plant in case there was something  and they would have to change the product. They had told me they could do  that. Now, you know, they did it, they got a new paint plant, probably  around 12 years ago. Someone says the paint plant may not be able to assist  them on the bigger product.</p><p>I know they can make adjustments. You know, I heard rumors that they may be  bringing the (Inaudible) in Korea. They have the same architectural base on  the (Inaudible) and the Chevy truck and that would be a good fit for our  plant. But I'm holding out that we're going to get a product.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Mayor Arno Hill of Lordstown, Ohio, I think you made  some news there tonight, sir. Thank you so much for coming on. We will be  staying on this story, sir. Your honor, we appreciate you coming on the  show. Thank you so much.</p><p>HILL:  Thank you very much. I appreciate the invite.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Next up, we've got new show premiering on Fox Business  tomorrow night. WSJ at-large, hosted by Jerry Baker. Here's a sneak peek  with former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. He is a big Democrat. He  says President Trump is right about China. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE SUMMERS, FORMER SECRETARY, U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT:  We, in the  United States need to be very clear we were entitled and we are right to  reject Chinese cheating in. Chinese violations as a rule. Rules that don't  cover unfair practices. We're right when we're against that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The full interview will air tomorrow night on WSJ at Large with  Jerry Baker at 9.30 p.m. Eastern Time right here on the Fox Business  Network.</p><p>Coming up, remember when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg told Congress earlier  this year that Facebook does not sell your data? Well, not so fast. We're  going to detail for you Zuckerberg's fastball there because Facebook was  all about selling access to your data. That slow drip of bad news continues  out of the U.K. The U.K. now scouring through Facebook's internal documents  that it seized last week. We've got that for you.</p><p>And later in the show. A shocker life expectancy for Americans falling at a  rate not seen in 100 years, that's back when there was World War I and the  flu pandemic. Dr. Marc Siegel joins us on that and how President Trump is  fighting to help rural America where this health crisis is at its worst.</p><p>We're going to be right back. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it's another day another round of shady dealings by big  tech. </p><p>You're watching the Fox Business Network. You won't believe these stories.</p><p>A New York labor union slamming Amazon for, quote, \"dehumanizing and deadly  work practices.\" Internal documents seized by Great Britain shows Facebook  is that profiting by selling companies access to your data including free  access to the dating site Tinder. </p><p>We got Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey under fire. A House committee examines  whether Jack Dorsey gave misleading testimony about twitter taking care of  violent posts. Also, Twitter censored a U.S. marine for apparently no  reason. </p><p>We've got Google CEO Sundar Pichai, he's set to testify at a congressional  hearing next week. Google faces multibillion-dollar fines in Europe for  tracking where you are even after you turn off your location on Google.  It's a lot of stuff. </p><p>Let's bring in attorney Harmeet Dhillon. She is fighting the battle against  social media censorship of conservatives. It's like tech is losing their  minds, Harmeet. What's going on here? </p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN, RNC:  Well, you know, Liz, we've  heard these types of stories actually for a couple of years now. But what's  amazing to me, is that we haven't seen more action against these big tech  companies from Washington, where even those conservatives have been  discriminated against clients like my client James Damore have been fired  from Google for voicing conservative views. </p><p>We haven't used the last two years of conservative dominance in Washington  to actually open up investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, the  Department of Justice, or Congress passing some regulations that would  reign in these massive abuses of civil rights and privacy rights on the  part of Americans.</p><p>We do see that happen in Europe. However, some of the stories that you just  mentioned are emanating out of Europe where they have much more concern for  privacy rights of citizens there. I would like to see more of that in  America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, we've got big tech lobbyists all over Washington, D.C.Harmeet, I like your response to Republican Texas Congressman Louie  Gohmert. Here is his fix for the problem with big tech. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  They ought to be subject to lawsuits and I  think some billion dollar class actions here and there would probably  change their conduct pretty dramatically.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow! Is that the fix? That Louie Gohmert last night, Harmeet,  because under the law, you know, the social media is exempt from lawsuits  because they supposedly offer truly diverse political discourse. What's  your answer to that?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, number one, I think that the Congress which Representative  Gohmert sits on has had two years to do something about it. They need to  redefine and perhaps pair back the Communications Decency Act Section 230.  That would be one.</p><p>But another is that a lot of these companies have arbitration clauses or  limitations of liability. For example, Twitter has $100 limitation of  liability and that's user policy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>DHILLON:  Some of these things make it unattractive to file a lawsuit and  those are also issues that could be addressed by Congress and by regulators  in Washington.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Harmeet, it's pretty creepy that Google is tracking  you after you turn off your location or pause it. They are potentially  tracking you via other apps, on Android devices. It's creepy because Google  workers have been protesting Google building a search engine for China  because China will use that search engine to track its citizens and commit  human rights abuses.</p><p>And now, we have had news coming in that started this talk yesterday,  Harmeet, that more Google workers support, support that censored search  engine, building it for China while they didn't help the Pentagon. What's  going on there?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, I think to be clear, it's that they were double the number  of Google employees protesting Google's work for the Pentagon than they are  protesting the work in China. I am actually impressed that any Google  employees are bold enough to protest what Google is doing in China.</p><p>But I think it's also convenient for them to protest what's happening  somewhere else where they don't seem to care about the welfare of their own  fellow employees and what Google is doing to Americans by stealing their  privacy, undermining them, censoring them and tracking them. I think there  is some massive hypocrisy going on there among Google employees or what we  call dissonance, cognitive dissonance.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Stay on that cognitive dissonance. I am looking at the headline  out of TechCrunch. Five hundred Google workers signed a letter, saying,  yes, Google, go ahead and build that censored search engine for China.</p><p>DHILLON:  OK.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, there are some against -- I mean, it's pretty striking  what's going on there, Harmeet.</p><p>DHILLON:  No, but, Liz, that's 500 saying, yes, do it. Five hundred people  who have questionable moral judgment who signed that. But there are 80,000  plus Google employees.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good point.</p><p>DHILLON:  I don't think it's fair to say that there are many of them who  support it. I think most of them are probably ashamed of it. I would have  to imagine.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, what do you think of Google going ahead with this censored  search engine for China? It's pretty amazing stuff.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think it's awful. I think it is awful that an American company  is going to be complicit in shadowing and giving this data to China which   uses it to punish people.</p><p>China uses data like this to prevent people from flying, to put people into  camps, to prevent them from getting jobs to the government, and to track  them and punish them and their relatives. It's really outrageous that any  American company would participate in that, but they are doing it for the  unholy dollar, unfortunately.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Do you think -- getting back to Facebook, do you think Facebook  jumped a shark here in terms of its credibility?</p><p>DHILLON:  Well, again, if you look into the details, it looks like the  consideration of charging for the data that is uncovered to this particular  story is from 2012 to 2014. They have come out and said that they don't  currently do that.</p><p>However, you know, follow the money. You have to understand that if you are  not being charged for a product, you are the product. I think that's also  OK for Americans as long as it's properly disclosed. The problem is we  haven't had transparency and that has not been disclosed what is being done  with our data. We also can't get it back.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>DHILLON:  I don't think there is a way for you to shut off Facebook and  then retrieve your data from that. That doesn't exist.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Beyond 2012, more recently, they have been giving access to  data. Certainly Cambridge Analytic was reading Facebook messages. Harmeet,  you're great. Come back soon. We love having you on.</p><p>DHILLON:  Anytime.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's good to see you. Coming up, high-profile Democrats now  doing a 180, and now standing tough about border security. You'll never  guess the latest Democrat who jumped on the Trump bandwagon, and he's  thinking about running in 2020. We've got the name, coming up.</p><p>But first, more details surfacing about the growing crisis at the border  with the migrant caravan. We've got the latest there. That's next. Stay  right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Developments tonight at the border. The border  patrol has arrested an active member of the MS-13 gang on U.S. side of the  border. He traveled with the caravan. He is a Honduran national. Homeland  Security has estimated there are hundreds of criminals in the caravan.</p><p>Separate from that, health officials in Tijuana warned about an escalating  humanitarian health crisis with the caravan. Jeff Paul is on the ground of  Tijuana, Mexico with more. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS REPORTER:  Yeah, Elizabeth. Just about the last couple  of hours, the situation behind started to develop. There are some migrants  from that caravan who are staying at the nearby shelter. They tried to  march towards the immigration offices here to protest, but they were then  stopped by the federal police over here who said that they are doing their  job and they are given orders to not let them pass.</p><p>At the same time this is happening, it has been a very rainy day, and that  of course is causing lots of health concerns. Sixty percent, according to  health officials, are suffering from respiratory infections that are  staying in that shelter. We spoke with one migrant who told us he is not  only concerned about his health but the others around him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's a big problem, especially with children. You  hear children coughing, for example. You hear they -- they start crying  because they can't take it. They start coughing and coughing and coughing.  If you think about it, we, adults cannot even take it sometimes. With  children, it is much more difficult.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL:  With so many people, some 6,000 migrants living in such close  quarters and very poor condition, there are talks of now opening up a  second additional shelter. The details right now being hammered out as we  speak. Elizabeth?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jeff Paul. Thank you so much for your reporting, sir. We really  appreciate it. With me now if Fox News medical correspondent, Dr. Marc  Siegel. Doctor, there is a lot of concern about the health crisis. It is a  humanitarian issue, what's happening in Tijuana, right?</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  I feel very bad for the  people there. The migrants are in trouble because they are in such close  quarters, hygiene might not be what you would want, and the respiratory  viruses. The issue is that the viruses spread very quickly among people  that are in close quarters, especially this time of year.</p><p>So, the report was from Griff Jenkins this morning, one-third are sick.  It's probably more than that. I think that's probably under-reported. The  nurses have been telling him that. Respiratory viruses, I'm concerned about  something like chicken pox which is going around down there because a lot  of people aren't vaccinated. That's about 90 percent infectivity rate of  chicken pox.</p><p>You can get quite ill. We think of that as a childhood disease. You can get  quite ill from that. Three cases of tuberculosis down there. That's very  problematic. Hepatitis A and lice. And also of course other diseases like  heart disease, asthma. So, there is a lot of problems with the conditions.  It's only going to get worse.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah. The Tijuana mayor says 30,000 a day funding for the  migrants is running out. We are going to stay on that story for you. Let's  switch to another shocker of a story. Life expectancy dropping in the U.S.  for the third straight year. Let's talk to the doctor about this, because  rural America is really getting hit too. This is stunning. We haven't seen  it dropping at this rate since World War I.</p><p>SIEGEL:  You know, when I saw this, my jaw dropped because I thought it was  going to be the obesity epidemic that you and I talked about last week.  People are overweight that they get heart disease, that they get cancer,  that they get stroke. That's stable. In fact, we have less people dying of  cancer than before.</p><p>It's actually suicide and the drug overdoses we have been talking about. We  are seeing 70,000 drug overdose deaths per year which is up because of  illegal fentanyl. Even as we start, Liz, to get a handle on doctors not  prescribing too much, on pharmacies not giving out too much, we still got  illegal chemists in China and Mexico with their fentanyl that caused over  30,000 overdose deaths in places like West Virginia, Ohio, the capitol,  Pennsylvania.</p><p>So, those states, New Hampshire getting really hammered with overdose  deaths. And we have suicide in places that are my favorite places in the  country. Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico. Gorgeous places where  you would think just being alive in this place would be enough to sustain  you, but not if you don't have a job.</p><p>In 2017, this is the statistics we are talking about, 53,000 deaths -- 53  percent increase over 1999, 53 percent increase, and it's because of job  loss. Hopefully, with the economy recovering --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>SIEGEL:  -- that we are going to see improvement.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, because this is despair and lack of hope. So, the White  House has been battling to get jobs for, you know, across the country. Is  that could be curative here?</p><p>SIEGEL:  I think that's the cure.</p><p>MACDONALD:  One of the cures, right?</p><p>SIEGEL?:  This has been hitting mainly ages 25 to 44. I think that the  White House getting us on track in terms of economy, I think we are seeing  more jobs than ever before, that's going to translate into people being  happier in rural states like the ones I just mentioned.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's a health crisis. Doctors are trying to help with the  opioid addition. It's humanitarian crisis. Doc, we love having you on. Are  you going to stay on the story for us?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It was a shocker, when we saw that, right?</p><p>SIEGEL: Unbelievable. I never expected that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>SIEGEL:  I think jobs will translate to people being happier and staying  alive.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We hope so. We are thinking of those folks out there. Thank  you, Dr. Siegel. Coming up next, much of the mainstream media losing their  collective mind after President Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen,  pleads guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Tower real estate deal  in Moscow.</p><p>It's not good to lie to Congress. The markets shrugged it off. But Gregg  Jarrett is here too to explain why it is not exactly the smoking gun  against Trump as the media is trying to report that. We are going to stay  on the story. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. President Trump blasting at his former personal  attorney, Michael Cohen, calling him weak and a liar after Cohen pleaded  guilty to a single count of lying to Congress to minimize the president's  role in efforts to build the Trump Tower in Moscow. It was special counsel  Robert Mueller who brought the charges.</p><p>Let's bring in Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. He is the author of  the bestseller book, \"The Russia Hoax.\" Gregg, a lot of speculation. What  are the facts at this moment? What do we know?</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  We know it's not a crime to build a  tower in Moscow. Trump is a real estate developer. He had an option and  letter of intent. He scrapped the deal. To my mind, you know, if there  really was some coordination or collusion or conspiracy with Russia to win  the election and those connected to Trump Tower, Cohen would have been  charged, but he wasn't.</p><p>He's charged as four other individuals who have been charged with what we  know as process crimes. These are things that have occurred after the fact  caused by Mueller's investigation itself. So if Cohen -- if Mueller had  evidence of collusion, Cohen would have been charged and so others.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That is the key silver bullet to what's happening here --</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- at this point in time, because we don't know what Robert  Mueller is going to do down the road. Nobody -- if there was conspiracy or  collusion, you're saying we would have seen those charges already?</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, against individuals at Trump's campaign.</p><p>JARRETT:  The media and the left which is slightly redundant have promised  that we would know by now all of the evidence of collusion, secret bank  transfers and rendezvouses in Moscow and the bowls (ph) of the Kremlin  between Trump and Putin and others, smoking gun, documents that would  evidence this conspiracy to steal the White House. None of it has come to  fruition.</p><p>MACDONALD:  No conspiracy or collusion charges right now.</p><p>JARRETT:  You know, collusion, first of all, not even a crime in a criminal  code. You would have to find some other relevant statute. And so far, it  appears that Mueller hasn't because of all of the people he has been  charging, all of them are for the most part are tax fraud cases, money  laundering or these process crimes, gee, you are not telling the truth to  me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Attorney Alan Dershowitz agrees with you that  Mueller is -- he is saying Mueller is creating crime --</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- after the fact. And Trump says that even if Cohen's  testimony were true, it would  be perfectly legal for President Trump to be  negotiating real estate deals while campaigning. It was a byproduct of him,  running a business while campaigning.</p><p>JARRETT:  Yeah, it's very much not only is it legal to talk to Russians  building some real estate in Moscow, but it's also perfectly legal as in  the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer to have a conversation with  the Russians.</p><p>In fact, it is the title of one of the chapters in my book. It is not a  crime to talk to a Russian. You can receive information from a Russian as  long as money doesn't exchange hands. It's not a violation of the Federal  Campaign Election Act. It's not conspiracy to defraud the government. All  that is nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But the media is basically bringing up that the president is  not meeting with Putin over Michael Cohen when it's over Ukraine.</p><p>JARRETT:  Exactly, you know, but, the media is on board with this collusion  narrative. They think if they say the word \"Russia\" and \"collusion\" enough,  the mere use of the term which connotes to crime will establish a crime --  it just doesn't under American law.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Let's move on to this story. The president apparently told  The New York Post that a pardon for Paul Manafort is not off the table.  What's your take on that story?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JARRETT:  If it were me, I's pardon everybody. Just to vaccine anger,  Robert Mueller and his team of partisans. This is the most lopsided,  unfair, biased prosecution I have ever seen in my life and I have been a  lawyer for almost 40 years. Mueller had conflicts of interest. Should never  have accepted the job. Assembles a team of nothing but pro-Hillary, anti- Trump partisans.</p><p>Every move they have made the better part of 19 months now, have exhibited  severe prejudice. So when Mueller comes out with his report, whether it's  made public or not, Trump's legal team, Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani and  others, will be publishing their counter report because as Professor  Dershowitz has pointed out, Mueller's reports going to be one-sided.</p><p>His version of events from a prosecutorial point of view. He is not going  to represent the others. Somebody has to. The lawyers for Trump have been  preparing their own counter report, or you can read my book.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>JARRETT:  And that needs -- in fairness to the president, that needs to be  presented simultaneously.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much for coming on. Will you come  on again?</p><p>JARRETT:  Yeah.</p><p>MACDONALD:  As soon as that Mueller report comes out, we're going to call  you.</p><p>JARRETT:  I'm not holding my breath.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Exactly. Great, Jarrett. You're terrific. Thank you so much.  We're going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. OK, who said this? \"Europe is already crushed  under this transformation that is taking place because of immigration.  Germany - Angela Merkel, weakened because of it. And other places impacted,  Italy - significantly impacted its politics by immigration.\" It's former  Secretary of State John Kerry.</p><p>John Kerry may run in 2020. He is starting to sound a lot like President  Trump. He certainly sounds like what Senator Obama and Senator Hillary  Clinton have said in the past.</p><p>Let's take it up with New York Republican Congressman Tom Reed. Sir, great  to see you. Your reaction to John Kerry.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  Obviously a statement like that about  immigration should be reflected in America's policy. We need a border, we  need to secure our border and make sure that it's functioning. When you see  the hypocrisy now of Secretary Kerry on the left demonstrating that they  recognize this in Europe and not in America, that's a question that we  should be asking as American citizens of our leaders.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Republican conservatives alike are humanitarian, they  are pro-legal immigration. The Democrats continue to muddy and the media  muddies this issue. It's not the first time Democrats have spoken against  illegal immigration. Bill Clinton again, Barack Obama, Senator Harry Reid,  Senator Dianne Feinstein. Your take on that.</p><p>REED:  Yeah, Liz, you're absolutely right. I mean, we as Republicans,  myself, firmly believe people should be able to come to America legally to  enjoy the American dream. That's what's made us great for generations. The  diversity is a strength, not a weakness. But you need a border that keeps  us secure.</p><p>When you see an MS-13 gang member just recently arrested at our southern  border trying to cross with this caravan that is coming up through Tijuana,  that is a signal, that is a problem that needs to be fixed. I will just  tell you, this hypocrisy on the left, it's good for Europe to control its  borders, its good for Europe to control its immigration status and not for  America, politics at play, not substance.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sir, are you pro-immigration?</p><p>REED:  Yeah, I believe in immigration. I believe we should have a country  that welcomes people to the American dream, but we have to do it in a  smart, sensible manner that has structure such as walls, such as  technology, such as people to keep us safe, our fellow American citizens  safe and sound. That's the top priority, but have a border that also  functions so that people can come and go in a way that is controlled.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Congressman Tom Reed of New York. I wish I have more time with  you, sir. We ran out of time. Come back soon. Great to see you.</p><p>REED:  Always great to be with you, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you so much for having us in your homes and thank you for  watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network. Have a  good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thank you for watching. Money, politics, we're going to bring you the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now.</p><p>First up, President Trump standing tough. Canceling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit, citing the Ukraine conflict. And separate from that, the president says he does think China wants to make a trade deal.</p><p>Blake Burman is live at the G20 in Buenos Aires. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there, Liz. President Trump steps the land here in Buenos Aires, Argentina within the next two to three hours. After that it's a couple days' worth of meeting with a handful of world leaders culminating Saturday evening a dinner sit-down with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to talk about several topics none more important than trade.</p><p>The president, though, when he left the White House to come to Argentina earlier this morning cast some doubt though, on whether or not there would be a breakthrough as it relates to a possible trade deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think we are very close to doing something with China. But I don't know that it wants to do it. Because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes. So, I really don't know.</p><p>But I will tell you that I think China wants to make a deal. I'm open to making a deal. But frankly, I like the deal we have right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The president will not be meeting with Vladimir Putin. President Trump canceled that meeting via Twitter on board Air Force One after being briefed by his Chief of Staff, John Kelly, the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and his National Security Advisor, John Bolton about Russia's recent aggressive action against Ukraine in the waters of Crimea.</p><p>The State Department today defending that decision.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT PALLADINO, DEPUTY SPOKESMAN, STATE DEPARTMENT: What's clear is, the president's tweets on the subject were quite clear what we looked for. And that is the return of the Ukrainian sailors and the vessels.</p><p>The aggression that we witnessed this week is unacceptable, and a strong message has been sent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: A spokesperson for the Kremlin said that they were not made aware of the president's tweet, the president's decision before he signed off on that tweet. Saying in a statement earlier today, quote, \"If this is so, the president will have a couple, speaking of Putin, a couple of additional hours on the program for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\" Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, Blake. And Rudy Giuliani and President Trump's lawyers are now slamming the decision to file charges against Michael Cohen during this G20 trip.</p><p>Let's get to the border. President Trump declaring, quote, \"a very possible government shutdown if we don't get the wall money.\"</p><p>This, as the U.S. officials saying no criminal charges have been filed against the 42 migrants who were arrested for illegally crossing the border during that caravan protest that ended in tear gas. He says the press reports charges were not filed because the accused had things like medical problems or issues with having children alongside them. Or they are accompanying.</p><p>And there is an issue on whether or not they were actually deported. We are staying to getting the facts of that story.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Texas Congressman Michael Burgess. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS, (R) TEXAS: Thanks for having me on, Liz. I appreciate it.</p><p>MACDONALD: What is the holdup in Congress over getting money for the border wall?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, the deadline is the 7th of December. There was a continuing resolution passed at the end of September that gave us until December. It is possible that there will be required another very short-term extension. But I believe that an agreement can be reached and I believe the president needs to get the money for the wall that he's asked.</p><p>We all saw last weekend the images of people coming to the fence, literally coming through the fence. The fence is not secure. The infrastructure needs to exist to secure the border and the president is exactly correct. And he needs to get the money to do the job.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, our border authority says a border wall would help them back them up in their efforts at the border. You make an important point. Now the president -- this is a story that's coming fast next week. He is saying he will shut down the government. Do you think a deal can get done here, sir?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, the actual -- the actual mechanics of a government shutdown would come from the lapse of appropriations if an agreement can't be reached on the 7th or if there is indeed a short-term extension of whatever point after that.</p><p>So, it's not actually an action by the White House that shuts the government down. It would be failure to reach an agreement an appropriation lapse that occurs in homeland security.</p><p>Do bear in mind that a number of the appropriations bills did pass by September. So, unlike in 2013 when a similar situation existed, the United States military has been funded.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Right.</p><p>BURGESS: The Department of Health and Human Services had been funded. So, there are significant funding bills that have already passed. Homeland security is one of the ones that remains, it needs to be done. The president needs to get his money.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Sir, it will be a partial shutdown. I hear what you are saying. So, what do you in -- what dollar figure do you have in your mind that you think is the correct number?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, the president has said he needs $25 billion to build the wall and that this year a $5 billion installment is what is required. I believe that is correct. And that is -- that's what the Congress should provide the president. I think that the votes are there on the House side to get that done.</p><p>The difficulty is always on the Senate side with a 60-vote, a 60-vote margin that's required. This is one of those times that I believe that the Senate majority leader should forgo the 60-vote rule and just simply pass the bill with 51 votes. This is too important. It needs to protect--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Can he do that? Can he--</p><p>BURGESS: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: Under on what grounds?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, it happened before and in fact, it happened of course with the Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch. Where they suspended the 60-vote rule of this. That obviously we challenge on that. But he sustained some of the simple majority.</p><p>So, there would also be the possibility of doing another quick reconciliation bill that would only require 51 votes to pass. So, there are avenues to get this done. It is unconscionable that the Senate leader on the Democratic side would shut down the government because he doesn't want to defend our southern border.</p><p>MACDONALD: Congressman Burgess, thank you so much. We'll have you back on again soon, sir.</p><p>BURGESS: Great.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you.</p><p>BURGESS: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thanks again.</p><p>Bill and Hillary Clinton on their 13-city speaking tour. Now in -- they were in Montreal. Bill Clinton saying America should be more like Canada when it comes to the border security there.</p><p>To National Diversity Coalition for Trump, Madison Gesiotto. Madison, great to see you.</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, MEMBER, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP: Good to be with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Madison, Bill Clinton he likes Canada's system for immigration. Doesn't Canada have a merit-based immigration system which Trump says the U.S. should do? It sounds like he may be agreeing with him on that front.</p><p>GESIOTTO: Yes, Canada does have a partially merit-based system. But the one thing to note about Canada is that I think the majority are close to 50 percent of their immigrants that come in don't come on the merit-based system. They come in other pathways. So, their pathways are still open in Canada and a lot of immigrants have come through that way.</p><p>But when it comes to merit-based, the president has been pushing that. He thinks it's a great, of great option and will be a wonderful policy for our country. And I think it very much mirrors and goes back to what President John F. Kennedy said in his 1961 address which we all have heard so many times. Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.</p><p>And I think that's what the heart of this policy really is, and why the president has been pushing for that. What can these immigrants do to produce the United States of America to make our country better.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Democrats in 2013 were for what President Trump is now saying, right? It was Chuck Schumer who signed off on it. Dozens of other Democrats. Obama supported merit-based systems, so did Joe Biden.</p><p>You know, Madison, it's pretty striking for Bill Clinton to say what he's saying now about Canada, you know, having a good system. Because Clinton was the one who signed in 1996 the toughest immigration reform bill that is still with us today. It essentially invented the immigration enforcement and increased deportations, right?</p><p>GESIOTTO: Well, I think over the years it's been bipartisan in terms of support for securing our borders and to making sure that we improve our immigration system but the problem was no one ever came to an agreement on what to get done.</p><p>Now President Trump is in office and people hate for this president, really has, you know, overcome their desire to get things done for the American people and to make our system better. They know. They know that it's broken. They know we need to get things done. But they really would prefer to go against and obstruct the agenda of President Trump, then they want to accomplish this.</p><p>And so, I think a lot of them are backtracking and really flipflopping on this issue. And as you know, it's not just 2013, it's not just the 1990's. There's been many cases over the past 20 or 30 years where a lot of these Democrats still in Congress today have supported man of the things President Trump and his administration are talking about now.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Madison, you are an astute observer of what's going on in the media and how the media covers things. Tell us what happened over the last five years. Because all of a sudden, you know, the media and their coverage, critics are saying there is kind of a 180 in perspective on what is needed to do border security. This was as of five years ago. There was very tough, tough coverage. And now, all of a sudden, it's open borders. That's how it feels.</p><p>GESIOTTO: Yes. I mean, and I think when we look at the media coverage of this issue specifically, it's actually quite appalling. Journalism is so very important. Making sure that we have people out there being fair and covering the facts are so important. And it's not happening.</p><p>People are letting their personal biases come into their stories. And they're not reporting the facts. So, people out there that are watching the mainstream media or reading articles online aren't getting the information that they are here to receive and that's very disappointing. And I hope that we can turn things around. Because I want fair coverage even if it's not always what I want to hear.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Madison Gesiotto, you're great. Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it.</p><p>GESIOTTO: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to a market check of your money. The Dow closing slightly lower today. But the blue chip index is on pace for it best week since the 2016 election.</p><p>To prices at the pump. The national average for regular gas is $2.51 a gallon. That is down 50 days straight. That's money in your pocket. And 21 states now have gas stations selling gas for less than $2 a gallon and that trend is growing.</p><p>In other headlines. New information about that murderous Boston mobster Whitey Bulger. Bulger reportedly wrote to a friend that he hoped to die peacefully in his sleep. Those letters sent right before he was brutally murdered in prison.</p><p>Manhattan U.S. attorney announcing a new distribution of more than $695 million to the victims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. It is the third payout, it will be sent to 27,000 victims worldwide. Bernie Madoff sentenced to 150 years in prison.</p><p>Now in honor of the 50th anniversary -- anniversary of the Beatles white album the hash tag Beatles songs for millennial's on fire today trending worldwide on Twitter. Look at this. Tweeters including millennials are rewriting the titles of famous Beatles songs, it's all about poking fun at millennials.</p><p>Look these titles. Strawberry field. Whatever. I get by with a little help from my parents while my iPhone gently tweets. It's pretty funny stuff.</p><p>And look at this cute video. A 6-year-old boy upstages Pope Francis during the post weekly speech. The young boy ran on stage, he shook the hand of a security guard along the way. He got a lot of laughs at the pope. The pope let the child continue to play around them. And that was totally cute.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump still going after General Motors. The president saying, he is just trying to protect American jobs. We got the mayor of one Ohio town at the center of this fight. He is now fearing economic disaster right before Christmas, but we've got breaking details on something we were first in telling you could be coming. Possible tax race to keep those G.M. jobs.</p><p>We're going to be right back. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. President Trump again slamming General Motors on twitter saying quote. \"G.M. is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing big steel opening plants all over the country, auto companies pouring into the U.S., including BMW.\"</p><p>Let's bring in by phone the mayor of one of the towns where G.M. is planning to cut jobs. He is the mayor of Lordstown, Ohio. He's Mayor Arno Hill. Mayor, how serious is this for your town? We want to hear about the human pain behind the story. Can you tell us what's going on?</p><p>MAYOR ARNO HILL, LORDSTOWN, OHIO: I will tell you. You know, we just had our third layoff in the last two years. Two years ago, we were running three shifts. Lost the third shift, lost the second shift, lost the third shift, lost by the town of (Inaudible) we lost over 3,000 jobs.</p><p>You know, the biggest thing is, you know people who have lost jobs whose benefits are starting to run out. I'm sure the people from the third lay off their benefits have run out. The second lay off I believe theirs would be running out by the end of the year. And by the people at the first shift, you know, they may be able to ride it out and settle on employment for a while.</p><p>But, you know, the village has taken a pretty good hit. And we're doing what we can. You know, we've been adjusting every time there is a layoff, so it would be OK. You know, the village would be OK for a while. But the small business as every business, which came in they figured it had seven people there's been a ripple effect is what we're looking at.</p><p>And I know a lot of those restaurants, stores, gas station, all of businesses, you know, they are the ones who are feeling it already.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Mayor, what's your take on how the president has been reacting to the story?</p><p>HILL: I think the president is trying to get General Motors' attention. You know, the General Motors they get bailed out many years ago, and you know, he ran on those, in fact, today, in Northeast Ohio, we're going to bring the jobs back. You know, the Northeast Ohio part of the state were the first one to go down. And to downturn, the last one to come up. He did campaign. He did turn (Inaudible) where we're at grab during the last presidential election.</p><p>And you know, right now, only then I could say I'm glad that they said they weren't permanently shuttering the plant. it's just that they are going to see its production and I think that we still have a pulse in our heartbeat.</p><p>MACDONALD: Mayor, we're hearing the president may try to get tax breaks to keep those G.M. jobs including jobs from going overseas. That's what Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown is saying. We're also hearing about how Ford says it figured how to keep jobs by rearranging shifts at factories in Kentucky and Michigan. What's your take on the possible tax breaks and what's your take on what Ford is doing.</p><p>HILL: As far as the possible tax break -- you know, I talked to Sherrod Brown. I talk to governor and lieutenant governor-elect Mike DeWine. They've all talked, they said, you know, we have to know what G.M. wants what G.M. needs to remain competitive. My phone has been ringing off the hook. I do believe that long-term I feel we'll get the product.</p><p>As far as what General Motors is doing and God, General Motors is reshuffling some of their laid off plant workers to other plants that all the (Inaudible) will do (Inaudible) whether it be in Spring Hill, Tennessee or Arlington, Texas. You know, if there's an opening I'm sure that several people may move on. I appreciate that. I'm sure that if we get another product a lot of those people will want to come back home.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, you're saying that hopefully G.M. will put an SUV or truck manufacturing capabilities in the factory in Lordstown. Is that a possibility?</p><p>HILL: I'm hoping that the crossover and SUV, a truck, a hybrid, an autonomous vehicle--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Can they do that. Can G.M. do that? Forgive me for interrupting. Can G.M. recalibrate their factories to do that?</p><p>HILL: The factory was set up for a smaller car. But I do know when they came on the 90's they had to posture the plant in case there was something and they would have to change the product. They had told me they could do that. Now, you know, they did it, they got a new paint plant, probably around 12 years ago. Someone says the paint plant may not be able to assist them on the bigger product.</p><p>I know they can make adjustments. You know, I heard rumors that they may be bringing the (Inaudible) in Korea. They have the same architectural base on the (Inaudible) and the Chevy truck and that would be a good fit for our plant. But I'm holding out that we're going to get a product.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Mayor Arno Hill of Lordstown, Ohio, I think you made some news there tonight, sir. Thank you so much for coming on. We will be staying on this story, sir. Your honor, we appreciate you coming on the show. Thank you so much.</p><p>HILL: Thank you very much. I appreciate the invite.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Next up, we've got new show premiering on Fox Business tomorrow night. WSJ at-large, hosted by Jerry Baker. Here's a sneak peek with former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. He is a big Democrat. He says President Trump is right about China. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE SUMMERS, FORMER SECRETARY, U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT: We, in the United States need to be very clear we were entitled and we are right to reject Chinese cheating in. Chinese violations as a rule. Rules that don't cover unfair practices. We're right when we're against that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: The full interview will air tomorrow night on WSJ at Large with Jerry Baker at 9.30 p.m. Eastern Time right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Coming up, remember when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg told Congress earlier this year that Facebook does not sell your data? Well, not so fast. We're going to detail for you Zuckerberg's fastball there because Facebook was all about selling access to your data. That slow drip of bad news continues out of the U.K. The U.K. now scouring through Facebook's internal documents that it seized last week. We've got that for you.</p><p>And later in the show. A shocker life expectancy for Americans falling at a rate not seen in 100 years, that's back when there was World War I and the flu pandemic. Dr. Marc Siegel joins us on that and how President Trump is fighting to help rural America where this health crisis is at its worst.</p><p>We're going to be right back. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it's another day another round of shady dealings by big tech.</p><p>You're watching the Fox Business Network. You won't believe these stories.</p><p>A New York labor union slamming Amazon for, quote, \"dehumanizing and deadly work practices.\" Internal documents seized by Great Britain shows Facebook is that profiting by selling companies access to your data including free access to the dating site Tinder.</p><p>We got Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey under fire. A House committee examines whether Jack Dorsey gave misleading testimony about twitter taking care of violent posts. Also, Twitter censored a U.S. marine for apparently no reason.</p><p>We've got Google CEO Sundar Pichai, he's set to testify at a congressional hearing next week. Google faces multibillion-dollar fines in Europe for tracking where you are even after you turn off your location on Google. It's a lot of stuff.</p><p>Let's bring in attorney Harmeet Dhillon. She is fighting the battle against social media censorship of conservatives. It's like tech is losing their minds, Harmeet. What's going on here?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN, RNC: Well, you know, Liz, we've heard these types of stories actually for a couple of years now. But what's amazing to me, is that we haven't seen more action against these big tech companies from Washington, where even those conservatives have been discriminated against clients like my client James Damore have been fired from Google for voicing conservative views.</p><p>We haven't used the last two years of conservative dominance in Washington to actually open up investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, or Congress passing some regulations that would reign in these massive abuses of civil rights and privacy rights on the part of Americans.</p><p>We do see that happen in Europe. However, some of the stories that you just mentioned are emanating out of Europe where they have much more concern for privacy rights of citizens there. I would like to see more of that in America.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, we've got big tech lobbyists all over Washington, D.C.Harmeet, I like your response to Republican Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert. Here is his fix for the problem with big tech. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS: They ought to be subject to lawsuits and I think some billion dollar class actions here and there would probably change their conduct pretty dramatically.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow! Is that the fix? That Louie Gohmert last night, Harmeet, because under the law, you know, the social media is exempt from lawsuits because they supposedly offer truly diverse political discourse. What's your answer to that?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, number one, I think that the Congress which Representative Gohmert sits on has had two years to do something about it. They need to redefine and perhaps pair back the Communications Decency Act Section 230. That would be one.</p><p>But another is that a lot of these companies have arbitration clauses or limitations of liability. For example, Twitter has $100 limitation of liability and that's user policy.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>DHILLON: Some of these things make it unattractive to file a lawsuit and those are also issues that could be addressed by Congress and by regulators in Washington.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Harmeet, it's pretty creepy that Google is tracking you after you turn off your location or pause it. They are potentially tracking you via other apps, on Android devices. It's creepy because Google workers have been protesting Google building a search engine for China because China will use that search engine to track its citizens and commit human rights abuses.</p><p>And now, we have had news coming in that started this talk yesterday, Harmeet, that more Google workers support, support that censored search engine, building it for China while they didn't help the Pentagon. What's going on there?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, I think to be clear, it's that they were double the number of Google employees protesting Google's work for the Pentagon than they are protesting the work in China. I am actually impressed that any Google employees are bold enough to protest what Google is doing in China.</p><p>But I think it's also convenient for them to protest what's happening somewhere else where they don't seem to care about the welfare of their own fellow employees and what Google is doing to Americans by stealing their privacy, undermining them, censoring them and tracking them. I think there is some massive hypocrisy going on there among Google employees or what we call dissonance, cognitive dissonance.</p><p>MACDONALD: Stay on that cognitive dissonance. I am looking at the headline out of TechCrunch. Five hundred Google workers signed a letter, saying, yes, Google, go ahead and build that censored search engine for China.</p><p>DHILLON: OK.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, there are some against -- I mean, it's pretty striking what's going on there, Harmeet.</p><p>DHILLON: No, but, Liz, that's 500 saying, yes, do it. Five hundred people who have questionable moral judgment who signed that. But there are 80,000 plus Google employees.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good point.</p><p>DHILLON: I don't think it's fair to say that there are many of them who support it. I think most of them are probably ashamed of it. I would have to imagine.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, what do you think of Google going ahead with this censored search engine for China? It's pretty amazing stuff.</p><p>DHILLON: I think it's awful. I think it is awful that an American company is going to be complicit in shadowing and giving this data to China which uses it to punish people.</p><p>China uses data like this to prevent people from flying, to put people into camps, to prevent them from getting jobs to the government, and to track them and punish them and their relatives. It's really outrageous that any American company would participate in that, but they are doing it for the unholy dollar, unfortunately.</p><p>MACDONALD: Do you think -- getting back to Facebook, do you think Facebook jumped a shark here in terms of its credibility?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, again, if you look into the details, it looks like the consideration of charging for the data that is uncovered to this particular story is from 2012 to 2014. They have come out and said that they don't currently do that.</p><p>However, you know, follow the money. You have to understand that if you are not being charged for a product, you are the product. I think that's also OK for Americans as long as it's properly disclosed. The problem is we haven't had transparency and that has not been disclosed what is being done with our data. We also can't get it back.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>DHILLON: I don't think there is a way for you to shut off Facebook and then retrieve your data from that. That doesn't exist.</p><p>MACDONALD: Beyond 2012, more recently, they have been giving access to data. Certainly Cambridge Analytic was reading Facebook messages. Harmeet, you're great. Come back soon. We love having you on.</p><p>DHILLON: Anytime.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's good to see you. Coming up, high-profile Democrats now doing a 180, and now standing tough about border security. You'll never guess the latest Democrat who jumped on the Trump bandwagon, and he's thinking about running in 2020. We've got the name, coming up.</p><p>But first, more details surfacing about the growing crisis at the border with the migrant caravan. We've got the latest there. That's next. Stay right there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Developments tonight at the border. The border patrol has arrested an active member of the MS-13 gang on U.S. side of the border. He traveled with the caravan. He is a Honduran national. Homeland Security has estimated there are hundreds of criminals in the caravan.</p><p>Separate from that, health officials in Tijuana warned about an escalating humanitarian health crisis with the caravan. Jeff Paul is on the ground of Tijuana, Mexico with more. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Yeah, Elizabeth. Just about the last couple of hours, the situation behind started to develop. There are some migrants from that caravan who are staying at the nearby shelter. They tried to march towards the immigration offices here to protest, but they were then stopped by the federal police over here who said that they are doing their job and they are given orders to not let them pass.</p><p>At the same time this is happening, it has been a very rainy day, and that of course is causing lots of health concerns. Sixty percent, according to health officials, are suffering from respiratory infections that are staying in that shelter. We spoke with one migrant who told us he is not only concerned about his health but the others around him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a big problem, especially with children. You hear children coughing, for example. You hear they -- they start crying because they can't take it. They start coughing and coughing and coughing. If you think about it, we, adults cannot even take it sometimes. With children, it is much more difficult.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL: With so many people, some 6,000 migrants living in such close quarters and very poor condition, there are talks of now opening up a second additional shelter. The details right now being hammered out as we speak. Elizabeth?</p><p>MACDONALD: Jeff Paul. Thank you so much for your reporting, sir. We really appreciate it. With me now if Fox News medical correspondent, Dr. Marc Siegel. Doctor, there is a lot of concern about the health crisis. It is a humanitarian issue, what's happening in Tijuana, right?</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I feel very bad for the people there. The migrants are in trouble because they are in such close quarters, hygiene might not be what you would want, and the respiratory viruses. The issue is that the viruses spread very quickly among people that are in close quarters, especially this time of year.</p><p>So, the report was from Griff Jenkins this morning, one-third are sick. It's probably more than that. I think that's probably under-reported. The nurses have been telling him that. Respiratory viruses, I'm concerned about something like chicken pox which is going around down there because a lot of people aren't vaccinated. That's about 90 percent infectivity rate of chicken pox.</p><p>You can get quite ill. We think of that as a childhood disease. You can get quite ill from that. Three cases of tuberculosis down there. That's very problematic. Hepatitis A and lice. And also of course other diseases like heart disease, asthma. So, there is a lot of problems with the conditions. It's only going to get worse.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah. The Tijuana mayor says 30,000 a day funding for the migrants is running out. We are going to stay on that story for you. Let's switch to another shocker of a story. Life expectancy dropping in the U.S. for the third straight year. Let's talk to the doctor about this, because rural America is really getting hit too. This is stunning. We haven't seen it dropping at this rate since World War I.</p><p>SIEGEL: You know, when I saw this, my jaw dropped because I thought it was going to be the obesity epidemic that you and I talked about last week. People are overweight that they get heart disease, that they get cancer, that they get stroke. That's stable. In fact, we have less people dying of cancer than before.</p><p>It's actually suicide and the drug overdoses we have been talking about. We are seeing 70,000 drug overdose deaths per year which is up because of illegal fentanyl. Even as we start, Liz, to get a handle on doctors not prescribing too much, on pharmacies not giving out too much, we still got illegal chemists in China and Mexico with their fentanyl that caused over 30,000 overdose deaths in places like West Virginia, Ohio, the capitol, Pennsylvania.</p><p>So, those states, New Hampshire getting really hammered with overdose deaths. And we have suicide in places that are my favorite places in the country. Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico. Gorgeous places where you would think just being alive in this place would be enough to sustain you, but not if you don't have a job.</p><p>In 2017, this is the statistics we are talking about, 53,000 deaths -- 53 percent increase over 1999, 53 percent increase, and it's because of job loss. Hopefully, with the economy recovering --</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>SIEGEL: -- that we are going to see improvement.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, because this is despair and lack of hope. So, the White House has been battling to get jobs for, you know, across the country. Is that could be curative here?</p><p>SIEGEL: I think that's the cure.</p><p>MACDONALD: One of the cures, right?</p><p>SIEGEL?: This has been hitting mainly ages 25 to 44. I think that the White House getting us on track in terms of economy, I think we are seeing more jobs than ever before, that's going to translate into people being happier in rural states like the ones I just mentioned.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's a health crisis. Doctors are trying to help with the opioid addition. It's humanitarian crisis. Doc, we love having you on. Are you going to stay on the story for us?</p><p>SIEGEL: Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: It was a shocker, when we saw that, right?</p><p>SIEGEL: Unbelievable. I never expected that.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>SIEGEL: I think jobs will translate to people being happier and staying alive.</p><p>MACDONALD: We hope so. We are thinking of those folks out there. Thank you, Dr. Siegel. Coming up next, much of the mainstream media losing their collective mind after President Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleads guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Tower real estate deal in Moscow.</p><p>It's not good to lie to Congress. The markets shrugged it off. But Gregg Jarrett is here too to explain why it is not exactly the smoking gun against Trump as the media is trying to report that. We are going to stay on the story. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. President Trump blasting at his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, calling him weak and a liar after Cohen pleaded guilty to a single count of lying to Congress to minimize the president's role in efforts to build the Trump Tower in Moscow. It was special counsel Robert Mueller who brought the charges.</p><p>Let's bring in Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. He is the author of the bestseller book, \"The Russia Hoax.\" Gregg, a lot of speculation. What are the facts at this moment? What do we know?</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: We know it's not a crime to build a tower in Moscow. Trump is a real estate developer. He had an option and letter of intent. He scrapped the deal. To my mind, you know, if there really was some coordination or collusion or conspiracy with Russia to win the election and those connected to Trump Tower, Cohen would have been charged, but he wasn't.</p><p>He's charged as four other individuals who have been charged with what we know as process crimes. These are things that have occurred after the fact caused by Mueller's investigation itself. So if Cohen -- if Mueller had evidence of collusion, Cohen would have been charged and so others.</p><p>MACDONALD: That is the key silver bullet to what's happening here --</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: -- at this point in time, because we don't know what Robert Mueller is going to do down the road. Nobody -- if there was conspiracy or collusion, you're saying we would have seen those charges already?</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, against individuals at Trump's campaign.</p><p>JARRETT: The media and the left which is slightly redundant have promised that we would know by now all of the evidence of collusion, secret bank transfers and rendezvouses in Moscow and the bowls (ph) of the Kremlin between Trump and Putin and others, smoking gun, documents that would evidence this conspiracy to steal the White House. None of it has come to fruition.</p><p>MACDONALD: No conspiracy or collusion charges right now.</p><p>JARRETT: You know, collusion, first of all, not even a crime in a criminal code. You would have to find some other relevant statute. And so far, it appears that Mueller hasn't because of all of the people he has been charging, all of them are for the most part are tax fraud cases, money laundering or these process crimes, gee, you are not telling the truth to me.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Attorney Alan Dershowitz agrees with you that Mueller is -- he is saying Mueller is creating crime --</p><p>JARRETT: That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD: -- after the fact. And Trump says that even if Cohen's testimony were true, it would be perfectly legal for President Trump to be negotiating real estate deals while campaigning. It was a byproduct of him, running a business while campaigning.</p><p>JARRETT: Yeah, it's very much not only is it legal to talk to Russians building some real estate in Moscow, but it's also perfectly legal as in the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer to have a conversation with the Russians.</p><p>In fact, it is the title of one of the chapters in my book. It is not a crime to talk to a Russian. You can receive information from a Russian as long as money doesn't exchange hands. It's not a violation of the Federal Campaign Election Act. It's not conspiracy to defraud the government. All that is nonsense.</p><p>MACDONALD: But the media is basically bringing up that the president is not meeting with Putin over Michael Cohen when it's over Ukraine.</p><p>JARRETT: Exactly, you know, but, the media is on board with this collusion narrative. They think if they say the word \"Russia\" and \"collusion\" enough, the mere use of the term which connotes to crime will establish a crime -- it just doesn't under American law.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Let's move on to this story. The president apparently told The New York Post that a pardon for Paul Manafort is not off the table. What's your take on that story?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JARRETT: If it were me, I's pardon everybody. Just to vaccine anger, Robert Mueller and his team of partisans. This is the most lopsided, unfair, biased prosecution I have ever seen in my life and I have been a lawyer for almost 40 years. Mueller had conflicts of interest. Should never have accepted the job. Assembles a team of nothing but pro-Hillary, anti- Trump partisans.</p><p>Every move they have made the better part of 19 months now, have exhibited severe prejudice. So when Mueller comes out with his report, whether it's made public or not, Trump's legal team, Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani and others, will be publishing their counter report because as Professor Dershowitz has pointed out, Mueller's reports going to be one-sided.</p><p>His version of events from a prosecutorial point of view. He is not going to represent the others. Somebody has to. The lawyers for Trump have been preparing their own counter report, or you can read my book.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>JARRETT: And that needs -- in fairness to the president, that needs to be presented simultaneously.</p><p>MACDONALD: Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much for coming on. Will you come on again?</p><p>JARRETT: Yeah.</p><p>MACDONALD: As soon as that Mueller report comes out, we're going to call you.</p><p>JARRETT: I'm not holding my breath.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: Exactly. Great, Jarrett. You're terrific. Thank you so much. We're going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. OK, who said this? \"Europe is already crushed under this transformation that is taking place because of immigration. Germany - Angela Merkel, weakened because of it. And other places impacted, Italy - significantly impacted its politics by immigration.\" It's former Secretary of State John Kerry.</p><p>John Kerry may run in 2020. He is starting to sound a lot like President Trump. He certainly sounds like what Senator Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton have said in the past.</p><p>Let's take it up with New York Republican Congressman Tom Reed. Sir, great to see you. Your reaction to John Kerry.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK: Obviously a statement like that about immigration should be reflected in America's policy. We need a border, we need to secure our border and make sure that it's functioning. When you see the hypocrisy now of Secretary Kerry on the left demonstrating that they recognize this in Europe and not in America, that's a question that we should be asking as American citizens of our leaders.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Republican conservatives alike are humanitarian, they are pro-legal immigration. The Democrats continue to muddy and the media muddies this issue. It's not the first time Democrats have spoken against illegal immigration. Bill Clinton again, Barack Obama, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Dianne Feinstein. Your take on that.</p><p>REED: Yeah, Liz, you're absolutely right. I mean, we as Republicans, myself, firmly believe people should be able to come to America legally to enjoy the American dream. That's what's made us great for generations. The diversity is a strength, not a weakness. But you need a border that keeps us secure.</p><p>When you see an MS-13 gang member just recently arrested at our southern border trying to cross with this caravan that is coming up through Tijuana, that is a signal, that is a problem that needs to be fixed. I will just tell you, this hypocrisy on the left, it's good for Europe to control its borders, its good for Europe to control its immigration status and not for America, politics at play, not substance.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sir, are you pro-immigration?</p><p>REED: Yeah, I believe in immigration. I believe we should have a country that welcomes people to the American dream, but we have to do it in a smart, sensible manner that has structure such as walls, such as technology, such as people to keep us safe, our fellow American citizens safe and sound. That's the top priority, but have a border that also functions so that people can come and go in a way that is controlled.</p><p>MACDONALD: Congressman Tom Reed of New York. I wish I have more time with you, sir. We ran out of time. Come back soon. Great to see you.</p><p>REED: Always great to be with you, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you so much for having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018112901cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSKRWD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVK-8RD1-JB20-G51Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7239\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Evening Edit (formerly Risk &amp;

Frank[1] There was a press conference on Friday from the White House urging forced 5G small cell installation[2] about the U.S. needing to win the controversial 'Race for 5G[3].' There was no reference to the testimony provided by the Telecom Industry[4] in February that they could provide no scientific studies that proved 5G wireless technology was biologically or environmentally safe. [embedded content][embedded content] In fact, many scientific studies have already proven 5G is NOT safe[5]. That's why 200+ doctors and scientists have been demanding a moratorium on 5G installation[6] since 2017. President Trump mostly read from a script. He mentioned that 5G networks must be secured[7] - which according to most security experts[8] seems completely impossible. </p><p>[embedded content] He mentioned that The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been taking bold action - maybe bolder than they've ever taken - to ensure 5G would be installed all across the county, above ground and below[9], as well as in space[10]. Other speakers included FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, daughter, Ivanka Trump, and representatives from the rural farm community and the Telecom Industry. No one mentioned:The FCC is being investigated for collusion[11] with the Telecom Industry in regard to 5G[12]. The lawsuits that have been filed against the FCC about forced 5G installation (See 1[13], 2[14]). The federal bill introduced in January that would stop[15] the forced federal 5G installation. The growing number of municipal governments who are trying to stop 5G from being installed in their communities (See 1[16], 2[17]). The first 5G court case won[18] in England after residents became sick and women delivered stillborn babies.Research has also already determined that exposure to 1G through 4G[19] wireless radiation IS NOT SAFE EITHER. \ufeff Federal 'safety' standards[20] are 20+ years old and they DO NOT apply to the way we use or are exposed to wireless technology today. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is supposed to regulate the Telecom Industry and protect the public[21] even though it seems like they have been doing everything but for a really long time. (See 1[22], 2[23], 3[24], 4[25], 5[26], 6[27]) The U.S Day of Action against 5G[28] is on May 15.

We hope you have a good evening and join us tomorrow night. Good to see you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good evening, everybody. We're waiting for the President this hour to hold his news conference in the White House Briefing Room and we expect President Trump to give us an update on his administration's fight against the China virus and potentially take some questions from the assembled White House Press Corps. They get along so well, you know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We'll be bringing you the President's remarks nonetheless, just as soon as he takes the podium, and be sure to join us here tomorrow for my exclusive interview with President Trump. That's at 5:00 p.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network on LOU DOBBS TONIGHT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump today following through on a major pledge from his 2016 presidential campaign promises to protect American workers, to put an end to the abuse of the H-1B visa program.</p><p>President Trump signed an Executive Order at the White House today, that order bans Federal agencies from firing American citizens or green card holders from their Federal jobs and hiring foreign workers to replace them.</p><p>Today's action also orders a study to determine just how many Federal jobs are now held by foreign visa workers. President Trump today heard from a number of American workers, workers who were forced into the degrading, humiliating process of training their less qualified foreign replacements - - that's right -- H-1B visa workers trained by the workers they were replacing from the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned corporation that provides utility services to residents in seven states.</p><p>The TVA recently announced a plan to outsource 20 percent of its technology jobs to companies based overseas. Do you suppose anyone in the TVA knew who was President? That move threatens more than 200 highly skilled American technology workers in Tennessee alone.</p><p>President Trump was enraged, announcing that he is firing two of the board members and called for the Board to fire the company's CEO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The current CEO, Jeff Lyash is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year -- did you know that? Eight million. He is the highest paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>The Board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed Board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words, \"You're fired.\"</p><p>So with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another, either the Board is going to do, we're going to do it, but he's gone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, he ought to be gone, and he should have been long gone. Not long after that strong warning from the President, he was handed a note from Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. Here's what that note said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Mark just brought this in from the TVA CEO and he has indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: He is willing to reverse course, isn't that nice? He would actually -- well, you know, we couldn't get the same note, I'm sure from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We couldn't get it from the Department of Depends in all likelihood. It's good at least that the TVA's overpaid CEO, arrogant as he is, and as disloyal as he is to the U.S. worker, at least he understood that he should be a little flexible when the President of the United States is telling you to reverse course.</p><p>During that same roundtable discussion today, President Trump also learned of a $15 million contract given by the Tennessee Valley Authority to the French based tech firm Capgemini. Here's the President reacting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not a consulting -- that's one of the companies they're picking up and it's Capgemini and that's $15 million just for that one company.</p><p>TRUMP: How many -- how many are there?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture and Tech Systems that TVA is saying.</p><p>TRUMP: They are paying a tremendous amount.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And our workers are very tight.</p><p>TRUMP: They're very political people. You know, that's a very political group of people. You just --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Really. That is now the --</p><p>TRUMP: Not to me. I don't care. I don't care who they are, but they are very political.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Very political. Their names have been on nearly every list of outsources in the country for 10 years. These are the same people who lobby day in and day out, spending millions of dollars to influence your elected representatives, whether they be congressmen or senators, and they are at it full time, and it is outrageous.</p><p>Outrageous that anyone running any agency would think that he or she is entitled to replace an American worker with a cheaper foreign worker who the fired American must -- well -- train. Outrageous.</p><p>President Trump once again showing he is standing up to corporate interest and providing a straightforward defense of American workers every day.</p><p>All of the companies you just heard about, French based, Capgemini; Canada based, CGI. There's a beauty by the way, with a terrible checkered background, Irish based Accenture. It was, I believe it was part of the -- well, ill-fated Arthur Andersen Company flood around 15,000 H-1B visas into the United States every year -- 15,000. That is by the way, a conservative estimate 15,000 to 65,000.</p><p>Yet there are corporations on Wall Street and their lobbying groups that would have more foreign workers come into this country to undercut the future of millions of American workers and their families.</p><p>We asked the Business Roundtable for a statement on today's presidential Executive Order. They pointed us to a statement from June, which says in part, they are concerned that the administration's proposed changes to immigration policy will disrupt business operations, the lives of our employees and ultimately harm our ability to do our part to rebuild the economy.</p><p>This is the Business Roundtable along with the Chamber of Commerce -- are the globalist elites who really don't really give a damn about the American worker.</p><p>At a time when roughly 30 million Americans are collecting unemployment benefits, the Business Roundtable is sufficiently arrogant and indifferent to be concerned there won't be enough immigrants to rebuild the economy. I guess they haven't heard of robotics either.</p><p>These are ideas that are swirling around the swamp, and not just among the open border radical Dems. Republican Senator Mike Lee, oh yes, he is still pushing his outsourcing bill, he calls it the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act. You know, we can't get anywhere without a bunch of lower paid high skilled foreign workers.</p><p>The bill is backed, of course by Big Technology and their owner oligarchs and the outsourcing firms, a number of whose names you've just heard here.</p><p>It is estimated to clog green card lines for the next decade with hundreds of thousands of Indian and Chinese H-1B visa workers. Perhaps Senator Lee should take a listen once again to President Trump's warning for those who betray American workers.</p><p>President Trump's defense of the American worker today is sure to help his continued rise in the polls. Rasmussen now showing President Trump with a 51 percent approval rating. How good is that? Well, let's put it in context.</p><p>It is seven points higher than Barack Obama at the same point in his presidency. That is when he was running for reelection in 2012.</p><p>Meanwhile, supporters of China -- Joe Biden chief among them -- are fearful that the nominee for the party of hate might have to actually show up for a debate with President Trump. Whoa, you don't think that would work out so well for China Joe? Me either.</p><p>Bill Clinton's former White House Press Secretary, Joe Lockhart advised Biden in an op-ed saying this, \"Whatever you do, don't debate Trump.\" I haven't agreed with Joe about much, but he's got this one right.</p><p>Perhaps Biden's supporters are concerned about the former Vice President's -- well, so many things to be concerned about, but amongst them the enthusiasm levels of his supporters.</p><p>A new poll finds just 40 percent of Biden supporters are enthusiastic about China Joe. That compares to 68 percent of voters supporting President Trump. They are very enthusiastic about reelecting the President of the United States.</p><p>The President's surge in these polls coming as violence has exploded in Democrat-run cities all across America. This weekend, Minneapolis police were investigating the city's 41st murder of the year. That's nearly the double the number from the same period a year ago.</p><p>Radical Dem leaders in that city, they don't have any other kind by the way in Minneapolis, pushing the Police Department into submission. So far the department is now urging residents to cooperate with criminals in order to remain safe. My Lord. Don't you wish you lived in Minneapolis?</p><p>Recommendations from the Minneapolis Police -- what's left of them include being prepared to give up your cell phone and purse or wallet, to carry less cash because you don't want to share that either, do you?

To the criminals running the streets of Chicago, his life obviously does not matter and the organization pushing all of this nonsense, all of these organizations, do you want to open your eyes?

Stay with us, please.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now, Chinese national Li Chen has pleaded guilty to stealing trade secrets for China while working as a researcher at the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Her husband also charged, his case is pending.</p><p>Chen was accused of stealing U.S. funded research intellectual property to set up a company in China and transfer the research she stole to the Chinese government.</p><p>And Dr. Anthony Fauci weighed in last week, saying don't worry about China stealing our research and intellectual property. Everything is so transparent. What's the fuss all about? Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I don't think so at all. I think one of the things people need to understand that what we do is really transparent. We publish it. We announce it.</p><p>So if they want to hack into a computer, and find out what the results of a vaccine trial are, they're going to hear about it in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" in a few days, anyway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, as Dr. Fauci knows, it wasn't about the results of the vaccine, it was about the construction of the vaccine. And Anthony Fauci talking about everything is so transparent. Well, maybe it's about time everyone got used to the idea that we are now in a serious Cold War with the People's Republic of China, and it is time to understand that the Communist Chinese party is stealing hundreds of billions of dollars from the United States every single year.</p><p>This is not a game and it is not a set of benign elites at \"The New England Journal\" deciding what will be the outcome of that contest.</p><p>One top Federal Reserve official says the economy -- speaking of bizarre elites -- that we could all benefit from a four to six-week shutdown of the economy.</p><p>His name is Neel Kashkari. He is the President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, and he says economic recovery is possible if the Chinese virus is brought under control. Now, this is a member of the Federal Reserve. They don't even know how to run the Federal Reserve folks, let alone what is best for the economy.</p><p>He also says Congress could afford big spending on another China virus relief bill. The Fed, however, can't manage an economy, as I said, let alone our entire society. They can't even manage interest rates. So here we have the President of the Minneapolis Fed, holding forth on just what is best to forestall the pandemic. It's just unbelievable what the Fed produces.</p><p>President Trump today says he may use Executive Orders to help American families if the radical Dems continue to resist any kind of relief for hurting Americans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to Executive Orders and we're looking at that very seriously right now.</p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want -- they are slow rolling it and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical left governors and radical left mayors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And that is exactly what they want to do. Joining us tonight is Marc Short. He is Chief of Staff for Vice President Mike Pence, and it's great to see you, Marc.</p><p>You were present at the signing of the Executive Order today. We're used to a lot of outrages in the Federal government, but to have an $8 million a year, CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority deciding to replace workers, American workers with H-1B cheap labor. This is -- the outrage that must be felt across this country won't be even measurable. It's going to be off the charts.</p><p>MARC SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Well, Lou, thanks for having me back on. As you know, in 2016, Donald Trump campaigned and pledged to drain the swamp and I think that's what you're seeing evidence of today's action.</p><p>A lot of Americans don't even recognize the Tennessee Valley Authority programs set up during the FDR years. It is still around other than those who still get electricity in parts of the southeast from it, but the fact that somebody on a Federal government payroll is getting $8 million in compensation is outrageous to most Americans and Donald Trump has brought attention to it and said we're going to stop it.</p><p>But as you mentioned earlier in your show also, what we're going to do is to make sure that government agencies like that are not using H-1B visa programs to displace American workers.</p><p>And so by shining light on it, it shows exactly what this President promised when he said he was able to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely. And it is -- to me, it's just dismal that the Federal government has never kept track of who is in its workforce. We don't know how many contractors there are -- I've never seen the number. I have never seen the number of people being outsourced in this country from the labor market to cheap, foreign -- to cheap foreign labor markets.</p><p>It's really stunning what the Federal government doesn't know about itself and about the country, and I hope as a result of this, we'll know how many visa workers are employed by the Federal government. Again, this President thinks of things no one else does. Hopefully, we can have a quick response.</p><p>SHORT: Well, again, it's why they elected a businessman to come in and to help create seven million jobs for Americans in his first three and a half years before the pandemic. It's why they trust him to rebuild our economy again, and it's because he's going to help make sure that American workers are placed first. That's what his campaign promise was. It's what he's delivered on. It is what he will keep doing as the President of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: And the visa sponsors, they're led by Google, Amazon, TCS, Facebook, Apple. We've got all sorts of this. These are the Big Tech, Silicon Valley. The President has said we've got to bust it up.</p><p>He has talked about it throughout the first three years, three and a half years of his presidency. Where are we? Because we really do need to do precisely what the President said. We watched the three top CEOs of the three major technology companies make $250 billion in additional market cap within one day of being on Capitol Hill being grilled by the radical Dems.</p><p>I mean, it is stunning stuff what we're permitting in this country?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Lou, I think that our concern is less how much value they are creating or earning from a private sector perspective, but it is a concern, as you mentioned before, about censorship and how many of these companies really more or less have a monopoly on information flow.</p><p>And I think there's been a lot of attention from conservative organizations brought to Google search engines and whether or not there's an inherent bias.</p><p>And as you know, the President signed the Executive Order back in May, asking the Attorney General to develop legislation to come forward and look at ways to protect Americans, so the information they are getting on online searches is legitimate as opposed to going through a bias filter.</p><p>And I think you'll be hearing more from the administration in the coming days on it.</p><p>DOBBS: This -- the violence that has seized these Democrat-run large cities across the country, the President has stepped forward, his Operation Legend working in, I believe, it's now five cities. But we're watching a Democratic Party that is not only the party of hate speaking rhetorically, they have become a party of hate in terms of letting young people be shot to death on their streets.</p><p>The explosion and violence since the Minneapolis death of George Floyd is outrageous, and we're hearing all of this money that's flowing to an organization called Black Lives Matter. Most of those deaths are black people who have been killed on the streets, say in Chicago, in Minneapolis, you name it.</p><p>SHORT: Lou, as you mentioned, the killing of George Floyd was a travesty, but what's happened in our inner cities is also a travesty. What we've seen -- you mentioned earlier on your show, the homicide increases in Chicago and New York.</p><p>Shockingly, there's been a double digit increase in homicide in 36 of our 50 biggest cities over the last few months and what you've seen, as you said, are these large inner cities that are run by roughly the Democratic Party and Democratic mayors that have turned a blind eye to the violence, and what we hear when the Vice President travels the country is those that are most upset and most asking for Federal support are actually African- American small business owners who are saying please protect my business. Please protect me from these rioters and looters.</p><p>And the reality is that while we all want to protect the First Amendment and make sure that the Right to Peaceably Assemble is protected, that doesn't constitute rioting, looting, violence, destruction of property, destruction and arson of churches, and that's where we're going to make sure, as this President said, we're going to step in.</p><p>If these mayors are unwilling to do it, this President is going to step in and make sure we protect the American people.</p><p>What we saw in the first three and a half years of this administration was the lowest unemployment rate ever for the African-American population of this country. This President put them first and foremost, we passed opportunity zones to make sure there's investment in those communities.</p><p>And sadly, what you're seeing in the name of protest is a destruction of a lot of the private property and frankly, businesses that are owned by African-Americans, and this administration is not going to tolerate it.</p><p>DOBBS: Marc Short, always good to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>SHORT: Thanks for having me.</p><p>DOBBS: Marc Short, Chief of Staff for Mike Pence.'</p><p>Up next, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance back at it. We will take that up right after these quick words.</p><p>DOBBS: Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance, fabricating more fraudulent accusations to go after President Trump. Vance coming up with the nonsense that the Trump Organization committed insurance and bank fraud as a pattern of financial misconduct in order to justify why he has been seeking subpoenas.</p><p>When will Attorney General Barr or perhaps Chief Justice John Roberts or the Judiciary -- we can't do much, I guess, with the state government of New York, that would be talking about nonsense -- but somebody needs to straighten all of this political combat out.</p><p>Joining us now is Larry Elder. He is host of \"The Larry Elder Show\" on the Salem Radio Network. Also the executive producer of the number one documentary in the entire world, \"Uncle Tom: Oral History of the American Black Conservative.\"</p><p>Larry, great to have you with us. I mean, here we have ...</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, SALEM RADIO NETWORK: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: ... Cy Vance trying to justify wanting to go after this President anyway he can. And people -- I mean, he's talking like he has -- that these are serious charges. This is frivolous. It's fraudulent. And he is a leftwing hack.</p><p>ELDER: Well, Lou, he is picking up on the mantle that was thrown down on Thursday by former President Barack Obama, who at John Lewis's funeral compared Donald Trump, believe it or not to Bull Connor.</p><p>Bull Connor is that Birmingham law man who in the 60s turned water hoses and six dogs on Civil Rights workers. He also compared President Trump to George Wallace, who famously stood in front of the University of Alabama and said segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump, as Marc Short has just said, presided over the lowest unemployment rates for blacks in history before the coronavirus pandemic shutdown. He expanded spending on historically black colleges. He wants to do something about the threat to unskilled workers in the inner city posed by unskilled illegal aliens.</p><p>If he is a racist, he needs to go back to racism school.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, it's absolutely a straightforward reality. This President has done more for African-Americans than any President in history, including -- Barack Obama. I mean, it's just stunning that he stood there in that church in Atlanta and lied through his teeth.</p><p>ELDER: I would say especially under Barack Obama. The black poverty rate increased under Barack Obama. The so-called wealth gap increased, and from a period of 2010 to 2013, black net worth fell a third, a full third under Barack Obama.</p><p>So Donald Trump has done far better for black people than Obama has ever done. It is not even close.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. And that's one of the reasons that blacks in this country are showing up in polls, 40 percent saying that they will vote for President Trump. That's a stunning margin.</p><p>ELDER: I think I've lost you, Lou. I really didn't hear the question.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I'm going to -- I'm going to back it up. We'll try it again. What do you think of the fact that 40 percent of blacks surveyed in this -- in the most recent poll said they will be voting for Donald Trump?</p><p>ELDER: I'm not sure it's going to be that high, but certainly, it's going to be much higher than the seven or eight percent that he got. I think it's going to be I think -- I think I've lost you again.</p><p>I think it's going to be at least twice what he got in 2016, if not more, and that'll be enough for Donald Trump to prevail at the presidential level. If he gets 20 to 25 percent of the black vote, it's all over for Mr. Biden.</p><p>DOBBS: All right, Larry Elder, it's always good to have you with us and I'm sorry that you lost me because that is the most fascinating thing, is to hear me all the time, Larry. Just joking.</p><p>Up next President Trump threatens the radical Dems with legal action over their efforts to steal another election.</p><p>And a reminder about my new book, \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever\" available for preorder now at thetrumpcentury.com, amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump speaking at the podium in the White House Briefing Room now. Here is the President.</p><p>TRUMP: It's currently off the coast of South Carolina heading northward to North Carolina. It is expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a Category 1 Hurricane. Very serious. A lot of water -- a lot of water coming from that storm.</p><p>I've already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and F.E.M.A.'s personnel -- and they are great. They are the job. They're already on the ground in all areas, every single area that we mentioned is covered.</p><p>Over the next several days. There's expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. We're working with each of those states, and in particular as it relates to F.E.M.A., the military, law enforcement, all of the different groups that are involved.</p><p>Storm surge and inland flooding are possible and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the state and local authorities. We're working with them. And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far. So, stay safe.</p><p>Next, let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus. We're beginning to see evidence of significant progress.</p><p>Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly six percent from the week before and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 to eight percent over that same period of time, an encouraging sign, very encouraging, I have to add that the virus is receding.</p><p>In hotspots across the south and west, we've seen slow improvements from their recent weekly peaks, Arizona's weekly case counts have dropped 37 percent. That's a tremendous drop and the governor and the state have done a fantastic job, down 37 percent. Texas down 18.7 percent. I was there a couple of days ago. And Florida 21.2 percent drop. So that's a tremendous job that they're all doing.</p><p>As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare-ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri, and I think you'll find that they're soon going to be very much under control.</p><p>Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates, under five percent: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming. So under five.</p><p>Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those states.</p><p>To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance, wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places, and to protect the elderly -- very, very important -- protect the elderly. It's much different.</p><p>The young children have very strong immune systems. We've learned how strong they are. But protect the elderly. The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. That's the average age.</p><p>It's important for Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want or certainly not a viable path forward and would ultimately inflict more harm that it would prevent.</p><p>As we're seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging, you have many places where we thought they were under control -- and doing a great job -- and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough invisible enemy.</p><p>Lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future, they just don't. It comes back, many times it comes back. The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially with respect to hospitals, learn more about the disease and develop effective treatments as we did in the United States. We're doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics.</p><p>Countries where there have been very significant flare-ups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan and also, as you probably heard in Hong Kong, they've had some very serious flare ups.</p><p>Japan has gone-- yes, a lot of -- six-fold flare-up, it's a lot, but they'll get it under control.</p><p>In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school with careful precautions. Ideally, we want to open those schools. We want to open them.</p><p>At the same time, we're placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment and medical interventions. Building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine, the vaccines are coming along incredibly well.</p><p>Today, I'd like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration, and the work that we've done. We are really taking an increased interest and we're seeing numbers that nobody can even believe in terms of percentage increase. It's telehealth for American patients.</p><p>The percentage increase is being worked on right now. But it's very, very significant, numbers that you would not even think possible. This has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA healthcare team, and it worked out really well.</p><p>We have a 91 percent approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we're doing. This is the first, it's the highest ever recorded. Now, telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA and it's becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens. You don't have to go to the doctor's office. You don't have to go to hospitals.</p><p>When the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience. And really they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes.</p><p>Today, I'm taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay. Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an Executive Order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent. We've done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we're doing on Medicine and medical and what we're doing. They can do things that you wouldn't believe that even a year ago or two years ago would not have been doable.</p><p>We're enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient and very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you.</p><p>The order builds upon a series of actions we've all taken to make telehealth available to all. We ensure that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost. That's no additional costs and co-payments can be waived for telehealth services.</p><p>We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices. And I will tell you that the favored nations clause that I've signed into existence -- nobody thought anybody would ever do that -- has a massive impact on prescription drug prices.</p><p>In addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, particular prescription drugs, but the favored nations clause is massive. For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 10 cents a pill, as an example, just as an example, and the United States pays $2.00 for the same pill, we get the same privilege and the same right as they do. We've never had that before. We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development. So the numbers are astronomical.</p><p>And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by Big Pharma, very big ads, very massive buy, but in the meantime, they're calling, they want to know if they can make a deal. And I say to people, the only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you and they understand that. I think our people understand that.</p><p>But in particular, when you look at the matching, you could call it matching or you could call it favored nations, call it whatever you like. It's a tremendous -- it's going to have a tremendous and I'm talking about 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent. That doesn't mean it goes to 10 cents as an example, but there's comes up and ours goes down.</p><p>And you have many, many countries where their numbers -- the numbers are so low. I mean, so low, and by that I mean much lower than the United States.</p><p>Another thing I'm doing is if a certain country like Canada -- Canada buys for very much less than the United States has bought. How they allowed this to happen, representatives of our country, standing at these podiums are in the Oval Office, how they allowed this to happen is just to me incredible.</p><p>We've been working on this for a long time. I've been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right? So, now a governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida is doing a great job. Our great Governor of Ohio or our great governor of any state can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada at sometimes 50 percent less. So we'll be buying from Canada.</p><p>Now what the drug companies are going to do, maybe they'll raise them, maybe they'll lower them or maybe they'll just give up and sell them to us directly, much cheaper.</p><p>So a lot of things are happening. Also the rebate, we have people that are very wealthy that nobody ever heard of them. Nobody knows who they are.</p><p>I guess in some cases, they can be pharmacies, in some cases, they are individuals. We're doing a rebate and the rebate goes to the people at the lowest price of drugs.</p><p>So we have a series of four things that we signed and you will see over a period of a fairly short period, drug prices are going to be tumbling down at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible.</p><p>We have in 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration. It was last year. Fifty one years, it went up. But that was just a small decline. This is a massive decline. This is a decline that nobody can believe.</p><p>I was called by senators. I was called by congressmen. Please don't do this. But Big Pharma doesn't mean anything to me other than we want them to do a great job. We want them to get their vaccines. We want them to do what has to be done.</p><p>So I think you're going to see drug price reductions over the next four or five or six months, probably take a little while to kick in that are going to be at numbers that you wouldn't believe.</p><p>But in the meantime, they called on Friday afternoon. They want to meet, see if they can do something else. They don't like favored nations clauses, I understand that.</p><p>We vastly expanded coverage allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services through telehealth, by the way, including Physical Therapy, Emergency Department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority.</p><p>We brought the substance abuse at least prior to the China plague, whatever you want to call it, we brought it down very substantially. Pediatric critical care and much more.</p><p>Thanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services. So a very, very big priority on telehealth.</p><p>As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help healthcare providers and hospitals expand their telehealth and they're all doing it. They're doing it gladly.</p><p>Prior to the epidemic, or the pandemic, whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it, but prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn't anything raging. And I guess one of the only good things that we've gotten out of this whole horrible situation is telehealth has been incredible.</p><p>And again, the increases are, you know, many hundreds of times greater than it was before. Do you have a number? It's like 2,000 percent or something like that. It's an incredible -- it's an incredible increase. You'll get the number, but it's -- I think they have it now finally, and it's really an incredible -- thank you, Kayleigh.</p><p>We work with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus. We cut red tape to allow many services to be conducted by phone rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular, 35 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services were over 3.6 million seniors did so over the phone.</p><p>So you're talking about 3.6 million seniors -- that's something -- 10.1 million Medicare beneficiaries have access care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic. So you're talking there 10.1 million people.</p><p>In April, over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than 0.1 percent in February. Those are part of the numbers that I think I'll have you get them, so this part you don't have to, you'll get the other -- the other section. Thank you.</p><p>So think of that. Compared to less than 0.1 percent -- 0.1 percent. That's an incredible number. So over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to -- so, it went from 0.1 percent to 43 percent. That's an incredible -- it's an incredible number.</p><p>The Executive Order I signed today will also expand healthcare access in rural America. We take care of rural America. It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure and we're working very hard with all of the people in government that are involved with the communications infrastructure so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access.</p><p>Additionally, revenue for rural providers vary significantly from month to month making it difficult for many to stay in business. Many, many are having a very difficult time to help fix this problem. My order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility, really great flexibility, and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients.</p><p>Furthermore, I'm directing the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission, we were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office just before I came up to the podium to form a Taskforce that will break down barriers to expanding rural healthcare.</p><p>This Order continues my administration's focus on rural healthcare. We allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas.</p><p>We allocated another $10 billion to 2,000 rural hospitals and more than 2,400 rural health clinics. We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements which took tremendous amounts of time, and these are people that have great reputations and great track records, for practitioners that serve on the frontlines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients.</p><p>We're also -- in terms of PPE ensuring that the state and local areas have the supplies they need. We've been supplying hospitals and cities and states. Governors helping governors at a number that nobody has ever heard of before with 15,440 nursing homes that have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment. They're very much stocked up. They're in great shape.</p><p>They all have the ventilators, all the ventilators they need. They have actually more than they need, and their equipment -- medical equipment -- is in very, very good shape. They are full.</p><p>My administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N-95 respirators, 85 million gloves and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide.</p><p>We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we've been talking about together on vaccines and treatments under Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting, most exciting.</p><p>Last week, we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. It had great results. This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia and those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along.</p><p>Hospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids such as dexamethasone that are used successfully in late stage illness. They've been very good.</p><p>We're also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies and that we're working on and that's a brilliant art. It's really an art. And we launched a national plasma drive last week. I was at the Red Cross building with the American Red Cross and 13 other healthcare organizations.</p><p>I urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov, coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today. We would really appreciate it. This really makes people better. But we need -- what we need is, we need that beautiful ingredient that you that got better seemed to have in your veins, you have to go to coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today. It will be tremendous. We really appreciate it if you do it because we're low. We are low. We can help a lot more people and it would be a terrific thing.</p><p>It'll take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative. It makes people better and you know you have something very special. You have something that knocked it out. So we want to be able to use it, so whatever you can do, coronavirus.gov.</p><p>As a result of improvements we've made in treatment for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85 percent from its April peak, 85 percent decline.</p><p>On vaccines, last week, we announced the $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSK to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine, 100 million doses. This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting.</p><p>We're supporting numerous companies that are doing very well or having wonderful results, and they are in final stages of testing.</p><p>There are now two vaccines in that final stage of clinical trials in America with a third vaccine likely to begin Phase 3 almost immediately.</p><p>And we have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies. These are great companies. These are companies that are not only well-known, they are well-respected, most importantly.</p><p>We are balancing speed and safety and we're on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year and we're mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we're ready immediately upon approval. We have our military lined up. It's logistics. It's all about logistics.</p><p>They deliver a lot of things including soldiers, but now there'll be doing vaccine. Our General is all ready to go and he is very excited and once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he will start the process. They will start the process and they'll get it out very, very quickly all over the country and maybe beyond if it works as we think it probably will.</p><p>By unleashing America's technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic and we will hopefully end it very quickly.</p><p>The therapeutics are very exciting to me where you can go into a hospital and whether it's through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody and they get better. That's something to me. It is very important. And we're doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccine.</p><p>So thank you all very much for being here. We'll take a couple of questions.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump in the White House announcing his Executive Order to improve rural access to health and telehealth care, updating us on the fight against the China virus.</p><p>Join us tomorrow night for my exclusive interview with President Trump right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>And a reminder of my new book, \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History,\" available for preorder right now at thetrumpcentury.com and amazon.com.</p><p>Thanks for being with us. Good night from Sussex.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2020080301cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HB-78H1-DXH2-6451-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002PUN</classCode><className>TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS221113 NUCLEAR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Labor and Employment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Deaths</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chicago</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This time trying to squeeze the President's former  personal attorney Michael Cohen over a business deal that never occurred.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We had a position to  possibly do a deal to build a building of some kind in Moscow.  I decided  not to do it.  The primary reason, it could have been other reasons but the  primary reason it was simple.  I was focused on running for President.   There would be nothing wrong if I did do it.  I was running my business  while I was campaigning.</p><p> There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won in which case I would have  gotten back into the business and why should I lose lots of opportunities.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  And disturbing new revelations about the threat posed to public  security and public health by the caravan massing at the U.S.-Mexico  border.  Hundreds of migrants reportedly known criminals carrying  potentially deadly infectious diseases.  We take up that report with former  FBI Intelligence officer Steve Rogers with us tonight.  </p><p> Also RINO lame-duck speaker, you remember him, Paul Ryan, he lost the House  for Republicans, he sabotaged candidates but none of that stopping him from  lecturing the Republican Party on who should be the party's next standard  bearer.  We'll tell you about his latest outrage here next.  </p><p> Our top story, President Trump on his way to Argentina tonight where he  will assuredly push ahead with his America First agenda.  While at the  summit the President will also sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping  to discuss the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries prior to his  departure for Argentina, the President addressed the prospects of a new  trade deal with China.</p><p> Soon after Air Force One left the tarmac, the administration announced the  President would be accompanied by White House trade policy adviser, Peter  Navarro.  At that meeting where Xi knew that the left wing business media - - get ready for this, they decided that at that moment the market was down  so they blamed -- that's right, Navarro showing up at the Xi dinner for the  markets losses.</p><p> Then the group at CNBC claimed upon Navarro's attendance at the Xi meeting,  stocks fail to their lows of the day.  The network also said then stocks  were trading higher but \"dimming hopes of a trade deal between China and  U.S. cap gains on Wall Street and then the market moved higher.  Of course,  and they didn't know what to say.  Here to take up the President's Trump to  the G20 Summit and what to expect from his meetings with globalist leaders,  Christian Whiton.</p><p> Former stated department senior advisor to the Trump and George W. Bush  administrations.  Christian, great to have you with us.  Let's start first  with China and the prospects of the deal.  This sounds like -- it sounds  like some advertising for some real disappointment for those who are  expecting the President to continue his tough policy position on trade with  China.  </p><p> MICHAEL WHITON, FORMER TRUMP STATE DEPARTMENT SENIOR ADVISER:  Yes.  It  also sounds like deja vu.  You know, we supposedly had a big deal with  China early in the administration at Mar-a-Lago and that was supposed to  lead to some wonders of trade.  Chinese didn't really do anything with it.   That fell apart.  And then earlier this spring, March, April, I think Larry  Kudlow went on T.V. and said the trade war was over.</p><p> Interesting.  They didn't want to call it that before.  And that there was  some deal.  The President looked at this deal and then decided to apply  sanctions.  I think again the Chinese are doing that, they're raising hype.   They're going to try and offer some framework and say we're serious this  time, trust us and just don't put the higher tariffs that are scheduled for  January 1 or the second or the third trench of big tariffs that the  President has offered.</p><p> But, you know, nothing really happens at the G20 and I don't think China is  going to fundamentally change its system over dinner.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Yes.  Over dinner nor has it shown any disposition to do so.  The  President himself putting the kibosh at -- on these reports what he would  likely style as fake news, that there would be some sort of framework come  out of this which is usually -- no offense, Christian, given your  background in the state department.  It sounds like typical gobbledygook  coming out of the state department that, you know, that it just means  nothing and really pretends nothing.  </p><p> WHITON:  Right.  Well, and then also could be coming out of the treasury  department.  And as you pointed out it's the left-wing financial press  saying what they -- they're hearing what they want to hear.  But if you  look at Xi Jinping having just crowned himself, he's in no mood to make  compromises either and it would be disastrous of course for President Trump  to make a compromise that undermines the hard work he's done.  </p><p> DOBBS:  You know, we've got all sorts of -- in this administration, we  actually have never-Trumpers within the administration who are working very  hard, I give you anonymous, the author of that anonymous op-ed in The New  York Times who's never been found out or at least identified publicly.   This is a -- this s a strange time.  And the President deciding today that  he's not going to meet with Vladimir Putin because of his aggression  against Ukraine.  What do you make of it?  </p><p> WHITON:  Well, here again we see the President is much tougher on Russia  than his predecessors.  Of course, the media still say he's soft on Russia,  they say he's friendly with dictators.  You know, Obama and his Secretary  of State John Kerry said they were going to get tough on Russia after  Russia invaded Ukraine.  The year after that in 2015, John Kerry goes head  and hand to hand in meet Vladimir Putin who keeps him waiting.</p><p> And then they chuck it up for four hours.  Trump has actually isolated  Russia.  He has armed Russia's opponents.  He has reacted significantly and  he doesn't get credit.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, you know who else doesn't get credit is Silicon Valley and  high-tech companies, big tech.  And their relationship with China and their  acquiescence it appears in politics in this country.  They're not standing  up supporting the President.  They're not trying to forcibly volubly stop  the theft, hundreds of billions of dollars by China.  Why not?  </p><p> WHITON:  Well, it's -- they see it to their financial benefit I assume.   Although I don't think in the long run it is.  You know, I don't think in  the long run it's good for Apple that they were not willing to help the FBI  unlock a terrorist cell phone but they are willing to help China sense with  the internet.  All across Silicon Valley they're complaining now that the  administration, that the government is finally looking at Chinese here who  are conducting industrial espionage.</p><p> Chinese nationals who are viewed as overseas Chinese by the Chinese  government, they are put under close surveillance, so are as students here  from China.  And they're used as assets and we're finally are getting to  the point where we're saying this is not good, this is being exploited by  our adversaries and will harm our security.  You know, if Silicon Valley  hot smart about this, send home the Chinese nationals, it would actually be  better long and they may have to pay Americans a few more bucks to do these  jobs.</p><p> But they'll save money in the long run because they'll keep their  intellectual property.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Yes.  And there would be more people who would be able to afford  Apple iPhone 10, it would be -- I think they would find to their advantage.   There's a new China study out from the Hoover Institution.  And I want to  read this part on the new China study saying beyond economic -- if we could  put that up, please.</p><p> Beyond economic espionage theft and forced technology transfer, China  captures much valuable new technology through its investments in U.S. high- tech companies and through its exploitation of the openness of American  university labs.  There is absolutely no, no vetting of students being  brought in from China.  These Chinese nationals are an important source of  that technology transfer.  Those are -- that's a nice expression for theft.</p><p> It is -- it is a calamity that's befallen this country.  And there is such  a willingness on the part of the leftist universities to continue this, 20  percent of most universities, major universities are going to international  students instead of Americans to begin with.  One has to ask why is that  and to -- and why -- who are they serving?  </p><p> WHITON:  Well, they're serving the needs of their administrators.  Of  course the professors are mostly left wing.  But the real -- the  mushrooming of staff of, you know, 18 vice chancellors for diversity and  gender studies at these universities, that's where the money is going to.   A new building, not actual education.  So yes, add to the ranks of  unpatriotic Silicon Valley types and universities and, you know who really  suffers are Asian Americans.</p><p> We've learned of course from this recent lawsuit that Harvard for example  has a quota on Asians that they're willing to accept.  And so they --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Asian Americans.  Asian Americans.</p><p> WHITON:  Exactly.  And so these Chinese who are here often being used as  assets by the Chinese government will pay full ride.  So they are pushing  Asian Americans who we ought to be training and ought to be giving  technical skills, not our adversaries.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Now, isn't it extraordinary? Asian Americans, citizens, are being  screened and international students, including Asians are being welcomed  with open arms as they -- as they help to maintain, if you will, those high  tuition levels for universities that for the most part are repositories of  left-wing indoctrination.  Christian Whiton, good to have you with us.   Thanks.  </p><p> WHITON:  Thanks, Lou.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Up next, with just a few weeks  left in Washington for this Congress, oh, they don't want to work too hard.   Five weeks remaining.  Just a little under that now.  Feckless lame-duck  speaker Paul Ryan using his remaining days, well, to just be an annoying  son of a gun.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES:  I think the Fed is by the way on the right track  normalizing.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Was that issue on the front of Donald J. Trump's mind?  </p><p> RYAN:  I think the immigration is just more on the front of his mind.  My  own view was, I would rather talk about the economy.  We don't want to have  a shutdown.  There's no -- I have no interest in doing that.  It makes no  sense.  He does create some hostility, Jim Acosta think Bob Mueller has  been left alone.  I think he's going to continue to be left alone.  But we  still ran on this better way agenda.  We put it in the place.  We put most  of these things into law.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  That man is absolutely delusional and self-absorbed.  Did I mention  that?  We'll take up the -- this ludicrous excuse for a speaker with Ed  Rollins when we come back.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  K Street owned RINO lame-duck Speaker Ryan says his former running  mate, do you remember the one who did so well in the 2012 presidential  elections?  That is incoming Senator Mitt Romney will soon pick up the on  obstructionist standard for the Republican Party left by John McCain.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> RYAN:  He feels a sense of civic duty.  I think with John McCain passing,  for example, Mitt believes that there's a role for him in our party, in  being, you know, a statesman and a standard bearer in our party.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  We've all been waiting for that.  You can tell that Paul Ryan has  been.  It must have slipped his -- well rather fragile mind that the  standard bearer of the party is the President of the United States for he  is the party's leaders and frankly its only hope.  Joining us tonight to  discuss all of this, top strategist for Great America PAC, former Reagan  White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst, Ed Rollins.</p><p> I have to say, I'm -- the Speaker continues to astound with his obtuseness,  his absolute delusion.  </p><p> ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well they don't -- they didn't believe  what Trump was advocating which is the conservative principles of the  Republican Party.  Romney didn't believe it, that's one of the reasons he  lost.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  He didn't believe in anything but Romney and Ryan doesn't believe  in anything but get lining his (INAUDIBLE) K Street.  These guys are owned  by the establishment.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  My great -- my great fear is that Romney is going to get in there  and when you've got two or three quote margins, anybody can play queen for  a day.  And Romney, you know, talking about him being the McCain of --  McCain basically destroyed the effort to get rid of Obamacare by one vote.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Basically he did it.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  And so we don't need another one.  We -- and it would have been  easy to elect somebody else in Utah.  Utah is not exactly a liberal  northeast state.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DOBBS:  It's getting more so though.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Yes.  But, you know, he was very insistent.  He wanted the  President's endorsement, the President was generous and did endorse him.</p><p> DOBBS:  And then he attacked the President.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Right.  And my sense is Mitt Romney gets out there and wants to  basically be the new John McCain, there are a lot of us that are concerned  that will go out there and attack him for whatever form we may have.  </p><p> DOBBS:  The Republican Party seems to be at an existential juncture.   You've got idiots like so many of those in leadership, in both the Senate  and the House who working against the President, actively and vigorously.   If they did their jobs with half as much energy, much could be done by the  -- by the Hill.  But they don't have that.  And they don't have -- you  know, frankly, I can't even imagine why there is such a thing as a  Republican Party right now because you're watching this kind of nonsense.</p><p> Mitt Romney coming in, Paul Ryan going out.  All of it -- all of it is so  unfortunate.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, unfortunately Paul Ryan is not going away.  Paul Ryan is  going to be there somewhere.  He has an ambition to be President some day.  </p><p> DOBBS:  You know what he's going to do.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Yes.  Well, he will be.</p><p> DOBBS:  He's got to line his pockets.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  For a while and then he'll go back to politics in Wisconsin and  run for governor or run for something else.  </p><p> DOBBS:  So what's the Republican Party going to do because they look like  damn fools.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, the Republican Party today is Donald Trump.  If you don't  like that then go find another party because the vast majority of Americans  say they're self identify as Republicans overwhelmingly, even more than  when I worked for Ronald Reagan are Trump supporters.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Yes.  Trump supporters have got to be scratching their heads  tonight.  Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state has just hired a never- Trumper, a pro-China mad fanatic free trader at any cost to America, Mary  Kissel.  I mean, how does she get hired?  </p><p> ROLLINS:  I have no idea.  I'm shocked by it.  I like May personally, I've  been in many shows (INAUDIBLE) but she is not a Trump person.  She doesn't  believe in the policies that the President advocates.  And for her to be  going in as a senior advisor the Secretary of State to me is astonishing. </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, let's look at a couple of things that we're talking about.   She call for example, the Helsinki Summit with Putin and the President a  great propaganda victory for Putin.  Call Trump -- the Trump  administration's aide to farmers.  A taxpayer solution to a government  problem.  Criticize the President for cancelling military exercises with  South Korea.  It goes on and on.  She is just -- just doesn't make a lick  of sense.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  And why she is there is, you know, there are enough never-Trumpers  and Bush establishment types that permeate the government as well as of  course Obama leftovers.  What the hell are they thinking? </p><p> ROLLINS:  With the two years left in this administration, this term, and  get ready for a reelection campaign, you've got to make sure your people  are loyal to you and believe in what your policies are.  And I was still in  the White House --</p><p> DOBBS:  So what is Mike Pompeo thinking ?  </p><p> ROLLINS:  I have no idea.  I mean, someone should have said to him no,  thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  You cannot have it.  I want to give  you a rational or you can have.   All you have to do is go read her  columns, go read her tweets.  She's been very public about this.  And  again, she's a nice person, articulate person but not a Trump person.  </p><p> DOBBS:  The previous secretary of state for this administration did the  same thing and got his tail kicked.  This one, it looks to me, deserves the  same response by the White House.  I can't think imagine why it's not  happening.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  The President or someone will have a heart to heart with him and  saying this is the most important thing.  We're going to be doing in the  next two years, our foreign policy stuff and this is my policy.  I want  people over there to advocate my policy.  The state department is hard to  move forward on anybody's agenda but their own.  So --</p><p> DOBBS:  You know, the great thing is this President is moving things by  himself.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Right.</p><p> DOBBS:  This is the man driving the North Korea engagement, he is also  driving the new doctrine against China and, frankly, as a Christian Whiton  pointed out, this President has been far tougher, for example, than his  predecessors against the nonsense of Vladimir Putin.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, I would hope our good friend John Bolton would basically  step in and do something on this -- on this front.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, and thank goodness that John is there.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Absolutely.  I agree.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Ed Rollins, as always.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p> DOBBS:  Good to have you here.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p> DOBBS:  Congressman Jim Jordan bowing out of the race to be the ranking  member of the House Judiciary Committee.  Jordan's spokesman saying this,  \"it has been made clear to him that leadership is going to be selecting  someone else\".  Of course Kevin McCarthy is a, you know, a mini me of Paul  Ryan, establishment hack.  There remains a possibility Jordan could  challenge Mark Meadows, talking about an extraordinary development for the  ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.</p><p> I wouldn't bet on that either with Kevin McCarthy following in Paul Ryan's  footsteps.  And by the way, I'm sure following this guidance of the same K  Street masters as did his predecessor.  </p><p> Be sure to vote in the poll tonight.  Do you believe RINO Paul Ryan will  soon join the Democratic Party where he is belonged throughout his  political career?  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on  Twitter @LouDobbs, and like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram  @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p> Up next.  The left-wing national media has their hair on fire over Michael  Cohen's new plea deal with the special counsel.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's Shakespearean because somebody who said he would  take a bullet for Donald Trump is now pointing the gun at him.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today is a good day for Donald Trump to resign.  I  really believe that.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a rational explanation for why he was so pro- Putin.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What this represents is the possibility of something  very simple, that there was money in it for Donald Trump.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The plea today by Cohen tells us that there is a  financial connection here.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Michael Cohen could be the most -- single most  terrifying person for Donald Trump.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  Oh, yes.   Frightening.  Scary.  Oh boy.  Washington Times  columnist Tammy Bruce joins me right after the break to take that up as  well as the latest in the Mueller witch-hunt.  All of that evidence that  they've built over the course of two years, it's just astonishing, isn't  it?  No wonder the President -- well, we'll take that up next.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Breaking news now.  President Trump will not be meeting with  Russian President Putin during the upcoming G20 Summit in Argentina.   President Trump tweeted out his decision earlier today citing growing  tension between Russia and Ukraine.  Russia hasn't yet released the  Ukrainian vessels and sailors that it seized last week in the Black Sea.  </p><p> President Trump slamming the Mueller witch-hunt again this morning in a  series of tweets calling the probe illegal, ridiculous and a disgrace.  All  of which were true.  We'd like to add it it's simply pathetic.  In addition  to working out a plea deal with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen who has  zero information about the President's alleged Russia collusion because  there is none.  Mueller no focusing on late-night calls between the  President and Roger Stone.</p><p> That's what he has been reduced to in this.  Mueller is trying to squeeze  author Jerome Corsi, a journalist and conservative who said he will file --  he will be filing a criminal lawsuit against Mueller.  Mueller is  absolutely -- his tactics have blown up in his face since Trump campaign  manager Paul Manafort reached a plea deal and we'll see how that works out.  </p><p> Joining me now to take up the President's upcoming G20 Summit, the impact  it could have on the United States, China and Russia relations, Tammy  Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Great to have  you with us.  I've got to start with Ryan.  Can you imagine this -- I mean  the words fail me.  He is such an ignoramus that it is -- it's unspeakable  what the Speaker is.  </p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's remarkable.  His -- and I  think he's serious when he expresses as a kind of -- a genuine shock at why  they would have lost the midterms and not knowing why that would happen.  I  do think, though, that he's not necessarily a dumb man.  I think he knows - - </p><p> DOBBS:  Oh, I think he is.  I think you're -- I think you're -- I think  you're very safe to go there.  </p><p> BRUCE: He -- a lot of Republicans wanted this kind of a punch at the  president.  I don't think that they necessarily mind losing the House  because now the --</p><p> DOBBS:  Republicans?</p><p> BRUCE:  I think they don't mind the Democrats being in charge and leading  the chart.</p><p> DOBBS:  Who's they?</p><p> BRUCE:  The Republicans in the -- in the House.</p><p> DOBBS:  You mean the --</p><p> BRUCE:  I mean, the leadership.</p><p> DOBBS:  The leadership?</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes.  Well, certainly not all of them, the Freedom Caucus but not.   But I think that --</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, they're complete idiots then and they should lose, they  should be then disbanded.</p><p> BRUCE:  Well it's -- they're the managers of the monster.  I think this  argument that there's partisanship in Washington is a fraud.  I think that  that's theater for the -- for the Hoipolloi in the country.  And that this  is really about -- you know, pulling the wool over our eyes and getting the  man --getting the monster to be as plump as it can be and managing it while  pretending to really be conservative or liberal.  That's what I think the  Republicans have been doing for quite some time.</p><p> DOBBS:  The Republican Party, the establishment wing of that party.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p> DOBBS:  The vast -- the vast number of Republicans, I think you're right.   There is a little problem though, you've got a guy by the name of Donald  Trump who's president of the United States who ran against his  establishment.  In point of fact, he's running against every one of those  idiots in the Republican parties who are really Democrats posing as  Republicans, I think you're right in that construction.  But this president  is right now, he is harvesting -- you know, these seeds of anti- establishmentarianism that he's been planning throughout the country for a  several years now.  This is a real war.</p><p> BRUCE:  It is.</p><p> DOBBS:  It's a fight that I hope the president doesn't ever get tired of  waging, because so much depends on his strength, his leadership and the  weakness of these fools.  I mean, there's no other expression for what a  Paul Ryan is.</p><p> BRUCE:  There is a sentiment I think that --</p><p> DOBBS:  And Kevin McCarthy by the way is coming in right behind him.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes. </p><p> DOBBS:  The same -- he's the same (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BRUCE:  The president would be making a mistake and I'm sure that people  are telling him that the fight would be over after the midterms.  Everyone  will settle down and it will not, because the fight for the establishment - -</p><p> DOBBS:  Who told you that? (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BRUCE:  I'm sure some advices are.  Well and other advisors within the  establishment probably are telling him that, when in fact they know as you  are correct, this is a long-term fight, this is not just about this term or  this presidency, this is about whether or not the Donald Trump attitude,  the new GOP would survive and it's a GOP that would be led by a man of  action, Donald Trump with ideas that would help the American people, where  management of the monster is no longer acceptable.  That we've got to cut  it down and really have government work for the people.</p><p> DOBBS:  Do you think the American people have got the stomach for it?</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, we're the American people who defeated the British when  everyone said we couldn't.  Look at what we've accomplished from the  beginning.  We are so --</p><p> DOBBS:  But that was on last -- that was on last week.</p><p> BRUCE:  We are even more -- I think being revolutionary is in our DNA.   We're even more committed to making sure that this experiment works because  we are a relatively young country.  Our generations will make it work, it's  not going to fail on our watch, I can tell you that right now.</p><p> DOBBS:  OK, and I'm going to say I hope the heck you're right.  Tammy  Bruce, always good to have you.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you, Lou.</p><p> DOBBS:  Thanks so much.  After calling for a free Palestine at the United  Nations the destruction of Israel, CNN finally cut ties with Marc Lamont  Hill, while his comments were polarizing for the -- for CNN.  It's  apparently just remarkable that his other employer might keep him on the  job.  You see, Hill also is a professor of Temple University and they say  quote, his views are his own, no problem for them that he is anti-Israel  and calling for the destruction of the country, incredible.</p><p> Up next, critical health concerns now involving more than a third of the  6,000 migrants crammed in a Tijuana Mexico Sports Complex.  We take it up  with Trump 2020 advisory board members Steve Rogers right after this quick  break.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  On Wall Street, stocks closing lower slightly, barely.  The Dow  down 28 points, the S&amp;P lost six, the NASDAQ down 19.  Not bad since the  NASDAQ yesterday was up 200, the Dow up more than 600.  Volume on the big  board backing down to 3.5 billion shares from 3.9 yesterday.</p><p> Crude oil up nearly two percent, $51.00 a barrel.  Gold close flat, silver  down nearly half a percent, copper lost nearly a percent.</p><p> And a reminder, listen to my reports three times a day, Coast to Coast on  the Salem Radio Network.</p><p> Disturbing news tonight out of Tijuana, 6,000 migrants crammed into a  Sports Complex there.  More than a third of them are being treated for  health-related issues, more than 2,200 medically treated, more than 60  percent with respiratory infections.  And 101 cases -- 101 cases of lice,  four cases of chicken pox, serious concerns about the prospect of hepatitis  because of the unsanitary conditions in which they're living.  Other  concerns also being outlined by the Department of Homeland Security, they  have identified now more than 600 criminals and gang members that are  travelling in that Caravan.</p><p> Joining me tonight to talk about the growing crisis on our border, security  concerns in the president's fight to build a wall of course, Steve Rogers.   A Trump 2020 advisory board member, former Navy lieutenant commander and a  former FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force member.  Steve, great to have you  here.</p><p> STEVE ROGERS, ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, TRUMP 2020:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p> DOBBS:  Let's start with that Caravan, the president doing the right thing,  securing the border.  He's being attacked as he is always no matter what he  does, by the establishment, by the left, by the right, by the Wall Street,  Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce and then of course, Chuck Schumer  and all of his buddies.</p><p> ROGERS:  Lou, after 9/11 as a military Intel officer, I was assigned the  FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and we were watching, we were gathering  intelligence and information about that border.  And we had concerns back  then, way back then who's crossing the border.  Of course our concern was  somebody would bring a dirty bomb across that border but we knew, we knew  there was a drug cartel, we knew there was human trafficking.  Nothing was  done until Donald Trump became President of the United States.</p><p> DOBBS:  He's the first president and first presidential candidate to speak  openly about the drug cartels and their role in corruption not only in  Mexico but at the border on -- by the way, the American people are coming  to the realization that corruption south of the border means there's  corruption to the north of the border.  And we're not doing nearly enough  to fight that either.</p><p> ROGERS:  And he's delivering on his promise that he would protect the  American people.  When you hear about 600 gang members this week, a gang  member from MS-13 was arrested, I mean, my goodness how many did we not  catch?  So when he talks about protection he meant it and he's delivering.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, and by the way, MS-13 gang members are throughout the country  for crying out loud.  And this is the first president to actually do  something about it.  His Justice Department making headway, one of its few  public at least accomplishments to this point.</p><p> The Cohen guilty plea, your reaction to what the left-wing media is making  of it.  Here's a business deal that was never done and now the great -- I  mean, you list -- I don't know if you saw the clips that we had of the  left-wing media just going nuts, there's no deal.</p><p> ROGERS:  Lou, when I was doing investigations of police work and had a  witness a so-called witness changed his story a dozen times.  How do you  believe him, why do you believe him?  Look, Michael Cohen's out to save his  own hide, and if he thinks he's going to save his hide on the back of the  president United States, well, he's got another story coming his way.</p><p> DOBBS:  The president's saying he's going to play tough with Democrats if  they continue to frustrate him and attack him.  That he's going to release  some documents that they will find very disturbing, the documents about  them.  What do you make of this, the promise, the threat however you would  start.</p><p> ROGERS:  I believe that he knows what's in those documents, timing is  everything.  I know he cares for this country and I know that perhaps he  doesn't want to do damage to the country even though it's the Democrats.   He cares about our country but if he has to use those documents to defend  himself, go ahead.  You know what Lou, the American people despite what the  polls say, I'm out there, they support this president, they value his  judgment.</p><p> DOBBS:  You know, I'm troubled by a number of reports that are coming out.   One is that there would be a framework of a deal that he might reach with  and this may be driven by Chinese propaganda in this country, that he might  come up with a framework that would be satisfactory for a while and defer  tariffs rather than continue with the tariffs and stay tough with them.  </p><p> And by the way, if that were the case there would still be the matter of a  half a trillion dollars in stolen American intellectual property each and  every year.  These are disturbing reports and they're being driven in some  measure by -- I'll call them what they really are, they're never Trumpers  and establishment RINO Republicans within his own administration.</p><p> ROGERS:  Well let's look at that let's look at what the president has done  already.  He has never compromised on the security of this country, never.   And I believe that he's going to be driven by that even with this issue in  China.</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, I think you're exactly right and I have to wonder though when  we look at this Mary Kissel appointment a never Trumper.  I read the -- to  the audience a number of the -- of the tweets her absolute pro-China, pro- fanitical actually, free-trade beliefs and her attacks on the president.   What in the world is Mike Pompeo thinking of and why -- how could you even  rationalize this?</p><p> ROGERS:  Well, difficult for us to rationalize it but I got to tell you, I  trust the judgement in to president and I'm sure he is going to make sure  she or anyone else supports his policies, he's the boss not Mike Pompeo, no  one else, he's the President of the United States.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, I think that may be a news break for Mike Pompeo based on his  most recent hire.</p><p> ROGERS:  Well --</p><p> DOBBS:  Thank you so much, Steve.  Great to have you here, Steve Rogers.</p><p> A new report from the Center for Disease Control shows life expectancy in  this country has declined for the second time in the past three years.  The  average life expectancy last year fell to just over 78-1/2 years old.  The  CDC says an increase in drug overdoses and suicides in this country are to  blame for this alarming trend.</p><p> Last year nearly 70,000 people died from drug overdoses, a 10 percent  increase from the previous year.  Last year more than 47,000 suicides up  from the 45,000 in the previous year.  Overall, nearly three million people  in this country died last year at 70,000 more deaths than in the previous  year.</p><p> Up next, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling Congress his company doesn't  sell your data, that doesn't mean they don't try or that they really don't.   Really, what does it all mean?  We take it up after the break with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He joins us here next stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Internal e-mail show Facebook considered profiting by selling  companies access to your personal data.  The e-mails reviewed by The Wall  Street Journal also suggests Facebook employees talked about pushing some  advertisers to spend more and return for increased access to user data.  </p><p> Joining me now to take up what is going on in Silicon Valley and big tech,  to take up Facebook and the company's growing struggles, and the increased  cyber threats from Russia, from China, and Iran, Former Senior Adviser in  the State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program, former Law  Enforcement Adviser to the RNC and cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.   Morgan, great to see you.  I want to compliment you on your recent op-ed in  the Hill -- </p><p> MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Thank you.</p><p> DOBBS:  -- in which you said point-blank that high-techs globalism is  killing patriotism in this country.</p><p> WRIGHT:  Absolutely. </p><p> DOBBS:  This is right now it seems to me the prospects for regulating out- of-control technology companies with huge, huge economic concentration in  power this time may be right.  What are your -- what are your thoughts? </p><p> WRIGHT:  That's why Sarbanes-Oxley came about, Lou.  And you know those  things that led up to that you know, Adelphia, Tyco, Enron.  Pretty soon  the government said, hey, we're not going to take this anymore and so you  go through litigation, you sue, you go through regulation like with the SEC  and the FCC and the FTC.  And then pretty soon it's like OK, Congress goes,  we've had enough of this, we're going to pass a law and now it's going to  be you know codified and your guys are going to -- and people went to jail,  Lou.  People went to jail with Sarbanes-Oxley. </p><p> So you know, what we're going to find out is that I think this issue of  privacy is I think is the watershed moment where we start listening at  what's happening in the E.U. with his seven countries that have filed  against Google for tracking them, the issue of privacy, Facebook you know,  Cambridge Analytical.  This all has to come to a head sometime and I think  2019 is going to be the year for it. </p><p> DOBBS:  You know, it's a hell of a note when the Europeans have more  impressive laws protecting consumers, protecting our personal data than  does the United States.  It's incredible me that we are -- have lag to this  far and given high tech such a pass.  I want to just turn to a specific  issue and that is Google.  Do you -- Pichai is going to be talking before  the -- </p><p> WRIGHT:  Finally, finally. </p><p> DOBBS:  Finally, he'll be talking to Congress.  Meanwhile, he's doing  business with China.  That's -- it's an extraordinary mess.  There's just  no constraint and apparently no effort to bring -- to rein in Google and  its absolutely pro-Chinese policies which are effectively the result is  anti-American. </p><p> WRIGHT:  Look, and that's why the one of the reasons I wrote the op-ed --  and look my father was a World War Two vet, he was also a Vietnam vet.  I  mean, there were people that -- you know, we've lost a lot of people in  defense of freedom to fight people like what China has become.  And what  has happened is we lack this patriotism.  Now, it's OK to have America  first.  We can still have a view of the world.  But in that op-ed that I  wrote in the research that I did, I found out that 47 percent of these CEOs  believe in globalism.  They believe the broader, they believe the world  should profit first before -- and be taken care of before the United  States, but yet they built their businesses on the opportunities that came  from the United States. </p><p> DOBBS:  That's right. </p><p> WRIGHT:  And I think Google is opening up, the AI the artificial  intelligence center in Shanghai and they go, it's going to be a vibrant  place.  Well, guess what, in China nothing gets built there that doesn't  get shared with the military, yet they turned our military down and threw  them to the curb on Project Maven on using artificial intelligence so we  could save soldier's lives and save other civilians lives so they don't  become collateral damage and yet where's the outrage on that?</p><p> They were more concerned about Project Maven than they are the censored  search engine that Google is defending still to this day.  They say they're  not building it but they haven't thrown it to the curb yet either. </p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, and meanwhile we're watching Chinese companies continue their  advances here, the front companies that are carrying out espionage 20  percent of place is reserved for foreign students and our universities.   You can mark it any way you want it is a zero-sum game.  That means 20  percent of those seats didn't go to an American student and there is no  discussion whatsoever, no public policy about what is occurred by most of  these universities that are left-wing driven, they are left-wing  indoctrination centers. </p><p> And we're looking at statistics now in surveys showing the millennial --  the millennial generation is the product of that indoctrination process in  our public schools and on our education.  </p><p> WRIGHT:  Yes.  During a congressional hearing, FBI Director Wray talked  about the Confucius Institutes to what China's putting all this money.  He  talked about that this is simply a front for the Chinese government to  commit espionage, to commit the theft of intellectual property.  60 percent  of the foreign students in the United States now are Chinese.  We have them  in some of the most sensitive programs getting PhDs and things around  material science and artificial intelligence.  </p><p> And guess what, all of that's going back to China along with the forced  transfer of Technology if you want to do business in China, you got to play  by their rules.  Hey, if they want to do that that's fine.  I think we  ought to do the same thing to Huawei and ZTE and all the other Chinese  companies who want to sell stuff in the United States. </p><p> DOBBS:  And this President relented with President Xi.  </p><p> WRIGHT:  Unfortunately on Huawei, he did.  Absolutely. </p><p> DOBBS:  And that's got to be reversed too because what is happening is it  is -- it's just unthinkable that we're letting this happen to this great  country and this president is responsible for driving these policies that  will preserve the republic one hopes.  Morgan Wright, always good to have  you with us.  Thanks so much. </p><p> WRIGHT:  Thank you, sir.</p><p> DOBBS:  And I think I should be very clear to all why it is that the  establishment is represented by the leadership of the Republican Party, the  Democratic Party, the Wall Street, the Koch Brothers are having a fit as  this President's policies move us -- move us forward.  They can't stand it  because they know they're going to have to give up their globalist interest  in favor of America first.  Well, Morgan Wright, always good to have you  here.  </p><p>Broward County residents will foot -- be footing the bill for Brenda Snipes  election antics even after she leaves office.  You aknow, some would call  them antics, some would call it fraud.  Starting in January, Snipes will  receive a total of $130,000 a year in pensions.  Residents of Florida will  be paying for her incompetence for years and years to come for a job well  done, of course.  </p><p> Up next -- well, you know what?  I'm going to surprise you on the side.   We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Breaking news and it is highly unexpected news from the Republican  Party.  House Freedom Caucus Co-Founder Jim Jordan will indeed become the  Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee.  (INAUDIBLE) is saying the  Steering Committee voted unanimously in Jordan's favor.  North Carolina  Congressman Mark Meadows who had expressed interest in the same job  celebrated the decision saying this is one of the few times that he can  take real pleasure in the success of Mr. Jordan.</p><p> A remind tore vote in tonight's poll.  Do you believe RINO Paul Ryan will  soon join the Democratic Party where he has belonged throughout his career?   Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  </p><p> That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Author and  journalist Jerome Corsi and the President of the Center for Security Policy  Fred Fleitz among our guests tomorrow.  Please join us.

Our top  stories, President Trump due to land I in about an hour.  Taking with him  his America First message of free and fair trade to the summit of G20  leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping who is feeling the full  source of Trump policy and American tariffs.  We'll talk about the  President's efforts to save American jobs, to stop Chinese theft of  American intellectual property with former state department senior adviser  Christian Whiton.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also tonight, the out of control Mueller witch-hunt has reach new depths of  pathetic desperation.  This time trying to squeeze the President's former  personal attorney Michael Cohen over a business deal that never occurred.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We had a position to  possibly do a deal to build a building of some kind in Moscow.  I decided  not to do it.  The primary reason, it could have been other reasons but the  primary reason it was simple.  I was focused on running for President.   There would be nothing wrong if I did do it.  I was running my business  while I was campaigning.</p><p>There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won in which case I would have  gotten back into the business and why should I lose lots of opportunities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  And disturbing new revelations about the threat posed to public  security and public health by the caravan massing at the U.S.-Mexico  border.  Hundreds of migrants reportedly known criminals carrying  potentially deadly infectious diseases.  We take up that report with former  FBI Intelligence officer Steve Rogers with us tonight.  </p><p>Also RINO lame-duck speaker, you remember him, Paul Ryan, he lost the House  for Republicans, he sabotaged candidates but none of that stopping him from  lecturing the Republican Party on who should be the party's next standard  bearer.  We'll tell you about his latest outrage here next.  </p><p>Our top story, President Trump on his way to Argentina tonight where he  will assuredly push ahead with his America First agenda.  While at the  summit the President will also sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping  to discuss the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries prior to his  departure for Argentina, the President addressed the prospects of a new  trade deal with China.</p><p>Soon after Air Force One left the tarmac, the administration announced the  President would be accompanied by White House trade policy adviser, Peter  Navarro.  At that meeting where Xi knew that the left wing business media - - get ready for this, they decided that at that moment the market was down  so they blamed -- that's right, Navarro showing up at the Xi dinner for the  markets losses.</p><p>Then the group at CNBC claimed upon Navarro's attendance at the Xi meeting,  stocks fail to their lows of the day.  The network also said then stocks  were trading higher but \"dimming hopes of a trade deal between China and  U.S. cap gains on Wall Street and then the market moved higher.  Of course,  and they didn't know what to say.  Here to take up the President's Trump to  the G20 Summit and what to expect from his meetings with globalist leaders,  Christian Whiton.</p><p>Former stated department senior advisor to the Trump and George W. Bush  administrations.  Christian, great to have you with us.  Let's start first  with China and the prospects of the deal.  This sounds like -- it sounds  like some advertising for some real disappointment for those who are  expecting the President to continue his tough policy position on trade with  China.  </p><p>MICHAEL WHITON, FORMER TRUMP STATE DEPARTMENT SENIOR ADVISER:  Yes.  It  also sounds like deja vu.  You know, we supposedly had a big deal with  China early in the administration at Mar-a-Lago and that was supposed to  lead to some wonders of trade.  Chinese didn't really do anything with it.   That fell apart.  And then earlier this spring, March, April, I think Larry  Kudlow went on T.V. and said the trade war was over.</p><p>Interesting.  They didn't want to call it that before.  And that there was  some deal.  The President looked at this deal and then decided to apply  sanctions.  I think again the Chinese are doing that, they're raising hype.   They're going to try and offer some framework and say we're serious this  time, trust us and just don't put the higher tariffs that are scheduled for  January 1 or the second or the third trench of big tariffs that the  President has offered.</p><p>But, you know, nothing really happens at the G20 and I don't think China is  going to fundamentally change its system over dinner.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Over dinner nor has it shown any disposition to do so.  The  President himself putting the kibosh at -- on these reports what he would  likely style as fake news, that there would be some sort of framework come  out of this which is usually -- no offense, Christian, given your  background in the state department.  It sounds like typical gobbledygook  coming out of the state department that, you know, that it just means  nothing and really pretends nothing.  </p><p>WHITON:  Right.  Well, and then also could be coming out of the treasury  department.  And as you pointed out it's the left-wing financial press  saying what they -- they're hearing what they want to hear.  But if you  look at Xi Jinping having just crowned himself, he's in no mood to make  compromises either and it would be disastrous of course for President Trump  to make a compromise that undermines the hard work he's done.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we've got all sorts of -- in this administration, we  actually have never-Trumpers within the administration who are working very  hard, I give you anonymous, the author of that anonymous op-ed in The New  York Times who's never been found out or at least identified publicly.   This is a -- this s a strange time.  And the President deciding today that  he's not going to meet with Vladimir Putin because of his aggression  against Ukraine.  What do you make of it?  </p><p>WHITON:  Well, here again we see the President is much tougher on Russia  than his predecessors.  Of course, the media still say he's soft on Russia,  they say he's friendly with dictators.  You know, Obama and his Secretary  of State John Kerry said they were going to get tough on Russia after  Russia invaded Ukraine.  The year after that in 2015, John Kerry goes head  and hand to hand in meet Vladimir Putin who keeps him waiting.</p><p>And then they chuck it up for four hours.  Trump has actually isolated  Russia.  He has armed Russia's opponents.  He has reacted significantly and  he doesn't get credit.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you know who else doesn't get credit is Silicon Valley and  high-tech companies, big tech.  And their relationship with China and their  acquiescence it appears in politics in this country.  They're not standing  up supporting the President.  They're not trying to forcibly volubly stop  the theft, hundreds of billions of dollars by China.  Why not?  </p><p>WHITON:  Well, it's -- they see it to their financial benefit I assume.   Although I don't think in the long run it is.  You know, I don't think in  the long run it's good for Apple that they were not willing to help the FBI  unlock a terrorist cell phone but they are willing to help China sense with  the internet.  All across Silicon Valley they're complaining now that the  administration, that the government is finally looking at Chinese here who  are conducting industrial espionage.</p><p>Chinese nationals who are viewed as overseas Chinese by the Chinese  government, they are put under close surveillance, so are as students here  from China.  And they're used as assets and we're finally are getting to  the point where we're saying this is not good, this is being exploited by  our adversaries and will harm our security.  You know, if Silicon Valley  hot smart about this, send home the Chinese nationals, it would actually be  better long and they may have to pay Americans a few more bucks to do these  jobs.</p><p>But they'll save money in the long run because they'll keep their  intellectual property.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  And there would be more people who would be able to afford  Apple iPhone 10, it would be -- I think they would find to their advantage.   There's a new China study out from the Hoover Institution.  And I want to  read this part on the new China study saying beyond economic -- if we could  put that up, please.</p><p>Beyond economic espionage theft and forced technology transfer, China  captures much valuable new technology through its investments in U.S. high- tech companies and through its exploitation of the openness of American  university labs.  There is absolutely no, no vetting of students being  brought in from China.  These Chinese nationals are an important source of  that technology transfer.  Those are -- that's a nice expression for theft.</p><p>It is -- it is a calamity that's befallen this country.  And there is such  a willingness on the part of the leftist universities to continue this, 20  percent of most universities, major universities are going to international  students instead of Americans to begin with.  One has to ask why is that  and to -- and why -- who are they serving?  </p><p>WHITON:  Well, they're serving the needs of their administrators.  Of  course the professors are mostly left wing.  But the real -- the  mushrooming of staff of, you know, 18 vice chancellors for diversity and  gender studies at these universities, that's where the money is going to.   A new building, not actual education.  So yes, add to the ranks of  unpatriotic Silicon Valley types and universities and, you know who really  suffers are Asian Americans.</p><p>We've learned of course from this recent lawsuit that Harvard for example  has a quota on Asians that they're willing to accept.  And so they --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Asian Americans.  Asian Americans.</p><p>WHITON:  Exactly.  And so these Chinese who are here often being used as  assets by the Chinese government will pay full ride.  So they are pushing  Asian Americans who we ought to be training and ought to be giving  technical skills, not our adversaries.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Now, isn't it extraordinary? Asian Americans, citizens, are being  screened and international students, including Asians are being welcomed  with open arms as they -- as they help to maintain, if you will, those high  tuition levels for universities that for the most part are repositories of  left-wing indoctrination.  Christian Whiton, good to have you with us.   Thanks.  </p><p>WHITON:  Thanks, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Up next, with just a few weeks  left in Washington for this Congress, oh, they don't want to work too hard.   Five weeks remaining.  Just a little under that now.  Feckless lame-duck  speaker Paul Ryan using his remaining days, well, to just be an annoying  son of a gun.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES:  I think the Fed is by the way on the right track  normalizing.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Was that issue on the front of Donald J. Trump's mind?  </p><p>RYAN:  I think the immigration is just more on the front of his mind.  My  own view was, I would rather talk about the economy.  We don't want to have  a shutdown.  There's no -- I have no interest in doing that.  It makes no  sense.  He does create some hostility, Jim Acosta think Bob Mueller has  been left alone.  I think he's going to continue to be left alone.  But we  still ran on this better way agenda.  We put it in the place.  We put most  of these things into law.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  That man is absolutely delusional and self-absorbed.  Did I mention  that?  We'll take up the -- this ludicrous excuse for a speaker with Ed  Rollins when we come back.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  K Street owned RINO lame-duck Speaker Ryan says his former running  mate, do you remember the one who did so well in the 2012 presidential  elections?  That is incoming Senator Mitt Romney will soon pick up the on  obstructionist standard for the Republican Party left by John McCain.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RYAN:  He feels a sense of civic duty.  I think with John McCain passing,  for example, Mitt believes that there's a role for him in our party, in  being, you know, a statesman and a standard bearer in our party.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We've all been waiting for that.  You can tell that Paul Ryan has  been.  It must have slipped his -- well rather fragile mind that the  standard bearer of the party is the President of the United States for he  is the party's leaders and frankly its only hope.  Joining us tonight to  discuss all of this, top strategist for Great America PAC, former Reagan  White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst, Ed Rollins.</p><p>I have to say, I'm -- the Speaker continues to astound with his obtuseness,  his absolute delusion.  </p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well they don't -- they didn't believe  what Trump was advocating which is the conservative principles of the  Republican Party.  Romney didn't believe it, that's one of the reasons he  lost.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  He didn't believe in anything but Romney and Ryan doesn't believe  in anything but get lining his (INAUDIBLE) K Street.  These guys are owned  by the establishment.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  My great -- my great fear is that Romney is going to get in there  and when you've got two or three quote margins, anybody can play queen for  a day.  And Romney, you know, talking about him being the McCain of --  McCain basically destroyed the effort to get rid of Obamacare by one vote.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Basically he did it.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  And so we don't need another one.  We -- and it would have been  easy to elect somebody else in Utah.  Utah is not exactly a liberal  northeast state.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  It's getting more so though.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes.  But, you know, he was very insistent.  He wanted the  President's endorsement, the President was generous and did endorse him.</p><p>DOBBS:  And then he attacked the President.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  And my sense is Mitt Romney gets out there and wants to  basically be the new John McCain, there are a lot of us that are concerned  that will go out there and attack him for whatever form we may have.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The Republican Party seems to be at an existential juncture.   You've got idiots like so many of those in leadership, in both the Senate  and the House who working against the President, actively and vigorously.   If they did their jobs with half as much energy, much could be done by the  -- by the Hill.  But they don't have that.  And they don't have -- you  know, frankly, I can't even imagine why there is such a thing as a  Republican Party right now because you're watching this kind of nonsense.</p><p>Mitt Romney coming in, Paul Ryan going out.  All of it -- all of it is so  unfortunate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, unfortunately Paul Ryan is not going away.  Paul Ryan is  going to be there somewhere.  He has an ambition to be President some day.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know what he's going to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes.  Well, he will be.</p><p>DOBBS:  He's got to line his pockets.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  For a while and then he'll go back to politics in Wisconsin and  run for governor or run for something else.  </p><p>DOBBS:  So what's the Republican Party going to do because they look like  damn fools.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, the Republican Party today is Donald Trump.  If you don't  like that then go find another party because the vast majority of Americans  say they're self identify as Republicans overwhelmingly, even more than  when I worked for Ronald Reagan are Trump supporters.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Trump supporters have got to be scratching their heads  tonight.  Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state has just hired a never- Trumper, a pro-China mad fanatic free trader at any cost to America, Mary  Kissel.  I mean, how does she get hired?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I have no idea.  I'm shocked by it.  I like May personally, I've  been in many shows (INAUDIBLE) but she is not a Trump person.  She doesn't  believe in the policies that the President advocates.  And for her to be  going in as a senior advisor the Secretary of State to me is astonishing. </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, let's look at a couple of things that we're talking about.   She call for example, the Helsinki Summit with Putin and the President a  great propaganda victory for Putin.  Call Trump -- the Trump  administration's aide to farmers.  A taxpayer solution to a government  problem.  Criticize the President for cancelling military exercises with  South Korea.  It goes on and on.  She is just -- just doesn't make a lick  of sense.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  And why she is there is, you know, there are enough never-Trumpers  and Bush establishment types that permeate the government as well as of  course Obama leftovers.  What the hell are they thinking? </p><p>ROLLINS:  With the two years left in this administration, this term, and  get ready for a reelection campaign, you've got to make sure your people  are loyal to you and believe in what your policies are.  And I was still in  the White House --</p><p>DOBBS:  So what is Mike Pompeo thinking ?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I have no idea.  I mean, someone should have said to him no,  thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  You cannot have it.  I want to give  you a rational or you can have.   All you have to do is go read her  columns, go read her tweets.  She's been very public about this.  And  again, she's a nice person, articulate person but not a Trump person.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The previous secretary of state for this administration did the  same thing and got his tail kicked.  This one, it looks to me, deserves the  same response by the White House.  I can't think imagine why it's not  happening.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  The President or someone will have a heart to heart with him and  saying this is the most important thing.  We're going to be doing in the  next two years, our foreign policy stuff and this is my policy.  I want  people over there to advocate my policy.  The state department is hard to  move forward on anybody's agenda but their own.  So --</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, the great thing is this President is moving things by  himself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  This is the man driving the North Korea engagement, he is also  driving the new doctrine against China and, frankly, as a Christian Whiton  pointed out, this President has been far tougher, for example, than his  predecessors against the nonsense of Vladimir Putin.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, I would hope our good friend John Bolton would basically  step in and do something on this -- on this front.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, and thank goodness that John is there.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Absolutely.  I agree.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Ed Rollins, as always.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to have you here.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Congressman Jim Jordan bowing out of the race to be the ranking  member of the House Judiciary Committee.  Jordan's spokesman saying this,  \"it has been made clear to him that leadership is going to be selecting  someone else\".  Of course Kevin McCarthy is a, you know, a mini me of Paul  Ryan, establishment hack.  There remains a possibility Jordan could  challenge Mark Meadows, talking about an extraordinary development for the  ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.</p><p>I wouldn't bet on that either with Kevin McCarthy following in Paul Ryan's  footsteps.  And by the way, I'm sure following this guidance of the same K  Street masters as did his predecessor.  </p><p>Be sure to vote in the poll tonight.  Do you believe RINO Paul Ryan will  soon join the Democratic Party where he is belonged throughout his  political career?  Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on  Twitter @LouDobbs, and like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram  @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next.  The left-wing national media has their hair on fire over Michael  Cohen's new plea deal with the special counsel.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's Shakespearean because somebody who said he would  take a bullet for Donald Trump is now pointing the gun at him.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today is a good day for Donald Trump to resign.  I  really believe that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a rational explanation for why he was so pro- Putin.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What this represents is the possibility of something  very simple, that there was money in it for Donald Trump.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The plea today by Cohen tells us that there is a  financial connection here.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Michael Cohen could be the most -- single most  terrifying person for Donald Trump.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, yes.   Frightening.  Scary.  Oh boy.  Washington Times  columnist Tammy Bruce joins me right after the break to take that up as  well as the latest in the Mueller witch-hunt.  All of that evidence that  they've built over the course of two years, it's just astonishing, isn't  it?  No wonder the President -- well, we'll take that up next.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Breaking news now.  President Trump will not be meeting with  Russian President Putin during the upcoming G20 Summit in Argentina.   President Trump tweeted out his decision earlier today citing growing  tension between Russia and Ukraine.  Russia hasn't yet released the  Ukrainian vessels and sailors that it seized last week in the Black Sea.  </p><p>President Trump slamming the Mueller witch-hunt again this morning in a  series of tweets calling the probe illegal, ridiculous and a disgrace.  All  of which were true.  We'd like to add it it's simply pathetic.  In addition  to working out a plea deal with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen who has  zero information about the President's alleged Russia collusion because  there is none.  Mueller no focusing on late-night calls between the  President and Roger Stone.</p><p>That's what he has been reduced to in this.  Mueller is trying to squeeze  author Jerome Corsi, a journalist and conservative who said he will file --  he will be filing a criminal lawsuit against Mueller.  Mueller is  absolutely -- his tactics have blown up in his face since Trump campaign  manager Paul Manafort reached a plea deal and we'll see how that works out.  </p><p>Joining me now to take up the President's upcoming G20 Summit, the impact  it could have on the United States, China and Russia relations, Tammy  Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Great to have  you with us.  I've got to start with Ryan.  Can you imagine this -- I mean  the words fail me.  He is such an ignoramus that it is -- it's unspeakable  what the Speaker is.  </p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's remarkable.  His -- and I  think he's serious when he expresses as a kind of -- a genuine shock at why  they would have lost the midterms and not knowing why that would happen.  I  do think, though, that he's not necessarily a dumb man.  I think he knows - - </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, I think he is.  I think you're -- I think you're -- I think  you're very safe to go there.  </p><p>BRUCE: He -- a lot of Republicans wanted this kind of a punch at the  president.  I don't think that they necessarily mind losing the House  because now the --</p><p>DOBBS:  Republicans?</p><p>BRUCE:  I think they don't mind the Democrats being in charge and leading  the chart.</p><p>DOBBS:  Who's they?</p><p>BRUCE:  The Republicans in the -- in the House.</p><p>DOBBS:  You mean the --</p><p>BRUCE:  I mean, the leadership.</p><p>DOBBS:  The leadership?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Well, certainly not all of them, the Freedom Caucus but not.   But I think that --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, they're complete idiots then and they should lose, they  should be then disbanded.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well it's -- they're the managers of the monster.  I think this  argument that there's partisanship in Washington is a fraud.  I think that  that's theater for the -- for the Hoipolloi in the country.  And that this  is really about -- you know, pulling the wool over our eyes and getting the  man --getting the monster to be as plump as it can be and managing it while  pretending to really be conservative or liberal.  That's what I think the  Republicans have been doing for quite some time.</p><p>DOBBS:  The Republican Party, the establishment wing of that party.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  The vast -- the vast number of Republicans, I think you're right.   There is a little problem though, you've got a guy by the name of Donald  Trump who's president of the United States who ran against his  establishment.  In point of fact, he's running against every one of those  idiots in the Republican parties who are really Democrats posing as  Republicans, I think you're right in that construction.  But this president  is right now, he is harvesting -- you know, these seeds of anti- establishmentarianism that he's been planning throughout the country for a  several years now.  This is a real war.</p><p>BRUCE:  It is.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's a fight that I hope the president doesn't ever get tired of  waging, because so much depends on his strength, his leadership and the  weakness of these fools.  I mean, there's no other expression for what a  Paul Ryan is.</p><p>BRUCE:  There is a sentiment I think that --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Kevin McCarthy by the way is coming in right behind him.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes. </p><p>DOBBS:  The same -- he's the same (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BRUCE:  The president would be making a mistake and I'm sure that people  are telling him that the fight would be over after the midterms.  Everyone  will settle down and it will not, because the fight for the establishment - -</p><p>DOBBS:  Who told you that? (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BRUCE:  I'm sure some advices are.  Well and other advisors within the  establishment probably are telling him that, when in fact they know as you  are correct, this is a long-term fight, this is not just about this term or  this presidency, this is about whether or not the Donald Trump attitude,  the new GOP would survive and it's a GOP that would be led by a man of  action, Donald Trump with ideas that would help the American people, where  management of the monster is no longer acceptable.  That we've got to cut  it down and really have government work for the people.</p><p>DOBBS:  Do you think the American people have got the stomach for it?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, we're the American people who defeated the British when  everyone said we couldn't.  Look at what we've accomplished from the  beginning.  We are so --</p><p>DOBBS:  But that was on last -- that was on last week.</p><p>BRUCE:  We are even more -- I think being revolutionary is in our DNA.   We're even more committed to making sure that this experiment works because  we are a relatively young country.  Our generations will make it work, it's  not going to fail on our watch, I can tell you that right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  OK, and I'm going to say I hope the heck you're right.  Tammy  Bruce, always good to have you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thanks so much.  After calling for a free Palestine at the United  Nations the destruction of Israel, CNN finally cut ties with Marc Lamont  Hill, while his comments were polarizing for the -- for CNN.  It's  apparently just remarkable that his other employer might keep him on the  job.  You see, Hill also is a professor of Temple University and they say  quote, his views are his own, no problem for them that he is anti-Israel  and calling for the destruction of the country, incredible.</p><p>Up next, critical health concerns now involving more than a third of the  6,000 migrants crammed in a Tijuana Mexico Sports Complex.  We take it up  with Trump 2020 advisory board members Steve Rogers right after this quick  break.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  On Wall Street, stocks closing lower slightly, barely.  The Dow  down 28 points, the S&amp;P lost six, the NASDAQ down 19.  Not bad since the  NASDAQ yesterday was up 200, the Dow up more than 600.  Volume on the big  board backing down to 3.5 billion shares from 3.9 yesterday.</p><p>Crude oil up nearly two percent, $51.00 a barrel.  Gold close flat, silver  down nearly half a percent, copper lost nearly a percent.</p><p>And a reminder, listen to my reports three times a day, Coast to Coast on  the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Disturbing news tonight out of Tijuana, 6,000 migrants crammed into a  Sports Complex there.  More than a third of them are being treated for  health-related issues, more than 2,200 medically treated, more than 60  percent with respiratory infections.  And 101 cases -- 101 cases of lice,  four cases of chicken pox, serious concerns about the prospect of hepatitis  because of the unsanitary conditions in which they're living.  Other  concerns also being outlined by the Department of Homeland Security, they  have identified now more than 600 criminals and gang members that are  travelling in that Caravan.</p><p>Joining me tonight to talk about the growing crisis on our border, security  concerns in the president's fight to build a wall of course, Steve Rogers.   A Trump 2020 advisory board member, former Navy lieutenant commander and a  former FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force member.  Steve, great to have you  here.</p><p>STEVE ROGERS, ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, TRUMP 2020:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with that Caravan, the president doing the right thing,  securing the border.  He's being attacked as he is always no matter what he  does, by the establishment, by the left, by the right, by the Wall Street,  Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce and then of course, Chuck Schumer  and all of his buddies.</p><p>ROGERS:  Lou, after 9/11 as a military Intel officer, I was assigned the  FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and we were watching, we were gathering  intelligence and information about that border.  And we had concerns back  then, way back then who's crossing the border.  Of course our concern was  somebody would bring a dirty bomb across that border but we knew, we knew  there was a drug cartel, we knew there was human trafficking.  Nothing was  done until Donald Trump became President of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS:  He's the first president and first presidential candidate to speak  openly about the drug cartels and their role in corruption not only in  Mexico but at the border on -- by the way, the American people are coming  to the realization that corruption south of the border means there's  corruption to the north of the border.  And we're not doing nearly enough  to fight that either.</p><p>ROGERS:  And he's delivering on his promise that he would protect the  American people.  When you hear about 600 gang members this week, a gang  member from MS-13 was arrested, I mean, my goodness how many did we not  catch?  So when he talks about protection he meant it and he's delivering.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and by the way, MS-13 gang members are throughout the country  for crying out loud.  And this is the first president to actually do  something about it.  His Justice Department making headway, one of its few  public at least accomplishments to this point.</p><p>The Cohen guilty plea, your reaction to what the left-wing media is making  of it.  Here's a business deal that was never done and now the great -- I  mean, you list -- I don't know if you saw the clips that we had of the  left-wing media just going nuts, there's no deal.</p><p>ROGERS:  Lou, when I was doing investigations of police work and had a  witness a so-called witness changed his story a dozen times.  How do you  believe him, why do you believe him?  Look, Michael Cohen's out to save his  own hide, and if he thinks he's going to save his hide on the back of the  president United States, well, he's got another story coming his way.</p><p>DOBBS:  The president's saying he's going to play tough with Democrats if  they continue to frustrate him and attack him.  That he's going to release  some documents that they will find very disturbing, the documents about  them.  What do you make of this, the promise, the threat however you would  start.</p><p>ROGERS:  I believe that he knows what's in those documents, timing is  everything.  I know he cares for this country and I know that perhaps he  doesn't want to do damage to the country even though it's the Democrats.   He cares about our country but if he has to use those documents to defend  himself, go ahead.  You know what Lou, the American people despite what the  polls say, I'm out there, they support this president, they value his  judgment.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, I'm troubled by a number of reports that are coming out.   One is that there would be a framework of a deal that he might reach with  and this may be driven by Chinese propaganda in this country, that he might  come up with a framework that would be satisfactory for a while and defer  tariffs rather than continue with the tariffs and stay tough with them.  </p><p>And by the way, if that were the case there would still be the matter of a  half a trillion dollars in stolen American intellectual property each and  every year.  These are disturbing reports and they're being driven in some  measure by -- I'll call them what they really are, they're never Trumpers  and establishment RINO Republicans within his own administration.</p><p>ROGERS:  Well let's look at that let's look at what the president has done  already.  He has never compromised on the security of this country, never.   And I believe that he's going to be driven by that even with this issue in  China.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I think you're exactly right and I have to wonder though when  we look at this Mary Kissel appointment a never Trumper.  I read the -- to  the audience a number of the -- of the tweets her absolute pro-China, pro- fanitical actually, free-trade beliefs and her attacks on the president.   What in the world is Mike Pompeo thinking of and why -- how could you even  rationalize this?</p><p>ROGERS:  Well, difficult for us to rationalize it but I got to tell you, I  trust the judgement in to president and I'm sure he is going to make sure  she or anyone else supports his policies, he's the boss not Mike Pompeo, no  one else, he's the President of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, I think that may be a news break for Mike Pompeo based on his  most recent hire.</p><p>ROGERS:  Well --</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you so much, Steve.  Great to have you here, Steve Rogers.</p><p>A new report from the Center for Disease Control shows life expectancy in  this country has declined for the second time in the past three years.  The  average life expectancy last year fell to just over 78-1/2 years old.  The  CDC says an increase in drug overdoses and suicides in this country are to  blame for this alarming trend.</p><p>Last year nearly 70,000 people died from drug overdoses, a 10 percent  increase from the previous year.  Last year more than 47,000 suicides up  from the 45,000 in the previous year.  Overall, nearly three million people  in this country died last year at 70,000 more deaths than in the previous  year.</p><p>Up next, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling Congress his company doesn't  sell your data, that doesn't mean they don't try or that they really don't.   Really, what does it all mean?  We take it up after the break with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He joins us here next stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Internal e-mail show Facebook considered profiting by selling  companies access to your personal data.  The e-mails reviewed by The Wall  Street Journal also suggests Facebook employees talked about pushing some  advertisers to spend more and return for increased access to user data.  </p><p>Joining me now to take up what is going on in Silicon Valley and big tech,  to take up Facebook and the company's growing struggles, and the increased  cyber threats from Russia, from China, and Iran, Former Senior Adviser in  the State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program, former Law  Enforcement Adviser to the RNC and cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.   Morgan, great to see you.  I want to compliment you on your recent op-ed in  the Hill -- </p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in which you said point-blank that high-techs globalism is  killing patriotism in this country.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Absolutely. </p><p>DOBBS:  This is right now it seems to me the prospects for regulating out- of-control technology companies with huge, huge economic concentration in  power this time may be right.  What are your -- what are your thoughts? </p><p>WRIGHT:  That's why Sarbanes-Oxley came about, Lou.  And you know those  things that led up to that you know, Adelphia, Tyco, Enron.  Pretty soon  the government said, hey, we're not going to take this anymore and so you  go through litigation, you sue, you go through regulation like with the SEC  and the FCC and the FTC.  And then pretty soon it's like OK, Congress goes,  we've had enough of this, we're going to pass a law and now it's going to  be you know codified and your guys are going to -- and people went to jail,  Lou.  People went to jail with Sarbanes-Oxley. </p><p>So you know, what we're going to find out is that I think this issue of  privacy is I think is the watershed moment where we start listening at  what's happening in the E.U. with his seven countries that have filed  against Google for tracking them, the issue of privacy, Facebook you know,  Cambridge Analytical.  This all has to come to a head sometime and I think  2019 is going to be the year for it. </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, it's a hell of a note when the Europeans have more  impressive laws protecting consumers, protecting our personal data than  does the United States.  It's incredible me that we are -- have lag to this  far and given high tech such a pass.  I want to just turn to a specific  issue and that is Google.  Do you -- Pichai is going to be talking before  the -- </p><p>WRIGHT:  Finally, finally. </p><p>DOBBS:  Finally, he'll be talking to Congress.  Meanwhile, he's doing  business with China.  That's -- it's an extraordinary mess.  There's just  no constraint and apparently no effort to bring -- to rein in Google and  its absolutely pro-Chinese policies which are effectively the result is  anti-American. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, and that's why the one of the reasons I wrote the op-ed --  and look my father was a World War Two vet, he was also a Vietnam vet.  I  mean, there were people that -- you know, we've lost a lot of people in  defense of freedom to fight people like what China has become.  And what  has happened is we lack this patriotism.  Now, it's OK to have America  first.  We can still have a view of the world.  But in that op-ed that I  wrote in the research that I did, I found out that 47 percent of these CEOs  believe in globalism.  They believe the broader, they believe the world  should profit first before -- and be taken care of before the United  States, but yet they built their businesses on the opportunities that came  from the United States. </p><p>DOBBS:  That's right. </p><p>WRIGHT:  And I think Google is opening up, the AI the artificial  intelligence center in Shanghai and they go, it's going to be a vibrant  place.  Well, guess what, in China nothing gets built there that doesn't  get shared with the military, yet they turned our military down and threw  them to the curb on Project Maven on using artificial intelligence so we  could save soldier's lives and save other civilians lives so they don't  become collateral damage and yet where's the outrage on that?</p><p>They were more concerned about Project Maven than they are the censored  search engine that Google is defending still to this day.  They say they're  not building it but they haven't thrown it to the curb yet either. </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and meanwhile we're watching Chinese companies continue their  advances here, the front companies that are carrying out espionage 20  percent of place is reserved for foreign students and our universities.   You can mark it any way you want it is a zero-sum game.  That means 20  percent of those seats didn't go to an American student and there is no  discussion whatsoever, no public policy about what is occurred by most of  these universities that are left-wing driven, they are left-wing  indoctrination centers. </p><p>And we're looking at statistics now in surveys showing the millennial --  the millennial generation is the product of that indoctrination process in  our public schools and on our education.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  During a congressional hearing, FBI Director Wray talked  about the Confucius Institutes to what China's putting all this money.  He  talked about that this is simply a front for the Chinese government to  commit espionage, to commit the theft of intellectual property.  60 percent  of the foreign students in the United States now are Chinese.  We have them  in some of the most sensitive programs getting PhDs and things around  material science and artificial intelligence.  </p><p>And guess what, all of that's going back to China along with the forced  transfer of Technology if you want to do business in China, you got to play  by their rules.  Hey, if they want to do that that's fine.  I think we  ought to do the same thing to Huawei and ZTE and all the other Chinese  companies who want to sell stuff in the United States. </p><p>DOBBS:  And this President relented with President Xi.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Unfortunately on Huawei, he did.  Absolutely. </p><p>DOBBS:  And that's got to be reversed too because what is happening is it  is -- it's just unthinkable that we're letting this happen to this great  country and this president is responsible for driving these policies that  will preserve the republic one hopes.  Morgan Wright, always good to have  you with us.  Thanks so much. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  And I think I should be very clear to all why it is that the  establishment is represented by the leadership of the Republican Party, the  Democratic Party, the Wall Street, the Koch Brothers are having a fit as  this President's policies move us -- move us forward.  They can't stand it  because they know they're going to have to give up their globalist interest  in favor of America first.  Well, Morgan Wright, always good to have you  here.  </p><p>Broward County residents will foot -- be footing the bill for Brenda Snipes  election antics even after she leaves office.  You aknow, some would call  them antics, some would call it fraud.  Starting in January, Snipes will  receive a total of $130,000 a year in pensions.  Residents of Florida will  be paying for her incompetence for years and years to come for a job well  done, of course.  </p><p>Up next -- well, you know what?  I'm going to surprise you on the side.   We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Breaking news and it is highly unexpected news from the Republican  Party.  House Freedom Caucus Co-Founder Jim Jordan will indeed become the  Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee.  (INAUDIBLE) is saying the  Steering Committee voted unanimously in Jordan's favor.  North Carolina  Congressman Mark Meadows who had expressed interest in the same job  celebrated the decision saying this is one of the few times that he can  take real pleasure in the success of Mr. Jordan.</p><p>A remind tore vote in tonight's poll.  Do you believe RINO Paul Ryan will  soon join the Democratic Party where he has belonged throughout his career?   Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  </p><p>That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Author and  journalist Jerome Corsi and the President of the Center for Security Policy  Fred Fleitz among our guests tomorrow.  Please join us.

Our top stories, President Trump due to land I in about an hour. Taking with him his America First message of free and fair trade to the summit of G20 leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping who is feeling the full source of Trump policy and American tariffs. We'll talk about the President's efforts to save American jobs, to stop Chinese theft of American intellectual property with former state department senior adviser Christian Whiton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also tonight, the out of control Mueller witch-hunt has reach new depths of pathetic desperation. This time trying to squeeze the President's former personal attorney Michael Cohen over a business deal that never occurred.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We had a position to possibly do a deal to build a building of some kind in Moscow. I decided not to do it. The primary reason, it could have been other reasons but the primary reason it was simple. I was focused on running for President. There would be nothing wrong if I did do it. I was running my business while I was campaigning.</p><p>There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won in which case I would have gotten back into the business and why should I lose lots of opportunities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And disturbing new revelations about the threat posed to public security and public health by the caravan massing at the U.S.-Mexico border. Hundreds of migrants reportedly known criminals carrying potentially deadly infectious diseases. We take up that report with former FBI Intelligence officer Steve Rogers with us tonight.</p><p>Also RINO lame-duck speaker, you remember him, Paul Ryan, he lost the House for Republicans, he sabotaged candidates but none of that stopping him from lecturing the Republican Party on who should be the party's next standard bearer. We'll tell you about his latest outrage here next.</p><p>Our top story, President Trump on his way to Argentina tonight where he will assuredly push ahead with his America First agenda. While at the summit the President will also sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries prior to his departure for Argentina, the President addressed the prospects of a new trade deal with China.</p><p>Soon after Air Force One left the tarmac, the administration announced the President would be accompanied by White House trade policy adviser, Peter Navarro. At that meeting where Xi knew that the left wing business media - - get ready for this, they decided that at that moment the market was down so they blamed -- that's right, Navarro showing up at the Xi dinner for the markets losses.</p><p>Then the group at CNBC claimed upon Navarro's attendance at the Xi meeting, stocks fail to their lows of the day. The network also said then stocks were trading higher but \"dimming hopes of a trade deal between China and U.S. cap gains on Wall Street and then the market moved higher. Of course, and they didn't know what to say. Here to take up the President's Trump to the G20 Summit and what to expect from his meetings with globalist leaders, Christian Whiton.</p><p>Former stated department senior advisor to the Trump and George W. Bush administrations. Christian, great to have you with us. Let's start first with China and the prospects of the deal. This sounds like -- it sounds like some advertising for some real disappointment for those who are expecting the President to continue his tough policy position on trade with China.</p><p>MICHAEL WHITON, FORMER TRUMP STATE DEPARTMENT SENIOR ADVISER: Yes. It also sounds like deja vu. You know, we supposedly had a big deal with China early in the administration at Mar-a-Lago and that was supposed to lead to some wonders of trade. Chinese didn't really do anything with it. That fell apart. And then earlier this spring, March, April, I think Larry Kudlow went on T.V. and said the trade war was over.</p><p>Interesting. They didn't want to call it that before. And that there was some deal. The President looked at this deal and then decided to apply sanctions. I think again the Chinese are doing that, they're raising hype. They're going to try and offer some framework and say we're serious this time, trust us and just don't put the higher tariffs that are scheduled for January 1 or the second or the third trench of big tariffs that the President has offered.</p><p>But, you know, nothing really happens at the G20 and I don't think China is going to fundamentally change its system over dinner.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. Over dinner nor has it shown any disposition to do so. The President himself putting the kibosh at -- on these reports what he would likely style as fake news, that there would be some sort of framework come out of this which is usually -- no offense, Christian, given your background in the state department. It sounds like typical gobbledygook coming out of the state department that, you know, that it just means nothing and really pretends nothing.</p><p>WHITON: Right. Well, and then also could be coming out of the treasury department. And as you pointed out it's the left-wing financial press saying what they -- they're hearing what they want to hear. But if you look at Xi Jinping having just crowned himself, he's in no mood to make compromises either and it would be disastrous of course for President Trump to make a compromise that undermines the hard work he's done.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, we've got all sorts of -- in this administration, we actually have never-Trumpers within the administration who are working very hard, I give you anonymous, the author of that anonymous op-ed in The New York Times who's never been found out or at least identified publicly. This is a -- this s a strange time. And the President deciding today that he's not going to meet with Vladimir Putin because of his aggression against Ukraine. What do you make of it?</p><p>WHITON: Well, here again we see the President is much tougher on Russia than his predecessors. Of course, the media still say he's soft on Russia, they say he's friendly with dictators. You know, Obama and his Secretary of State John Kerry said they were going to get tough on Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine. The year after that in 2015, John Kerry goes head and hand to hand in meet Vladimir Putin who keeps him waiting.</p><p>And then they chuck it up for four hours. Trump has actually isolated Russia. He has armed Russia's opponents. He has reacted significantly and he doesn't get credit.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you know who else doesn't get credit is Silicon Valley and high-tech companies, big tech. And their relationship with China and their acquiescence it appears in politics in this country. They're not standing up supporting the President. They're not trying to forcibly volubly stop the theft, hundreds of billions of dollars by China. Why not?</p><p>WHITON: Well, it's -- they see it to their financial benefit I assume. Although I don't think in the long run it is. You know, I don't think in the long run it's good for Apple that they were not willing to help the FBI unlock a terrorist cell phone but they are willing to help China sense with the internet. All across Silicon Valley they're complaining now that the administration, that the government is finally looking at Chinese here who are conducting industrial espionage.</p><p>Chinese nationals who are viewed as overseas Chinese by the Chinese government, they are put under close surveillance, so are as students here from China. And they're used as assets and we're finally are getting to the point where we're saying this is not good, this is being exploited by our adversaries and will harm our security. You know, if Silicon Valley hot smart about this, send home the Chinese nationals, it would actually be better long and they may have to pay Americans a few more bucks to do these jobs.</p><p>But they'll save money in the long run because they'll keep their intellectual property.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. And there would be more people who would be able to afford Apple iPhone 10, it would be -- I think they would find to their advantage. There's a new China study out from the Hoover Institution. And I want to read this part on the new China study saying beyond economic -- if we could put that up, please.</p><p>Beyond economic espionage theft and forced technology transfer, China captures much valuable new technology through its investments in U.S. high- tech companies and through its exploitation of the openness of American university labs. There is absolutely no, no vetting of students being brought in from China. These Chinese nationals are an important source of that technology transfer. Those are -- that's a nice expression for theft.</p><p>It is -- it is a calamity that's befallen this country. And there is such a willingness on the part of the leftist universities to continue this, 20 percent of most universities, major universities are going to international students instead of Americans to begin with. One has to ask why is that and to -- and why -- who are they serving?</p><p>WHITON: Well, they're serving the needs of their administrators. Of course the professors are mostly left wing. But the real -- the mushrooming of staff of, you know, 18 vice chancellors for diversity and gender studies at these universities, that's where the money is going to. A new building, not actual education. So yes, add to the ranks of unpatriotic Silicon Valley types and universities and, you know who really suffers are Asian Americans.</p><p>We've learned of course from this recent lawsuit that Harvard for example has a quota on Asians that they're willing to accept. And so they --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Asian Americans. Asian Americans.</p><p>WHITON: Exactly. And so these Chinese who are here often being used as assets by the Chinese government will pay full ride. So they are pushing Asian Americans who we ought to be training and ought to be giving technical skills, not our adversaries.</p><p>DOBBS: Now, isn't it extraordinary? Asian Americans, citizens, are being screened and international students, including Asians are being welcomed with open arms as they -- as they help to maintain, if you will, those high tuition levels for universities that for the most part are repositories of left-wing indoctrination. Christian Whiton, good to have you with us. Thanks.</p><p>WHITON: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Look forward to seeing you soon. Up next, with just a few weeks left in Washington for this Congress, oh, they don't want to work too hard. Five weeks remaining. Just a little under that now. Feckless lame-duck speaker Paul Ryan using his remaining days, well, to just be an annoying son of a gun.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I think the Fed is by the way on the right track normalizing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was that issue on the front of Donald J. Trump's mind?</p><p>RYAN: I think the immigration is just more on the front of his mind. My own view was, I would rather talk about the economy. We don't want to have a shutdown. There's no -- I have no interest in doing that. It makes no sense. He does create some hostility, Jim Acosta think Bob Mueller has been left alone. I think he's going to continue to be left alone. But we still ran on this better way agenda. We put it in the place. We put most of these things into law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: That man is absolutely delusional and self-absorbed. Did I mention that? We'll take up the -- this ludicrous excuse for a speaker with Ed Rollins when we come back. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: K Street owned RINO lame-duck Speaker Ryan says his former running mate, do you remember the one who did so well in the 2012 presidential elections? That is incoming Senator Mitt Romney will soon pick up the on obstructionist standard for the Republican Party left by John McCain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN: He feels a sense of civic duty. I think with John McCain passing, for example, Mitt believes that there's a role for him in our party, in being, you know, a statesman and a standard bearer in our party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We've all been waiting for that. You can tell that Paul Ryan has been. It must have slipped his -- well rather fragile mind that the standard bearer of the party is the President of the United States for he is the party's leaders and frankly its only hope. Joining us tonight to discuss all of this, top strategist for Great America PAC, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst, Ed Rollins.</p><p>I have to say, I'm -- the Speaker continues to astound with his obtuseness, his absolute delusion.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well they don't -- they didn't believe what Trump was advocating which is the conservative principles of the Republican Party. Romney didn't believe it, that's one of the reasons he lost.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: He didn't believe in anything but Romney and Ryan doesn't believe in anything but get lining his (INAUDIBLE) K Street. These guys are owned by the establishment.</p><p>ROLLINS: My great -- my great fear is that Romney is going to get in there and when you've got two or three quote margins, anybody can play queen for a day. And Romney, you know, talking about him being the McCain of -- McCain basically destroyed the effort to get rid of Obamacare by one vote.</p><p>DOBBS: Basically he did it.</p><p>ROLLINS: And so we don't need another one. We -- and it would have been easy to elect somebody else in Utah. Utah is not exactly a liberal northeast state.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: It's getting more so though.</p><p>ROLLINS: Yes. But, you know, he was very insistent. He wanted the President's endorsement, the President was generous and did endorse him.</p><p>DOBBS: And then he attacked the President.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right. And my sense is Mitt Romney gets out there and wants to basically be the new John McCain, there are a lot of us that are concerned that will go out there and attack him for whatever form we may have.</p><p>DOBBS: The Republican Party seems to be at an existential juncture. You've got idiots like so many of those in leadership, in both the Senate and the House who working against the President, actively and vigorously. If they did their jobs with half as much energy, much could be done by the -- by the Hill. But they don't have that. And they don't have -- you know, frankly, I can't even imagine why there is such a thing as a Republican Party right now because you're watching this kind of nonsense.</p><p>Mitt Romney coming in, Paul Ryan going out. All of it -- all of it is so unfortunate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, unfortunately Paul Ryan is not going away. Paul Ryan is going to be there somewhere. He has an ambition to be President some day.</p><p>DOBBS: You know what he's going to do.</p><p>ROLLINS: Yes. Well, he will be.</p><p>DOBBS: He's got to line his pockets.</p><p>ROLLINS: For a while and then he'll go back to politics in Wisconsin and run for governor or run for something else.</p><p>DOBBS: So what's the Republican Party going to do because they look like damn fools.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, the Republican Party today is Donald Trump. If you don't like that then go find another party because the vast majority of Americans say they're self identify as Republicans overwhelmingly, even more than when I worked for Ronald Reagan are Trump supporters.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. Trump supporters have got to be scratching their heads tonight. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state has just hired a never- Trumper, a pro-China mad fanatic free trader at any cost to America, Mary Kissel. I mean, how does she get hired?</p><p>ROLLINS: I have no idea. I'm shocked by it. I like May personally, I've been in many shows (INAUDIBLE) but she is not a Trump person. She doesn't believe in the policies that the President advocates. And for her to be going in as a senior advisor the Secretary of State to me is astonishing.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's look at a couple of things that we're talking about. She call for example, the Helsinki Summit with Putin and the President a great propaganda victory for Putin. Call Trump -- the Trump administration's aide to farmers. A taxpayer solution to a government problem. Criticize the President for cancelling military exercises with South Korea. It goes on and on. She is just -- just doesn't make a lick of sense.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: And why she is there is, you know, there are enough never-Trumpers and Bush establishment types that permeate the government as well as of course Obama leftovers. What the hell are they thinking?</p><p>ROLLINS: With the two years left in this administration, this term, and get ready for a reelection campaign, you've got to make sure your people are loyal to you and believe in what your policies are. And I was still in the White House --</p><p>DOBBS: So what is Mike Pompeo thinking ?</p><p>ROLLINS: I have no idea. I mean, someone should have said to him no, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. You cannot have it. I want to give you a rational or you can have. All you have to do is go read her columns, go read her tweets. She's been very public about this. And again, she's a nice person, articulate person but not a Trump person.</p><p>DOBBS: The previous secretary of state for this administration did the same thing and got his tail kicked. This one, it looks to me, deserves the same response by the White House. I can't think imagine why it's not happening.</p><p>ROLLINS: The President or someone will have a heart to heart with him and saying this is the most important thing. We're going to be doing in the next two years, our foreign policy stuff and this is my policy. I want people over there to advocate my policy. The state department is hard to move forward on anybody's agenda but their own. So --</p><p>DOBBS: You know, the great thing is this President is moving things by himself.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: This is the man driving the North Korea engagement, he is also driving the new doctrine against China and, frankly, as a Christian Whiton pointed out, this President has been far tougher, for example, than his predecessors against the nonsense of Vladimir Putin.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, I would hope our good friend John Bolton would basically step in and do something on this -- on this front.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, and thank goodness that John is there.</p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely. I agree.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed Rollins, as always.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Good to have you here.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman Jim Jordan bowing out of the race to be the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. Jordan's spokesman saying this, \"it has been made clear to him that leadership is going to be selecting someone else\". Of course Kevin McCarthy is a, you know, a mini me of Paul Ryan, establishment hack. There remains a possibility Jordan could challenge Mark Meadows, talking about an extraordinary development for the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.</p><p>I wouldn't bet on that either with Kevin McCarthy following in Paul Ryan's footsteps. And by the way, I'm sure following this guidance of the same K Street masters as did his predecessor.</p><p>Be sure to vote in the poll tonight. Do you believe RINO Paul Ryan will soon join the Democratic Party where he is belonged throughout his political career?

The left-wing national media has their hair on fire over Michael Cohen's new plea deal with the special counsel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's Shakespearean because somebody who said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump is now pointing the gun at him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today is a good day for Donald Trump to resign. I really believe that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a rational explanation for why he was so pro- Putin.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What this represents is the possibility of something very simple, that there was money in it for Donald Trump.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The plea today by Cohen tells us that there is a financial connection here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michael Cohen could be the most -- single most terrifying person for Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Oh, yes. Frightening. Scary. Oh boy. Washington Times columnist Tammy Bruce joins me right after the break to take that up as well as the latest in the Mueller witch-hunt. All of that evidence that they've built over the course of two years, it's just astonishing, isn't it? No wonder the President -- well, we'll take that up next. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now. President Trump will not be meeting with Russian President Putin during the upcoming G20 Summit in Argentina. President Trump tweeted out his decision earlier today citing growing tension between Russia and Ukraine. Russia hasn't yet released the Ukrainian vessels and sailors that it seized last week in the Black Sea.</p><p>President Trump slamming the Mueller witch-hunt again this morning in a series of tweets calling the probe illegal, ridiculous and a disgrace. All of which were true. We'd like to add it it's simply pathetic. In addition to working out a plea deal with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen who has zero information about the President's alleged Russia collusion because there is none. Mueller no focusing on late-night calls between the President and Roger Stone.</p><p>That's what he has been reduced to in this. Mueller is trying to squeeze author Jerome Corsi, a journalist and conservative who said he will file -- he will be filing a criminal lawsuit against Mueller. Mueller is absolutely -- his tactics have blown up in his face since Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort reached a plea deal and we'll see how that works out.</p><p>Joining me now to take up the President's upcoming G20 Summit, the impact it could have on the United States, China and Russia relations, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business Contributor. Great to have you with us. I've got to start with Ryan. Can you imagine this -- I mean the words fail me. He is such an ignoramus that it is -- it's unspeakable what the Speaker is.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: It's remarkable. His -- and I think he's serious when he expresses as a kind of -- a genuine shock at why they would have lost the midterms and not knowing why that would happen. I do think, though, that he's not necessarily a dumb man. I think he knows - -</p><p>DOBBS: Oh, I think he is. I think you're -- I think you're -- I think you're very safe to go there.</p><p>BRUCE: He -- a lot of Republicans wanted this kind of a punch at the president. I don't think that they necessarily mind losing the House because now the --</p><p>DOBBS: Republicans?</p><p>BRUCE: I think they don't mind the Democrats being in charge and leading the chart.</p><p>DOBBS: Who's they?</p><p>BRUCE: The Republicans in the -- in the House.</p><p>DOBBS: You mean the --</p><p>BRUCE: I mean, the leadership.</p><p>DOBBS: The leadership?</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. Well, certainly not all of them, the Freedom Caucus but not. But I think that --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, they're complete idiots then and they should lose, they should be then disbanded.</p><p>BRUCE: Well it's -- they're the managers of the monster. I think this argument that there's partisanship in Washington is a fraud. I think that that's theater for the -- for the Hoipolloi in the country. And that this is really about -- you know, pulling the wool over our eyes and getting the man --getting the monster to be as plump as it can be and managing it while pretending to really be conservative or liberal. That's what I think the Republicans have been doing for quite some time.</p><p>DOBBS: The Republican Party, the establishment wing of that party.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: The vast -- the vast number of Republicans, I think you're right. There is a little problem though, you've got a guy by the name of Donald Trump who's president of the United States who ran against his establishment. In point of fact, he's running against every one of those idiots in the Republican parties who are really Democrats posing as Republicans, I think you're right in that construction. But this president is right now, he is harvesting -- you know, these seeds of anti- establishmentarianism that he's been planning throughout the country for a several years now. This is a real war.</p><p>BRUCE: It is.</p><p>DOBBS: It's a fight that I hope the president doesn't ever get tired of waging, because so much depends on his strength, his leadership and the weakness of these fools. I mean, there's no other expression for what a Paul Ryan is.</p><p>BRUCE: There is a sentiment I think that --</p><p>DOBBS: And Kevin McCarthy by the way is coming in right behind him.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: The same -- he's the same (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BRUCE: The president would be making a mistake and I'm sure that people are telling him that the fight would be over after the midterms. Everyone will settle down and it will not, because the fight for the establishment - -</p><p>DOBBS: Who told you that? (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BRUCE: I'm sure some advices are. Well and other advisors within the establishment probably are telling him that, when in fact they know as you are correct, this is a long-term fight, this is not just about this term or this presidency, this is about whether or not the Donald Trump attitude, the new GOP would survive and it's a GOP that would be led by a man of action, Donald Trump with ideas that would help the American people, where management of the monster is no longer acceptable. That we've got to cut it down and really have government work for the people.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you think the American people have got the stomach for it?</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, we're the American people who defeated the British when everyone said we couldn't. Look at what we've accomplished from the beginning. We are so --</p><p>DOBBS: But that was on last -- that was on last week.</p><p>BRUCE: We are even more -- I think being revolutionary is in our DNA. We're even more committed to making sure that this experiment works because we are a relatively young country. Our generations will make it work, it's not going to fail on our watch, I can tell you that right now.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, and I'm going to say I hope the heck you're right. Tammy Bruce, always good to have you.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much. After calling for a free Palestine at the United Nations the destruction of Israel, CNN finally cut ties with Marc Lamont Hill, while his comments were polarizing for the -- for CNN. It's apparently just remarkable that his other employer might keep him on the job. You see, Hill also is a professor of Temple University and they say quote, his views are his own, no problem for them that he is anti-Israel and calling for the destruction of the country, incredible.</p><p>Up next, critical health concerns now involving more than a third of the 6,000 migrants crammed in a Tijuana Mexico Sports Complex. We take it up with Trump 2020 advisory board members Steve Rogers right after this quick break. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: On Wall Street, stocks closing lower slightly, barely. The Dow down 28 points, the S&amp;P lost six, the NASDAQ down 19. Not bad since the NASDAQ yesterday was up 200, the Dow up more than 600. Volume on the big board backing down to 3.5 billion shares from 3.9 yesterday.</p><p>Crude oil up nearly two percent, $51.00 a barrel. Gold close flat, silver down nearly half a percent, copper lost nearly a percent.</p><p>And a reminder, listen to my reports three times a day, Coast to Coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Disturbing news tonight out of Tijuana, 6,000 migrants crammed into a Sports Complex there. More than a third of them are being treated for health-related issues, more than 2,200 medically treated, more than 60 percent with respiratory infections. And 101 cases -- 101 cases of lice, four cases of chicken pox, serious concerns about the prospect of hepatitis because of the unsanitary conditions in which they're living. Other concerns also being outlined by the Department of Homeland Security, they have identified now more than 600 criminals and gang members that are travelling in that Caravan.</p><p>Joining me tonight to talk about the growing crisis on our border, security concerns in the president's fight to build a wall of course, Steve Rogers. A Trump 2020 advisory board member, former Navy lieutenant commander and a former FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force member. Steve, great to have you here.</p><p>STEVE ROGERS, ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, TRUMP 2020: Pleasure to be here.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with that Caravan, the president doing the right thing, securing the border. He's being attacked as he is always no matter what he does, by the establishment, by the left, by the right, by the Wall Street, Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce and then of course, Chuck Schumer and all of his buddies.</p><p>ROGERS: Lou, after 9/11 as a military Intel officer, I was assigned the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and we were watching, we were gathering intelligence and information about that border. And we had concerns back then, way back then who's crossing the border. Of course our concern was somebody would bring a dirty bomb across that border but we knew, we knew there was a drug cartel, we knew there was human trafficking. Nothing was done until Donald Trump became President of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: He's the first president and first presidential candidate to speak openly about the drug cartels and their role in corruption not only in Mexico but at the border on -- by the way, the American people are coming to the realization that corruption south of the border means there's corruption to the north of the border. And we're not doing nearly enough to fight that either.</p><p>ROGERS: And he's delivering on his promise that he would protect the American people. When you hear about 600 gang members this week, a gang member from MS-13 was arrested, I mean, my goodness how many did we not catch? So when he talks about protection he meant it and he's delivering.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, and by the way, MS-13 gang members are throughout the country for crying out loud. And this is the first president to actually do something about it. His Justice Department making headway, one of its few public at least accomplishments to this point.</p><p>The Cohen guilty plea, your reaction to what the left-wing media is making of it. Here's a business deal that was never done and now the great -- I mean, you list -- I don't know if you saw the clips that we had of the left-wing media just going nuts, there's no deal.</p><p>ROGERS: Lou, when I was doing investigations of police work and had a witness a so-called witness changed his story a dozen times. How do you believe him, why do you believe him? Look, Michael Cohen's out to save his own hide, and if he thinks he's going to save his hide on the back of the president United States, well, he's got another story coming his way.</p><p>DOBBS: The president's saying he's going to play tough with Democrats if they continue to frustrate him and attack him. That he's going to release some documents that they will find very disturbing, the documents about them. What do you make of this, the promise, the threat however you would start.</p><p>ROGERS: I believe that he knows what's in those documents, timing is everything. I know he cares for this country and I know that perhaps he doesn't want to do damage to the country even though it's the Democrats. He cares about our country but if he has to use those documents to defend himself, go ahead. You know what Lou, the American people despite what the polls say, I'm out there, they support this president, they value his judgment.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, I'm troubled by a number of reports that are coming out. One is that there would be a framework of a deal that he might reach with and this may be driven by Chinese propaganda in this country, that he might come up with a framework that would be satisfactory for a while and defer tariffs rather than continue with the tariffs and stay tough with them.</p><p>And by the way, if that were the case there would still be the matter of a half a trillion dollars in stolen American intellectual property each and every year. These are disturbing reports and they're being driven in some measure by -- I'll call them what they really are, they're never Trumpers and establishment RINO Republicans within his own administration.</p><p>ROGERS: Well let's look at that let's look at what the president has done already. He has never compromised on the security of this country, never. And I believe that he's going to be driven by that even with this issue in China.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I think you're exactly right and I have to wonder though when we look at this Mary Kissel appointment a never Trumper. I read the -- to the audience a number of the -- of the tweets her absolute pro-China, pro- fanitical actually, free-trade beliefs and her attacks on the president. What in the world is Mike Pompeo thinking of and why -- how could you even rationalize this?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, difficult for us to rationalize it but I got to tell you, I trust the judgement in to president and I'm sure he is going to make sure she or anyone else supports his policies, he's the boss not Mike Pompeo, no one else, he's the President of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, I think that may be a news break for Mike Pompeo based on his most recent hire.</p><p>ROGERS: Well --</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you so much, Steve. Great to have you here, Steve Rogers.</p><p>A new report from the Center for Disease Control shows life expectancy in this country has declined for the second time in the past three years. The average life expectancy last year fell to just over 78-1/2 years old. The CDC says an increase in drug overdoses and suicides in this country are to blame for this alarming trend.</p><p>Last year nearly 70,000 people died from drug overdoses, a 10 percent increase from the previous year. Last year more than 47,000 suicides up from the 45,000 in the previous year. Overall, nearly three million people in this country died last year at 70,000 more deaths than in the previous year.</p><p>Up next, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling Congress his company doesn't sell your data, that doesn't mean they don't try or that they really don't. Really, what does it all mean? We take it up after the break with cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright. He joins us here next stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Internal e-mail show Facebook considered profiting by selling companies access to your personal data. The e-mails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal also suggests Facebook employees talked about pushing some advertisers to spend more and return for increased access to user data.</p><p>Joining me now to take up what is going on in Silicon Valley and big tech, to take up Facebook and the company's growing struggles, and the increased cyber threats from Russia, from China, and Iran, Former Senior Adviser in the State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program, former Law Enforcement Adviser to the RNC and cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright. Morgan, great to see you. I want to compliment you on your recent op-ed in the Hill --</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: -- in which you said point-blank that high-techs globalism is killing patriotism in this country.</p><p>WRIGHT: Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: This is right now it seems to me the prospects for regulating out- of-control technology companies with huge, huge economic concentration in power this time may be right. What are your -- what are your thoughts?</p><p>WRIGHT: That's why Sarbanes-Oxley came about, Lou. And you know those things that led up to that you know, Adelphia, Tyco, Enron. Pretty soon the government said, hey, we're not going to take this anymore and so you go through litigation, you sue, you go through regulation like with the SEC and the FCC and the FTC. And then pretty soon it's like OK, Congress goes, we've had enough of this, we're going to pass a law and now it's going to be you know codified and your guys are going to -- and people went to jail, Lou. People went to jail with Sarbanes-Oxley.</p><p>So you know, what we're going to find out is that I think this issue of privacy is I think is the watershed moment where we start listening at what's happening in the E.U. with his seven countries that have filed against Google for tracking them, the issue of privacy, Facebook you know, Cambridge Analytical. This all has to come to a head sometime and I think 2019 is going to be the year for it.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, it's a hell of a note when the Europeans have more impressive laws protecting consumers, protecting our personal data than does the United States. It's incredible me that we are -- have lag to this far and given high tech such a pass. I want to just turn to a specific issue and that is Google. Do you -- Pichai is going to be talking before the --</p><p>WRIGHT: Finally, finally.</p><p>DOBBS: Finally, he'll be talking to Congress. Meanwhile, he's doing business with China. That's -- it's an extraordinary mess. There's just no constraint and apparently no effort to bring -- to rein in Google and its absolutely pro-Chinese policies which are effectively the result is anti-American.</p><p>WRIGHT: Look, and that's why the one of the reasons I wrote the op-ed -- and look my father was a World War Two vet, he was also a Vietnam vet. I mean, there were people that -- you know, we've lost a lot of people in defense of freedom to fight people like what China has become. And what has happened is we lack this patriotism. Now, it's OK to have America first. We can still have a view of the world. But in that op-ed that I wrote in the research that I did, I found out that 47 percent of these CEOs believe in globalism. They believe the broader, they believe the world should profit first before -- and be taken care of before the United States, but yet they built their businesses on the opportunities that came from the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: That's right.</p><p>WRIGHT: And I think Google is opening up, the AI the artificial intelligence center in Shanghai and they go, it's going to be a vibrant place. Well, guess what, in China nothing gets built there that doesn't get shared with the military, yet they turned our military down and threw them to the curb on Project Maven on using artificial intelligence so we could save soldier's lives and save other civilians lives so they don't become collateral damage and yet where's the outrage on that?</p><p>They were more concerned about Project Maven than they are the censored search engine that Google is defending still to this day. They say they're not building it but they haven't thrown it to the curb yet either.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, and meanwhile we're watching Chinese companies continue their advances here, the front companies that are carrying out espionage 20 percent of place is reserved for foreign students and our universities. You can mark it any way you want it is a zero-sum game. That means 20 percent of those seats didn't go to an American student and there is no discussion whatsoever, no public policy about what is occurred by most of these universities that are left-wing driven, they are left-wing indoctrination centers.</p><p>And we're looking at statistics now in surveys showing the millennial -- the millennial generation is the product of that indoctrination process in our public schools and on our education.</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes. During a congressional hearing, FBI Director Wray talked about the Confucius Institutes to what China's putting all this money. He talked about that this is simply a front for the Chinese government to commit espionage, to commit the theft of intellectual property. 60 percent of the foreign students in the United States now are Chinese. We have them in some of the most sensitive programs getting PhDs and things around material science and artificial intelligence.</p><p>And guess what, all of that's going back to China along with the forced transfer of Technology if you want to do business in China, you got to play by their rules. Hey, if they want to do that that's fine. I think we ought to do the same thing to Huawei and ZTE and all the other Chinese companies who want to sell stuff in the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: And this President relented with President Xi.</p><p>WRIGHT: Unfortunately on Huawei, he did. Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: And that's got to be reversed too because what is happening is it is -- it's just unthinkable that we're letting this happen to this great country and this president is responsible for driving these policies that will preserve the republic one hopes. Morgan Wright, always good to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>WRIGHT: Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS: And I think I should be very clear to all why it is that the establishment is represented by the leadership of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the Wall Street, the Koch Brothers are having a fit as this President's policies move us -- move us forward. They can't stand it because they know they're going to have to give up their globalist interest in favor of America first. Well, Morgan Wright, always good to have you here.</p><p>Broward County residents will foot -- be footing the bill for Brenda Snipes election antics even after she leaves office. You aknow, some would call them antics, some would call it fraud. Starting in January, Snipes will receive a total of $130,000 a year in pensions. Residents of Florida will be paying for her incompetence for years and years to come for a job well done, of course.</p><p>Up next -- well, you know what? I'm going to surprise you on the side. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news and it is highly unexpected news from the Republican Party. House Freedom Caucus Co-Founder Jim Jordan will indeed become the Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee. (INAUDIBLE) is saying the Steering Committee voted unanimously in Jordan's favor. North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows who had expressed interest in the same job celebrated the decision saying this is one of the few times that he can take real pleasure in the success of Mr. Jordan.</p><p>A remind tore vote in tonight's poll.

Our top  stories, President Trump due to land I in about an hour.  Taking with him  his America First message of free and fair trade to the summit of G20  leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping who is feeling the full  source of Trump policy and American tariffs.  We'll talk about the  President's efforts to save American jobs, to stop Chinese theft of  American intellectual property with former state department senior adviser  Christian Whiton.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also tonight, the out of control Mueller witch-hunt has reach new depths of  pathetic desperation.  This time trying to squeeze the President's former  personal attorney Michael Cohen over a business deal that never occurred.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We had a position to  possibly do a deal to build a building of some kind in Moscow.  I decided  not to do it.  The primary reason, it could have been other reasons but the  primary reason it was simple.  I was focused on running for President.   There would be nothing wrong if I did do it.  I was running my business  while I was campaigning.</p><p>There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won in which case I would have  gotten back into the business and why should I lose lots of opportunities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  And disturbing new revelations about the threat posed to public  security and public health by the caravan massing at the U.S.-Mexico  border.  Hundreds of migrants reportedly known criminals carrying  potentially deadly infectious diseases.  We take up that report with former  FBI Intelligence officer Steve Rogers with us tonight.  </p><p>Also RINO lame-duck speaker, you remember him, Paul Ryan, he lost the House  for Republicans, he sabotaged candidates but none of that stopping him from  lecturing the Republican Party on who should be the party's next standard  bearer.  We'll tell you about his latest outrage here next.  </p><p>Our top story, President Trump on his way to Argentina tonight where he  will assuredly push ahead with his America First agenda.  While at the  summit the President will also sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping  to discuss the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries prior to his  departure for Argentina, the President addressed the prospects of a new  trade deal with China.</p><p>Soon after Air Force One left the tarmac, the administration announced the  President would be accompanied by White House trade policy adviser, Peter  Navarro.  At that meeting where Xi knew that the left wing business media - - get ready for this, they decided that at that moment the market was down  so they blamed -- that's right, Navarro showing up at the Xi dinner for the  markets losses.</p><p>Then the group at CNBC claimed upon Navarro's attendance at the Xi meeting,  stocks fail to their lows of the day.  The network also said then stocks  were trading higher but \"dimming hopes of a trade deal between China and  U.S. cap gains on Wall Street and then the market moved higher.  Of course,  and they didn't know what to say.  Here to take up the President's Trump to  the G20 Summit and what to expect from his meetings with globalist leaders,  Christian Whiton.</p><p>Former stated department senior advisor to the Trump and George W. Bush  administrations.  Christian, great to have you with us.  Let's start first  with China and the prospects of the deal.  This sounds like -- it sounds  like some advertising for some real disappointment for those who are  expecting the President to continue his tough policy position on trade with  China.  </p><p>MICHAEL WHITON, FORMER TRUMP STATE DEPARTMENT SENIOR ADVISER:  Yes.  It  also sounds like deja vu.  You know, we supposedly had a big deal with  China early in the administration at Mar-a-Lago and that was supposed to  lead to some wonders of trade.  Chinese didn't really do anything with it.   That fell apart.  And then earlier this spring, March, April, I think Larry  Kudlow went on T.V. and said the trade war was over.</p><p>Interesting.  They didn't want to call it that before.  And that there was  some deal.  The President looked at this deal and then decided to apply  sanctions.  I think again the Chinese are doing that, they're raising hype.   They're going to try and offer some framework and say we're serious this  time, trust us and just don't put the higher tariffs that are scheduled for  January 1 or the second or the third trench of big tariffs that the  President has offered.</p><p>But, you know, nothing really happens at the G20 and I don't think China is  going to fundamentally change its system over dinner.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Over dinner nor has it shown any disposition to do so.  The  President himself putting the kibosh at -- on these reports what he would  likely style as fake news, that there would be some sort of framework come  out of this which is usually -- no offense, Christian, given your  background in the state department.  It sounds like typical gobbledygook  coming out of the state department that, you know, that it just means  nothing and really pretends nothing.  </p><p>WHITON:  Right.  Well, and then also could be coming out of the treasury  department.  And as you pointed out it's the left-wing financial press  saying what they -- they're hearing what they want to hear.  But if you  look at Xi Jinping having just crowned himself, he's in no mood to make  compromises either and it would be disastrous of course for President Trump  to make a compromise that undermines the hard work he's done.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, we've got all sorts of -- in this administration, we  actually have never-Trumpers within the administration who are working very  hard, I give you anonymous, the author of that anonymous op-ed in The New  York Times who's never been found out or at least identified publicly.   This is a -- this s a strange time.  And the President deciding today that  he's not going to meet with Vladimir Putin because of his aggression  against Ukraine.  What do you make of it?  </p><p>WHITON:  Well, here again we see the President is much tougher on Russia  than his predecessors.  Of course, the media still say he's soft on Russia,  they say he's friendly with dictators.  You know, Obama and his Secretary  of State John Kerry said they were going to get tough on Russia after  Russia invaded Ukraine.  The year after that in 2015, John Kerry goes head  and hand to hand in meet Vladimir Putin who keeps him waiting.</p><p>And then they chuck it up for four hours.  Trump has actually isolated  Russia.  He has armed Russia's opponents.  He has reacted significantly and  he doesn't get credit.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you know who else doesn't get credit is Silicon Valley and  high-tech companies, big tech.  And their relationship with China and their  acquiescence it appears in politics in this country.  They're not standing  up supporting the President.  They're not trying to forcibly volubly stop  the theft, hundreds of billions of dollars by China.  Why not?  </p><p>WHITON:  Well, it's -- they see it to their financial benefit I assume.   Although I don't think in the long run it is.  You know, I don't think in  the long run it's good for Apple that they were not willing to help the FBI  unlock a terrorist cell phone but they are willing to help China sense with  the internet.  All across Silicon Valley they're complaining now that the  administration, that the government is finally looking at Chinese here who  are conducting industrial espionage.</p><p>Chinese nationals who are viewed as overseas Chinese by the Chinese  government, they are put under close surveillance, so are as students here  from China.  And they're used as assets and we're finally are getting to  the point where we're saying this is not good, this is being exploited by  our adversaries and will harm our security.  You know, if Silicon Valley  hot smart about this, send home the Chinese nationals, it would actually be  better long and they may have to pay Americans a few more bucks to do these  jobs.</p><p>But they'll save money in the long run because they'll keep their  intellectual property.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  And there would be more people who would be able to afford  Apple iPhone 10, it would be -- I think they would find to their advantage.   There's a new China study out from the Hoover Institution.  And I want to  read this part on the new China study saying beyond economic -- if we could  put that up, please.</p><p>Beyond economic espionage theft and forced technology transfer, China  captures much valuable new technology through its investments in U.S. high- tech companies and through its exploitation of the openness of American  university labs.  There is absolutely no, no vetting of students being  brought in from China.  These Chinese nationals are an important source of  that technology transfer.  Those are -- that's a nice expression for theft.</p><p>It is -- it is a calamity that's befallen this country.  And there is such  a willingness on the part of the leftist universities to continue this, 20  percent of most universities, major universities are going to international  students instead of Americans to begin with.  One has to ask why is that  and to -- and why -- who are they serving?  </p><p>WHITON:  Well, they're serving the needs of their administrators.  Of  course the professors are mostly left wing.  But the real -- the  mushrooming of staff of, you know, 18 vice chancellors for diversity and  gender studies at these universities, that's where the money is going to.   A new building, not actual education.  So yes, add to the ranks of  unpatriotic Silicon Valley types and universities and, you know who really  suffers are Asian Americans.</p><p>We've learned of course from this recent lawsuit that Harvard for example  has a quota on Asians that they're willing to accept.  And so they --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Asian Americans.  Asian Americans.</p><p>WHITON:  Exactly.  And so these Chinese who are here often being used as  assets by the Chinese government will pay full ride.  So they are pushing  Asian Americans who we ought to be training and ought to be giving  technical skills, not our adversaries.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Now, isn't it extraordinary? Asian Americans, citizens, are being  screened and international students, including Asians are being welcomed  with open arms as they -- as they help to maintain, if you will, those high  tuition levels for universities that for the most part are repositories of  left-wing indoctrination.  Christian Whiton, good to have you with us.   Thanks.  </p><p>WHITON:  Thanks, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Up next, with just a few weeks  left in Washington for this Congress, oh, they don't want to work too hard.   Five weeks remaining.  Just a little under that now.  Feckless lame-duck  speaker Paul Ryan using his remaining days, well, to just be an annoying  son of a gun.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES:  I think the Fed is by the way on the right track  normalizing.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Was that issue on the front of Donald J. Trump's mind?  </p><p>RYAN:  I think the immigration is just more on the front of his mind.  My  own view was, I would rather talk about the economy.  We don't want to have  a shutdown.  There's no -- I have no interest in doing that.  It makes no  sense.  He does create some hostility, Jim Acosta think Bob Mueller has  been left alone.  I think he's going to continue to be left alone.  But we  still ran on this better way agenda.  We put it in the place.  We put most  of these things into law.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  That man is absolutely delusional and self-absorbed.  Did I mention  that?  We'll take up the -- this ludicrous excuse for a speaker with Ed  Rollins when we come back.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  K Street owned RINO lame-duck Speaker Ryan says his former running  mate, do you remember the one who did so well in the 2012 presidential  elections?  That is incoming Senator Mitt Romney will soon pick up the on  obstructionist standard for the Republican Party left by John McCain.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RYAN:  He feels a sense of civic duty.  I think with John McCain passing,  for example, Mitt believes that there's a role for him in our party, in  being, you know, a statesman and a standard bearer in our party.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We've all been waiting for that.  You can tell that Paul Ryan has  been.  It must have slipped his -- well rather fragile mind that the  standard bearer of the party is the President of the United States for he  is the party's leaders and frankly its only hope.  Joining us tonight to  discuss all of this, top strategist for Great America PAC, former Reagan  White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst, Ed Rollins.</p><p>I have to say, I'm -- the Speaker continues to astound with his obtuseness,  his absolute delusion.  </p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well they don't -- they didn't believe  what Trump was advocating which is the conservative principles of the  Republican Party.  Romney didn't believe it, that's one of the reasons he  lost.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  He didn't believe in anything but Romney and Ryan doesn't believe  in anything but get lining his (INAUDIBLE) K Street.  These guys are owned  by the establishment.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  My great -- my great fear is that Romney is going to get in there  and when you've got two or three quote margins, anybody can play queen for  a day.  And Romney, you know, talking about him being the McCain of --  McCain basically destroyed the effort to get rid of Obamacare by one vote.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Basically he did it.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  And so we don't need another one.  We -- and it would have been  easy to elect somebody else in Utah.  Utah is not exactly a liberal  northeast state.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DOBBS:  It's getting more so though.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes.  But, you know, he was very insistent.  He wanted the  President's endorsement, the President was generous and did endorse him.</p><p>DOBBS:  And then he attacked the President.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  And my sense is Mitt Romney gets out there and wants to  basically be the new John McCain, there are a lot of us that are concerned  that will go out there and attack him for whatever form we may have.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The Republican Party seems to be at an existential juncture.   You've got idiots like so many of those in leadership, in both the Senate  and the House who working against the President, actively and vigorously.   If they did their jobs with half as much energy, much could be done by the  -- by the Hill.  But they don't have that.  And they don't have -- you  know, frankly, I can't even imagine why there is such a thing as a  Republican Party right now because you're watching this kind of nonsense.</p><p>Mitt Romney coming in, Paul Ryan going out.  All of it -- all of it is so  unfortunate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, unfortunately Paul Ryan is not going away.  Paul Ryan is  going to be there somewhere.  He has an ambition to be President some day.  </p><p>DOBBS:  You know what he's going to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes.  Well, he will be.</p><p>DOBBS:  He's got to line his pockets.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  For a while and then he'll go back to politics in Wisconsin and  run for governor or run for something else.  </p><p>DOBBS:  So what's the Republican Party going to do because they look like  damn fools.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, the Republican Party today is Donald Trump.  If you don't  like that then go find another party because the vast majority of Americans  say they're self identify as Republicans overwhelmingly, even more than  when I worked for Ronald Reagan are Trump supporters.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Trump supporters have got to be scratching their heads  tonight.  Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state has just hired a never- Trumper, a pro-China mad fanatic free trader at any cost to America, Mary  Kissel.  I mean, how does she get hired?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I have no idea.  I'm shocked by it.  I like May personally, I've  been in many shows (INAUDIBLE) but she is not a Trump person.  She doesn't  believe in the policies that the President advocates.  And for her to be  going in as a senior advisor the Secretary of State to me is astonishing. </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, let's look at a couple of things that we're talking about.   She call for example, the Helsinki Summit with Putin and the President a  great propaganda victory for Putin.  Call Trump -- the Trump  administration's aide to farmers.  A taxpayer solution to a government  problem.  Criticize the President for cancelling military exercises with  South Korea.  It goes on and on.  She is just -- just doesn't make a lick  of sense.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  And why she is there is, you know, there are enough never-Trumpers  and Bush establishment types that permeate the government as well as of  course Obama leftovers.  What the hell are they thinking? </p><p>ROLLINS:  With the two years left in this administration, this term, and  get ready for a reelection campaign, you've got to make sure your people  are loyal to you and believe in what your policies are.  And I was still in  the White House --</p><p>DOBBS:  So what is Mike Pompeo thinking ?  </p><p>ROLLINS:  I have no idea.  I mean, someone should have said to him no,  thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  You cannot have it.  I want to give  you a rational or you can have.   All you have to do is go read her  columns, go read her tweets.  She's been very public about this.  And  again, she's a nice person, articulate person but not a Trump person.  </p><p>DOBBS:  The previous secretary of state for this administration did the  same thing and got his tail kicked.  This one, it looks to me, deserves the  same response by the White House.  I can't think imagine why it's not  happening.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  The President or someone will have a heart to heart with him and  saying this is the most important thing.  We're going to be doing in the  next two years, our foreign policy stuff and this is my policy.  I want  people over there to advocate my policy.  The state department is hard to  move forward on anybody's agenda but their own.  So --</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, the great thing is this President is moving things by  himself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  This is the man driving the North Korea engagement, he is also  driving the new doctrine against China and, frankly, as a Christian Whiton  pointed out, this President has been far tougher, for example, than his  predecessors against the nonsense of Vladimir Putin.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, I would hope our good friend John Bolton would basically  step in and do something on this -- on this front.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, and thank goodness that John is there.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Absolutely.  I agree.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Ed Rollins, as always.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to have you here.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Congressman Jim Jordan bowing out of the race to be the ranking  member of the House Judiciary Committee.  Jordan's spokesman saying this,  \"it has been made clear to him that leadership is going to be selecting  someone else\".  Of course Kevin McCarthy is a, you know, a mini me of Paul  Ryan, establishment hack.  There remains a possibility Jordan could  challenge Mark Meadows, talking about an extraordinary development for the  ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.</p><p>I wouldn't bet on that either with Kevin McCarthy following in Paul Ryan's  footsteps.  And by the way, I'm sure following this guidance of the same K  Street masters as did his predecessor.  </p><p>Be sure to vote in the poll tonight.

The left-wing national media has their hair on fire over Michael  Cohen's new plea deal with the special counsel.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's Shakespearean because somebody who said he would  take a bullet for Donald Trump is now pointing the gun at him.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today is a good day for Donald Trump to resign.  I  really believe that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a rational explanation for why he was so pro- Putin.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What this represents is the possibility of something  very simple, that there was money in it for Donald Trump.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The plea today by Cohen tells us that there is a  financial connection here.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Michael Cohen could be the most -- single most  terrifying person for Donald Trump.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, yes.   Frightening.  Scary.  Oh boy.  Washington Times  columnist Tammy Bruce joins me right after the break to take that up as  well as the latest in the Mueller witch-hunt.  All of that evidence that  they've built over the course of two years, it's just astonishing, isn't  it?  No wonder the President -- well, we'll take that up next.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Breaking news now.  President Trump will not be meeting with  Russian President Putin during the upcoming G20 Summit in Argentina.   President Trump tweeted out his decision earlier today citing growing  tension between Russia and Ukraine.  Russia hasn't yet released the  Ukrainian vessels and sailors that it seized last week in the Black Sea.  </p><p>President Trump slamming the Mueller witch-hunt again this morning in a  series of tweets calling the probe illegal, ridiculous and a disgrace.  All  of which were true.  We'd like to add it it's simply pathetic.  In addition  to working out a plea deal with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen who has  zero information about the President's alleged Russia collusion because  there is none.  Mueller no focusing on late-night calls between the  President and Roger Stone.</p><p>That's what he has been reduced to in this.  Mueller is trying to squeeze  author Jerome Corsi, a journalist and conservative who said he will file --  he will be filing a criminal lawsuit against Mueller.  Mueller is  absolutely -- his tactics have blown up in his face since Trump campaign  manager Paul Manafort reached a plea deal and we'll see how that works out.  </p><p>Joining me now to take up the President's upcoming G20 Summit, the impact  it could have on the United States, China and Russia relations, Tammy  Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Great to have  you with us.  I've got to start with Ryan.  Can you imagine this -- I mean  the words fail me.  He is such an ignoramus that it is -- it's unspeakable  what the Speaker is.  </p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's remarkable.  His -- and I  think he's serious when he expresses as a kind of -- a genuine shock at why  they would have lost the midterms and not knowing why that would happen.  I  do think, though, that he's not necessarily a dumb man.  I think he knows - - </p><p>DOBBS:  Oh, I think he is.  I think you're -- I think you're -- I think  you're very safe to go there.  </p><p>BRUCE: He -- a lot of Republicans wanted this kind of a punch at the  president.  I don't think that they necessarily mind losing the House  because now the --</p><p>DOBBS:  Republicans?</p><p>BRUCE:  I think they don't mind the Democrats being in charge and leading  the chart.</p><p>DOBBS:  Who's they?</p><p>BRUCE:  The Republicans in the -- in the House.</p><p>DOBBS:  You mean the --</p><p>BRUCE:  I mean, the leadership.</p><p>DOBBS:  The leadership?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Well, certainly not all of them, the Freedom Caucus but not.   But I think that --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, they're complete idiots then and they should lose, they  should be then disbanded.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well it's -- they're the managers of the monster.  I think this  argument that there's partisanship in Washington is a fraud.  I think that  that's theater for the -- for the Hoipolloi in the country.  And that this  is really about -- you know, pulling the wool over our eyes and getting the  man --getting the monster to be as plump as it can be and managing it while  pretending to really be conservative or liberal.  That's what I think the  Republicans have been doing for quite some time.</p><p>DOBBS:  The Republican Party, the establishment wing of that party.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  The vast -- the vast number of Republicans, I think you're right.   There is a little problem though, you've got a guy by the name of Donald  Trump who's president of the United States who ran against his  establishment.  In point of fact, he's running against every one of those  idiots in the Republican parties who are really Democrats posing as  Republicans, I think you're right in that construction.  But this president  is right now, he is harvesting -- you know, these seeds of anti- establishmentarianism that he's been planning throughout the country for a  several years now.  This is a real war.</p><p>BRUCE:  It is.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's a fight that I hope the president doesn't ever get tired of  waging, because so much depends on his strength, his leadership and the  weakness of these fools.  I mean, there's no other expression for what a  Paul Ryan is.</p><p>BRUCE:  There is a sentiment I think that --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Kevin McCarthy by the way is coming in right behind him.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes. </p><p>DOBBS:  The same -- he's the same (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BRUCE:  The president would be making a mistake and I'm sure that people  are telling him that the fight would be over after the midterms.  Everyone  will settle down and it will not, because the fight for the establishment - -</p><p>DOBBS:  Who told you that? (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BRUCE:  I'm sure some advices are.  Well and other advisors within the  establishment probably are telling him that, when in fact they know as you  are correct, this is a long-term fight, this is not just about this term or  this presidency, this is about whether or not the Donald Trump attitude,  the new GOP would survive and it's a GOP that would be led by a man of  action, Donald Trump with ideas that would help the American people, where  management of the monster is no longer acceptable.  That we've got to cut  it down and really have government work for the people.</p><p>DOBBS:  Do you think the American people have got the stomach for it?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, we're the American people who defeated the British when  everyone said we couldn't.  Look at what we've accomplished from the  beginning.  We are so --</p><p>DOBBS:  But that was on last -- that was on last week.</p><p>BRUCE:  We are even more -- I think being revolutionary is in our DNA.   We're even more committed to making sure that this experiment works because  we are a relatively young country.  Our generations will make it work, it's  not going to fail on our watch, I can tell you that right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  OK, and I'm going to say I hope the heck you're right.  Tammy  Bruce, always good to have you.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thanks so much.  After calling for a free Palestine at the United  Nations the destruction of Israel, CNN finally cut ties with Marc Lamont  Hill, while his comments were polarizing for the -- for CNN.  It's  apparently just remarkable that his other employer might keep him on the  job.  You see, Hill also is a professor of Temple University and they say  quote, his views are his own, no problem for them that he is anti-Israel  and calling for the destruction of the country, incredible.</p><p>Up next, critical health concerns now involving more than a third of the  6,000 migrants crammed in a Tijuana Mexico Sports Complex.  We take it up  with Trump 2020 advisory board members Steve Rogers right after this quick  break.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  On Wall Street, stocks closing lower slightly, barely.  The Dow  down 28 points, the S&amp;P lost six, the NASDAQ down 19.  Not bad since the  NASDAQ yesterday was up 200, the Dow up more than 600.  Volume on the big  board backing down to 3.5 billion shares from 3.9 yesterday.</p><p>Crude oil up nearly two percent, $51.00 a barrel.  Gold close flat, silver  down nearly half a percent, copper lost nearly a percent.</p><p>And a reminder, listen to my reports three times a day, Coast to Coast on  the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Disturbing news tonight out of Tijuana, 6,000 migrants crammed into a  Sports Complex there.  More than a third of them are being treated for  health-related issues, more than 2,200 medically treated, more than 60  percent with respiratory infections.  And 101 cases -- 101 cases of lice,  four cases of chicken pox, serious concerns about the prospect of hepatitis  because of the unsanitary conditions in which they're living.  Other  concerns also being outlined by the Department of Homeland Security, they  have identified now more than 600 criminals and gang members that are  travelling in that Caravan.</p><p>Joining me tonight to talk about the growing crisis on our border, security  concerns in the president's fight to build a wall of course, Steve Rogers.   A Trump 2020 advisory board member, former Navy lieutenant commander and a  former FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force member.  Steve, great to have you  here.</p><p>STEVE ROGERS, ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, TRUMP 2020:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with that Caravan, the president doing the right thing,  securing the border.  He's being attacked as he is always no matter what he  does, by the establishment, by the left, by the right, by the Wall Street,  Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce and then of course, Chuck Schumer  and all of his buddies.</p><p>ROGERS:  Lou, after 9/11 as a military Intel officer, I was assigned the  FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and we were watching, we were gathering  intelligence and information about that border.  And we had concerns back  then, way back then who's crossing the border.  Of course our concern was  somebody would bring a dirty bomb across that border but we knew, we knew  there was a drug cartel, we knew there was human trafficking.  Nothing was  done until Donald Trump became President of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS:  He's the first president and first presidential candidate to speak  openly about the drug cartels and their role in corruption not only in  Mexico but at the border on -- by the way, the American people are coming  to the realization that corruption south of the border means there's  corruption to the north of the border.  And we're not doing nearly enough  to fight that either.</p><p>ROGERS:  And he's delivering on his promise that he would protect the  American people.  When you hear about 600 gang members this week, a gang  member from MS-13 was arrested, I mean, my goodness how many did we not  catch?  So when he talks about protection he meant it and he's delivering.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and by the way, MS-13 gang members are throughout the country  for crying out loud.  And this is the first president to actually do  something about it.  His Justice Department making headway, one of its few  public at least accomplishments to this point.</p><p>The Cohen guilty plea, your reaction to what the left-wing media is making  of it.  Here's a business deal that was never done and now the great -- I  mean, you list -- I don't know if you saw the clips that we had of the  left-wing media just going nuts, there's no deal.</p><p>ROGERS:  Lou, when I was doing investigations of police work and had a  witness a so-called witness changed his story a dozen times.  How do you  believe him, why do you believe him?  Look, Michael Cohen's out to save his  own hide, and if he thinks he's going to save his hide on the back of the  president United States, well, he's got another story coming his way.</p><p>DOBBS:  The president's saying he's going to play tough with Democrats if  they continue to frustrate him and attack him.  That he's going to release  some documents that they will find very disturbing, the documents about  them.  What do you make of this, the promise, the threat however you would  start.</p><p>ROGERS:  I believe that he knows what's in those documents, timing is  everything.  I know he cares for this country and I know that perhaps he  doesn't want to do damage to the country even though it's the Democrats.   He cares about our country but if he has to use those documents to defend  himself, go ahead.  You know what Lou, the American people despite what the  polls say, I'm out there, they support this president, they value his  judgment.</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, I'm troubled by a number of reports that are coming out.   One is that there would be a framework of a deal that he might reach with  and this may be driven by Chinese propaganda in this country, that he might  come up with a framework that would be satisfactory for a while and defer  tariffs rather than continue with the tariffs and stay tough with them.  </p><p>And by the way, if that were the case there would still be the matter of a  half a trillion dollars in stolen American intellectual property each and  every year.  These are disturbing reports and they're being driven in some  measure by -- I'll call them what they really are, they're never Trumpers  and establishment RINO Republicans within his own administration.</p><p>ROGERS:  Well let's look at that let's look at what the president has done  already.  He has never compromised on the security of this country, never.   And I believe that he's going to be driven by that even with this issue in  China.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I think you're exactly right and I have to wonder though when  we look at this Mary Kissel appointment a never Trumper.  I read the -- to  the audience a number of the -- of the tweets her absolute pro-China, pro- fanitical actually, free-trade beliefs and her attacks on the president.   What in the world is Mike Pompeo thinking of and why -- how could you even  rationalize this?</p><p>ROGERS:  Well, difficult for us to rationalize it but I got to tell you, I  trust the judgement in to president and I'm sure he is going to make sure  she or anyone else supports his policies, he's the boss not Mike Pompeo, no  one else, he's the President of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, I think that may be a news break for Mike Pompeo based on his  most recent hire.</p><p>ROGERS:  Well --</p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you so much, Steve.  Great to have you here, Steve Rogers.</p><p>A new report from the Center for Disease Control shows life expectancy in  this country has declined for the second time in the past three years.  The  average life expectancy last year fell to just over 78-1/2 years old.  The  CDC says an increase in drug overdoses and suicides in this country are to  blame for this alarming trend.</p><p>Last year nearly 70,000 people died from drug overdoses, a 10 percent  increase from the previous year.  Last year more than 47,000 suicides up  from the 45,000 in the previous year.

Really, what does it all mean?  We take it up after the break with  cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.  He joins us here next stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Internal e-mail show Facebook considered profiting by selling  companies access to your personal data.  The e-mails reviewed by The Wall  Street Journal also suggests Facebook employees talked about pushing some  advertisers to spend more and return for increased access to user data.  </p><p>Joining me now to take up what is going on in Silicon Valley and big tech,  to take up Facebook and the company's growing struggles, and the increased  cyber threats from Russia, from China, and Iran, Former Senior Adviser in  the State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program, former Law  Enforcement Adviser to the RNC and cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright.   Morgan, great to see you.  I want to compliment you on your recent op-ed in  the Hill -- </p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in which you said point-blank that high-techs globalism is  killing patriotism in this country.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Absolutely. </p><p>DOBBS:  This is right now it seems to me the prospects for regulating out- of-control technology companies with huge, huge economic concentration in  power this time may be right.  What are your -- what are your thoughts? </p><p>WRIGHT:  That's why Sarbanes-Oxley came about, Lou.  And you know those  things that led up to that you know, Adelphia, Tyco, Enron.  Pretty soon  the government said, hey, we're not going to take this anymore and so you  go through litigation, you sue, you go through regulation like with the SEC  and the FCC and the FTC.  And then pretty soon it's like OK, Congress goes,  we've had enough of this, we're going to pass a law and now it's going to  be you know codified and your guys are going to -- and people went to jail,  Lou.  People went to jail with Sarbanes-Oxley. </p><p>So you know, what we're going to find out is that I think this issue of  privacy is I think is the watershed moment where we start listening at  what's happening in the E.U. with his seven countries that have filed  against Google for tracking them, the issue of privacy, Facebook you know,  Cambridge Analytical.  This all has to come to a head sometime and I think  2019 is going to be the year for it. </p><p>DOBBS:  You know, it's a hell of a note when the Europeans have more  impressive laws protecting consumers, protecting our personal data than  does the United States.  It's incredible me that we are -- have lag to this  far and given high tech such a pass.  I want to just turn to a specific  issue and that is Google.  Do you -- Pichai is going to be talking before  the -- </p><p>WRIGHT:  Finally, finally. </p><p>DOBBS:  Finally, he'll be talking to Congress.  Meanwhile, he's doing  business with China.  That's -- it's an extraordinary mess.  There's just  no constraint and apparently no effort to bring -- to rein in Google and  its absolutely pro-Chinese policies which are effectively the result is  anti-American. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, and that's why the one of the reasons I wrote the op-ed --  and look my father was a World War Two vet, he was also a Vietnam vet.  I  mean, there were people that -- you know, we've lost a lot of people in  defense of freedom to fight people like what China has become.  And what  has happened is we lack this patriotism.  Now, it's OK to have America  first.  We can still have a view of the world.  But in that op-ed that I  wrote in the research that I did, I found out that 47 percent of these CEOs  believe in globalism.  They believe the broader, they believe the world  should profit first before -- and be taken care of before the United  States, but yet they built their businesses on the opportunities that came  from the United States. </p><p>DOBBS:  That's right. </p><p>WRIGHT:  And I think Google is opening up, the AI the artificial  intelligence center in Shanghai and they go, it's going to be a vibrant  place.  Well, guess what, in China nothing gets built there that doesn't  get shared with the military, yet they turned our military down and threw  them to the curb on Project Maven on using artificial intelligence so we  could save soldier's lives and save other civilians lives so they don't  become collateral damage and yet where's the outrage on that?</p><p>They were more concerned about Project Maven than they are the censored  search engine that Google is defending still to this day.  They say they're  not building it but they haven't thrown it to the curb yet either. </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and meanwhile we're watching Chinese companies continue their  advances here, the front companies that are carrying out espionage 20  percent of place is reserved for foreign students and our universities.   You can mark it any way you want it is a zero-sum game.  That means 20  percent of those seats didn't go to an American student and there is no  discussion whatsoever, no public policy about what is occurred by most of  these universities that are left-wing driven, they are left-wing  indoctrination centers. </p><p>And we're looking at statistics now in surveys showing the millennial --  the millennial generation is the product of that indoctrination process in  our public schools and on our education.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  During a congressional hearing, FBI Director Wray talked  about the Confucius Institutes to what China's putting all this money.  He  talked about that this is simply a front for the Chinese government to  commit espionage, to commit the theft of intellectual property.  60 percent  of the foreign students in the United States now are Chinese.  We have them  in some of the most sensitive programs getting PhDs and things around  material science and artificial intelligence.  </p><p>And guess what, all of that's going back to China along with the forced  transfer of Technology if you want to do business in China, you got to play  by their rules.  Hey, if they want to do that that's fine.  I think we  ought to do the same thing to Huawei and ZTE and all the other Chinese  companies who want to sell stuff in the United States. </p><p>DOBBS:  And this President relented with President Xi.  </p><p>WRIGHT:  Unfortunately on Huawei, he did.  Absolutely. </p><p>DOBBS:  And that's got to be reversed too because what is happening is it  is -- it's just unthinkable that we're letting this happen to this great  country and this president is responsible for driving these policies that  will preserve the republic one hopes.  Morgan Wright, always good to have  you with us.  Thanks so much. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  And I think I should be very clear to all why it is that the  establishment is represented by the leadership of the Republican Party, the  Democratic Party, the Wall Street, the Koch Brothers are having a fit as  this President's policies move us -- move us forward.  They can't stand it  because they know they're going to have to give up their globalist interest  in favor of America first.  Well, Morgan Wright, always good to have you  here.  </p><p>Broward County residents will foot -- be footing the bill for Brenda Snipes  election antics even after she leaves office.  You aknow, some would call  them antics, some would call it fraud.  Starting in January, Snipes will  receive a total of $130,000 a year in pensions.  Residents of Florida will  be paying for her incompetence for years and years to come for a job well  done, of course.  </p><p>Up next -- well, you know what?  I'm going to surprise you on the side.   We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Breaking news and it is highly unexpected news from the Republican  Party.  House Freedom Caucus Co-Founder Jim Jordan will indeed become the  Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee.  (INAUDIBLE) is saying the  Steering Committee voted unanimously in Jordan's favor.  North Carolina  Congressman Mark Meadows who had expressed interest in the same job  celebrated the decision saying this is one of the few times that he can  take real pleasure in the success of Mr. Jordan.</p><p>A remind tore vote in tonight's poll.  Do you believe RINO Paul Ryan will  soon join the Democratic Party where he has belonged throughout his career?   Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs.  </p><p>That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Author and  journalist Jerome Corsi and the President of the Center for Security Policy  Fred Fleitz among our guests tomorrow.  Please join us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Hey, Laura. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hey, Judge Jeanine. How are you? Fantastic  show tonight as always. Love the Bongino segment. Fantastic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> PIRRO: Well, we love Dan Bongino. He's a fighter wherever you need one.  Anyway, where are you tonight? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> INGRAHAM:  We are in Chicago having a lot of fun, causing a little trouble,  but all in a good way, the good trouble in a good way. </p><p> PIRRO:  Make sure you have Giordano's pizza.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  You know something, you are the second person who told me that  so I'm on it. Judge Jeanine, thank you so much. Great show. </p><p> PIRRO:  All right. Have a great show.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right, welcome to THE INGRAHAM Angle.  I'm Laura Ingraham  live from Chicago tonight and we're going to explain why in just a little  bit. </p><p> The president just wrapping up a raucous rally in Indiana in Evansville.  We're going to breakdown his remarks throughout the hours so stick with us. </p><p> Also tonight, are congressional Republicans about to go to war with big  tech? House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to join us later in the  hour to break it all down. The looming fight over bias in Silicon Valley. </p><p> Plus, the reason we are here, violence continues to rock this amazing  American city, and while its political leaders might be asleep at the  switch, we came to get answers. Fox's own Gianno Caldwell went to some of  the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere in this country to talk to gang  bangers and ex-cons. Some exclusive video you do not want to miss. </p><p> But first, as we just mentioned, the president is taking all comers tonight  in Evansville and if you are just getting caught up, here is what you may  have missed. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York  Times,\" which, by the way, if I wasn't here, they would be out of business.  \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times,\" CNN. So, a writer for \"The New  York Times\" that pretends she knows what she's talking about, hasn't got a  clue. </p><p> And I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same, the place was packed, she  made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty  chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom may be. And listen -- and he  was so disappointed at the tone in the room. NBC, which is probably worse  than CNN, but the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great  thing to do. How smart. That's what the worth. Who knows? With these  people, you never know.</p><p> By the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, governor, look how many cameras  you have back there. It's just like the academy awards. Look at it. They  can't get enough! But when they start screaming fake news, you see those  red lights go off for a little while. Excuse me, we have technical  difficulties. OK, then they go back. Right? Look at that. You know, in the  studio, you hear they go, \"listen, he's about ready to go, look.\" ladies  and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties. </p><p> We need Republicans in Congress. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by  left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies,  and their fake news allies. </p><p> You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at  what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's  see. All I can say this, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of  it -- because inside, they have incredible people, but our Justice  Department, and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right  and doing it now because people are angry. People are angry. </p><p> What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point, I wanted to stay out,  but at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly, I want them to do  their job, I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to.  Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching and the whole world gets it  and the whole world understands exactly what is going on. </p><p> The Democrats, they called themselves the resistance. That is what they are  good at. Resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day,  they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine  the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 like never  before delivered. </p><p> The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly  undemocratic they really have become, right? The so-called resistance is  mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we  are really -- we are getting rid of those bad ideas one by one so fast, and  it is driving them crazy. See, you have to understand, I have a better  education than they do from a much better school. </p><p> The elites, they are the elites. They are the elites. I went to a better  schools, I went to better everything. And by the way -- by the way -- are  you ready for this? I am president and they are not.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Joining us now for reaction, Katrina Pierson of course, senior  advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign. That's right. Already talking about  2020. Florida's republican attorney general Pam Bondi and attorney and  Democratic strategist, Jan Ronis. Great to see all of you tonight. </p><p> Pam, let's start -- let's start with you, Pam. Indiana -- I think this is  the president's third trip. He's heading to Charlotte, North Carolina for  the next rally. He is stacked for these rallies. He is going to hit every  close race, senate race. He'll do some house races, some people thought he  wasn't going to be this active on the campaign trail, but, boy, were they  wrong. </p><p> PAM BONDI, FLORIDA STATE ATTORNEY:  They sure were, Laura. They were wrong  and look at President Trump, look at his energy. He loves doing this. He  loves going out and supporting these candidates, and he knows how important  congress is to helping him pass the agenda that he needs to pass. </p><p> And he cares, and he is out there. I mean, this man must never, ever sleep.  I mean, the president is just working tirelessly to help all of these  races. And he loves it. He loves it. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Katrina, I'm here in Chicago and had a chance to talk to a lot  of folks earlier today. And believe it or not, even in liberal Chicago,  where I think it is like 83 percent or 87 percent of the city voted  democrat for Hillary in 2016, he has a lot of fans here. </p><p> But I think maybe two or three people, you know, in a room where I got to  talk to about eight people, said we love what the president is doing on the  economy, Katrina, but why does he have to harp on CNN or these other  networks. Just focus on your agenda, don't worry about these other side  issues because no one really cares. No one's watching those networks. They  are giving them too much -- too much publicity. </p><p> KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I don't think  anyone can deny that Donald Trump isn't a fighter. He is his number one  defender. We had a lot of experience about that on the first campaign. But  it's really important for him to continue to highlight and identify how the  fake news is doing an injustice to this country. </p><p> And, you know, as for tonight, Laura, there is nothing quite like or as fun  as a Trump rally. Even in this hostile political environment, the president  has deep opportunities do not just place a stamp of approval on candidates  that are going to help them keep America great, but it's the opportunity to  bypass those networks and speak directly to the people that talk about  those accomplishments. </p><p> And I have to tell you that this president has accomplished so much in his  first two years that we actually had to create a website, promises  kept.com, just to keep up with him. I was not one of those people that  expected him to just sit around and wait for the candidates to get going. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Now, the thing that is going to happen tomorrow, and Jan, you  can chime in here, tomorrow it looks like they are going to announce  officially, they needed to do it by tomorrow, that Canada is going to join  in on this agreement with the United States and Mexico, replacing the old  NAFTA, a huge deal. Clinton, Obama, Bush, Hillary, they all promised --  Hillary if she was elected -- that they were going to change NAFTA. </p><p> No one thought President Trump was going to be able to do it. Just two days  ago, all the brilliant ones on cable news were saying, oh, Canada is not  going to join. This is never going to get through. Jan, on the issues of  trade and the economy, what is the Democrats' response to Trump's winning  on these issue? </p><p> JAN RONIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY:  Well, the Democratic response ought to be  that really -- that the NAFTA renegotiations are just NAFTA with a new  name. I mean, quite frankly, the differences are very subtle -- </p><p> INGRAHAM:  No, they are not. Jan, you cannot come on this show. This is  actually something I know a lot about and I don't mean to interrupt you  right off the bat. But if you come on this show, and you start talking  smack about something you frankly don't know what you're talking about --  god bless you -- this is a completely redo of the NAFTA deal. </p><p> Do you understand what the rules of origin are all about? Do you get the  percentage of American components? Do you get that? Then you wouldn't have  said what you just said. </p><p> RONIS:  For example, the percentage of American components have gone up I  believe from 65 to 75. That's relatively a very small amount. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Right. OK.</p><p> RONIS:  And the wage increases don't apply to Mexico, which would still  allow Mexico to, you know, manufacture these cars at far lower prices than  in the United States. So it isn't -- you think the manufacturers will now  going to return to Mexico when they don't have to pay $16 an hour? They're  going to stay in Mexico. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  This is I've got to say. Yes, but you have intellectual property  protections, Pam Bondi, you have digital protections, this was a hard  bargain that was driven by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the whole team at  the USTR, Lusi Videgaray who came in the show a couple of days ago, is the  foreign minister. We finally got Trudeau and the gang in Canada on board. </p><p> The idea that this is a significant deal -- if it wasn't significant, then  why didn't Obama did something? Then why didn't, you know, why didn't  George W. Bush do anything with it? </p><p> BONDO:  Because they couldn't. </p><p> RONIS:  And in fact the word changes under way (ph) during the Obama  administration.</p><p> BONDI:  Because they couldn't do anything with it.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Never got anything done, Jan. You know it, I know it. I don't  want to be cranky tonight but you cannot come on this show and make claims  that are completely, patently false! This is a total redo of NAFTA. You  don't know what you're talking about. It's several -- I think it is 700  pages long. So don't come on the show and say it's ridiculous. Pam Bondi,  your turn. </p><p> BONDI:  Thank you. And the president and Jared and the staff, they have  been working on this nonstop. They were working on it all day today on  Canada. And with all the noise, everything going on, everything they are  trying to accuse the president of in the middle of all that, he is staying  laser focused and he is helping the American people. </p><p> He is bringing jobs to our country -- at 3.8 unemployment -- everything he  said, but what he did with Mexico and now Canada is unprecedented. And he  is a businessman. He is successful, and that is why our country is thriving  because of President Trump. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  And by the way, news for Jan and everyone else watching, the  Europeans tonight announced -- another thing that the experts that would  never happen -- that they are going to eliminate, I believe, most tariffs  on automobiles. Why are they doing that do you think? Because they see what  Trump just did with Canada and with Mexico on NAFTA. </p><p> So, these barriers to effective and fair trade are systematically being  dismantled because of a smart trade policy, and that is what Democrats used  to be in favor of. I want to play for you, Katrina, something that Chuck  Todd said today about a bombshell tomorrow. Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Here's what I've learned about Bob Mueller, not a  single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him would say,  if he didn't have anything -- if he would've ended this investigation if  there was no collusion, that he already would have ended this --  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tell that though until he tells us. </p><p> TODD:  That's true. I think he knows more than anything he keeps quiet  between Labor Day and election day. I'm not missing work tomorrow. I  wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, we are not missing work tomorrow, either, but that was one  of the more ridiculous things I've heard. Katrina -- and a rabbit is going  to come out of his hat. </p><p> PIERSON:  Laura, this is hypervigilance on behalf of the left. These are  the kinds of things that we have been hearing since the president took the  famous ride down the escalator and people are pretty much immune to it.  Clearly there was no collusion. </p><p> But look, no one is going to be listening to the talking heads on TV  particularly when their 401(K)s are going up. This trade deal was very  good, and it looks like it even took the stock market out of correction  territory. So again, Laura, the people at home are smarter than a lot of  the media think. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, I think again, the Democrats have to actually come to  the table with solutions, not just identity politics, get Trump and impeach  him. </p><p> PIERSON:  But how could they possibly come with solutions, they don't even  know who they are? Are they Democrats? Are they liberals? Are they  socialists? There is a crisis going on in the Democrat Party and President  Trump is out there -- </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, it's a split (ph) personality. </p><p> PIERSON:  That's what it is. It's a split personality and the Trump  derangement syndrome just compounds the effect.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right guys. </p><p> BONDI:  And Laura, he's out there talking to the American people. He's out  there talking to the American people that they understand, saying we are  not going to get ripped off by other countries anymore. </p><p> PIERSON:  Right.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Real quick, I got to give Jan a final thought real quick. We're  way over. </p><p> RONIS:  Listen, he is going back to the same old rhetoric that he did when  he first got elected, trying to scare the American people, talking about  Hillary getting away with criminal activities, frightening everybody about  undocumented aliens. It's the same old, you know, art of -- the art of  politics is getting elected and re-elected, and I'll give him credit  because he is an expert at that but it's at the expense of the truth. It's  at the expense of what this country and its people.</p><p> PIERSON:  401(K), Jan, 401(K). </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, 4.2 percent GDP. </p><p> RONIS:  -- millions of people in this country -- </p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right guys, we're out of time. All right, we are here in  Chicago. A new wave of violence striking the city. When we come back, we  are going to talk to one of the best reporters on the ground, and you don't  want to miss that. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yet another wave of violence rocking the city of Chicago  tonight. Just yesterday, eight people were shot and wounded in a period of  eight hours. And with each day that goes by, Chicago city officials led by  Rahm Emanuel seemed more and more powerless to stop it. This week, Gianno  Caldwell, a Fox News political analyst and Chicago native, went out to  speak with members of the worst hit communities and find out what is  driving the bloodshed. Watchg.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NINI, CHICAGO RESIDENT:  In this neighborhood, everybody want to be better  than the next person. Everybody want to rock the better jeans. You know  what you got on, the better shoes. Everyone want to be the one on top. </p><p> So these boys looking at it, like, hey, let me see your (inaudible) and let  me do this and that. That's why there's a lot of violence. And I believe,  you get some of these boys into a job, put money in their pockets so they  can survive, take care of what they need to take care of, maybe it'll stop  some of this stuff. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Joining us now with more is Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great  to see you tonight. You know, it was interesting what Ninin just said  there, and she said everyone wants to be on top, have what the other guy  has or better, I don't know if she was talking about house or car or shoes  or what. But -- </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Everything. All of the above.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  -- she said if they had a job maybe it would -- yes, maybe it  would be better. To get the job, you have to have the skills, you have to  have the educational background, a parent or role model who helps with the  education and the guidance. The problem is a lot of these kids don't have  any of that. And then the gangs walk in. </p><p> CADWELL:  Yes, Laura. I think what I really saw here this week, when doing  these interviews with a number of the high-ranking gang members throughout  the city of Chicago, is there is a deficit in personal responsibility. A  lot of parents that have left their homes who believe that their parents  maybe were too harsh on them as they were growing up, they allowed their  kids to run free. </p><p> And as a result, we see the bloodshed. We all did a study in 2015, which  said for every 100,000 residents in the city of Chicago, there is, on  average, one white person shot, 28 Hispanic shot, and a whopping 113  African-Americans shot in a city of 2.7 million people. This is beyond the  pale of what we should see in any American city. And I know, and I thank  you for your coverage on this, because you have done it from your heart,  this has not been political for you. </p><p> You see the same things that I see in a lot of the African-American  residents here in Chicago, which is no American city should be like this.  There should be no person in an American city that have to live through  this level of fear. </p><p> And what we are seeing and especially speaking to the gang bangers in the  city of Chicago, there is a lot of those folks feel that this was a life  that they were preconditioned for. This isn't something that they  necessarily chose, as one told me, this is the life that chose him. So this  is, I mean, is just unfortunate. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  And Gianno, the need for investment or business to come in, as  we have talked about before, how do you solve this problem? Until the  streets are safe, we need more detectives, more police, more personal  responsibility, more role models, it is hard to get the business to come  in, even with tax incentives that Rahm Emanuel, as far as I know, hasn't  been willing to talk about. </p><p> But even with tax incentives, if you go in there in some Inglewood, some of  these other areas and worried about your safety, or your employee safety,  that is -- that is going to be a heavy lift. </p><p> CALDWEL:  It will be. But, you know, I was really happy to hear from an  individual who runs a program or an organization called ex-cons for  community and social change. His name is Tyrone Muhammad. He is actually an  ex-con. He went to jail I believe for about 30 years for murder. </p><p> He started a program when he got out of jail and he goes and gets more ex- cons and they go back into those communities in which they robbed and steal  from, the communities that they murdered and which led to bloodshed. </p><p> So, that was something that I thought was particularly encouraging because  they are talking to the youth. They're looking to put those individuals and  jobs.  And I was really happy to hear that because those are the stories  that we normally don't hear, those are stories that we normally don't see. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  I actually -- Gianno, we actually have -- Gianno, we actually  have that part of your discussion with him. I think we are going to play it  now. Let's watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TYRONE MUHAMMAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECCSC:  Those guys involved with my  organization have served 20 years or more in prison. We are men who  recognize that we've made a mistake. We are not sitting around waiting on  something (inaudible) white person, the politicians, the legislation, to  change our condition. We know that we helped perpetrate some of the  violence in our community and we learned a long time ago why we was in  prison, that we would have to change it ourselves. </p><p> (END VIDE CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right Gianno, final thoughts real quick. </p><p> CALDWELL:  We need more of that in the city of Chicago. There needs to be  an expansion of personal responsibility because no one can rely on the  government to solve all of these problems. And that includes the violence  in Chicago. They are part of the solution but they are not the solution in  totality. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  You need more police, you need more cops on the ground, you need  more detectives so they actually solve some of these crimes, and that is  where the mayor and city officials kick in. Gianno, thank you very much. </p><p> CALDWEL:  It's been a failure of leadership on the level of the city and as  well of the state, there's been a failure of leadership in Chicago. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, we've been trying to get Rahm Emanuel on this show and  other alderman and not much luck there. So, we'll keep trying. Gianno,  thanks so much. </p><p> Now with the discussion on this, we're going to talk to Horace Cooper of  Project 21, and of course, Leo Terrell is with us, radio talk show host.  Both of you, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you. I don't  think this is an issue that should be political. It should be solved. </p><p> This should be solved both from within the community, with police, safe  leaders, and business can partner, but if it is not going to come from  within and a real move from within the community, I don't know how we are  going to solve this. </p><p> But I can tell by talking to folks today, you need more police on the  ground. If you don't have more police on the ground, you will never get any  of the good stuff to happen. Leo? </p><p> LEO TERRELL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well Laura, I can tell from your  sincerity that you are very serious about this. But it's just not police,  respectfully. When I just saw the president on Fox talking about African- American unemployment rate is down, what about in the south and west sides  of Chicago? There is poverty in Chicago youth, from 18 to 24. Giovanni  didn't talk about the unemployment rate in Chicago. </p><p> You got to have jobs they are and what I submit to you, Laura, is that  there are no jobs there. There's just not on the local level. We have a  Republican governor and the blame goes all the way around. But let's focus  on the absence of jobs. I'll support your argument about police but please,  acknowledge that great -- make America great again does not apply to  African-American youth between the ages of 18 and 24 beyond the south and  west side of Chicago. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Leo, I think you are right about that. I mean, I'm not --</p><p> TERRELL:  Thank you.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  I think you're right about that the jobs aren't there. Trump  didn't create Chicago. So, I mean, you are a really good civil rights  attorney, a Democrat, and I get that, but to say or imply -- </p><p> TERRELL:  Can I point out one thing? </p><p> INGRAHAM:  -- to imply that Trump caused Chicago is absurd, and it will not  stand. Horace? </p><p> HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21:  Absolutely.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  I mean, it starts before Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel has been  there since 2011, murder rates, ridiculous high. More than 2,000 people now  have been murdered in Chicago since he became mayor. Unacceptable.  Absolutely unacceptable. </p><p> COOPER:  Jobs -- jobs will never come to Chicago as long as it's Beirut on  Lake Michigan. Here's the truth. The truth is, it requires two basic  techniques. You  must increase the fear of apprehension on those who would  mug, rob, or rape grandma, the people who will not let Lucy go to school,  and they create an environment so Frank the father can't get a job. </p><p> You absolutely must start with creating apprehension -- excuse me, a risk  of apprehension, for those individuals. Once that risk is real, who do not  change, who will not conform, they must be removed. That means five, seven,  or 10-year sentences. When that happens, which we know it worked, it worked  in Richmond, it worked in New York City, it worked in Louisiana, in New  Orleans, it will work anywhere. When that happens, then we can talk about  jobs and personal responsibility. </p><p> TERRELL:  Hey, can I just say a little game called Jeopardy? How about  this? What do you got to lose? Give me a chance. OK, who made that  statement in 2016? The Democrats have always been in office --</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, lowest unemployment for African-American and how long?</p><p> TERRELL:  -- give me a chance. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> TERRELL:  Remember that guy? </p><p> COOPER:  We have set five records for low unemployment in just the first 10  (ph) years. </p><p> TERRELL:  What about Chicago? We are talking about Chicago, Horace. We are  talking about Chicago.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Guys, stop, stop, stop! Do you know that Democrats have been  running Chicago for I believe seven decades? Do you realize that? </p><p> TERRELL:  We have a Republican governor, Laura! </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Do you realize there is not one -- there is not -- we are  talking about the city of Chicago. You, Leo, are very smart, you know just  like I do, the city is run by the city council and the mayor's office. It's  not run by Bruce Rauner, OK. </p><p> They do legislate legislation and allocation of funds, but the funds and  the local taxes in Chicago run the police and they assist in running the  schools. OK? So, lets' be honest. This is 70 years of Democratic  leadership, 70! </p><p> TERRELL:  Here's a good fellow (ph) response. Local governments don't  create jobs. You know, Laura, that the job creation starts up in -- </p><p> (CROSTALK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Why are we on this? </p><p> TERRELL:  There are no jobs! </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Do you think, I mean honestly, if do you that Rahm Emanuel since  2011, has done a good job for the city of Chicago, because I can tell you,  most Democrats we talked to today in the streets, they want him gone. They  don't want him to return. They want a new person in. </p><p> TERRELL:  I'm not here to defend Rahm Emanuel. I'm not here -- I'm just  simply saying, you do acknowledge that jobs are critical. Horace simply  said lock everybody up. He doesn't have a job plan. </p><p> COOPER:  You will not create a thriving job market as long as grandma is  afraid to even go and get her prescriptions filled. </p><p> TERREL:  Talking points. </p><p> COOPER:  That Lucy can't go to school -- it's not a talking point. This is  a reality. </p><p> TERRELL:  It is, talking points. Pure tactic.</p><p> COOPER:  That Chicago papers profiled all of these victims that we are  ignoring. We don't have jets that fly in from Arizona to Washington, D.C. - -</p><p> TERRELL:  Talking points.</p><p> COOPER:  -- for all of the people who are dying in Chicago.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  OK, you know what -- you know it's not a talking point. Leo, you  keep saying talking points.  You know what is not a talking point?  We  talked to a woman whose nephew's remains were burned and stored in a 55- gallon drum.  You know what his great crime was?  Walking home.  </p><p> TERRELL:  That's a horrible crime.  That's a horrible crime.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  That's what life is in some of these neighborhoods in Chicago.   Don't tell me it's a talking point.  That's someone's life, and it happens  way too often, predominately African-American.  And it's got to stop.  The  cauldron of death and Chicago, got to put an end to it.  It is ridiculous,  and Republicans and Democrats have got to come together.  And the people of  the city I think want to do something about it, but when you have failed  leadership, whether it's Republican or Democrat, it's got to be changed and  swept out of office.  </p><p> TERRELL:  I agree with you, Laura.  I agree with you.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Great segment.  We are out of time.  </p><p> COOPER:  A jobs program will not stop cutthroat --  </p><p> TERRELL:  We are done, Horace.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  OK, guys, we're out of time.  We're going to be covering this  for months and months and months.  Thank you so much.</p><p> And joining us now with more -- excuse me.  We're going to take a break.   When we come back, we are going to talk about what Andrew Cuomo said,  believe it or not, about a ICE.  You thought the ICE protests were bad  before.  We might have protests on the other side after you hear what he  said.  Don't got away.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to abolish  ICE.  Where did this come from?  By the way, did you have any idea what ICE  does?  These are people that go into a nest of MS-13.  They call nest.   That is what it is.  It's a nest.  These are evil people in there.  </p><p> I can't say \"animals\" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I  called them animals.  I called them animals.  She went crazy.  I can't do  it.  </p><p> (BOOS)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Nancy Pelosi gets a lot of boos, doesn't she?  That was  President Trump at Indiana earlier tonight.  And that situation, those  remarks, could well not stand in greater contrast of the rhetoric we are  hearing from Democrats.  Andrew Cuomo last night at his debate with Cynthia  Nixon.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  New York state is the state that said we  will not cooperate with ICE.  They were a bunch of thugs.  He politicized  ICE.  they are a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, president of the  National Border Patrol union, and Esther Valdes, an immigration attorney.   Esther, good to see you.  Art, good to see you.  I'm going to have Art take  the first swing at the Cuomo comments.  I do not understand why the  Democrats keep going back to the well of maligning the great men and women  of the Immigration Customs Enforcement, but they must think it is going to  work somewhere, and maybe in New York.  Art?  </p><p> ART DEL CUETO:  They are doing it because they don't have anything else to  say.  When you lose the argument, you've got to bring a race.  That is  usually what these people have been doing.  It's amazing to hear someone  say something like that, and then call the ICE people thugs.  You are  saying you are not going to agree with law enforcement, but they are the  ones that are thugs?  It sounds like you're the thug.  </p><p> Every time I hear these guys go back and forth, I can't help but wonder  that they are competing and some kind of here, hold my beer, let's see how  stupid I can sound today contest.  It's just amazing.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Esther, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, had his own  reaction to what Cuomo said last night.  Let's watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR:  What he is saying, his actions are  disgusting.  To call ICE agents thugs, think about it.  These are men and  women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and  daughters, that chose to enforce the laws of this country, strap a gun to  the hip every day, put a Kevlar vest on to go out to the community and  protect America, protect the communities.  He calls them thugs.  Actually,  ICE arrests thugs, MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Esther, ICE arrests thugs and the Democrats are calling ICE  thugs, your reaction?  </p><p> ESTHER VALDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  It is notable that Governor Cuomo is  not a border state governor.  Otherwise he would have firsthand knowledge  of what ICE officers actually do.  They are the frontline defenders, and  here in San Diego they are the first line of defense to disrupt drug  trafficking rings, child molestation rings, and people who exploit men and  women.  I invite Governor Cuomo to come down here and see what ICE agents  actually do.  </p><p> And by and large, I interact with them as an immigration attorney at least  once a week when I'm at the detention facilities.  Those men and women are  some of our finest, bravest law enforcement agents that we have.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  I've got to remind everyone who the senators are who are in  favor of abolishing ICE, and this is just a list.  I'm sure it will grow,  but this is where we are right now.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, OK, New  York, she'll be running for president, 2020, Elizabeth Warren in  Massachusetts, she'll be running in 2020, Bernie Sanders, Vermont, he'll be  running a 2020, Mark Pocan in Wisconsin, nobody can even recognize him on  the street, Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Earl Blumenauer from  Oregon, Nydia Velazquez, New York, goes on, Raul Grijalva, Mark DeSaulnier,  California, and that's just where we are right now.  Of course,  congressional candidates, Alexandria Cortez, Randy Bryce, so forth.  </p><p> Art, I don't know why, again, Democrats think that the men and women who  keep us safe, are breaking up a child sex trafficking rings, human  smuggling rings, of course narcotics operations funded by the cartels -- I  don't get it.  How is that going to appeal even to the inner city folks who  want a safe environment as well?  I'm presuming they want safer streets,  safer situations for their families.  </p><p> DEL CUETO:  They should.  The thing is, they try to make this division, and  then they turn it around or they make it about race.  Listen, even when  I've come on your show, I see some of the comments that some of these  individuals say about myself.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, lovely.  </p><p> DEL CUETO:  As being Hispanic.  But I came to this country, my parents came  to this country legally.  There is a legal way to do it.  People can't  distinguish the difference between border patrol agents, between ICE  agents, between the immigration officers at our ports of entry.  They can't  distinguish the difference between a legal immigrant in an illegal  immigrant.  </p><p> It is just -- I don't know what their thought processes, but anything they  can do is they try to divide as much as possible so they appease a certain  group of people, and try to -- that's what it is.  It comes down to  division and race.  And the reality is, I've said it so many times, illegal  is not a race.  We are not out there separating families.  Whose to blame?   The families themselves.  An American citizen commits a crime with their  child in this country, what happens?  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  You get separated.</p><p> DEL CUETO:  You get separated, and you go through the court system.  What  is happening here is these people, they are such great parents that they  are turning over their children to drug smugglers, they are turning their  children over to people smugglers, they are abandoning them in the desert,  and we're the bad guys?  Come on.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  But it's our fault.  It's ICE's fault.  Guys, thank you so much.  </p><p> Charges of anti-conservative bias are roiling the big tech companies.   Kevin McCarthy has something to say about it.  Don't miss it, up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My administration is also  standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans.  Social media  giants, and I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate  political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results.  We will not  let large corporations silence conservative voices.  And it can.  It can go  the other way, too, some day.  We are not going to let them control what we  can and cannot see, read, and learn from.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  You heard President Trump.  He wants social media companies to  be held accountable for alleged anti-conservative bias.  Next week, Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey will have his feet held to the fire when he testifies on  Capitol Hill.  And one of the individuals leading the charge on all of this  is House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who joins us now.  Congressman,  great to see you.  </p><p> This is what I have been told, congressman, time and time again by my  liberal friends, OK?  This is an algorithm.  This has nothing to do with  politics.  The algorithm was in place before Trump, and it's going to be in  place after Trump.  There is no political bias, it all relates to what  articles are popular and versus articles that are not as popular.  What is  your reaction to that?  </p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  That's just not true.   Social media today is the modern-day town hall.  Sixty-seven percent of  adults get their news from somewhere on social media.  But let's just play  that out.  You see Prager University that puts out conservative videos, but  one happened to be about Israel with Alan Dershowitz, one happened to be  about baseball with George Will.  You know what?  Facebook wouldn't show  those because they said YouTube rated them similar to pornography.  </p><p> Then we found out recently that they said it was a couple of Facebook  employees.  Take, for instance, I follow your tweets.  You put something  out about Sweden last week in regards to conservatives gaming based upon  their immigration policy.  That algorithm, written by a human, said that  was sensitive, so certain people on Twitter could not see that.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  The Swedish election is sensitive.  OK.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  That's sensitive.  So that is just an algorithm?  But if you  Google the California Republican Party right before the primary, they said  our ideology was Nazism, and they blame that on Wikipedia.  </p><p> But after we have raised this issue -- and I've had many conversations with  the president about it, that we have to stop this bias, look what happened  in Facebook just this week.  Their own employees, those conservatives who  have been intimidated based upon their own personal philosophy, put a group  together and rose up because they feel that has been going on as well.  You  look at what they did to Palmer Luckey and others.  Palmer is a brilliant  kid who invented Oculus, who Facebook actually purchased.  But when they  found out he had given money, his own personal money based upon who he  wanted to see become president, they wanted to push him out.  This is what  is happening in social media, they think it is just algorithms.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Congressman, let's get to solutions here.  A lot of pals are  working in antitrust and expert on antitrust issues, some kind of difficult  antitrust theories floating out there.  But there is another interesting  idea beyond antitrust, which is to consider Facebook and Twitter and so  forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public  utility.  \"Vanity Fair\" had a headline about Bannon saying, Steve Bannon  wants to nationalize Facebook and Google's data.  The cofounder of  Cambridge Analytica says big data should be placed in a public trust.  That  is going to your point that this really is the town square, and even though  it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising, we're  talking about Facebook especially, so we have to treat a different way.  Is  that something Congress is going to look at in consultation with the  executive branch?  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  I think Congress is going to look at everything from the  perspective of how powerful they have become.  I have spoken to Jack Dorsey  throughout the month, because the beginning of August, I sent a letter  requesting for him to come to Energy and Commerce.  And I want to give him  credit, he is showing up September 5th, and he and I philosophically  disagree, but we do we worry on one thing.  We believe in the First  Amendment.  But we also believe in transparency and accountability.  He is  coming forward.  I think the other companies CEOs need to go forward as  well, because the stories that they are telling and blaming other people,  and it's just an algorithm, is proving not to be true.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  The Google CEO said, no, I understand, but they are happy to  work with China on setting up the censorship tools that the communists in  China want instituted in Google.  They don't have any problem with that.  </p><p> I have to get your thoughts on today's funeral ceremonies for John McCain,  impassioned speeches, we had Vice President Biden speak, many others.  Your  thoughts?  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  Well, I was there.  And I thought the very best speaker was a  very first speaker.  He was the first chief of staff to then congressman  John McCain.  And he told the story that John McCain told when he was a  POW, about a guard coming in, it's Christmas time, kind of loosening up the  ropes that had his arms time behind his back.  And right before he was  going off his time, he tied those ropes back.  He never seen this guard  before but he sees him out in the yard.  The guard walks up, doesn't say  anything to him, but with his foot in the gravel, he makes a cross, saying  about faith.  </p><p> And when you think of John McCain and what he went through, and every time  I watched put a jacket on, the difficulty, I had great respect for this  man.  I worked with him many times.  I had a difference of opinion, but I  thought that summed it up with a much more personal story, it was the  strongest story of the day.  It was a beautiful celebration of his life.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  I would agree with you, an amazing tribute.  And I'm going to  ignore some of the not so thinly veiled hits on President Trump by some of  the people who participated, but I agree with you.  Just that image of  Senator McCain, and may he rest in peace.  Congressman McCarthy, thank you  so much for joining us tonight.  And we are going to be watching that  hearing with Dorsey next week.  </p><p> The Justice Department, by the way, is firing a major shot at Harvard  University and affirmative action.  Details ahead.  You do not want to miss  this segment with Michelle Malkin.  Don't go away.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Harvard in the hot seat.  What happens when Harvard University  capped the number of Asian students who could be admitted?  Well, that  didn't go down so well.  Michelle Malkin joining us, and of course from  CRTV, and Cathy Areu, the publisher of \"Catalina Magazine.\" Also we have  news from Betsy DeVos at the Education Department involving Title IX and  sexual harassment on college campuses.  </p><p> But let's start with this Harvard story.  Michelle, you have been all over  this issue of affirmative action for years.  And now, we are at the point  where we are penalizing Asian students, and thankfully the U.S. Department  of Justice stepped in on behalf of fairness and merit on behalf of these  Asian students.  Tell us what you know.  </p><p> MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, this blatant racial  discrimination in the name of so-called social justice has punished high  achieving Asian-American students for a long time.  It's been obvious since  the late 1980s and 1990s when I was in college.  </p><p> And finally, we have the Trump Justice Department fighting with equality of  opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.  And what I love most about  what is happening, Laura, is Harvard is squirming under the microscope and  the bright, glaring sunlight of discovery.  For the longest time they had  kept their racially conscious and race unneutral policies under wraps, and  now it's being exposed.  </p><p> And what is happening is, you have a lot of liberal Asian-Americans who are  finally, finally having second thoughts about the social engineering that  has punished them at the expense of equality of opportunity.  And look, it  makes absolutely no sense to punish the children of legal immigrants from  all over Asia as some sort of social justice recompense to black students.   The reparations foundation of affirmative action here has been totally  blown up.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Let's go to Cathy.  Really short segment here.  Cathy, if it's  just a merit based analysis on admissions, the study from the Center for  Equal Opportunity shows that Asian-Americans would have 43 percent of the  admissions, Hispanics, two percent, African-Americans, on merit according  to the Center for Equal Opportunity, just one percent.  </p><p> CATHY AREU, \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE:  Right.  And what is merit?  Is merit  meaning SATs, is it meaning test scores?  So we are trying to say, this  against affirmative action.  And what's happening is that Harvard actually  has a system where there school population is diverse.  So the Trump  administration is trying to take away diversity at our institutions like  Harvard.  Harvard is fighting for diversity so that our student body can  look like our demographics in our country.  And there is nothing wrong with  that.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Let's move on really quickly.  No time here.  But Betsy DeVos  and Title IX.  Michelle, now it looks like men or anyone accused of sexual  harassment will have a few more rights aft UVA and of course some of the  other cases like Duke and so forth.  </p><p> MALKIN:  You think that civil libertarians would be cheering the fact that  we have administration that is restoring the rights of the accused and  restoring due process that has been sabotaged, particularly under the Obama  administration, by radicals who don't think that accused men should have  the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, that men who are  accused should have legal representation, that men who are accused should  be allowed to have access to exculpatory evidence, and that is what DeVos  is restoring.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Cathy, I owe you one because we're out of time.  When we come  back, final thoughts from Chicago.  Busy news night.  Stay there.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Tomorrow night, we'll be back here in Chicago, and we will be  following up on our reporting on some of the other media sources out there.   We told you this week about CNN and a little loosey-goosey they were  playing with their source Lanny Davis.  Who is lying more?  And tomorrow,  what NBC reportedly did to put the kibosh on that Harvey Weinstein  reporting by Ronan Farrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Anyway, where are you tonight? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> INGRAHAM:  We are in Chicago having a lot of fun, causing a little trouble,  but all in a good way, the good trouble in a good way. </p><p> PIRRO:  Make sure you have Giordano's pizza.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  You know something, you are the second person who told me that  so I'm on it. Judge Jeanine, thank you so much. Great show. </p><p> PIRRO:  All right. Have a great show.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right, welcome to THE INGRAHAM Angle.  I'm Laura Ingraham  live from Chicago tonight and we're going to explain why in just a little  bit. </p><p> The president just wrapping up a raucous rally in Indiana in Evansville.  We're going to breakdown his remarks throughout the hours so stick with us. </p><p> Also tonight, are congressional Republicans about to go to war with big  tech? House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to join us later in the  hour to break it all down. The looming fight over bias in Silicon Valley. </p><p> Plus, the reason we are here, violence continues to rock this amazing  American city, and while its political leaders might be asleep at the  switch, we came to get answers. Fox's own Gianno Caldwell went to some of  the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere in this country to talk to gang  bangers and ex-cons. Some exclusive video you do not want to miss. </p><p> But first, as we just mentioned, the president is taking all comers tonight  in Evansville and if you are just getting caught up, here is what you may  have missed. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York  Times,\" which, by the way, if I wasn't here, they would be out of business.  \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times,\" CNN. So, a writer for \"The New  York Times\" that pretends she knows what she's talking about, hasn't got a  clue. </p><p> And I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same, the place was packed, she  made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty  chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom may be. And listen -- and he  was so disappointed at the tone in the room. NBC, which is probably worse  than CNN, but the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great  thing to do. How smart. That's what the worth. Who knows? With these  people, you never know.</p><p> By the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, governor, look how many cameras  you have back there. It's just like the academy awards. Look at it. They  can't get enough! But when they start screaming fake news, you see those  red lights go off for a little while. Excuse me, we have technical  difficulties. OK, then they go back. Right? Look at that. You know, in the  studio, you hear they go, \"listen, he's about ready to go, look.\" ladies  and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties. </p><p> We need Republicans in Congress. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by  left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies,  and their fake news allies. </p><p> You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at  what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's  see. All I can say this, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of  it -- because inside, they have incredible people, but our Justice  Department, and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right  and doing it now because people are angry. People are angry. </p><p> What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point, I wanted to stay out,  but at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly, I want them to do  their job, I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to.  Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching and the whole world gets it  and the whole world understands exactly what is going on. </p><p> The Democrats, they called themselves the resistance. That is what they are  good at. Resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day,  they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine  the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 like never  before delivered. </p><p> The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly  undemocratic they really have become, right? The so-called resistance is  mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we  are really -- we are getting rid of those bad ideas one by one so fast, and  it is driving them crazy. See, you have to understand, I have a better  education than they do from a much better school. </p><p> The elites, they are the elites. They are the elites. I went to a better  schools, I went to better everything. And by the way -- by the way -- are  you ready for this? I am president and they are not.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Joining us now for reaction, Katrina Pierson of course, senior  advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign. That's right. Already talking about  2020. Florida's republican attorney general Pam Bondi and attorney and  Democratic strategist, Jan Ronis. Great to see all of you tonight. </p><p> Pam, let's start -- let's start with you, Pam. Indiana -- I think this is  the president's third trip. He's heading to Charlotte, North Carolina for  the next rally. He is stacked for these rallies. He is going to hit every  close race, senate race. He'll do some house races, some people thought he  wasn't going to be this active on the campaign trail, but, boy, were they  wrong. </p><p> PAM BONDI, FLORIDA STATE ATTORNEY:  They sure were, Laura. They were wrong  and look at President Trump, look at his energy. He loves doing this. He  loves going out and supporting these candidates, and he knows how important  congress is to helping him pass the agenda that he needs to pass. </p><p> And he cares, and he is out there. I mean, this man must never, ever sleep.  I mean, the president is just working tirelessly to help all of these  races. And he loves it. He loves it. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Katrina, I'm here in Chicago and had a chance to talk to a lot  of folks earlier today. And believe it or not, even in liberal Chicago,  where I think it is like 83 percent or 87 percent of the city voted  democrat for Hillary in 2016, he has a lot of fans here. </p><p> But I think maybe two or three people, you know, in a room where I got to  talk to about eight people, said we love what the president is doing on the  economy, Katrina, but why does he have to harp on CNN or these other  networks. Just focus on your agenda, don't worry about these other side  issues because no one really cares. No one's watching those networks. They  are giving them too much -- too much publicity. </p><p> KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I don't think  anyone can deny that Donald Trump isn't a fighter. He is his number one  defender. We had a lot of experience about that on the first campaign. But  it's really important for him to continue to highlight and identify how the  fake news is doing an injustice to this country. </p><p> And, you know, as for tonight, Laura, there is nothing quite like or as fun  as a Trump rally. Even in this hostile political environment, the president  has deep opportunities do not just place a stamp of approval on candidates  that are going to help them keep America great, but it's the opportunity to  bypass those networks and speak directly to the people that talk about  those accomplishments. </p><p> And I have to tell you that this president has accomplished so much in his  first two years that we actually had to create a website, promises  kept.com, just to keep up with him. I was not one of those people that  expected him to just sit around and wait for the candidates to get going. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Now, the thing that is going to happen tomorrow, and Jan, you  can chime in here, tomorrow it looks like they are going to announce  officially, they needed to do it by tomorrow, that Canada is going to join  in on this agreement with the United States and Mexico, replacing the old  NAFTA, a huge deal. Clinton, Obama, Bush, Hillary, they all promised --  Hillary if she was elected -- that they were going to change NAFTA. </p><p> No one thought President Trump was going to be able to do it. Just two days  ago, all the brilliant ones on cable news were saying, oh, Canada is not  going to join. This is never going to get through. Jan, on the issues of  trade and the economy, what is the Democrats' response to Trump's winning  on these issue? </p><p> JAN RONIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY:  Well, the Democratic response ought to be  that really -- that the NAFTA renegotiations are just NAFTA with a new  name. I mean, quite frankly, the differences are very subtle -- </p><p> INGRAHAM:  No, they are not. Jan, you cannot come on this show. This is  actually something I know a lot about and I don't mean to interrupt you  right off the bat. But if you come on this show, and you start talking  smack about something you frankly don't know what you're talking about --  god bless you -- this is a completely redo of the NAFTA deal. </p><p> Do you understand what the rules of origin are all about? Do you get the  percentage of American components? Do you get that? Then you wouldn't have  said what you just said. </p><p> RONIS:  For example, the percentage of American components have gone up I  believe from 65 to 75. That's relatively a very small amount. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Right. OK.</p><p> RONIS:  And the wage increases don't apply to Mexico, which would still  allow Mexico to, you know, manufacture these cars at far lower prices than  in the United States. So it isn't -- you think the manufacturers will now  going to return to Mexico when they don't have to pay $16 an hour? They're  going to stay in Mexico. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  This is I've got to say. Yes, but you have intellectual property  protections, Pam Bondi, you have digital protections, this was a hard  bargain that was driven by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the whole team at  the USTR, Lusi Videgaray who came in the show a couple of days ago, is the  foreign minister. We finally got Trudeau and the gang in Canada on board. </p><p> The idea that this is a significant deal -- if it wasn't significant, then  why didn't Obama did something? Then why didn't, you know, why didn't  George W. Bush do anything with it? </p><p> BONDO:  Because they couldn't. </p><p> RONIS:  And in fact the word changes under way (ph) during the Obama  administration.</p><p> BONDI:  Because they couldn't do anything with it.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Never got anything done, Jan. You know it, I know it. I don't  want to be cranky tonight but you cannot come on this show and make claims  that are completely, patently false! This is a total redo of NAFTA. You  don't know what you're talking about. It's several -- I think it is 700  pages long. So don't come on the show and say it's ridiculous. Pam Bondi,  your turn. </p><p> BONDI:  Thank you. And the president and Jared and the staff, they have  been working on this nonstop. They were working on it all day today on  Canada. And with all the noise, everything going on, everything they are  trying to accuse the president of in the middle of all that, he is staying  laser focused and he is helping the American people. </p><p> He is bringing jobs to our country -- at 3.8 unemployment -- everything he  said, but what he did with Mexico and now Canada is unprecedented. And he  is a businessman. He is successful, and that is why our country is thriving  because of President Trump. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  And by the way, news for Jan and everyone else watching, the  Europeans tonight announced -- another thing that the experts that would  never happen -- that they are going to eliminate, I believe, most tariffs  on automobiles. Why are they doing that do you think? Because they see what  Trump just did with Canada and with Mexico on NAFTA. </p><p> So, these barriers to effective and fair trade are systematically being  dismantled because of a smart trade policy, and that is what Democrats used  to be in favor of. I want to play for you, Katrina, something that Chuck  Todd said today about a bombshell tomorrow. Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Here's what I've learned about Bob Mueller, not a  single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him would say,  if he didn't have anything -- if he would've ended this investigation if  there was no collusion, that he already would have ended this --  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tell that though until he tells us. </p><p> TODD:  That's true. I think he knows more than anything he keeps quiet  between Labor Day and election day. I'm not missing work tomorrow. I  wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, we are not missing work tomorrow, either, but that was one  of the more ridiculous things I've heard. Katrina -- and a rabbit is going  to come out of his hat. </p><p> PIERSON:  Laura, this is hypervigilance on behalf of the left. These are  the kinds of things that we have been hearing since the president took the  famous ride down the escalator and people are pretty much immune to it.  Clearly there was no collusion. </p><p> But look, no one is going to be listening to the talking heads on TV  particularly when their 401(K)s are going up. This trade deal was very  good, and it looks like it even took the stock market out of correction  territory. So again, Laura, the people at home are smarter than a lot of  the media think. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, I think again, the Democrats have to actually come to  the table with solutions, not just identity politics, get Trump and impeach  him. </p><p> PIERSON:  But how could they possibly come with solutions, they don't even  know who they are? Are they Democrats? Are they liberals? Are they  socialists? There is a crisis going on in the Democrat Party and President  Trump is out there -- </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, it's a split (ph) personality. </p><p> PIERSON:  That's what it is. It's a split personality and the Trump  derangement syndrome just compounds the effect.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right guys. </p><p> BONDI:  And Laura, he's out there talking to the American people. He's out  there talking to the American people that they understand, saying we are  not going to get ripped off by other countries anymore. </p><p> PIERSON:  Right.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Real quick, I got to give Jan a final thought real quick. We're  way over. </p><p> RONIS:  Listen, he is going back to the same old rhetoric that he did when  he first got elected, trying to scare the American people, talking about  Hillary getting away with criminal activities, frightening everybody about  undocumented aliens. It's the same old, you know, art of -- the art of  politics is getting elected and re-elected, and I'll give him credit  because he is an expert at that but it's at the expense of the truth. It's  at the expense of what this country and its people.</p><p> PIERSON:  401(K), Jan, 401(K). </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, 4.2 percent GDP. </p><p> RONIS:  -- millions of people in this country -- </p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right guys, we're out of time. All right, we are here in  Chicago. A new wave of violence striking the city. When we come back, we  are going to talk to one of the best reporters on the ground, and you don't  want to miss that. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yet another wave of violence rocking the city of Chicago  tonight. Just yesterday, eight people were shot and wounded in a period of  eight hours. And with each day that goes by, Chicago city officials led by  Rahm Emanuel seemed more and more powerless to stop it. This week, Gianno  Caldwell, a Fox News political analyst and Chicago native, went out to  speak with members of the worst hit communities and find out what is  driving the bloodshed. Watchg.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NINI, CHICAGO RESIDENT:  In this neighborhood, everybody want to be better  than the next person. Everybody want to rock the better jeans. You know  what you got on, the better shoes. Everyone want to be the one on top. </p><p> So these boys looking at it, like, hey, let me see your (inaudible) and let  me do this and that. That's why there's a lot of violence. And I believe,  you get some of these boys into a job, put money in their pockets so they  can survive, take care of what they need to take care of, maybe it'll stop  some of this stuff. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Joining us now with more is Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great  to see you tonight. You know, it was interesting what Ninin just said  there, and she said everyone wants to be on top, have what the other guy  has or better, I don't know if she was talking about house or car or shoes  or what. But -- </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Everything. All of the above.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  -- she said if they had a job maybe it would -- yes, maybe it  would be better. To get the job, you have to have the skills, you have to  have the educational background, a parent or role model who helps with the  education and the guidance. The problem is a lot of these kids don't have  any of that. And then the gangs walk in. </p><p> CADWELL:  Yes, Laura. I think what I really saw here this week, when doing  these interviews with a number of the high-ranking gang members throughout  the city of Chicago, is there is a deficit in personal responsibility. A  lot of parents that have left their homes who believe that their parents  maybe were too harsh on them as they were growing up, they allowed their  kids to run free. </p><p> And as a result, we see the bloodshed. We all did a study in 2015, which  said for every 100,000 residents in the city of Chicago, there is, on  average, one white person shot, 28 Hispanic shot, and a whopping 113  African-Americans shot in a city of 2.7 million people. This is beyond the  pale of what we should see in any American city. And I know, and I thank  you for your coverage on this, because you have done it from your heart,  this has not been political for you. </p><p> You see the same things that I see in a lot of the African-American  residents here in Chicago, which is no American city should be like this.  There should be no person in an American city that have to live through  this level of fear. </p><p> And what we are seeing and especially speaking to the gang bangers in the  city of Chicago, there is a lot of those folks feel that this was a life  that they were preconditioned for. This isn't something that they  necessarily chose, as one told me, this is the life that chose him. So this  is, I mean, is just unfortunate. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  And Gianno, the need for investment or business to come in, as  we have talked about before, how do you solve this problem? Until the  streets are safe, we need more detectives, more police, more personal  responsibility, more role models, it is hard to get the business to come  in, even with tax incentives that Rahm Emanuel, as far as I know, hasn't  been willing to talk about. </p><p> But even with tax incentives, if you go in there in some Inglewood, some of  these other areas and worried about your safety, or your employee safety,  that is -- that is going to be a heavy lift. </p><p> CALDWEL:  It will be. But, you know, I was really happy to hear from an  individual who runs a program or an organization called ex-cons for  community and social change. His name is Tyrone Muhammad. He is actually an  ex-con. He went to jail I believe for about 30 years for murder. </p><p> He started a program when he got out of jail and he goes and gets more ex- cons and they go back into those communities in which they robbed and steal  from, the communities that they murdered and which led to bloodshed. </p><p> So, that was something that I thought was particularly encouraging because  they are talking to the youth. They're looking to put those individuals and  jobs.  And I was really happy to hear that because those are the stories  that we normally don't hear, those are stories that we normally don't see. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  I actually -- Gianno, we actually have -- Gianno, we actually  have that part of your discussion with him. I think we are going to play it  now. Let's watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TYRONE MUHAMMAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECCSC:  Those guys involved with my  organization have served 20 years or more in prison. We are men who  recognize that we've made a mistake. We are not sitting around waiting on  something (inaudible) white person, the politicians, the legislation, to  change our condition. We know that we helped perpetrate some of the  violence in our community and we learned a long time ago why we was in  prison, that we would have to change it ourselves. </p><p> (END VIDE CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right Gianno, final thoughts real quick. </p><p> CALDWELL:  We need more of that in the city of Chicago. There needs to be  an expansion of personal responsibility because no one can rely on the  government to solve all of these problems. And that includes the violence  in Chicago. They are part of the solution but they are not the solution in  totality. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  You need more police, you need more cops on the ground, you need  more detectives so they actually solve some of these crimes, and that is  where the mayor and city officials kick in. Gianno, thank you very much. </p><p> CALDWEL:  It's been a failure of leadership on the level of the city and as  well of the state, there's been a failure of leadership in Chicago. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, we've been trying to get Rahm Emanuel on this show and  other alderman and not much luck there. So, we'll keep trying. Gianno,  thanks so much. </p><p> Now with the discussion on this, we're going to talk to Horace Cooper of  Project 21, and of course, Leo Terrell is with us, radio talk show host.  Both of you, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you. I don't  think this is an issue that should be political. It should be solved. </p><p> This should be solved both from within the community, with police, safe  leaders, and business can partner, but if it is not going to come from  within and a real move from within the community, I don't know how we are  going to solve this. </p><p> But I can tell by talking to folks today, you need more police on the  ground. If you don't have more police on the ground, you will never get any  of the good stuff to happen. Leo? </p><p> LEO TERRELL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well Laura, I can tell from your  sincerity that you are very serious about this. But it's just not police,  respectfully. When I just saw the president on Fox talking about African- American unemployment rate is down, what about in the south and west sides  of Chicago? There is poverty in Chicago youth, from 18 to 24. Giovanni  didn't talk about the unemployment rate in Chicago. </p><p> You got to have jobs they are and what I submit to you, Laura, is that  there are no jobs there. There's just not on the local level. We have a  Republican governor and the blame goes all the way around. But let's focus  on the absence of jobs. I'll support your argument about police but please,  acknowledge that great -- make America great again does not apply to  African-American youth between the ages of 18 and 24 beyond the south and  west side of Chicago. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Leo, I think you are right about that. I mean, I'm not --</p><p> TERRELL:  Thank you.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  I think you're right about that the jobs aren't there. Trump  didn't create Chicago. So, I mean, you are a really good civil rights  attorney, a Democrat, and I get that, but to say or imply -- </p><p> TERRELL:  Can I point out one thing? </p><p> INGRAHAM:  -- to imply that Trump caused Chicago is absurd, and it will not  stand. Horace? </p><p> HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21:  Absolutely.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  I mean, it starts before Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel has been  there since 2011, murder rates, ridiculous high. More than 2,000 people now  have been murdered in Chicago since he became mayor. Unacceptable.  Absolutely unacceptable. </p><p> COOPER:  Jobs -- jobs will never come to Chicago as long as it's Beirut on  Lake Michigan. Here's the truth. The truth is, it requires two basic  techniques. You  must increase the fear of apprehension on those who would  mug, rob, or rape grandma, the people who will not let Lucy go to school,  and they create an environment so Frank the father can't get a job. </p><p> You absolutely must start with creating apprehension -- excuse me, a risk  of apprehension, for those individuals. Once that risk is real, who do not  change, who will not conform, they must be removed. That means five, seven,  or 10-year sentences. When that happens, which we know it worked, it worked  in Richmond, it worked in New York City, it worked in Louisiana, in New  Orleans, it will work anywhere. When that happens, then we can talk about  jobs and personal responsibility. </p><p> TERRELL:  Hey, can I just say a little game called Jeopardy? How about  this? What do you got to lose? Give me a chance. OK, who made that  statement in 2016? The Democrats have always been in office --</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, lowest unemployment for African-American and how long?</p><p> TERRELL:  -- give me a chance. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> TERRELL:  Remember that guy? </p><p> COOPER:  We have set five records for low unemployment in just the first 10  (ph) years. </p><p> TERRELL:  What about Chicago? We are talking about Chicago, Horace. We are  talking about Chicago.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Guys, stop, stop, stop! Do you know that Democrats have been  running Chicago for I believe seven decades? Do you realize that? </p><p> TERRELL:  We have a Republican governor, Laura! </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Do you realize there is not one -- there is not -- we are  talking about the city of Chicago. You, Leo, are very smart, you know just  like I do, the city is run by the city council and the mayor's office. It's  not run by Bruce Rauner, OK. </p><p> They do legislate legislation and allocation of funds, but the funds and  the local taxes in Chicago run the police and they assist in running the  schools. OK? So, lets' be honest. This is 70 years of Democratic  leadership, 70! </p><p> TERRELL:  Here's a good fellow (ph) response. Local governments don't  create jobs. You know, Laura, that the job creation starts up in -- </p><p> (CROSTALK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Why are we on this? </p><p> TERRELL:  There are no jobs! </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Do you think, I mean honestly, if do you that Rahm Emanuel since  2011, has done a good job for the city of Chicago, because I can tell you,  most Democrats we talked to today in the streets, they want him gone. They  don't want him to return. They want a new person in. </p><p> TERRELL:  I'm not here to defend Rahm Emanuel. I'm not here -- I'm just  simply saying, you do acknowledge that jobs are critical. Horace simply  said lock everybody up. He doesn't have a job plan. </p><p> COOPER:  You will not create a thriving job market as long as grandma is  afraid to even go and get her prescriptions filled. </p><p> TERREL:  Talking points. </p><p> COOPER:  That Lucy can't go to school -- it's not a talking point. This is  a reality. </p><p> TERRELL:  It is, talking points. Pure tactic.</p><p> COOPER:  That Chicago papers profiled all of these victims that we are  ignoring. We don't have jets that fly in from Arizona to Washington, D.C. - -</p><p> TERRELL:  Talking points.</p><p> COOPER:  -- for all of the people who are dying in Chicago.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  OK, you know what -- you know it's not a talking point. Leo, you  keep saying talking points.  You know what is not a talking point?  We  talked to a woman whose nephew's remains were burned and stored in a 55- gallon drum.  You know what his great crime was?  Walking home.  </p><p> TERRELL:  That's a horrible crime.  That's a horrible crime.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  That's what life is in some of these neighborhoods in Chicago.   Don't tell me it's a talking point.  That's someone's life, and it happens  way too often, predominately African-American.  And it's got to stop.  The  cauldron of death and Chicago, got to put an end to it.  It is ridiculous,  and Republicans and Democrats have got to come together.  And the people of  the city I think want to do something about it, but when you have failed  leadership, whether it's Republican or Democrat, it's got to be changed and  swept out of office.  </p><p> TERRELL:  I agree with you, Laura.  I agree with you.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Great segment.  We are out of time.  </p><p> COOPER:  A jobs program will not stop cutthroat --  </p><p> TERRELL:  We are done, Horace.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  OK, guys, we're out of time.  We're going to be covering this  for months and months and months.  Thank you so much.</p><p> And joining us now with more -- excuse me.  We're going to take a break.   When we come back, we are going to talk about what Andrew Cuomo said,  believe it or not, about a ICE.  You thought the ICE protests were bad  before.  We might have protests on the other side after you hear what he  said.  Don't got away.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to abolish  ICE.  Where did this come from?  By the way, did you have any idea what ICE  does?  These are people that go into a nest of MS-13.  They call nest.   That is what it is.  It's a nest.  These are evil people in there.  </p><p> I can't say \"animals\" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I  called them animals.  I called them animals.  She went crazy.  I can't do  it.  </p><p> (BOOS)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Nancy Pelosi gets a lot of boos, doesn't she?  That was  President Trump at Indiana earlier tonight.  And that situation, those  remarks, could well not stand in greater contrast of the rhetoric we are  hearing from Democrats.  Andrew Cuomo last night at his debate with Cynthia  Nixon.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  New York state is the state that said we  will not cooperate with ICE.  They were a bunch of thugs.  He politicized  ICE.  they are a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, president of the  National Border Patrol union, and Esther Valdes, an immigration attorney.   Esther, good to see you.  Art, good to see you.  I'm going to have Art take  the first swing at the Cuomo comments.  I do not understand why the  Democrats keep going back to the well of maligning the great men and women  of the Immigration Customs Enforcement, but they must think it is going to  work somewhere, and maybe in New York.  Art?  </p><p> ART DEL CUETO:  They are doing it because they don't have anything else to  say.  When you lose the argument, you've got to bring a race.  That is  usually what these people have been doing.  It's amazing to hear someone  say something like that, and then call the ICE people thugs.  You are  saying you are not going to agree with law enforcement, but they are the  ones that are thugs?  It sounds like you're the thug.  </p><p> Every time I hear these guys go back and forth, I can't help but wonder  that they are competing and some kind of here, hold my beer, let's see how  stupid I can sound today contest.  It's just amazing.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Esther, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, had his own  reaction to what Cuomo said last night.  Let's watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR:  What he is saying, his actions are  disgusting.  To call ICE agents thugs, think about it.  These are men and  women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and  daughters, that chose to enforce the laws of this country, strap a gun to  the hip every day, put a Kevlar vest on to go out to the community and  protect America, protect the communities.  He calls them thugs.  Actually,  ICE arrests thugs, MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Esther, ICE arrests thugs and the Democrats are calling ICE  thugs, your reaction?  </p><p> ESTHER VALDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  It is notable that Governor Cuomo is  not a border state governor.  Otherwise he would have firsthand knowledge  of what ICE officers actually do.  They are the frontline defenders, and  here in San Diego they are the first line of defense to disrupt drug  trafficking rings, child molestation rings, and people who exploit men and  women.  I invite Governor Cuomo to come down here and see what ICE agents  actually do.  </p><p> And by and large, I interact with them as an immigration attorney at least  once a week when I'm at the detention facilities.  Those men and women are  some of our finest, bravest law enforcement agents that we have.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  I've got to remind everyone who the senators are who are in  favor of abolishing ICE, and this is just a list.  I'm sure it will grow,  but this is where we are right now.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, OK, New  York, she'll be running for president, 2020, Elizabeth Warren in  Massachusetts, she'll be running in 2020, Bernie Sanders, Vermont, he'll be  running a 2020, Mark Pocan in Wisconsin, nobody can even recognize him on  the street, Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Earl Blumenauer from  Oregon, Nydia Velazquez, New York, goes on, Raul Grijalva, Mark DeSaulnier,  California, and that's just where we are right now.  Of course,  congressional candidates, Alexandria Cortez, Randy Bryce, so forth.  </p><p> Art, I don't know why, again, Democrats think that the men and women who  keep us safe, are breaking up a child sex trafficking rings, human  smuggling rings, of course narcotics operations funded by the cartels -- I  don't get it.  How is that going to appeal even to the inner city folks who  want a safe environment as well?  I'm presuming they want safer streets,  safer situations for their families.  </p><p> DEL CUETO:  They should.  The thing is, they try to make this division, and  then they turn it around or they make it about race.  Listen, even when  I've come on your show, I see some of the comments that some of these  individuals say about myself.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, lovely.  </p><p> DEL CUETO:  As being Hispanic.  But I came to this country, my parents came  to this country legally.  There is a legal way to do it.  People can't  distinguish the difference between border patrol agents, between ICE  agents, between the immigration officers at our ports of entry.  They can't  distinguish the difference between a legal immigrant in an illegal  immigrant.  </p><p> It is just -- I don't know what their thought processes, but anything they  can do is they try to divide as much as possible so they appease a certain  group of people, and try to -- that's what it is.  It comes down to  division and race.  And the reality is, I've said it so many times, illegal  is not a race.  We are not out there separating families.  Whose to blame?   The families themselves.  An American citizen commits a crime with their  child in this country, what happens?  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  You get separated.</p><p> DEL CUETO:  You get separated, and you go through the court system.  What  is happening here is these people, they are such great parents that they  are turning over their children to drug smugglers, they are turning their  children over to people smugglers, they are abandoning them in the desert,  and we're the bad guys?  Come on.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  But it's our fault.  It's ICE's fault.  Guys, thank you so much.  </p><p> Charges of anti-conservative bias are roiling the big tech companies.   Kevin McCarthy has something to say about it.  Don't miss it, up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My administration is also  standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans.  Social media  giants, and I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate  political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results.  We will not  let large corporations silence conservative voices.  And it can.  It can go  the other way, too, some day.  We are not going to let them control what we  can and cannot see, read, and learn from.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  You heard President Trump.  He wants social media companies to  be held accountable for alleged anti-conservative bias.  Next week, Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey will have his feet held to the fire when he testifies on  Capitol Hill.  And one of the individuals leading the charge on all of this  is House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who joins us now.  Congressman,  great to see you.  </p><p> This is what I have been told, congressman, time and time again by my  liberal friends, OK?  This is an algorithm.  This has nothing to do with  politics.  The algorithm was in place before Trump, and it's going to be in  place after Trump.  There is no political bias, it all relates to what  articles are popular and versus articles that are not as popular.  What is  your reaction to that?  </p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  That's just not true.   Social media today is the modern-day town hall.  Sixty-seven percent of  adults get their news from somewhere on social media.  But let's just play  that out.  You see Prager University that puts out conservative videos, but  one happened to be about Israel with Alan Dershowitz, one happened to be  about baseball with George Will.  You know what?  Facebook wouldn't show  those because they said YouTube rated them similar to pornography.  </p><p> Then we found out recently that they said it was a couple of Facebook  employees.  Take, for instance, I follow your tweets.  You put something  out about Sweden last week in regards to conservatives gaming based upon  their immigration policy.  That algorithm, written by a human, said that  was sensitive, so certain people on Twitter could not see that.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  The Swedish election is sensitive.  OK.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  That's sensitive.  So that is just an algorithm?  But if you  Google the California Republican Party right before the primary, they said  our ideology was Nazism, and they blame that on Wikipedia.  </p><p> But after we have raised this issue -- and I've had many conversations with  the president about it, that we have to stop this bias, look what happened  in Facebook just this week.  Their own employees, those conservatives who  have been intimidated based upon their own personal philosophy, put a group  together and rose up because they feel that has been going on as well.  You  look at what they did to Palmer Luckey and others.  Palmer is a brilliant  kid who invented Oculus, who Facebook actually purchased.  But when they  found out he had given money, his own personal money based upon who he  wanted to see become president, they wanted to push him out.  This is what  is happening in social media, they think it is just algorithms.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Congressman, let's get to solutions here.  A lot of pals are  working in antitrust and expert on antitrust issues, some kind of difficult  antitrust theories floating out there.  But there is another interesting  idea beyond antitrust, which is to consider Facebook and Twitter and so  forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public  utility.  \"Vanity Fair\" had a headline about Bannon saying, Steve Bannon  wants to nationalize Facebook and Google's data.  The cofounder of  Cambridge Analytica says big data should be placed in a public trust.  That  is going to your point that this really is the town square, and even though  it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising, we're  talking about Facebook especially, so we have to treat a different way.  Is  that something Congress is going to look at in consultation with the  executive branch?  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  I think Congress is going to look at everything from the  perspective of how powerful they have become.  I have spoken to Jack Dorsey  throughout the month, because the beginning of August, I sent a letter  requesting for him to come to Energy and Commerce.  And I want to give him  credit, he is showing up September 5th, and he and I philosophically  disagree, but we do we worry on one thing.  We believe in the First  Amendment.  But we also believe in transparency and accountability.  He is  coming forward.  I think the other companies CEOs need to go forward as  well, because the stories that they are telling and blaming other people,  and it's just an algorithm, is proving not to be true.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  The Google CEO said, no, I understand, but they are happy to  work with China on setting up the censorship tools that the communists in  China want instituted in Google.  They don't have any problem with that.  </p><p> I have to get your thoughts on today's funeral ceremonies for John McCain,  impassioned speeches, we had Vice President Biden speak, many others.  Your  thoughts?  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  Well, I was there.  And I thought the very best speaker was a  very first speaker.  He was the first chief of staff to then congressman  John McCain.  And he told the story that John McCain told when he was a  POW, about a guard coming in, it's Christmas time, kind of loosening up the  ropes that had his arms time behind his back.  And right before he was  going off his time, he tied those ropes back.  He never seen this guard  before but he sees him out in the yard.  The guard walks up, doesn't say  anything to him, but with his foot in the gravel, he makes a cross, saying  about faith.  </p><p> And when you think of John McCain and what he went through, and every time  I watched put a jacket on, the difficulty, I had great respect for this  man.  I worked with him many times.  I had a difference of opinion, but I  thought that summed it up with a much more personal story, it was the  strongest story of the day.  It was a beautiful celebration of his life.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  I would agree with you, an amazing tribute.  And I'm going to  ignore some of the not so thinly veiled hits on President Trump by some of  the people who participated, but I agree with you.  Just that image of  Senator McCain, and may he rest in peace.  Congressman McCarthy, thank you  so much for joining us tonight.  And we are going to be watching that  hearing with Dorsey next week.  </p><p> The Justice Department, by the way, is firing a major shot at Harvard  University and affirmative action.  Details ahead.  You do not want to miss  this segment with Michelle Malkin.  Don't go away.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Harvard in the hot seat.  What happens when Harvard University  capped the number of Asian students who could be admitted?  Well, that  didn't go down so well.  Michelle Malkin joining us, and of course from  CRTV, and Cathy Areu, the publisher of \"Catalina Magazine.\" Also we have  news from Betsy DeVos at the Education Department involving Title IX and  sexual harassment on college campuses.  </p><p> But let's start with this Harvard story.  Michelle, you have been all over  this issue of affirmative action for years.  And now, we are at the point  where we are penalizing Asian students, and thankfully the U.S. Department  of Justice stepped in on behalf of fairness and merit on behalf of these  Asian students.  Tell us what you know.  </p><p> MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, this blatant racial  discrimination in the name of so-called social justice has punished high  achieving Asian-American students for a long time.  It's been obvious since  the late 1980s and 1990s when I was in college.  </p><p> And finally, we have the Trump Justice Department fighting with equality of  opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.  And what I love most about  what is happening, Laura, is Harvard is squirming under the microscope and  the bright, glaring sunlight of discovery.  For the longest time they had  kept their racially conscious and race unneutral policies under wraps, and  now it's being exposed.  </p><p> And what is happening is, you have a lot of liberal Asian-Americans who are  finally, finally having second thoughts about the social engineering that  has punished them at the expense of equality of opportunity.  And look, it  makes absolutely no sense to punish the children of legal immigrants from  all over Asia as some sort of social justice recompense to black students.   The reparations foundation of affirmative action here has been totally  blown up.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Let's go to Cathy.  Really short segment here.  Cathy, if it's  just a merit based analysis on admissions, the study from the Center for  Equal Opportunity shows that Asian-Americans would have 43 percent of the  admissions, Hispanics, two percent, African-Americans, on merit according  to the Center for Equal Opportunity, just one percent.  </p><p> CATHY AREU, \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE:  Right.  And what is merit?  Is merit  meaning SATs, is it meaning test scores?  So we are trying to say, this  against affirmative action.  And what's happening is that Harvard actually  has a system where there school population is diverse.  So the Trump  administration is trying to take away diversity at our institutions like  Harvard.  Harvard is fighting for diversity so that our student body can  look like our demographics in our country.  And there is nothing wrong with  that.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Let's move on really quickly.  No time here.  But Betsy DeVos  and Title IX.  Michelle, now it looks like men or anyone accused of sexual  harassment will have a few more rights aft UVA and of course some of the  other cases like Duke and so forth.  </p><p> MALKIN:  You think that civil libertarians would be cheering the fact that  we have administration that is restoring the rights of the accused and  restoring due process that has been sabotaged, particularly under the Obama  administration, by radicals who don't think that accused men should have  the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, that men who are  accused should have legal representation, that men who are accused should  be allowed to have access to exculpatory evidence, and that is what DeVos  is restoring.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Cathy, I owe you one because we're out of time.  When we come  back, final thoughts from Chicago.  Busy news night.  Stay there.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Tomorrow night, we'll be back here in Chicago, and we will be  following up on our reporting on some of the other media sources out there.   We told you this week about CNN and a little loosey-goosey they were  playing with their source Lanny Davis.  Who is lying more?  And tomorrow,  what NBC reportedly did to put the kibosh on that Harvey Weinstein  reporting by Ronan Farrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Laura Ingraham live from Chicago tonight and we're going to explain why in just a little bit.</p><p>The president just wrapping up a raucous rally in Indiana in Evansville. We're going to breakdown his remarks throughout the hours so stick with us.</p><p>Also tonight, are congressional Republicans about to go to war with big tech? House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to join us later in the hour to break it all down. The looming fight over bias in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Plus, the reason we are here, violence continues to rock this amazing American city, and while its political leaders might be asleep at the switch, we came to get answers. Fox's own Gianno Caldwell went to some of the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere in this country to talk to gang bangers and ex-cons. Some exclusive video you do not want to miss.</p><p>But first, as we just mentioned, the president is taking all comers tonight in Evansville and if you are just getting caught up, here is what you may have missed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The failing \"New York Times,\" which, by the way, if I wasn't here, they would be out of business. \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times,\" CNN. So, a writer for \"The New York Times\" that pretends she knows what she's talking about, hasn't got a clue.</p><p>And I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same, the place was packed, she made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom may be. And listen -- and he was so disappointed at the tone in the room. NBC, which is probably worse than CNN, but the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart. That's what the worth. Who knows? With these people, you never know.</p><p>By the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, governor, look how many cameras you have back there. It's just like the academy awards. Look at it. They can't get enough! But when they start screaming fake news, you see those red lights go off for a little while. Excuse me, we have technical difficulties. OK, then they go back. Right? Look at that. You know, in the studio, you hear they go, \"listen, he's about ready to go, look.\" ladies and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties.</p><p>We need Republicans in Congress. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies, and their fake news allies.</p><p>You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's see. All I can say this, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of it -- because inside, they have incredible people, but our Justice Department, and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right and doing it now because people are angry. People are angry.</p><p>What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point, I wanted to stay out, but at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly, I want them to do their job, I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to. Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching and the whole world gets it and the whole world understands exactly what is going on.</p><p>The Democrats, they called themselves the resistance. That is what they are good at. Resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day, they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 like never before delivered.</p><p>The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly undemocratic they really have become, right? The so-called resistance is mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we are really -- we are getting rid of those bad ideas one by one so fast, and it is driving them crazy. See, you have to understand, I have a better education than they do from a much better school.</p><p>The elites, they are the elites. They are the elites. I went to a better schools, I went to better everything. And by the way -- by the way -- are you ready for this? I am president and they are not.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining us now for reaction, Katrina Pierson of course, senior advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign. That's right. Already talking about 2020. Florida's republican attorney general Pam Bondi and attorney and Democratic strategist, Jan Ronis. Great to see all of you tonight.</p><p>Pam, let's start -- let's start with you, Pam. Indiana -- I think this is the president's third trip. He's heading to Charlotte, North Carolina for the next rally. He is stacked for these rallies. He is going to hit every close race, senate race. He'll do some house races, some people thought he wasn't going to be this active on the campaign trail, but, boy, were they wrong.</p><p>PAM BONDI, FLORIDA STATE ATTORNEY: They sure were, Laura. They were wrong and look at President Trump, look at his energy. He loves doing this. He loves going out and supporting these candidates, and he knows how important congress is to helping him pass the agenda that he needs to pass.</p><p>And he cares, and he is out there. I mean, this man must never, ever sleep. I mean, the president is just working tirelessly to help all of these races. And he loves it. He loves it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Katrina, I'm here in Chicago and had a chance to talk to a lot of folks earlier today. And believe it or not, even in liberal Chicago, where I think it is like 83 percent or 87 percent of the city voted democrat for Hillary in 2016, he has a lot of fans here.</p><p>But I think maybe two or three people, you know, in a room where I got to talk to about eight people, said we love what the president is doing on the economy, Katrina, but why does he have to harp on CNN or these other networks. Just focus on your agenda, don't worry about these other side issues because no one really cares. No one's watching those networks. They are giving them too much -- too much publicity.</p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I don't think anyone can deny that Donald Trump isn't a fighter. He is his number one defender. We had a lot of experience about that on the first campaign. But it's really important for him to continue to highlight and identify how the fake news is doing an injustice to this country.</p><p>And, you know, as for tonight, Laura, there is nothing quite like or as fun as a Trump rally. Even in this hostile political environment, the president has deep opportunities do not just place a stamp of approval on candidates that are going to help them keep America great, but it's the opportunity to bypass those networks and speak directly to the people that talk about those accomplishments.</p><p>And I have to tell you that this president has accomplished so much in his first two years that we actually had to create a website, promises kept.com, just to keep up with him. I was not one of those people that expected him to just sit around and wait for the candidates to get going.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, the thing that is going to happen tomorrow, and Jan, you can chime in here, tomorrow it looks like they are going to announce officially, they needed to do it by tomorrow, that Canada is going to join in on this agreement with the United States and Mexico, replacing the old NAFTA, a huge deal. Clinton, Obama, Bush, Hillary, they all promised -- Hillary if she was elected -- that they were going to change NAFTA.</p><p>No one thought President Trump was going to be able to do it. Just two days ago, all the brilliant ones on cable news were saying, oh, Canada is not going to join. This is never going to get through. Jan, on the issues of trade and the economy, what is the Democrats' response to Trump's winning on these issue?</p><p>JAN RONIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY: Well, the Democratic response ought to be that really -- that the NAFTA renegotiations are just NAFTA with a new name. I mean, quite frankly, the differences are very subtle --</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, they are not. Jan, you cannot come on this show. This is actually something I know a lot about and I don't mean to interrupt you right off the bat. But if you come on this show, and you start talking smack about something you frankly don't know what you're talking about -- god bless you -- this is a completely redo of the NAFTA deal.</p><p>Do you understand what the rules of origin are all about? Do you get the percentage of American components? Do you get that? Then you wouldn't have said what you just said.</p><p>RONIS: For example, the percentage of American components have gone up I believe from 65 to 75. That's relatively a very small amount.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right. OK.</p><p>RONIS: And the wage increases don't apply to Mexico, which would still allow Mexico to, you know, manufacture these cars at far lower prices than in the United States. So it isn't -- you think the manufacturers will now going to return to Mexico when they don't have to pay $16 an hour? They're going to stay in Mexico.</p><p>INGRAHAM: This is I've got to say. Yes, but you have intellectual property protections, Pam Bondi, you have digital protections, this was a hard bargain that was driven by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the whole team at the USTR, Lusi Videgaray who came in the show a couple of days ago, is the foreign minister. We finally got Trudeau and the gang in Canada on board.</p><p>The idea that this is a significant deal -- if it wasn't significant, then why didn't Obama did something? Then why didn't, you know, why didn't George W. Bush do anything with it?</p><p>BONDO: Because they couldn't.</p><p>RONIS: And in fact the word changes under way (ph) during the Obama administration.</p><p>BONDI: Because they couldn't do anything with it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Never got anything done, Jan. You know it, I know it. I don't want to be cranky tonight but you cannot come on this show and make claims that are completely, patently false! This is a total redo of NAFTA. You don't know what you're talking about. It's several -- I think it is 700 pages long. So don't come on the show and say it's ridiculous. Pam Bondi, your turn.</p><p>BONDI: Thank you. And the president and Jared and the staff, they have been working on this nonstop. They were working on it all day today on Canada. And with all the noise, everything going on, everything they are trying to accuse the president of in the middle of all that, he is staying laser focused and he is helping the American people.</p><p>He is bringing jobs to our country -- at 3.8 unemployment -- everything he said, but what he did with Mexico and now Canada is unprecedented. And he is a businessman. He is successful, and that is why our country is thriving because of President Trump.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And by the way, news for Jan and everyone else watching, the Europeans tonight announced -- another thing that the experts that would never happen -- that they are going to eliminate, I believe, most tariffs on automobiles. Why are they doing that do you think? Because they see what Trump just did with Canada and with Mexico on NAFTA.</p><p>So, these barriers to effective and fair trade are systematically being dismantled because of a smart trade policy, and that is what Democrats used to be in favor of. I want to play for you, Katrina, something that Chuck Todd said today about a bombshell tomorrow. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Here's what I've learned about Bob Mueller, not a single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him would say, if he didn't have anything -- if he would've ended this investigation if there was no collusion, that he already would have ended this --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can't tell that though until he tells us.</p><p>TODD: That's true. I think he knows more than anything he keeps quiet between Labor Day and election day. I'm not missing work tomorrow. I wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, we are not missing work tomorrow, either, but that was one of the more ridiculous things I've heard. Katrina -- and a rabbit is going to come out of his hat.</p><p>PIERSON: Laura, this is hypervigilance on behalf of the left. These are the kinds of things that we have been hearing since the president took the famous ride down the escalator and people are pretty much immune to it. Clearly there was no collusion.</p><p>But look, no one is going to be listening to the talking heads on TV particularly when their 401(K)s are going up. This trade deal was very good, and it looks like it even took the stock market out of correction territory. So again, Laura, the people at home are smarter than a lot of the media think.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, well, I think again, the Democrats have to actually come to the table with solutions, not just identity politics, get Trump and impeach him.</p><p>PIERSON: But how could they possibly come with solutions, they don't even know who they are? Are they Democrats? Are they liberals? Are they socialists? There is a crisis going on in the Democrat Party and President Trump is out there --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, it's a split (ph) personality.</p><p>PIERSON: That's what it is. It's a split personality and the Trump derangement syndrome just compounds the effect.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right guys.</p><p>BONDI: And Laura, he's out there talking to the American people. He's out there talking to the American people that they understand, saying we are not going to get ripped off by other countries anymore.</p><p>PIERSON: Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Real quick, I got to give Jan a final thought real quick. We're way over.</p><p>RONIS: Listen, he is going back to the same old rhetoric that he did when he first got elected, trying to scare the American people, talking about Hillary getting away with criminal activities, frightening everybody about undocumented aliens. It's the same old, you know, art of -- the art of politics is getting elected and re-elected, and I'll give him credit because he is an expert at that but it's at the expense of the truth. It's at the expense of what this country and its people.</p><p>PIERSON: 401(K), Jan, 401(K).</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, 4.2 percent GDP.</p><p>RONIS: -- millions of people in this country --</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right guys, we're out of time. All right, we are here in Chicago. A new wave of violence striking the city. When we come back, we are going to talk to one of the best reporters on the ground, and you don't want to miss that. Stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yet another wave of violence rocking the city of Chicago tonight. Just yesterday, eight people were shot and wounded in a period of eight hours. And with each day that goes by, Chicago city officials led by Rahm Emanuel seemed more and more powerless to stop it. This week, Gianno Caldwell, a Fox News political analyst and Chicago native, went out to speak with members of the worst hit communities and find out what is driving the bloodshed. Watchg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NINI, CHICAGO RESIDENT: In this neighborhood, everybody want to be better than the next person. Everybody want to rock the better jeans. You know what you got on, the better shoes. Everyone want to be the one on top.</p><p>So these boys looking at it, like, hey, let me see your (inaudible) and let me do this and that. That's why there's a lot of violence. And I believe, you get some of these boys into a job, put money in their pockets so they can survive, take care of what they need to take care of, maybe it'll stop some of this stuff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining us now with more is Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great to see you tonight. You know, it was interesting what Ninin just said there, and she said everyone wants to be on top, have what the other guy has or better, I don't know if she was talking about house or car or shoes or what. But --</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Everything. All of the above.</p><p>INGRAHAM: -- she said if they had a job maybe it would -- yes, maybe it would be better. To get the job, you have to have the skills, you have to have the educational background, a parent or role model who helps with the education and the guidance. The problem is a lot of these kids don't have any of that. And then the gangs walk in.</p><p>CADWELL: Yes, Laura. I think what I really saw here this week, when doing these interviews with a number of the high-ranking gang members throughout the city of Chicago, is there is a deficit in personal responsibility. A lot of parents that have left their homes who believe that their parents maybe were too harsh on them as they were growing up, they allowed their kids to run free.</p><p>And as a result, we see the bloodshed. We all did a study in 2015, which said for every 100,000 residents in the city of Chicago, there is, on average, one white person shot, 28 Hispanic shot, and a whopping 113 African-Americans shot in a city of 2.7 million people. This is beyond the pale of what we should see in any American city. And I know, and I thank you for your coverage on this, because you have done it from your heart, this has not been political for you.</p><p>You see the same things that I see in a lot of the African-American residents here in Chicago, which is no American city should be like this. There should be no person in an American city that have to live through this level of fear.</p><p>And what we are seeing and especially speaking to the gang bangers in the city of Chicago, there is a lot of those folks feel that this was a life that they were preconditioned for. This isn't something that they necessarily chose, as one told me, this is the life that chose him. So this is, I mean, is just unfortunate.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And Gianno, the need for investment or business to come in, as we have talked about before, how do you solve this problem? Until the streets are safe, we need more detectives, more police, more personal responsibility, more role models, it is hard to get the business to come in, even with tax incentives that Rahm Emanuel, as far as I know, hasn't been willing to talk about.</p><p>But even with tax incentives, if you go in there in some Inglewood, some of these other areas and worried about your safety, or your employee safety, that is -- that is going to be a heavy lift.</p><p>CALDWEL: It will be. But, you know, I was really happy to hear from an individual who runs a program or an organization called ex-cons for community and social change. His name is Tyrone Muhammad. He is actually an ex-con. He went to jail I believe for about 30 years for murder.</p><p>He started a program when he got out of jail and he goes and gets more ex- cons and they go back into those communities in which they robbed and steal from, the communities that they murdered and which led to bloodshed.</p><p>So, that was something that I thought was particularly encouraging because they are talking to the youth. They're looking to put those individuals and jobs. And I was really happy to hear that because those are the stories that we normally don't hear, those are stories that we normally don't see.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I actually -- Gianno, we actually have -- Gianno, we actually have that part of your discussion with him. I think we are going to play it now. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TYRONE MUHAMMAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECCSC: Those guys involved with my organization have served 20 years or more in prison. We are men who recognize that we've made a mistake. We are not sitting around waiting on something (inaudible) white person, the politicians, the legislation, to change our condition. We know that we helped perpetrate some of the violence in our community and we learned a long time ago why we was in prison, that we would have to change it ourselves.</p><p>(END VIDE CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right Gianno, final thoughts real quick.</p><p>CALDWELL: We need more of that in the city of Chicago. There needs to be an expansion of personal responsibility because no one can rely on the government to solve all of these problems. And that includes the violence in Chicago. They are part of the solution but they are not the solution in totality.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You need more police, you need more cops on the ground, you need more detectives so they actually solve some of these crimes, and that is where the mayor and city officials kick in. Gianno, thank you very much.</p><p>CALDWEL: It's been a failure of leadership on the level of the city and as well of the state, there's been a failure of leadership in Chicago.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, we've been trying to get Rahm Emanuel on this show and other alderman and not much luck there. So, we'll keep trying. Gianno, thanks so much.</p><p>Now with the discussion on this, we're going to talk to Horace Cooper of Project 21, and of course, Leo Terrell is with us, radio talk show host. Both of you, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you. I don't think this is an issue that should be political. It should be solved.</p><p>This should be solved both from within the community, with police, safe leaders, and business can partner, but if it is not going to come from within and a real move from within the community, I don't know how we are going to solve this.</p><p>But I can tell by talking to folks today, you need more police on the ground. If you don't have more police on the ground, you will never get any of the good stuff to happen. Leo?</p><p>LEO TERRELL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well Laura, I can tell from your sincerity that you are very serious about this. But it's just not police, respectfully. When I just saw the president on Fox talking about African- American unemployment rate is down, what about in the south and west sides of Chicago? There is poverty in Chicago youth, from 18 to 24. Giovanni didn't talk about the unemployment rate in Chicago.</p><p>You got to have jobs they are and what I submit to you, Laura, is that there are no jobs there. There's just not on the local level. We have a Republican governor and the blame goes all the way around. But let's focus on the absence of jobs. I'll support your argument about police but please, acknowledge that great -- make America great again does not apply to African-American youth between the ages of 18 and 24 beyond the south and west side of Chicago.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Leo, I think you are right about that. I mean, I'm not --</p><p>TERRELL: Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think you're right about that the jobs aren't there. Trump didn't create Chicago. So, I mean, you are a really good civil rights attorney, a Democrat, and I get that, but to say or imply --</p><p>TERRELL: Can I point out one thing?</p><p>INGRAHAM: -- to imply that Trump caused Chicago is absurd, and it will not stand. Horace?</p><p>HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21: Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean, it starts before Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel has been there since 2011, murder rates, ridiculous high. More than 2,000 people now have been murdered in Chicago since he became mayor. Unacceptable. Absolutely unacceptable.</p><p>COOPER: Jobs -- jobs will never come to Chicago as long as it's Beirut on Lake Michigan. Here's the truth. The truth is, it requires two basic techniques. You must increase the fear of apprehension on those who would mug, rob, or rape grandma, the people who will not let Lucy go to school, and they create an environment so Frank the father can't get a job.</p><p>You absolutely must start with creating apprehension -- excuse me, a risk of apprehension, for those individuals. Once that risk is real, who do not change, who will not conform, they must be removed. That means five, seven, or 10-year sentences. When that happens, which we know it worked, it worked in Richmond, it worked in New York City, it worked in Louisiana, in New Orleans, it will work anywhere. When that happens, then we can talk about jobs and personal responsibility.</p><p>TERRELL: Hey, can I just say a little game called Jeopardy? How about this? What do you got to lose? Give me a chance. OK, who made that statement in 2016? The Democrats have always been in office --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, lowest unemployment for African-American and how long?</p><p>TERRELL: -- give me a chance.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TERRELL: Remember that guy?</p><p>COOPER: We have set five records for low unemployment in just the first 10 (ph) years.</p><p>TERRELL: What about Chicago? We are talking about Chicago, Horace. We are talking about Chicago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Guys, stop, stop, stop! Do you know that Democrats have been running Chicago for I believe seven decades? Do you realize that?</p><p>TERRELL: We have a Republican governor, Laura!</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do you realize there is not one -- there is not -- we are talking about the city of Chicago. You, Leo, are very smart, you know just like I do, the city is run by the city council and the mayor's office. It's not run by Bruce Rauner, OK.</p><p>They do legislate legislation and allocation of funds, but the funds and the local taxes in Chicago run the police and they assist in running the schools. OK? So, lets' be honest. This is 70 years of Democratic leadership, 70!</p><p>TERRELL: Here's a good fellow (ph) response. Local governments don't create jobs. You know, Laura, that the job creation starts up in --</p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why are we on this?</p><p>TERRELL: There are no jobs!</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do you think, I mean honestly, if do you that Rahm Emanuel since 2011, has done a good job for the city of Chicago, because I can tell you, most Democrats we talked to today in the streets, they want him gone. They don't want him to return. They want a new person in.</p><p>TERRELL: I'm not here to defend Rahm Emanuel. I'm not here -- I'm just simply saying, you do acknowledge that jobs are critical. Horace simply said lock everybody up. He doesn't have a job plan.</p><p>COOPER: You will not create a thriving job market as long as grandma is afraid to even go and get her prescriptions filled.</p><p>TERREL: Talking points.</p><p>COOPER: That Lucy can't go to school -- it's not a talking point. This is a reality.</p><p>TERRELL: It is, talking points. Pure tactic.</p><p>COOPER: That Chicago papers profiled all of these victims that we are ignoring. We don't have jets that fly in from Arizona to Washington, D.C. - -</p><p>TERRELL: Talking points.</p><p>COOPER: -- for all of the people who are dying in Chicago.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, you know what -- you know it's not a talking point. Leo, you keep saying talking points. You know what is not a talking point? We talked to a woman whose nephew's remains were burned and stored in a 55- gallon drum. You know what his great crime was? Walking home.</p><p>TERRELL: That's a horrible crime. That's a horrible crime.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's what life is in some of these neighborhoods in Chicago. Don't tell me it's a talking point. That's someone's life, and it happens way too often, predominately African-American. And it's got to stop. The cauldron of death and Chicago, got to put an end to it. It is ridiculous, and Republicans and Democrats have got to come together. And the people of the city I think want to do something about it, but when you have failed leadership, whether it's Republican or Democrat, it's got to be changed and swept out of office.</p><p>TERRELL: I agree with you, Laura. I agree with you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Great segment. We are out of time.</p><p>COOPER: A jobs program will not stop cutthroat --</p><p>TERRELL: We are done, Horace.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, guys, we're out of time. We're going to be covering this for months and months and months. Thank you so much.</p><p>And joining us now with more -- excuse me. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we are going to talk about what Andrew Cuomo said, believe it or not, about a ICE. You thought the ICE protests were bad before. We might have protests on the other side after you hear what he said. Don't got away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats want to abolish ICE. Where did this come from? By the way, did you have any idea what ICE does? These are people that go into a nest of MS-13. They call nest. That is what it is. It's a nest. These are evil people in there.</p><p>I can't say \"animals\" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I called them animals. I called them animals. She went crazy. I can't do it.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Nancy Pelosi gets a lot of boos, doesn't she? That was President Trump at Indiana earlier tonight. And that situation, those remarks, could well not stand in greater contrast of the rhetoric we are hearing from Democrats. Andrew Cuomo last night at his debate with Cynthia Nixon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK: New York state is the state that said we will not cooperate with ICE. They were a bunch of thugs. He politicized ICE. they are a bunch of thugs. We said we will sue them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, president of the National Border Patrol union, and Esther Valdes, an immigration attorney. Esther, good to see you. Art, good to see you. I'm going to have Art take the first swing at the Cuomo comments. I do not understand why the Democrats keep going back to the well of maligning the great men and women of the Immigration Customs Enforcement, but they must think it is going to work somewhere, and maybe in New York. Art?</p><p>ART DEL CUETO: They are doing it because they don't have anything else to say. When you lose the argument, you've got to bring a race. That is usually what these people have been doing. It's amazing to hear someone say something like that, and then call the ICE people thugs. You are saying you are not going to agree with law enforcement, but they are the ones that are thugs? It sounds like you're the thug.</p><p>Every time I hear these guys go back and forth, I can't help but wonder that they are competing and some kind of here, hold my beer, let's see how stupid I can sound today contest. It's just amazing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Esther, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, had his own reaction to what Cuomo said last night. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR: What he is saying, his actions are disgusting. To call ICE agents thugs, think about it. These are men and women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, that chose to enforce the laws of this country, strap a gun to the hip every day, put a Kevlar vest on to go out to the community and protect America, protect the communities. He calls them thugs. Actually, ICE arrests thugs, MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Esther, ICE arrests thugs and the Democrats are calling ICE thugs, your reaction?</p><p>ESTHER VALDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: It is notable that Governor Cuomo is not a border state governor. Otherwise he would have firsthand knowledge of what ICE officers actually do. They are the frontline defenders, and here in San Diego they are the first line of defense to disrupt drug trafficking rings, child molestation rings, and people who exploit men and women. I invite Governor Cuomo to come down here and see what ICE agents actually do.</p><p>And by and large, I interact with them as an immigration attorney at least once a week when I'm at the detention facilities. Those men and women are some of our finest, bravest law enforcement agents that we have.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I've got to remind everyone who the senators are who are in favor of abolishing ICE, and this is just a list. I'm sure it will grow, but this is where we are right now. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, OK, New York, she'll be running for president, 2020, Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, she'll be running in 2020, Bernie Sanders, Vermont, he'll be running a 2020, Mark Pocan in Wisconsin, nobody can even recognize him on the street, Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Earl Blumenauer from Oregon, Nydia Velazquez, New York, goes on, Raul Grijalva, Mark DeSaulnier, California, and that's just where we are right now. Of course, congressional candidates, Alexandria Cortez, Randy Bryce, so forth.</p><p>Art, I don't know why, again, Democrats think that the men and women who keep us safe, are breaking up a child sex trafficking rings, human smuggling rings, of course narcotics operations funded by the cartels -- I don't get it. How is that going to appeal even to the inner city folks who want a safe environment as well? I'm presuming they want safer streets, safer situations for their families.</p><p>DEL CUETO: They should. The thing is, they try to make this division, and then they turn it around or they make it about race. Listen, even when I've come on your show, I see some of the comments that some of these individuals say about myself.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, lovely.</p><p>DEL CUETO: As being Hispanic. But I came to this country, my parents came to this country legally. There is a legal way to do it. People can't distinguish the difference between border patrol agents, between ICE agents, between the immigration officers at our ports of entry. They can't distinguish the difference between a legal immigrant in an illegal immigrant.</p><p>It is just -- I don't know what their thought processes, but anything they can do is they try to divide as much as possible so they appease a certain group of people, and try to -- that's what it is. It comes down to division and race. And the reality is, I've said it so many times, illegal is not a race. We are not out there separating families. Whose to blame? The families themselves. An American citizen commits a crime with their child in this country, what happens?</p><p>INGRAHAM: You get separated.</p><p>DEL CUETO: You get separated, and you go through the court system. What is happening here is these people, they are such great parents that they are turning over their children to drug smugglers, they are turning their children over to people smugglers, they are abandoning them in the desert, and we're the bad guys? Come on.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But it's our fault. It's ICE's fault. Guys, thank you so much.</p><p>Charges of anti-conservative bias are roiling the big tech companies. Kevin McCarthy has something to say about it. Don't miss it, up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My administration is also standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans. Social media giants, and I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results. We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices. And it can. It can go the other way, too, some day. We are not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: You heard President Trump. He wants social media companies to be held accountable for alleged anti-conservative bias. Next week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey will have his feet held to the fire when he testifies on Capitol Hill. And one of the individuals leading the charge on all of this is House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who joins us now. Congressman, great to see you.</p><p>This is what I have been told, congressman, time and time again by my liberal friends, OK? This is an algorithm. This has nothing to do with politics. The algorithm was in place before Trump, and it's going to be in place after Trump. There is no political bias, it all relates to what articles are popular and versus articles that are not as popular. What is your reaction to that?</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: That's just not true. Social media today is the modern-day town hall. Sixty-seven percent of adults get their news from somewhere on social media. But let's just play that out. You see Prager University that puts out conservative videos, but one happened to be about Israel with Alan Dershowitz, one happened to be about baseball with George Will. You know what? Facebook wouldn't show those because they said YouTube rated them similar to pornography.</p><p>Then we found out recently that they said it was a couple of Facebook employees. Take, for instance, I follow your tweets. You put something out about Sweden last week in regards to conservatives gaming based upon their immigration policy. That algorithm, written by a human, said that was sensitive, so certain people on Twitter could not see that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: The Swedish election is sensitive. OK.</p><p>MCCARTHY: That's sensitive. So that is just an algorithm? But if you Google the California Republican Party right before the primary, they said our ideology was Nazism, and they blame that on Wikipedia.</p><p>But after we have raised this issue -- and I've had many conversations with the president about it, that we have to stop this bias, look what happened in Facebook just this week. Their own employees, those conservatives who have been intimidated based upon their own personal philosophy, put a group together and rose up because they feel that has been going on as well. You look at what they did to Palmer Luckey and others. Palmer is a brilliant kid who invented Oculus, who Facebook actually purchased. But when they found out he had given money, his own personal money based upon who he wanted to see become president, they wanted to push him out. This is what is happening in social media, they think it is just algorithms.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman, let's get to solutions here. A lot of pals are working in antitrust and expert on antitrust issues, some kind of difficult antitrust theories floating out there. But there is another interesting idea beyond antitrust, which is to consider Facebook and Twitter and so forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public utility. \"Vanity Fair\" had a headline about Bannon saying, Steve Bannon wants to nationalize Facebook and Google's data. The cofounder of Cambridge Analytica says big data should be placed in a public trust. That is going to your point that this really is the town square, and even though it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising, we're talking about Facebook especially, so we have to treat a different way. Is that something Congress is going to look at in consultation with the executive branch?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think Congress is going to look at everything from the perspective of how powerful they have become. I have spoken to Jack Dorsey throughout the month, because the beginning of August, I sent a letter requesting for him to come to Energy and Commerce. And I want to give him credit, he is showing up September 5th, and he and I philosophically disagree, but we do we worry on one thing. We believe in the First Amendment. But we also believe in transparency and accountability. He is coming forward. I think the other companies CEOs need to go forward as well, because the stories that they are telling and blaming other people, and it's just an algorithm, is proving not to be true.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The Google CEO said, no, I understand, but they are happy to work with China on setting up the censorship tools that the communists in China want instituted in Google. They don't have any problem with that.</p><p>I have to get your thoughts on today's funeral ceremonies for John McCain, impassioned speeches, we had Vice President Biden speak, many others. Your thoughts?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I was there. And I thought the very best speaker was a very first speaker. He was the first chief of staff to then congressman John McCain. And he told the story that John McCain told when he was a POW, about a guard coming in, it's Christmas time, kind of loosening up the ropes that had his arms time behind his back. And right before he was going off his time, he tied those ropes back. He never seen this guard before but he sees him out in the yard. The guard walks up, doesn't say anything to him, but with his foot in the gravel, he makes a cross, saying about faith.</p><p>And when you think of John McCain and what he went through, and every time I watched put a jacket on, the difficulty, I had great respect for this man. I worked with him many times. I had a difference of opinion, but I thought that summed it up with a much more personal story, it was the strongest story of the day. It was a beautiful celebration of his life.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I would agree with you, an amazing tribute. And I'm going to ignore some of the not so thinly veiled hits on President Trump by some of the people who participated, but I agree with you. Just that image of Senator McCain, and may he rest in peace. Congressman McCarthy, thank you so much for joining us tonight. And we are going to be watching that hearing with Dorsey next week.</p><p>The Justice Department, by the way, is firing a major shot at Harvard University and affirmative action. Details ahead. You do not want to miss this segment with Michelle Malkin. Don't go away.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Harvard in the hot seat. What happens when Harvard University capped the number of Asian students who could be admitted? Well, that didn't go down so well. Michelle Malkin joining us, and of course from CRTV, and Cathy Areu, the publisher of \"Catalina Magazine.\" Also we have news from Betsy DeVos at the Education Department involving Title IX and sexual harassment on college campuses.</p><p>But let's start with this Harvard story. Michelle, you have been all over this issue of affirmative action for years. And now, we are at the point where we are penalizing Asian students, and thankfully the U.S. Department of Justice stepped in on behalf of fairness and merit on behalf of these Asian students. Tell us what you know.</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Yes, this blatant racial discrimination in the name of so-called social justice has punished high achieving Asian-American students for a long time. It's been obvious since the late 1980s and 1990s when I was in college.</p><p>And finally, we have the Trump Justice Department fighting with equality of opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome. And what I love most about what is happening, Laura, is Harvard is squirming under the microscope and the bright, glaring sunlight of discovery. For the longest time they had kept their racially conscious and race unneutral policies under wraps, and now it's being exposed.</p><p>And what is happening is, you have a lot of liberal Asian-Americans who are finally, finally having second thoughts about the social engineering that has punished them at the expense of equality of opportunity. And look, it makes absolutely no sense to punish the children of legal immigrants from all over Asia as some sort of social justice recompense to black students. The reparations foundation of affirmative action here has been totally blown up.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Let's go to Cathy. Really short segment here. Cathy, if it's just a merit based analysis on admissions, the study from the Center for Equal Opportunity shows that Asian-Americans would have 43 percent of the admissions, Hispanics, two percent, African-Americans, on merit according to the Center for Equal Opportunity, just one percent.</p><p>CATHY AREU, \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE: Right. And what is merit? Is merit meaning SATs, is it meaning test scores? So we are trying to say, this against affirmative action. And what's happening is that Harvard actually has a system where there school population is diverse. So the Trump administration is trying to take away diversity at our institutions like Harvard. Harvard is fighting for diversity so that our student body can look like our demographics in our country. And there is nothing wrong with that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Let's move on really quickly. No time here. But Betsy DeVos and Title IX. Michelle, now it looks like men or anyone accused of sexual harassment will have a few more rights aft UVA and of course some of the other cases like Duke and so forth.</p><p>MALKIN: You think that civil libertarians would be cheering the fact that we have administration that is restoring the rights of the accused and restoring due process that has been sabotaged, particularly under the Obama administration, by radicals who don't think that accused men should have the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, that men who are accused should have legal representation, that men who are accused should be allowed to have access to exculpatory evidence, and that is what DeVos is restoring.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Cathy, I owe you one because we're out of time. When we come back, final thoughts from Chicago. Busy news night. Stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Tomorrow night, we'll be back here in Chicago, and we will be following up on our reporting on some of the other media sources out there. We told you this week about CNN and a little loosey-goosey they were playing with their source Lanny Davis. Who is lying more? And tomorrow, what NBC reportedly did to put the kibosh on that Harvey Weinstein reporting by Ronan Farrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018083001cb257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T56-S5V1-JB20-G4WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>HARVARD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rally</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Indiana</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Speeches</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jobs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mexico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chicago</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Youth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Guns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Deaths</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Hey, Laura. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hey, Judge Jeanine. How are you? Fantastic  show tonight as always. Love the Bongino segment. Fantastic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIRRO: Well, we love Dan Bongino. He's a fighter wherever you need one.  Anyway, where are you tonight? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  We are in Chicago having a lot of fun, causing a little trouble,  but all in a good way, the good trouble in a good way. </p><p>PIRRO:  Make sure you have Giordano's pizza.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You know something, you are the second person who told me that  so I'm on it. Judge Jeanine, thank you so much. Great show. </p><p>PIRRO:  All right. Have a great show.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, welcome to THE INGRAHAM Angle.  I'm Laura Ingraham  live from Chicago tonight and we're going to explain why in just a little  bit. </p><p>The president just wrapping up a raucous rally in Indiana in Evansville.  We're going to breakdown his remarks throughout the hours so stick with us. </p><p>Also tonight, are congressional Republicans about to go to war with big  tech? House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to join us later in the  hour to break it all down. The looming fight over bias in Silicon Valley. </p><p>Plus, the reason we are here, violence continues to rock this amazing  American city, and while its political leaders might be asleep at the  switch, we came to get answers. Fox's own Gianno Caldwell went to some of  the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere in this country to talk to gang  bangers and ex-cons. Some exclusive video you do not want to miss. </p><p>But first, as we just mentioned, the president is taking all comers tonight  in Evansville and if you are just getting caught up, here is what you may  have missed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York  Times,\" which, by the way, if I wasn't here, they would be out of business.  \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times,\" CNN. So, a writer for \"The New  York Times\" that pretends she knows what she's talking about, hasn't got a  clue. </p><p>And I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same, the place was packed, she  made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty  chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom may be. And listen -- and he  was so disappointed at the tone in the room. NBC, which is probably worse  than CNN, but the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great  thing to do. How smart. That's what the worth. Who knows? With these  people, you never know.</p><p>By the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, governor, look how many cameras  you have back there. It's just like the academy awards. Look at it. They  can't get enough! But when they start screaming fake news, you see those  red lights go off for a little while. Excuse me, we have technical  difficulties. OK, then they go back. Right? Look at that. You know, in the  studio, you hear they go, \"listen, he's about ready to go, look.\" ladies  and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties. </p><p>We need Republicans in Congress. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by  left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies,  and their fake news allies. </p><p>You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at  what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's  see. All I can say this, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of  it -- because inside, they have incredible people, but our Justice  Department, and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right  and doing it now because people are angry. People are angry. </p><p>What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point, I wanted to stay out,  but at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly, I want them to do  their job, I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to.  Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching and the whole world gets it  and the whole world understands exactly what is going on. </p><p>The Democrats, they called themselves the resistance. That is what they are  good at. Resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day,  they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine  the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 like never  before delivered. </p><p>The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly  undemocratic they really have become, right? The so-called resistance is  mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we  are really -- we are getting rid of those bad ideas one by one so fast, and  it is driving them crazy. See, you have to understand, I have a better  education than they do from a much better school. </p><p>The elites, they are the elites. They are the elites. I went to a better  schools, I went to better everything. And by the way -- by the way -- are  you ready for this? I am president and they are not.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now for reaction, Katrina Pierson of course, senior  advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign. That's right. Already talking about  2020. Florida's republican attorney general Pam Bondi and attorney and  Democratic strategist, Jan Ronis. Great to see all of you tonight. </p><p>Pam, let's start -- let's start with you, Pam. Indiana -- I think this is  the president's third trip. He's heading to Charlotte, North Carolina for  the next rally. He is stacked for these rallies. He is going to hit every  close race, senate race. He'll do some house races, some people thought he  wasn't going to be this active on the campaign trail, but, boy, were they  wrong. </p><p>PAM BONDI, FLORIDA STATE ATTORNEY:  They sure were, Laura. They were wrong  and look at President Trump, look at his energy. He loves doing this. He  loves going out and supporting these candidates, and he knows how important  congress is to helping him pass the agenda that he needs to pass. </p><p>And he cares, and he is out there. I mean, this man must never, ever sleep.  I mean, the president is just working tirelessly to help all of these  races. And he loves it. He loves it. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Katrina, I'm here in Chicago and had a chance to talk to a lot  of folks earlier today. And believe it or not, even in liberal Chicago,  where I think it is like 83 percent or 87 percent of the city voted  democrat for Hillary in 2016, he has a lot of fans here. </p><p>But I think maybe two or three people, you know, in a room where I got to  talk to about eight people, said we love what the president is doing on the  economy, Katrina, but why does he have to harp on CNN or these other  networks. Just focus on your agenda, don't worry about these other side  issues because no one really cares. No one's watching those networks. They  are giving them too much -- too much publicity. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I don't think  anyone can deny that Donald Trump isn't a fighter. He is his number one  defender. We had a lot of experience about that on the first campaign. But  it's really important for him to continue to highlight and identify how the  fake news is doing an injustice to this country. </p><p>And, you know, as for tonight, Laura, there is nothing quite like or as fun  as a Trump rally. Even in this hostile political environment, the president  has deep opportunities do not just place a stamp of approval on candidates  that are going to help them keep America great, but it's the opportunity to  bypass those networks and speak directly to the people that talk about  those accomplishments. </p><p>And I have to tell you that this president has accomplished so much in his  first two years that we actually had to create a website, promises  kept.com, just to keep up with him. I was not one of those people that  expected him to just sit around and wait for the candidates to get going. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now, the thing that is going to happen tomorrow, and Jan, you  can chime in here, tomorrow it looks like they are going to announce  officially, they needed to do it by tomorrow, that Canada is going to join  in on this agreement with the United States and Mexico, replacing the old  NAFTA, a huge deal. Clinton, Obama, Bush, Hillary, they all promised --  Hillary if she was elected -- that they were going to change NAFTA. </p><p>No one thought President Trump was going to be able to do it. Just two days  ago, all the brilliant ones on cable news were saying, oh, Canada is not  going to join. This is never going to get through. Jan, on the issues of  trade and the economy, what is the Democrats' response to Trump's winning  on these issue? </p><p>JAN RONIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY:  Well, the Democratic response ought to be  that really -- that the NAFTA renegotiations are just NAFTA with a new  name. I mean, quite frankly, the differences are very subtle -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  No, they are not. Jan, you cannot come on this show. This is  actually something I know a lot about and I don't mean to interrupt you  right off the bat. But if you come on this show, and you start talking  smack about something you frankly don't know what you're talking about --  god bless you -- this is a completely redo of the NAFTA deal. </p><p>Do you understand what the rules of origin are all about? Do you get the  percentage of American components? Do you get that? Then you wouldn't have  said what you just said. </p><p>RONIS:  For example, the percentage of American components have gone up I  believe from 65 to 75. That's relatively a very small amount. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Right. OK.</p><p>RONIS:  And the wage increases don't apply to Mexico, which would still  allow Mexico to, you know, manufacture these cars at far lower prices than  in the United States. So it isn't -- you think the manufacturers will now  going to return to Mexico when they don't have to pay $16 an hour? They're  going to stay in Mexico. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  This is I've got to say. Yes, but you have intellectual property  protections, Pam Bondi, you have digital protections, this was a hard  bargain that was driven by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the whole team at  the USTR, Lusi Videgaray who came in the show a couple of days ago, is the  foreign minister. We finally got Trudeau and the gang in Canada on board. </p><p>The idea that this is a significant deal -- if it wasn't significant, then  why didn't Obama did something? Then why didn't, you know, why didn't  George W. Bush do anything with it? </p><p>BONDO:  Because they couldn't. </p><p>RONIS:  And in fact the word changes under way (ph) during the Obama  administration.</p><p>BONDI:  Because they couldn't do anything with it.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Never got anything done, Jan. You know it, I know it. I don't  want to be cranky tonight but you cannot come on this show and make claims  that are completely, patently false! This is a total redo of NAFTA. You  don't know what you're talking about. It's several -- I think it is 700  pages long. So don't come on the show and say it's ridiculous. Pam Bondi,  your turn. </p><p>BONDI:  Thank you. And the president and Jared and the staff, they have  been working on this nonstop. They were working on it all day today on  Canada. And with all the noise, everything going on, everything they are  trying to accuse the president of in the middle of all that, he is staying  laser focused and he is helping the American people. </p><p>He is bringing jobs to our country -- at 3.8 unemployment -- everything he  said, but what he did with Mexico and now Canada is unprecedented. And he  is a businessman. He is successful, and that is why our country is thriving  because of President Trump. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And by the way, news for Jan and everyone else watching, the  Europeans tonight announced -- another thing that the experts that would  never happen -- that they are going to eliminate, I believe, most tariffs  on automobiles. Why are they doing that do you think? Because they see what  Trump just did with Canada and with Mexico on NAFTA. </p><p>So, these barriers to effective and fair trade are systematically being  dismantled because of a smart trade policy, and that is what Democrats used  to be in favor of. I want to play for you, Katrina, something that Chuck  Todd said today about a bombshell tomorrow. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Here's what I've learned about Bob Mueller, not a  single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him would say,  if he didn't have anything -- if he would've ended this investigation if  there was no collusion, that he already would have ended this --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tell that though until he tells us. </p><p>TODD:  That's true. I think he knows more than anything he keeps quiet  between Labor Day and election day. I'm not missing work tomorrow. I  wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we are not missing work tomorrow, either, but that was one  of the more ridiculous things I've heard. Katrina -- and a rabbit is going  to come out of his hat. </p><p>PIERSON:  Laura, this is hypervigilance on behalf of the left. These are  the kinds of things that we have been hearing since the president took the  famous ride down the escalator and people are pretty much immune to it.  Clearly there was no collusion. </p><p>But look, no one is going to be listening to the talking heads on TV  particularly when their 401(K)s are going up. This trade deal was very  good, and it looks like it even took the stock market out of correction  territory. So again, Laura, the people at home are smarter than a lot of  the media think. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, I think again, the Democrats have to actually come to  the table with solutions, not just identity politics, get Trump and impeach  him. </p><p>PIERSON:  But how could they possibly come with solutions, they don't even  know who they are? Are they Democrats? Are they liberals? Are they  socialists? There is a crisis going on in the Democrat Party and President  Trump is out there -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, it's a split (ph) personality. </p><p>PIERSON:  That's what it is. It's a split personality and the Trump  derangement syndrome just compounds the effect.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys. </p><p>BONDI:  And Laura, he's out there talking to the American people. He's out  there talking to the American people that they understand, saying we are  not going to get ripped off by other countries anymore. </p><p>PIERSON:  Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Real quick, I got to give Jan a final thought real quick. We're  way over. </p><p>RONIS:  Listen, he is going back to the same old rhetoric that he did when  he first got elected, trying to scare the American people, talking about  Hillary getting away with criminal activities, frightening everybody about  undocumented aliens. It's the same old, you know, art of -- the art of  politics is getting elected and re-elected, and I'll give him credit  because he is an expert at that but it's at the expense of the truth. It's  at the expense of what this country and its people.</p><p>PIERSON:  401(K), Jan, 401(K). </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, 4.2 percent GDP. </p><p>RONIS:  -- millions of people in this country -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys, we're out of time. All right, we are here in  Chicago. A new wave of violence striking the city. When we come back, we  are going to talk to one of the best reporters on the ground, and you don't  want to miss that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yet another wave of violence rocking the city of Chicago  tonight. Just yesterday, eight people were shot and wounded in a period of  eight hours. And with each day that goes by, Chicago city officials led by  Rahm Emanuel seemed more and more powerless to stop it. This week, Gianno  Caldwell, a Fox News political analyst and Chicago native, went out to  speak with members of the worst hit communities and find out what is  driving the bloodshed. Watchg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NINI, CHICAGO RESIDENT:  In this neighborhood, everybody want to be better  than the next person. Everybody want to rock the better jeans. You know  what you got on, the better shoes. Everyone want to be the one on top. </p><p>So these boys looking at it, like, hey, let me see your (inaudible) and let  me do this and that. That's why there's a lot of violence. And I believe,  you get some of these boys into a job, put money in their pockets so they  can survive, take care of what they need to take care of, maybe it'll stop  some of this stuff. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now with more is Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great  to see you tonight. You know, it was interesting what Ninin just said  there, and she said everyone wants to be on top, have what the other guy  has or better, I don't know if she was talking about house or car or shoes  or what. But -- </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Everything. All of the above.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- she said if they had a job maybe it would -- yes, maybe it  would be better. To get the job, you have to have the skills, you have to  have the educational background, a parent or role model who helps with the  education and the guidance. The problem is a lot of these kids don't have  any of that. And then the gangs walk in. </p><p>CADWELL:  Yes, Laura. I think what I really saw here this week, when doing  these interviews with a number of the high-ranking gang members throughout  the city of Chicago, is there is a deficit in personal responsibility. A  lot of parents that have left their homes who believe that their parents  maybe were too harsh on them as they were growing up, they allowed their  kids to run free. </p><p>And as a result, we see the bloodshed. We all did a study in 2015, which  said for every 100,000 residents in the city of Chicago, there is, on  average, one white person shot, 28 Hispanic shot, and a whopping 113  African-Americans shot in a city of 2.7 million people. This is beyond the  pale of what we should see in any American city. And I know, and I thank  you for your coverage on this, because you have done it from your heart,  this has not been political for you. </p><p>You see the same things that I see in a lot of the African-American  residents here in Chicago, which is no American city should be like this.  There should be no person in an American city that have to live through  this level of fear. </p><p>And what we are seeing and especially speaking to the gang bangers in the  city of Chicago, there is a lot of those folks feel that this was a life  that they were preconditioned for. This isn't something that they  necessarily chose, as one told me, this is the life that chose him. So this  is, I mean, is just unfortunate. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And Gianno, the need for investment or business to come in, as  we have talked about before, how do you solve this problem? Until the  streets are safe, we need more detectives, more police, more personal  responsibility, more role models, it is hard to get the business to come  in, even with tax incentives that Rahm Emanuel, as far as I know, hasn't  been willing to talk about. </p><p>But even with tax incentives, if you go in there in some Inglewood, some of  these other areas and worried about your safety, or your employee safety,  that is -- that is going to be a heavy lift. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It will be. But, you know, I was really happy to hear from an  individual who runs a program or an organization called ex-cons for  community and social change. His name is Tyrone Muhammad. He is actually an  ex-con. He went to jail I believe for about 30 years for murder. </p><p>He started a program when he got out of jail and he goes and gets more ex- cons and they go back into those communities in which they robbed and steal  from, the communities that they murdered and which led to bloodshed. </p><p>So, that was something that I thought was particularly encouraging because  they are talking to the youth. They're looking to put those individuals and  jobs.  And I was really happy to hear that because those are the stories  that we normally don't hear, those are stories that we normally don't see. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I actually -- Gianno, we actually have -- Gianno, we actually  have that part of your discussion with him. I think we are going to play it  now. Let's watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TYRONE MUHAMMAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECCSC:  Those guys involved with my  organization have served 20 years or more in prison. We are men who  recognize that we've made a mistake. We are not sitting around waiting on  something (inaudible) white person, the politicians, the legislation, to  change our condition. We know that we helped perpetrate some of the  violence in our community and we learned a long time ago why we was in  prison, that we would have to change it ourselves. </p><p>(END VIDE CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right Gianno, final thoughts real quick. </p><p>CALDWELL:  We need more of that in the city of Chicago. There needs to be  an expansion of personal responsibility because no one can rely on the  government to solve all of these problems. And that includes the violence  in Chicago. They are part of the solution but they are not the solution in  totality. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You need more police, you need more cops on the ground, you need  more detectives so they actually solve some of these crimes, and that is  where the mayor and city officials kick in. Gianno, thank you very much. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It's been a failure of leadership on the level of the city and as  well of the state, there's been a failure of leadership in Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we've been trying to get Rahm Emanuel on this show and  other alderman and not much luck there. So, we'll keep trying. Gianno,  thanks so much. </p><p>Now with the discussion on this, we're going to talk to Horace Cooper of  Project 21, and of course, Leo Terrell is with us, radio talk show host.  Both of you, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you. I don't  think this is an issue that should be political. It should be solved. </p><p>This should be solved both from within the community, with police, safe  leaders, and business can partner, but if it is not going to come from  within and a real move from within the community, I don't know how we are  going to solve this. </p><p>But I can tell by talking to folks today, you need more police on the  ground. If you don't have more police on the ground, you will never get any  of the good stuff to happen. Leo? </p><p>LEO TERRELL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well Laura, I can tell from your  sincerity that you are very serious about this. But it's just not police,  respectfully. When I just saw the president on Fox talking about African- American unemployment rate is down, what about in the south and west sides  of Chicago? There is poverty in Chicago youth, from 18 to 24. Giovanni  didn't talk about the unemployment rate in Chicago. </p><p>You got to have jobs they are and what I submit to you, Laura, is that  there are no jobs there. There's just not on the local level. We have a  Republican governor and the blame goes all the way around. But let's focus  on the absence of jobs. I'll support your argument about police but please,  acknowledge that great -- make America great again does not apply to  African-American youth between the ages of 18 and 24 beyond the south and  west side of Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Leo, I think you are right about that. I mean, I'm not --</p><p>TERRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I think you're right about that the jobs aren't there. Trump  didn't create Chicago. So, I mean, you are a really good civil rights  attorney, a Democrat, and I get that, but to say or imply -- </p><p>TERRELL:  Can I point out one thing? </p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- to imply that Trump caused Chicago is absurd, and it will not  stand. Horace? </p><p>HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21:  Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I mean, it starts before Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel has been  there since 2011, murder rates, ridiculous high. More than 2,000 people now  have been murdered in Chicago since he became mayor. Unacceptable.  Absolutely unacceptable. </p><p>COOPER:  Jobs -- jobs will never come to Chicago as long as it's Beirut on  Lake Michigan. Here's the truth. The truth is, it requires two basic  techniques. You  must increase the fear of apprehension on those who would  mug, rob, or rape grandma, the people who will not let Lucy go to school,  and they create an environment so Frank the father can't get a job. </p><p>You absolutely must start with creating apprehension -- excuse me, a risk  of apprehension, for those individuals. Once that risk is real, who do not  change, who will not conform, they must be removed. That means five, seven,  or 10-year sentences. When that happens, which we know it worked, it worked  in Richmond, it worked in New York City, it worked in Louisiana, in New  Orleans, it will work anywhere. When that happens, then we can talk about  jobs and personal responsibility. </p><p>TERRELL:  Hey, can I just say a little game called Jeopardy? How about  this? What do you got to lose? Give me a chance. OK, who made that  statement in 2016? The Democrats have always been in office --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lowest unemployment for African-American and how long?</p><p>TERRELL:  -- give me a chance. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TERRELL:  Remember that guy? </p><p>COOPER:  We have set five records for low unemployment in just the first 10  (ph) years. </p><p>TERRELL:  What about Chicago? We are talking about Chicago, Horace. We are  talking about Chicago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Guys, stop, stop, stop! Do you know that Democrats have been  running Chicago for I believe seven decades? Do you realize that? </p><p>TERRELL:  We have a Republican governor, Laura! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you realize there is not one -- there is not -- we are  talking about the city of Chicago. You, Leo, are very smart, you know just  like I do, the city is run by the city council and the mayor's office. It's  not run by Bruce Rauner, OK. </p><p>They do legislate legislation and allocation of funds, but the funds and  the local taxes in Chicago run the police and they assist in running the  schools. OK? So, lets' be honest. This is 70 years of Democratic  leadership, 70! </p><p>TERRELL:  Here's a good fellow (ph) response. Local governments don't  create jobs. You know, Laura, that the job creation starts up in -- </p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Why are we on this? </p><p>TERRELL:  There are no jobs! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you think, I mean honestly, if do you that Rahm Emanuel since  2011, has done a good job for the city of Chicago, because I can tell you,  most Democrats we talked to today in the streets, they want him gone. They  don't want him to return. They want a new person in. </p><p>TERRELL:  I'm not here to defend Rahm Emanuel. I'm not here -- I'm just  simply saying, you do acknowledge that jobs are critical. Horace simply  said lock everybody up. He doesn't have a job plan. </p><p>COOPER:  You will not create a thriving job market as long as grandma is  afraid to even go and get her prescriptions filled. </p><p>TERREL:  Talking points. </p><p>COOPER:  That Lucy can't go to school -- it's not a talking point. This is  a reality. </p><p>TERRELL:  It is, talking points. Pure tactic.</p><p>COOPER:  That Chicago papers profiled all of these victims that we are  ignoring. We don't have jets that fly in from Arizona to Washington, D.C. - -</p><p>TERRELL:  Talking points.</p><p>COOPER:  -- for all of the people who are dying in Chicago.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, you know what -- you know it's not a talking point. Leo, you  keep saying talking points.  You know what is not a talking point?  We  talked to a woman whose nephew's remains were burned and stored in a 55- gallon drum.  You know what his great crime was?  Walking home.  </p><p>TERRELL:  That's a horrible crime.  That's a horrible crime.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's what life is in some of these neighborhoods in Chicago.   Don't tell me it's a talking point.  That's someone's life, and it happens  way too often, predominately African-American.  And it's got to stop.  The  cauldron of death and Chicago, got to put an end to it.  It is ridiculous,  and Republicans and Democrats have got to come together.  And the people of  the city I think want to do something about it, but when you have failed  leadership, whether it's Republican or Democrat, it's got to be changed and  swept out of office.  </p><p>TERRELL:  I agree with you, Laura.  I agree with you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Great segment.  We are out of time.  </p><p>COOPER:  A jobs program will not stop cutthroat --  </p><p>TERRELL:  We are done, Horace.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, guys, we're out of time.  We're going to be covering this  for months and months and months.  Thank you so much.</p><p>And joining us now with more -- excuse me.  We're going to take a break.   When we come back, we are going to talk about what Andrew Cuomo said,  believe it or not, about a ICE.  You thought the ICE protests were bad  before.  We might have protests on the other side after you hear what he  said.  Don't got away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to abolish  ICE.  Where did this come from?  By the way, did you have any idea what ICE  does?  These are people that go into a nest of MS-13.  They call nest.   That is what it is.  It's a nest.  These are evil people in there.  </p><p>I can't say \"animals\" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I  called them animals.  I called them animals.  She went crazy.  I can't do  it.  </p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Nancy Pelosi gets a lot of boos, doesn't she?  That was  President Trump at Indiana earlier tonight.  And that situation, those  remarks, could well not stand in greater contrast of the rhetoric we are  hearing from Democrats.  Andrew Cuomo last night at his debate with Cynthia  Nixon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  New York state is the state that said we  will not cooperate with ICE.  They were a bunch of thugs.  He politicized  ICE.  they are a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, president of the  National Border Patrol union, and Esther Valdes, an immigration attorney.   Esther, good to see you.  Art, good to see you.  I'm going to have Art take  the first swing at the Cuomo comments.  I do not understand why the  Democrats keep going back to the well of maligning the great men and women  of the Immigration Customs Enforcement, but they must think it is going to  work somewhere, and maybe in New York.  Art?  </p><p>ART DEL CUETO:  They are doing it because they don't have anything else to  say.  When you lose the argument, you've got to bring a race.  That is  usually what these people have been doing.  It's amazing to hear someone  say something like that, and then call the ICE people thugs.  You are  saying you are not going to agree with law enforcement, but they are the  ones that are thugs?  It sounds like you're the thug.  </p><p>Every time I hear these guys go back and forth, I can't help but wonder  that they are competing and some kind of here, hold my beer, let's see how  stupid I can sound today contest.  It's just amazing.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, had his own  reaction to what Cuomo said last night.  Let's watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR:  What he is saying, his actions are  disgusting.  To call ICE agents thugs, think about it.  These are men and  women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and  daughters, that chose to enforce the laws of this country, strap a gun to  the hip every day, put a Kevlar vest on to go out to the community and  protect America, protect the communities.  He calls them thugs.  Actually,  ICE arrests thugs, MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, ICE arrests thugs and the Democrats are calling ICE  thugs, your reaction?  </p><p>ESTHER VALDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  It is notable that Governor Cuomo is  not a border state governor.  Otherwise he would have firsthand knowledge  of what ICE officers actually do.  They are the frontline defenders, and  here in San Diego they are the first line of defense to disrupt drug  trafficking rings, child molestation rings, and people who exploit men and  women.  I invite Governor Cuomo to come down here and see what ICE agents  actually do.  </p><p>And by and large, I interact with them as an immigration attorney at least  once a week when I'm at the detention facilities.  Those men and women are  some of our finest, bravest law enforcement agents that we have.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I've got to remind everyone who the senators are who are in  favor of abolishing ICE, and this is just a list.  I'm sure it will grow,  but this is where we are right now.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, OK, New  York, she'll be running for president, 2020, Elizabeth Warren in  Massachusetts, she'll be running in 2020, Bernie Sanders, Vermont, he'll be  running a 2020, Mark Pocan in Wisconsin, nobody can even recognize him on  the street, Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Earl Blumenauer from  Oregon, Nydia Velazquez, New York, goes on, Raul Grijalva, Mark DeSaulnier,  California, and that's just where we are right now.  Of course,  congressional candidates, Alexandria Cortez, Randy Bryce, so forth.  </p><p>Art, I don't know why, again, Democrats think that the men and women who  keep us safe, are breaking up a child sex trafficking rings, human  smuggling rings, of course narcotics operations funded by the cartels -- I  don't get it.  How is that going to appeal even to the inner city folks who  want a safe environment as well?  I'm presuming they want safer streets,  safer situations for their families.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  They should.  The thing is, they try to make this division, and  then they turn it around or they make it about race.  Listen, even when  I've come on your show, I see some of the comments that some of these  individuals say about myself.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lovely.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  As being Hispanic.  But I came to this country, my parents came  to this country legally.  There is a legal way to do it.  People can't  distinguish the difference between border patrol agents, between ICE  agents, between the immigration officers at our ports of entry.  They can't  distinguish the difference between a legal immigrant in an illegal  immigrant.  </p><p>It is just -- I don't know what their thought processes, but anything they  can do is they try to divide as much as possible so they appease a certain  group of people, and try to -- that's what it is.  It comes down to  division and race.  And the reality is, I've said it so many times, illegal  is not a race.  We are not out there separating families.  Whose to blame?   The families themselves.  An American citizen commits a crime with their  child in this country, what happens?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You get separated.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  You get separated, and you go through the court system.  What  is happening here is these people, they are such great parents that they  are turning over their children to drug smugglers, they are turning their  children over to people smugglers, they are abandoning them in the desert,  and we're the bad guys?  Come on.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  But it's our fault.  It's ICE's fault.  Guys, thank you so much.  </p><p>Charges of anti-conservative bias are roiling the big tech companies.   Kevin McCarthy has something to say about it.  Don't miss it, up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My administration is also  standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans.  Social media  giants, and I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate  political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results.  We will not  let large corporations silence conservative voices.  And it can.  It can go  the other way, too, some day.  We are not going to let them control what we  can and cannot see, read, and learn from.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You heard President Trump.  He wants social media companies to  be held accountable for alleged anti-conservative bias.  Next week, Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey will have his feet held to the fire when he testifies on  Capitol Hill.  And one of the individuals leading the charge on all of this  is House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who joins us now.  Congressman,  great to see you.  </p><p>This is what I have been told, congressman, time and time again by my  liberal friends, OK?  This is an algorithm.  This has nothing to do with  politics.  The algorithm was in place before Trump, and it's going to be in  place after Trump.  There is no political bias, it all relates to what  articles are popular and versus articles that are not as popular.  What is  your reaction to that?  </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  That's just not true.   Social media today is the modern-day town hall.  Sixty-seven percent of  adults get their news from somewhere on social media.  But let's just play  that out.  You see Prager University that puts out conservative videos, but  one happened to be about Israel with Alan Dershowitz, one happened to be  about baseball with George Will.  You know what?  Facebook wouldn't show  those because they said YouTube rated them similar to pornography.  </p><p>Then we found out recently that they said it was a couple of Facebook  employees.  Take, for instance, I follow your tweets.  You put something  out about Sweden last week in regards to conservatives gaming based upon  their immigration policy.  That algorithm, written by a human, said that  was sensitive, so certain people on Twitter could not see that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Swedish election is sensitive.  OK.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's sensitive.  So that is just an algorithm?  But if you  Google the California Republican Party right before the primary, they said  our ideology was Nazism, and they blame that on Wikipedia.  </p><p>But after we have raised this issue -- and I've had many conversations with  the president about it, that we have to stop this bias, look what happened  in Facebook just this week.  Their own employees, those conservatives who  have been intimidated based upon their own personal philosophy, put a group  together and rose up because they feel that has been going on as well.  You  look at what they did to Palmer Luckey and others.  Palmer is a brilliant  kid who invented Oculus, who Facebook actually purchased.  But when they  found out he had given money, his own personal money based upon who he  wanted to see become president, they wanted to push him out.  This is what  is happening in social media, they think it is just algorithms.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Congressman, let's get to solutions here.  A lot of pals are  working in antitrust and expert on antitrust issues, some kind of difficult  antitrust theories floating out there.  But there is another interesting  idea beyond antitrust, which is to consider Facebook and Twitter and so  forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public  utility.  \"Vanity Fair\" had a headline about Bannon saying, Steve Bannon  wants to nationalize Facebook and Google's data.  The cofounder of  Cambridge Analytica says big data should be placed in a public trust.  That  is going to your point that this really is the town square, and even though  it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising, we're  talking about Facebook especially, so we have to treat a different way.  Is  that something Congress is going to look at in consultation with the  executive branch?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I think Congress is going to look at everything from the  perspective of how powerful they have become.  I have spoken to Jack Dorsey  throughout the month, because the beginning of August, I sent a letter  requesting for him to come to Energy and Commerce.  And I want to give him  credit, he is showing up September 5th, and he and I philosophically  disagree, but we do we worry on one thing.  We believe in the First  Amendment.  But we also believe in transparency and accountability.  He is  coming forward.  I think the other companies CEOs need to go forward as  well, because the stories that they are telling and blaming other people,  and it's just an algorithm, is proving not to be true.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Google CEO said, no, I understand, but they are happy to  work with China on setting up the censorship tools that the communists in  China want instituted in Google.  They don't have any problem with that.  </p><p>I have to get your thoughts on today's funeral ceremonies for John McCain,  impassioned speeches, we had Vice President Biden speak, many others.  Your  thoughts?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I was there.  And I thought the very best speaker was a  very first speaker.  He was the first chief of staff to then congressman  John McCain.  And he told the story that John McCain told when he was a  POW, about a guard coming in, it's Christmas time, kind of loosening up the  ropes that had his arms time behind his back.  And right before he was  going off his time, he tied those ropes back.  He never seen this guard  before but he sees him out in the yard.  The guard walks up, doesn't say  anything to him, but with his foot in the gravel, he makes a cross, saying  about faith.  </p><p>And when you think of John McCain and what he went through, and every time  I watched put a jacket on, the difficulty, I had great respect for this  man.  I worked with him many times.  I had a difference of opinion, but I  thought that summed it up with a much more personal story, it was the  strongest story of the day.  It was a beautiful celebration of his life.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I would agree with you, an amazing tribute.  And I'm going to  ignore some of the not so thinly veiled hits on President Trump by some of  the people who participated, but I agree with you.  Just that image of  Senator McCain, and may he rest in peace.  Congressman McCarthy, thank you  so much for joining us tonight.  And we are going to be watching that  hearing with Dorsey next week.  </p><p>The Justice Department, by the way, is firing a major shot at Harvard  University and affirmative action.  Details ahead.  You do not want to miss  this segment with Michelle Malkin.  Don't go away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Harvard in the hot seat.  What happens when Harvard University  capped the number of Asian students who could be admitted?  Well, that  didn't go down so well.  Michelle Malkin joining us, and of course from  CRTV, and Cathy Areu, the publisher of \"Catalina Magazine.\" Also we have  news from Betsy DeVos at the Education Department involving Title IX and  sexual harassment on college campuses.  </p><p>But let's start with this Harvard story.  Michelle, you have been all over  this issue of affirmative action for years.  And now, we are at the point  where we are penalizing Asian students, and thankfully the U.S. Department  of Justice stepped in on behalf of fairness and merit on behalf of these  Asian students.  Tell us what you know.  </p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, this blatant racial  discrimination in the name of so-called social justice has punished high  achieving Asian-American students for a long time.  It's been obvious since  the late 1980s and 1990s when I was in college.  </p><p>And finally, we have the Trump Justice Department fighting with equality of  opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.  And what I love most about  what is happening, Laura, is Harvard is squirming under the microscope and  the bright, glaring sunlight of discovery.  For the longest time they had  kept their racially conscious and race unneutral policies under wraps, and  now it's being exposed.  </p><p>And what is happening is, you have a lot of liberal Asian-Americans who are  finally, finally having second thoughts about the social engineering that  has punished them at the expense of equality of opportunity.  And look, it  makes absolutely no sense to punish the children of legal immigrants from  all over Asia as some sort of social justice recompense to black students.   The reparations foundation of affirmative action here has been totally  blown up.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's go to Cathy.  Really short segment here.  Cathy, if it's  just a merit based analysis on admissions, the study from the Center for  Equal Opportunity shows that Asian-Americans would have 43 percent of the  admissions, Hispanics, two percent, African-Americans, on merit according  to the Center for Equal Opportunity, just one percent.  </p><p>CATHY AREU, \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE:  Right.  And what is merit?  Is merit  meaning SATs, is it meaning test scores?  So we are trying to say, this  against affirmative action.  And what's happening is that Harvard actually  has a system where there school population is diverse.  So the Trump  administration is trying to take away diversity at our institutions like  Harvard.  Harvard is fighting for diversity so that our student body can  look like our demographics in our country.  And there is nothing wrong with  that.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's move on really quickly.  No time here.  But Betsy DeVos  and Title IX.  Michelle, now it looks like men or anyone accused of sexual  harassment will have a few more rights aft UVA and of course some of the  other cases like Duke and so forth.  </p><p>MALKIN:  You think that civil libertarians would be cheering the fact that  we have administration that is restoring the rights of the accused and  restoring due process that has been sabotaged, particularly under the Obama  administration, by radicals who don't think that accused men should have  the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, that men who are  accused should have legal representation, that men who are accused should  be allowed to have access to exculpatory evidence, and that is what DeVos  is restoring.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Cathy, I owe you one because we're out of time.  When we come  back, final thoughts from Chicago.  Busy news night.  Stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Tomorrow night, we'll be back here in Chicago, and we will be  following up on our reporting on some of the other media sources out there.   We told you this week about CNN and a little loosey-goosey they were  playing with their source Lanny Davis.  Who is lying more?  And tomorrow,  what NBC reportedly did to put the kibosh on that Harvey Weinstein  reporting by Ronan Farrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Hey, Laura. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hey, Judge Jeanine. How are you? Fantastic  show tonight as always. Love the Bongino segment. Fantastic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIRRO: Well, we love Dan Bongino. He's a fighter wherever you need one.  Anyway, where are you tonight? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  We are in Chicago having a lot of fun, causing a little trouble,  but all in a good way, the good trouble in a good way. </p><p>PIRRO:  Make sure you have Giordano's pizza.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You know something, you are the second person who told me that  so I'm on it. Judge Jeanine, thank you so much. Great show. </p><p>PIRRO:  All right. Have a great show.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, welcome to THE INGRAHAM Angle.  I'm Laura Ingraham  live from Chicago tonight and we're going to explain why in just a little  bit. </p><p>The president just wrapping up a raucous rally in Indiana in Evansville.  We're going to breakdown his remarks throughout the hours so stick with us. </p><p>Also tonight, are congressional Republicans about to go to war with big  tech? House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to join us later in the  hour to break it all down. The looming fight over bias in Silicon Valley. </p><p>Plus, the reason we are here, violence continues to rock this amazing  American city, and while its political leaders might be asleep at the  switch, we came to get answers. Fox's own Gianno Caldwell went to some of  the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere in this country to talk to gang  bangers and ex-cons. Some exclusive video you do not want to miss. </p><p>But first, as we just mentioned, the president is taking all comers tonight  in Evansville and if you are just getting caught up, here is what you may  have missed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York  Times,\" which, by the way, if I wasn't here, they would be out of business.  \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times,\" CNN. So, a writer for \"The New  York Times\" that pretends she knows what she's talking about, hasn't got a  clue. </p><p>And I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same, the place was packed, she  made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty  chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom may be. And listen -- and he  was so disappointed at the tone in the room. NBC, which is probably worse  than CNN, but the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great  thing to do. How smart. That's what the worth. Who knows? With these  people, you never know.</p><p>By the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, governor, look how many cameras  you have back there. It's just like the academy awards. Look at it. They  can't get enough! But when they start screaming fake news, you see those  red lights go off for a little while. Excuse me, we have technical  difficulties. OK, then they go back. Right? Look at that. You know, in the  studio, you hear they go, \"listen, he's about ready to go, look.\" ladies  and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties. </p><p>We need Republicans in Congress. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by  left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies,  and their fake news allies. </p><p>You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at  what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's  see. All I can say this, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of  it -- because inside, they have incredible people, but our Justice  Department, and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right  and doing it now because people are angry. People are angry. </p><p>What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point, I wanted to stay out,  but at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly, I want them to do  their job, I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to.  Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching and the whole world gets it  and the whole world understands exactly what is going on. </p><p>The Democrats, they called themselves the resistance. That is what they are  good at. Resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day,  they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine  the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 like never  before delivered. </p><p>The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly  undemocratic they really have become, right? The so-called resistance is  mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we  are really -- we are getting rid of those bad ideas one by one so fast, and  it is driving them crazy. See, you have to understand, I have a better  education than they do from a much better school. </p><p>The elites, they are the elites. They are the elites. I went to a better  schools, I went to better everything. And by the way -- by the way -- are  you ready for this? I am president and they are not.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now for reaction, Katrina Pierson of course, senior  advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign. That's right. Already talking about  2020. Florida's republican attorney general Pam Bondi and attorney and  Democratic strategist, Jan Ronis. Great to see all of you tonight. </p><p>Pam, let's start -- let's start with you, Pam. Indiana -- I think this is  the president's third trip. He's heading to Charlotte, North Carolina for  the next rally. He is stacked for these rallies. He is going to hit every  close race, senate race. He'll do some house races, some people thought he  wasn't going to be this active on the campaign trail, but, boy, were they  wrong. </p><p>PAM BONDI, FLORIDA STATE ATTORNEY:  They sure were, Laura. They were wrong  and look at President Trump, look at his energy. He loves doing this. He  loves going out and supporting these candidates, and he knows how important  congress is to helping him pass the agenda that he needs to pass. </p><p>And he cares, and he is out there. I mean, this man must never, ever sleep.  I mean, the president is just working tirelessly to help all of these  races. And he loves it. He loves it. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Katrina, I'm here in Chicago and had a chance to talk to a lot  of folks earlier today. And believe it or not, even in liberal Chicago,  where I think it is like 83 percent or 87 percent of the city voted  democrat for Hillary in 2016, he has a lot of fans here. </p><p>But I think maybe two or three people, you know, in a room where I got to  talk to about eight people, said we love what the president is doing on the  economy, Katrina, but why does he have to harp on CNN or these other  networks. Just focus on your agenda, don't worry about these other side  issues because no one really cares. No one's watching those networks. They  are giving them too much -- too much publicity. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I don't think  anyone can deny that Donald Trump isn't a fighter. He is his number one  defender. We had a lot of experience about that on the first campaign. But  it's really important for him to continue to highlight and identify how the  fake news is doing an injustice to this country. </p><p>And, you know, as for tonight, Laura, there is nothing quite like or as fun  as a Trump rally. Even in this hostile political environment, the president  has deep opportunities do not just place a stamp of approval on candidates  that are going to help them keep America great, but it's the opportunity to  bypass those networks and speak directly to the people that talk about  those accomplishments. </p><p>And I have to tell you that this president has accomplished so much in his  first two years that we actually had to create a website, promises  kept.com, just to keep up with him. I was not one of those people that  expected him to just sit around and wait for the candidates to get going. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now, the thing that is going to happen tomorrow, and Jan, you  can chime in here, tomorrow it looks like they are going to announce  officially, they needed to do it by tomorrow, that Canada is going to join  in on this agreement with the United States and Mexico, replacing the old  NAFTA, a huge deal. Clinton, Obama, Bush, Hillary, they all promised --  Hillary if she was elected -- that they were going to change NAFTA. </p><p>No one thought President Trump was going to be able to do it. Just two days  ago, all the brilliant ones on cable news were saying, oh, Canada is not  going to join. This is never going to get through. Jan, on the issues of  trade and the economy, what is the Democrats' response to Trump's winning  on these issue? </p><p>JAN RONIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY:  Well, the Democratic response ought to be  that really -- that the NAFTA renegotiations are just NAFTA with a new  name. I mean, quite frankly, the differences are very subtle -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  No, they are not. Jan, you cannot come on this show. This is  actually something I know a lot about and I don't mean to interrupt you  right off the bat. But if you come on this show, and you start talking  smack about something you frankly don't know what you're talking about --  god bless you -- this is a completely redo of the NAFTA deal. </p><p>Do you understand what the rules of origin are all about? Do you get the  percentage of American components? Do you get that? Then you wouldn't have  said what you just said. </p><p>RONIS:  For example, the percentage of American components have gone up I  believe from 65 to 75. That's relatively a very small amount. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Right. OK.</p><p>RONIS:  And the wage increases don't apply to Mexico, which would still  allow Mexico to, you know, manufacture these cars at far lower prices than  in the United States. So it isn't -- you think the manufacturers will now  going to return to Mexico when they don't have to pay $16 an hour? They're  going to stay in Mexico. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  This is I've got to say. Yes, but you have intellectual property  protections, Pam Bondi, you have digital protections, this was a hard  bargain that was driven by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the whole team at  the USTR, Lusi Videgaray who came in the show a couple of days ago, is the  foreign minister. We finally got Trudeau and the gang in Canada on board. </p><p>The idea that this is a significant deal -- if it wasn't significant, then  why didn't Obama did something? Then why didn't, you know, why didn't  George W. Bush do anything with it? </p><p>BONDO:  Because they couldn't. </p><p>RONIS:  And in fact the word changes under way (ph) during the Obama  administration.</p><p>BONDI:  Because they couldn't do anything with it.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Never got anything done, Jan. You know it, I know it. I don't  want to be cranky tonight but you cannot come on this show and make claims  that are completely, patently false! This is a total redo of NAFTA. You  don't know what you're talking about. It's several -- I think it is 700  pages long. So don't come on the show and say it's ridiculous. Pam Bondi,  your turn. </p><p>BONDI:  Thank you. And the president and Jared and the staff, they have  been working on this nonstop. They were working on it all day today on  Canada. And with all the noise, everything going on, everything they are  trying to accuse the president of in the middle of all that, he is staying  laser focused and he is helping the American people. </p><p>He is bringing jobs to our country -- at 3.8 unemployment -- everything he  said, but what he did with Mexico and now Canada is unprecedented. And he  is a businessman. He is successful, and that is why our country is thriving  because of President Trump. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And by the way, news for Jan and everyone else watching, the  Europeans tonight announced -- another thing that the experts that would  never happen -- that they are going to eliminate, I believe, most tariffs  on automobiles. Why are they doing that do you think? Because they see what  Trump just did with Canada and with Mexico on NAFTA. </p><p>So, these barriers to effective and fair trade are systematically being  dismantled because of a smart trade policy, and that is what Democrats used  to be in favor of. I want to play for you, Katrina, something that Chuck  Todd said today about a bombshell tomorrow. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Here's what I've learned about Bob Mueller, not a  single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him would say,  if he didn't have anything -- if he would've ended this investigation if  there was no collusion, that he already would have ended this --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tell that though until he tells us. </p><p>TODD:  That's true. I think he knows more than anything he keeps quiet  between Labor Day and election day. I'm not missing work tomorrow. I  wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we are not missing work tomorrow, either, but that was one  of the more ridiculous things I've heard. Katrina -- and a rabbit is going  to come out of his hat. </p><p>PIERSON:  Laura, this is hypervigilance on behalf of the left. These are  the kinds of things that we have been hearing since the president took the  famous ride down the escalator and people are pretty much immune to it.  Clearly there was no collusion. </p><p>But look, no one is going to be listening to the talking heads on TV  particularly when their 401(K)s are going up. This trade deal was very  good, and it looks like it even took the stock market out of correction  territory. So again, Laura, the people at home are smarter than a lot of  the media think. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, I think again, the Democrats have to actually come to  the table with solutions, not just identity politics, get Trump and impeach  him. </p><p>PIERSON:  But how could they possibly come with solutions, they don't even  know who they are? Are they Democrats? Are they liberals? Are they  socialists? There is a crisis going on in the Democrat Party and President  Trump is out there -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, it's a split (ph) personality. </p><p>PIERSON:  That's what it is. It's a split personality and the Trump  derangement syndrome just compounds the effect.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys. </p><p>BONDI:  And Laura, he's out there talking to the American people. He's out  there talking to the American people that they understand, saying we are  not going to get ripped off by other countries anymore. </p><p>PIERSON:  Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Real quick, I got to give Jan a final thought real quick. We're  way over. </p><p>RONIS:  Listen, he is going back to the same old rhetoric that he did when  he first got elected, trying to scare the American people, talking about  Hillary getting away with criminal activities, frightening everybody about  undocumented aliens. It's the same old, you know, art of -- the art of  politics is getting elected and re-elected, and I'll give him credit  because he is an expert at that but it's at the expense of the truth. It's  at the expense of what this country and its people.</p><p>PIERSON:  401(K), Jan, 401(K). </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, 4.2 percent GDP. </p><p>RONIS:  -- millions of people in this country -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys, we're out of time. All right, we are here in  Chicago. A new wave of violence striking the city. When we come back, we  are going to talk to one of the best reporters on the ground, and you don't  want to miss that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yet another wave of violence rocking the city of Chicago  tonight. Just yesterday, eight people were shot and wounded in a period of  eight hours. And with each day that goes by, Chicago city officials led by  Rahm Emanuel seemed more and more powerless to stop it. This week, Gianno  Caldwell, a Fox News political analyst and Chicago native, went out to  speak with members of the worst hit communities and find out what is  driving the bloodshed. Watchg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NINI, CHICAGO RESIDENT:  In this neighborhood, everybody want to be better  than the next person. Everybody want to rock the better jeans. You know  what you got on, the better shoes. Everyone want to be the one on top. </p><p>So these boys looking at it, like, hey, let me see your (inaudible) and let  me do this and that. That's why there's a lot of violence. And I believe,  you get some of these boys into a job, put money in their pockets so they  can survive, take care of what they need to take care of, maybe it'll stop  some of this stuff. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now with more is Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great  to see you tonight. You know, it was interesting what Ninin just said  there, and she said everyone wants to be on top, have what the other guy  has or better, I don't know if she was talking about house or car or shoes  or what. But -- </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Everything. All of the above.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- she said if they had a job maybe it would -- yes, maybe it  would be better. To get the job, you have to have the skills, you have to  have the educational background, a parent or role model who helps with the  education and the guidance. The problem is a lot of these kids don't have  any of that. And then the gangs walk in. </p><p>CADWELL:  Yes, Laura. I think what I really saw here this week, when doing  these interviews with a number of the high-ranking gang members throughout  the city of Chicago, is there is a deficit in personal responsibility. A  lot of parents that have left their homes who believe that their parents  maybe were too harsh on them as they were growing up, they allowed their  kids to run free. </p><p>And as a result, we see the bloodshed. We all did a study in 2015, which  said for every 100,000 residents in the city of Chicago, there is, on  average, one white person shot, 28 Hispanic shot, and a whopping 113  African-Americans shot in a city of 2.7 million people. This is beyond the  pale of what we should see in any American city. And I know, and I thank  you for your coverage on this, because you have done it from your heart,  this has not been political for you. </p><p>You see the same things that I see in a lot of the African-American  residents here in Chicago, which is no American city should be like this.  There should be no person in an American city that have to live through  this level of fear. </p><p>And what we are seeing and especially speaking to the gang bangers in the  city of Chicago, there is a lot of those folks feel that this was a life  that they were preconditioned for. This isn't something that they  necessarily chose, as one told me, this is the life that chose him. So this  is, I mean, is just unfortunate. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And Gianno, the need for investment or business to come in, as  we have talked about before, how do you solve this problem? Until the  streets are safe, we need more detectives, more police, more personal  responsibility, more role models, it is hard to get the business to come  in, even with tax incentives that Rahm Emanuel, as far as I know, hasn't  been willing to talk about. </p><p>But even with tax incentives, if you go in there in some Inglewood, some of  these other areas and worried about your safety, or your employee safety,  that is -- that is going to be a heavy lift. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It will be. But, you know, I was really happy to hear from an  individual who runs a program or an organization called ex-cons for  community and social change. His name is Tyrone Muhammad. He is actually an  ex-con. He went to jail I believe for about 30 years for murder. </p><p>He started a program when he got out of jail and he goes and gets more ex- cons and they go back into those communities in which they robbed and steal  from, the communities that they murdered and which led to bloodshed. </p><p>So, that was something that I thought was particularly encouraging because  they are talking to the youth. They're looking to put those individuals and  jobs.  And I was really happy to hear that because those are the stories  that we normally don't hear, those are stories that we normally don't see. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I actually -- Gianno, we actually have -- Gianno, we actually  have that part of your discussion with him. I think we are going to play it  now. Let's watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TYRONE MUHAMMAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECCSC:  Those guys involved with my  organization have served 20 years or more in prison. We are men who  recognize that we've made a mistake. We are not sitting around waiting on  something (inaudible) white person, the politicians, the legislation, to  change our condition. We know that we helped perpetrate some of the  violence in our community and we learned a long time ago why we was in  prison, that we would have to change it ourselves. </p><p>(END VIDE CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right Gianno, final thoughts real quick. </p><p>CALDWELL:  We need more of that in the city of Chicago. There needs to be  an expansion of personal responsibility because no one can rely on the  government to solve all of these problems. And that includes the violence  in Chicago. They are part of the solution but they are not the solution in  totality. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You need more police, you need more cops on the ground, you need  more detectives so they actually solve some of these crimes, and that is  where the mayor and city officials kick in. Gianno, thank you very much. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It's been a failure of leadership on the level of the city and as  well of the state, there's been a failure of leadership in Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we've been trying to get Rahm Emanuel on this show and  other alderman and not much luck there. So, we'll keep trying. Gianno,  thanks so much. </p><p>Now with the discussion on this, we're going to talk to Horace Cooper of  Project 21, and of course, Leo Terrell is with us, radio talk show host.  Both of you, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you. I don't  think this is an issue that should be political. It should be solved. </p><p>This should be solved both from within the community, with police, safe  leaders, and business can partner, but if it is not going to come from  within and a real move from within the community, I don't know how we are  going to solve this. </p><p>But I can tell by talking to folks today, you need more police on the  ground. If you don't have more police on the ground, you will never get any  of the good stuff to happen. Leo? </p><p>LEO TERRELL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well Laura, I can tell from your  sincerity that you are very serious about this. But it's just not police,  respectfully. When I just saw the president on Fox talking about African- American unemployment rate is down, what about in the south and west sides  of Chicago? There is poverty in Chicago youth, from 18 to 24. Giovanni  didn't talk about the unemployment rate in Chicago. </p><p>You got to have jobs they are and what I submit to you, Laura, is that  there are no jobs there. There's just not on the local level. We have a  Republican governor and the blame goes all the way around. But let's focus  on the absence of jobs. I'll support your argument about police but please,  acknowledge that great -- make America great again does not apply to  African-American youth between the ages of 18 and 24 beyond the south and  west side of Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Leo, I think you are right about that. I mean, I'm not --</p><p>TERRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I think you're right about that the jobs aren't there. Trump  didn't create Chicago. So, I mean, you are a really good civil rights  attorney, a Democrat, and I get that, but to say or imply -- </p><p>TERRELL:  Can I point out one thing? </p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- to imply that Trump caused Chicago is absurd, and it will not  stand. Horace? </p><p>HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21:  Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I mean, it starts before Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel has been  there since 2011, murder rates, ridiculous high. More than 2,000 people now  have been murdered in Chicago since he became mayor. Unacceptable.  Absolutely unacceptable. </p><p>COOPER:  Jobs -- jobs will never come to Chicago as long as it's Beirut on  Lake Michigan. Here's the truth. The truth is, it requires two basic  techniques. You  must increase the fear of apprehension on those who would  mug, rob, or rape grandma, the people who will not let Lucy go to school,  and they create an environment so Frank the father can't get a job. </p><p>You absolutely must start with creating apprehension -- excuse me, a risk  of apprehension, for those individuals. Once that risk is real, who do not  change, who will not conform, they must be removed. That means five, seven,  or 10-year sentences. When that happens, which we know it worked, it worked  in Richmond, it worked in New York City, it worked in Louisiana, in New  Orleans, it will work anywhere. When that happens, then we can talk about  jobs and personal responsibility. </p><p>TERRELL:  Hey, can I just say a little game called Jeopardy? How about  this? What do you got to lose? Give me a chance. OK, who made that  statement in 2016? The Democrats have always been in office --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lowest unemployment for African-American and how long?</p><p>TERRELL:  -- give me a chance. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TERRELL:  Remember that guy? </p><p>COOPER:  We have set five records for low unemployment in just the first 10  (ph) years. </p><p>TERRELL:  What about Chicago? We are talking about Chicago, Horace. We are  talking about Chicago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Guys, stop, stop, stop! Do you know that Democrats have been  running Chicago for I believe seven decades? Do you realize that? </p><p>TERRELL:  We have a Republican governor, Laura! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you realize there is not one -- there is not -- we are  talking about the city of Chicago. You, Leo, are very smart, you know just  like I do, the city is run by the city council and the mayor's office. It's  not run by Bruce Rauner, OK. </p><p>They do legislate legislation and allocation of funds, but the funds and  the local taxes in Chicago run the police and they assist in running the  schools. OK? So, lets' be honest. This is 70 years of Democratic  leadership, 70! </p><p>TERRELL:  Here's a good fellow (ph) response. Local governments don't  create jobs. You know, Laura, that the job creation starts up in -- </p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Why are we on this? </p><p>TERRELL:  There are no jobs! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you think, I mean honestly, if do you that Rahm Emanuel since  2011, has done a good job for the city of Chicago, because I can tell you,  most Democrats we talked to today in the streets, they want him gone. They  don't want him to return. They want a new person in. </p><p>TERRELL:  I'm not here to defend Rahm Emanuel. I'm not here -- I'm just  simply saying, you do acknowledge that jobs are critical. Horace simply  said lock everybody up. He doesn't have a job plan. </p><p>COOPER:  You will not create a thriving job market as long as grandma is  afraid to even go and get her prescriptions filled. </p><p>TERREL:  Talking points. </p><p>COOPER:  That Lucy can't go to school -- it's not a talking point. This is  a reality. </p><p>TERRELL:  It is, talking points. Pure tactic.</p><p>COOPER:  That Chicago papers profiled all of these victims that we are  ignoring. We don't have jets that fly in from Arizona to Washington, D.C. - -</p><p>TERRELL:  Talking points.</p><p>COOPER:  -- for all of the people who are dying in Chicago.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, you know what -- you know it's not a talking point. Leo, you  keep saying talking points.  You know what is not a talking point?  We  talked to a woman whose nephew's remains were burned and stored in a 55- gallon drum.  You know what his great crime was?  Walking home.  </p><p>TERRELL:  That's a horrible crime.  That's a horrible crime.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's what life is in some of these neighborhoods in Chicago.   Don't tell me it's a talking point.  That's someone's life, and it happens  way too often, predominately African-American.  And it's got to stop.  The  cauldron of death and Chicago, got to put an end to it.  It is ridiculous,  and Republicans and Democrats have got to come together.  And the people of  the city I think want to do something about it, but when you have failed  leadership, whether it's Republican or Democrat, it's got to be changed and  swept out of office.  </p><p>TERRELL:  I agree with you, Laura.  I agree with you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Great segment.  We are out of time.  </p><p>COOPER:  A jobs program will not stop cutthroat --  </p><p>TERRELL:  We are done, Horace.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, guys, we're out of time.  We're going to be covering this  for months and months and months.  Thank you so much.</p><p>And joining us now with more -- excuse me.  We're going to take a break.   When we come back, we are going to talk about what Andrew Cuomo said,  believe it or not, about a ICE.  You thought the ICE protests were bad  before.  We might have protests on the other side after you hear what he  said.  Don't got away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to abolish  ICE.  Where did this come from?  By the way, did you have any idea what ICE  does?  These are people that go into a nest of MS-13.  They call nest.   That is what it is.  It's a nest.  These are evil people in there.  </p><p>I can't say \"animals\" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I  called them animals.  I called them animals.  She went crazy.  I can't do  it.  </p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Nancy Pelosi gets a lot of boos, doesn't she?  That was  President Trump at Indiana earlier tonight.  And that situation, those  remarks, could well not stand in greater contrast of the rhetoric we are  hearing from Democrats.  Andrew Cuomo last night at his debate with Cynthia  Nixon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  New York state is the state that said we  will not cooperate with ICE.  They were a bunch of thugs.  He politicized  ICE.  they are a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, president of the  National Border Patrol union, and Esther Valdes, an immigration attorney.   Esther, good to see you.  Art, good to see you.  I'm going to have Art take  the first swing at the Cuomo comments.  I do not understand why the  Democrats keep going back to the well of maligning the great men and women  of the Immigration Customs Enforcement, but they must think it is going to  work somewhere, and maybe in New York.  Art?  </p><p>ART DEL CUETO:  They are doing it because they don't have anything else to  say.  When you lose the argument, you've got to bring a race.  That is  usually what these people have been doing.  It's amazing to hear someone  say something like that, and then call the ICE people thugs.  You are  saying you are not going to agree with law enforcement, but they are the  ones that are thugs?  It sounds like you're the thug.  </p><p>Every time I hear these guys go back and forth, I can't help but wonder  that they are competing and some kind of here, hold my beer, let's see how  stupid I can sound today contest.  It's just amazing.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, had his own  reaction to what Cuomo said last night.  Let's watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR:  What he is saying, his actions are  disgusting.  To call ICE agents thugs, think about it.  These are men and  women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and  daughters, that chose to enforce the laws of this country, strap a gun to  the hip every day, put a Kevlar vest on to go out to the community and  protect America, protect the communities.  He calls them thugs.  Actually,  ICE arrests thugs, MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, ICE arrests thugs and the Democrats are calling ICE  thugs, your reaction?  </p><p>ESTHER VALDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  It is notable that Governor Cuomo is  not a border state governor.  Otherwise he would have firsthand knowledge  of what ICE officers actually do.  They are the frontline defenders, and  here in San Diego they are the first line of defense to disrupt drug  trafficking rings, child molestation rings, and people who exploit men and  women.  I invite Governor Cuomo to come down here and see what ICE agents  actually do.  </p><p>And by and large, I interact with them as an immigration attorney at least  once a week when I'm at the detention facilities.  Those men and women are  some of our finest, bravest law enforcement agents that we have.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I've got to remind everyone who the senators are who are in  favor of abolishing ICE, and this is just a list.  I'm sure it will grow,  but this is where we are right now.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, OK, New  York, she'll be running for president, 2020, Elizabeth Warren in  Massachusetts, she'll be running in 2020, Bernie Sanders, Vermont, he'll be  running a 2020, Mark Pocan in Wisconsin, nobody can even recognize him on  the street, Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Earl Blumenauer from  Oregon, Nydia Velazquez, New York, goes on, Raul Grijalva, Mark DeSaulnier,  California, and that's just where we are right now.  Of course,  congressional candidates, Alexandria Cortez, Randy Bryce, so forth.  </p><p>Art, I don't know why, again, Democrats think that the men and women who  keep us safe, are breaking up a child sex trafficking rings, human  smuggling rings, of course narcotics operations funded by the cartels -- I  don't get it.  How is that going to appeal even to the inner city folks who  want a safe environment as well?  I'm presuming they want safer streets,  safer situations for their families.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  They should.  The thing is, they try to make this division, and  then they turn it around or they make it about race.  Listen, even when  I've come on your show, I see some of the comments that some of these  individuals say about myself.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lovely.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  As being Hispanic.  But I came to this country, my parents came  to this country legally.  There is a legal way to do it.  People can't  distinguish the difference between border patrol agents, between ICE  agents, between the immigration officers at our ports of entry.  They can't  distinguish the difference between a legal immigrant in an illegal  immigrant.  </p><p>It is just -- I don't know what their thought processes, but anything they  can do is they try to divide as much as possible so they appease a certain  group of people, and try to -- that's what it is.  It comes down to  division and race.  And the reality is, I've said it so many times, illegal  is not a race.  We are not out there separating families.  Whose to blame?   The families themselves.  An American citizen commits a crime with their  child in this country, what happens?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You get separated.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  You get separated, and you go through the court system.  What  is happening here is these people, they are such great parents that they  are turning over their children to drug smugglers, they are turning their  children over to people smugglers, they are abandoning them in the desert,  and we're the bad guys?  Come on.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  But it's our fault.  It's ICE's fault.  Guys, thank you so much.  </p><p>Charges of anti-conservative bias are roiling the big tech companies.   Kevin McCarthy has something to say about it.  Don't miss it, up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My administration is also  standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans.  Social media  giants, and I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate  political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results.  We will not  let large corporations silence conservative voices.  And it can.  It can go  the other way, too, some day.  We are not going to let them control what we  can and cannot see, read, and learn from.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You heard President Trump.  He wants social media companies to  be held accountable for alleged anti-conservative bias.  Next week, Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey will have his feet held to the fire when he testifies on  Capitol Hill.  And one of the individuals leading the charge on all of this  is House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who joins us now.  Congressman,  great to see you.  </p><p>This is what I have been told, congressman, time and time again by my  liberal friends, OK?  This is an algorithm.  This has nothing to do with  politics.  The algorithm was in place before Trump, and it's going to be in  place after Trump.  There is no political bias, it all relates to what  articles are popular and versus articles that are not as popular.  What is  your reaction to that?  </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  That's just not true.   Social media today is the modern-day town hall.  Sixty-seven percent of  adults get their news from somewhere on social media.  But let's just play  that out.  You see Prager University that puts out conservative videos, but  one happened to be about Israel with Alan Dershowitz, one happened to be  about baseball with George Will.  You know what?  Facebook wouldn't show  those because they said YouTube rated them similar to pornography.  </p><p>Then we found out recently that they said it was a couple of Facebook  employees.  Take, for instance, I follow your tweets.  You put something  out about Sweden last week in regards to conservatives gaming based upon  their immigration policy.  That algorithm, written by a human, said that  was sensitive, so certain people on Twitter could not see that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Swedish election is sensitive.  OK.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's sensitive.  So that is just an algorithm?  But if you  Google the California Republican Party right before the primary, they said  our ideology was Nazism, and they blame that on Wikipedia.  </p><p>But after we have raised this issue -- and I've had many conversations with  the president about it, that we have to stop this bias, look what happened  in Facebook just this week.  Their own employees, those conservatives who  have been intimidated based upon their own personal philosophy, put a group  together and rose up because they feel that has been going on as well.  You  look at what they did to Palmer Luckey and others.  Palmer is a brilliant  kid who invented Oculus, who Facebook actually purchased.  But when they  found out he had given money, his own personal money based upon who he  wanted to see become president, they wanted to push him out.  This is what  is happening in social media, they think it is just algorithms.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Congressman, let's get to solutions here.  A lot of pals are  working in antitrust and expert on antitrust issues, some kind of difficult  antitrust theories floating out there.  But there is another interesting  idea beyond antitrust, which is to consider Facebook and Twitter and so  forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public  utility.  \"Vanity Fair\" had a headline about Bannon saying, Steve Bannon  wants to nationalize Facebook and Google's data.  The cofounder of  Cambridge Analytica says big data should be placed in a public trust.  That  is going to your point that this really is the town square, and even though  it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising, we're  talking about Facebook especially, so we have to treat a different way.  Is  that something Congress is going to look at in consultation with the  executive branch?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I think Congress is going to look at everything from the  perspective of how powerful they have become.  I have spoken to Jack Dorsey  throughout the month, because the beginning of August, I sent a letter  requesting for him to come to Energy and Commerce.  And I want to give him  credit, he is showing up September 5th, and he and I philosophically  disagree, but we do we worry on one thing.  We believe in the First  Amendment.  But we also believe in transparency and accountability.  He is  coming forward.  I think the other companies CEOs need to go forward as  well, because the stories that they are telling and blaming other people,  and it's just an algorithm, is proving not to be true.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Google CEO said, no, I understand, but they are happy to  work with China on setting up the censorship tools that the communists in  China want instituted in Google.  They don't have any problem with that.  </p><p>I have to get your thoughts on today's funeral ceremonies for John McCain,  impassioned speeches, we had Vice President Biden speak, many others.  Your  thoughts?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I was there.  And I thought the very best speaker was a  very first speaker.  He was the first chief of staff to then congressman  John McCain.  And he told the story that John McCain told when he was a  POW, about a guard coming in, it's Christmas time, kind of loosening up the  ropes that had his arms time behind his back.  And right before he was  going off his time, he tied those ropes back.  He never seen this guard  before but he sees him out in the yard.  The guard walks up, doesn't say  anything to him, but with his foot in the gravel, he makes a cross, saying  about faith.  </p><p>And when you think of John McCain and what he went through, and every time  I watched put a jacket on, the difficulty, I had great respect for this  man.  I worked with him many times.  I had a difference of opinion, but I  thought that summed it up with a much more personal story, it was the  strongest story of the day.  It was a beautiful celebration of his life.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I would agree with you, an amazing tribute.  And I'm going to  ignore some of the not so thinly veiled hits on President Trump by some of  the people who participated, but I agree with you.  Just that image of  Senator McCain, and may he rest in peace.  Congressman McCarthy, thank you  so much for joining us tonight.  And we are going to be watching that  hearing with Dorsey next week.  </p><p>The Justice Department, by the way, is firing a major shot at Harvard  University and affirmative action.  Details ahead.  You do not want to miss  this segment with Michelle Malkin.  Don't go away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Harvard in the hot seat.  What happens when Harvard University  capped the number of Asian students who could be admitted?  Well, that  didn't go down so well.  Michelle Malkin joining us, and of course from  CRTV, and Cathy Areu, the publisher of \"Catalina Magazine.\" Also we have  news from Betsy DeVos at the Education Department involving Title IX and  sexual harassment on college campuses.  </p><p>But let's start with this Harvard story.  Michelle, you have been all over  this issue of affirmative action for years.  And now, we are at the point  where we are penalizing Asian students, and thankfully the U.S. Department  of Justice stepped in on behalf of fairness and merit on behalf of these  Asian students.  Tell us what you know.  </p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, this blatant racial  discrimination in the name of so-called social justice has punished high  achieving Asian-American students for a long time.  It's been obvious since  the late 1980s and 1990s when I was in college.  </p><p>And finally, we have the Trump Justice Department fighting with equality of  opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.  And what I love most about  what is happening, Laura, is Harvard is squirming under the microscope and  the bright, glaring sunlight of discovery.  For the longest time they had  kept their racially conscious and race unneutral policies under wraps, and  now it's being exposed.  </p><p>And what is happening is, you have a lot of liberal Asian-Americans who are  finally, finally having second thoughts about the social engineering that  has punished them at the expense of equality of opportunity.  And look, it  makes absolutely no sense to punish the children of legal immigrants from  all over Asia as some sort of social justice recompense to black students.   The reparations foundation of affirmative action here has been totally  blown up.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's go to Cathy.  Really short segment here.  Cathy, if it's  just a merit based analysis on admissions, the study from the Center for  Equal Opportunity shows that Asian-Americans would have 43 percent of the  admissions, Hispanics, two percent, African-Americans, on merit according  to the Center for Equal Opportunity, just one percent.  </p><p>CATHY AREU, \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE:  Right.  And what is merit?  Is merit  meaning SATs, is it meaning test scores?  So we are trying to say, this  against affirmative action.  And what's happening is that Harvard actually  has a system where there school population is diverse.  So the Trump  administration is trying to take away diversity at our institutions like  Harvard.  Harvard is fighting for diversity so that our student body can  look like our demographics in our country.  And there is nothing wrong with  that.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's move on really quickly.  No time here.  But Betsy DeVos  and Title IX.  Michelle, now it looks like men or anyone accused of sexual  harassment will have a few more rights aft UVA and of course some of the  other cases like Duke and so forth.  </p><p>MALKIN:  You think that civil libertarians would be cheering the fact that  we have administration that is restoring the rights of the accused and  restoring due process that has been sabotaged, particularly under the Obama  administration, by radicals who don't think that accused men should have  the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, that men who are  accused should have legal representation, that men who are accused should  be allowed to have access to exculpatory evidence, and that is what DeVos  is restoring.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Cathy, I owe you one because we're out of time.  When we come  back, final thoughts from Chicago.  Busy news night.  Stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Tomorrow night, we'll be back here in Chicago, and we will be  following up on our reporting on some of the other media sources out there.   We told you this week about CNN and a little loosey-goosey they were  playing with their source Lanny Davis.  Who is lying more?  And tomorrow,  what NBC reportedly did to put the kibosh on that Harvey Weinstein  reporting by Ronan Farrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Hey, Laura. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hey, Judge Jeanine. How are you? Fantastic  show tonight as always. Love the Bongino segment. Fantastic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIRRO: Well, we love Dan Bongino. He's a fighter wherever you need one.  Anyway, where are you tonight? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  We are in Chicago having a lot of fun, causing a little trouble,  but all in a good way, the good trouble in a good way. </p><p>PIRRO:  Make sure you have Giordano's pizza.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You know something, you are the second person who told me that  so I'm on it. Judge Jeanine, thank you so much. Great show. </p><p>PIRRO:  All right. Have a great show.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, welcome to THE INGRAHAM Angle.  I'm Laura Ingraham  live from Chicago tonight and we're going to explain why in just a little  bit. </p><p>The president just wrapping up a raucous rally in Indiana in Evansville.  We're going to breakdown his remarks throughout the hours so stick with us. </p><p>Also tonight, are congressional Republicans about to go to war with big  tech? House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to join us later in the  hour to break it all down. The looming fight over bias in Silicon Valley. </p><p>Plus, the reason we are here, violence continues to rock this amazing  American city, and while its political leaders might be asleep at the  switch, we came to get answers. Fox's own Gianno Caldwell went to some of  the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere in this country to talk to gang  bangers and ex-cons. Some exclusive video you do not want to miss. </p><p>But first, as we just mentioned, the president is taking all comers tonight  in Evansville and if you are just getting caught up, here is what you may  have missed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York  Times,\" which, by the way, if I wasn't here, they would be out of business.  \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times,\" CNN. So, a writer for \"The New  York Times\" that pretends she knows what she's talking about, hasn't got a  clue. </p><p>And I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same, the place was packed, she  made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty  chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom may be. And listen -- and he  was so disappointed at the tone in the room. NBC, which is probably worse  than CNN, but the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great  thing to do. How smart. That's what the worth. Who knows? With these  people, you never know.</p><p>By the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, governor, look how many cameras  you have back there. It's just like the academy awards. Look at it. They  can't get enough! But when they start screaming fake news, you see those  red lights go off for a little while. Excuse me, we have technical  difficulties. OK, then they go back. Right? Look at that. You know, in the  studio, you hear they go, \"listen, he's about ready to go, look.\" ladies  and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties. </p><p>We need Republicans in Congress. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by  left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies,  and their fake news allies. </p><p>You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at  what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's  see. All I can say this, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of  it -- because inside, they have incredible people, but our Justice  Department, and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right  and doing it now because people are angry. People are angry. </p><p>What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point, I wanted to stay out,  but at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly, I want them to do  their job, I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to.  Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching and the whole world gets it  and the whole world understands exactly what is going on. </p><p>The Democrats, they called themselves the resistance. That is what they are  good at. Resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day,  they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine  the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 like never  before delivered. </p><p>The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly  undemocratic they really have become, right? The so-called resistance is  mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we  are really -- we are getting rid of those bad ideas one by one so fast, and  it is driving them crazy. See, you have to understand, I have a better  education than they do from a much better school. </p><p>The elites, they are the elites. They are the elites. I went to a better  schools, I went to better everything. And by the way -- by the way -- are  you ready for this? I am president and they are not.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now for reaction, Katrina Pierson of course, senior  advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign. That's right. Already talking about  2020. Florida's republican attorney general Pam Bondi and attorney and  Democratic strategist, Jan Ronis. Great to see all of you tonight. </p><p>Pam, let's start -- let's start with you, Pam. Indiana -- I think this is  the president's third trip. He's heading to Charlotte, North Carolina for  the next rally. He is stacked for these rallies. He is going to hit every  close race, senate race. He'll do some house races, some people thought he  wasn't going to be this active on the campaign trail, but, boy, were they  wrong. </p><p>PAM BONDI, FLORIDA STATE ATTORNEY:  They sure were, Laura. They were wrong  and look at President Trump, look at his energy. He loves doing this. He  loves going out and supporting these candidates, and he knows how important  congress is to helping him pass the agenda that he needs to pass. </p><p>And he cares, and he is out there. I mean, this man must never, ever sleep.  I mean, the president is just working tirelessly to help all of these  races. And he loves it. He loves it. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Katrina, I'm here in Chicago and had a chance to talk to a lot  of folks earlier today. And believe it or not, even in liberal Chicago,  where I think it is like 83 percent or 87 percent of the city voted  democrat for Hillary in 2016, he has a lot of fans here. </p><p>But I think maybe two or three people, you know, in a room where I got to  talk to about eight people, said we love what the president is doing on the  economy, Katrina, but why does he have to harp on CNN or these other  networks. Just focus on your agenda, don't worry about these other side  issues because no one really cares. No one's watching those networks. They  are giving them too much -- too much publicity. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I don't think  anyone can deny that Donald Trump isn't a fighter. He is his number one  defender. We had a lot of experience about that on the first campaign. But  it's really important for him to continue to highlight and identify how the  fake news is doing an injustice to this country. </p><p>And, you know, as for tonight, Laura, there is nothing quite like or as fun  as a Trump rally. Even in this hostile political environment, the president  has deep opportunities do not just place a stamp of approval on candidates  that are going to help them keep America great, but it's the opportunity to  bypass those networks and speak directly to the people that talk about  those accomplishments. </p><p>And I have to tell you that this president has accomplished so much in his  first two years that we actually had to create a website, promises  kept.com, just to keep up with him. I was not one of those people that  expected him to just sit around and wait for the candidates to get going. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now, the thing that is going to happen tomorrow, and Jan, you  can chime in here, tomorrow it looks like they are going to announce  officially, they needed to do it by tomorrow, that Canada is going to join  in on this agreement with the United States and Mexico, replacing the old  NAFTA, a huge deal. Clinton, Obama, Bush, Hillary, they all promised --  Hillary if she was elected -- that they were going to change NAFTA. </p><p>No one thought President Trump was going to be able to do it. Just two days  ago, all the brilliant ones on cable news were saying, oh, Canada is not  going to join. This is never going to get through. Jan, on the issues of  trade and the economy, what is the Democrats' response to Trump's winning  on these issue? </p><p>JAN RONIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY:  Well, the Democratic response ought to be  that really -- that the NAFTA renegotiations are just NAFTA with a new  name. I mean, quite frankly, the differences are very subtle -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  No, they are not. Jan, you cannot come on this show. This is  actually something I know a lot about and I don't mean to interrupt you  right off the bat. But if you come on this show, and you start talking  smack about something you frankly don't know what you're talking about --  god bless you -- this is a completely redo of the NAFTA deal. </p><p>Do you understand what the rules of origin are all about? Do you get the  percentage of American components? Do you get that? Then you wouldn't have  said what you just said. </p><p>RONIS:  For example, the percentage of American components have gone up I  believe from 65 to 75. That's relatively a very small amount. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Right. OK.</p><p>RONIS:  And the wage increases don't apply to Mexico, which would still  allow Mexico to, you know, manufacture these cars at far lower prices than  in the United States. So it isn't -- you think the manufacturers will now  going to return to Mexico when they don't have to pay $16 an hour? They're  going to stay in Mexico. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  This is I've got to say. Yes, but you have intellectual property  protections, Pam Bondi, you have digital protections, this was a hard  bargain that was driven by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the whole team at  the USTR, Lusi Videgaray who came in the show a couple of days ago, is the  foreign minister. We finally got Trudeau and the gang in Canada on board. </p><p>The idea that this is a significant deal -- if it wasn't significant, then  why didn't Obama did something? Then why didn't, you know, why didn't  George W. Bush do anything with it? </p><p>BONDO:  Because they couldn't. </p><p>RONIS:  And in fact the word changes under way (ph) during the Obama  administration.</p><p>BONDI:  Because they couldn't do anything with it.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Never got anything done, Jan. You know it, I know it. I don't  want to be cranky tonight but you cannot come on this show and make claims  that are completely, patently false! This is a total redo of NAFTA. You  don't know what you're talking about. It's several -- I think it is 700  pages long. So don't come on the show and say it's ridiculous. Pam Bondi,  your turn. </p><p>BONDI:  Thank you. And the president and Jared and the staff, they have  been working on this nonstop. They were working on it all day today on  Canada. And with all the noise, everything going on, everything they are  trying to accuse the president of in the middle of all that, he is staying  laser focused and he is helping the American people. </p><p>He is bringing jobs to our country -- at 3.8 unemployment -- everything he  said, but what he did with Mexico and now Canada is unprecedented. And he  is a businessman. He is successful, and that is why our country is thriving  because of President Trump. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And by the way, news for Jan and everyone else watching, the  Europeans tonight announced -- another thing that the experts that would  never happen -- that they are going to eliminate, I believe, most tariffs  on automobiles. Why are they doing that do you think? Because they see what  Trump just did with Canada and with Mexico on NAFTA. </p><p>So, these barriers to effective and fair trade are systematically being  dismantled because of a smart trade policy, and that is what Democrats used  to be in favor of. I want to play for you, Katrina, something that Chuck  Todd said today about a bombshell tomorrow. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Here's what I've learned about Bob Mueller, not a  single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him would say,  if he didn't have anything -- if he would've ended this investigation if  there was no collusion, that he already would have ended this --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tell that though until he tells us. </p><p>TODD:  That's true. I think he knows more than anything he keeps quiet  between Labor Day and election day. I'm not missing work tomorrow. I  wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we are not missing work tomorrow, either, but that was one  of the more ridiculous things I've heard. Katrina -- and a rabbit is going  to come out of his hat. </p><p>PIERSON:  Laura, this is hypervigilance on behalf of the left. These are  the kinds of things that we have been hearing since the president took the  famous ride down the escalator and people are pretty much immune to it.  Clearly there was no collusion. </p><p>But look, no one is going to be listening to the talking heads on TV  particularly when their 401(K)s are going up. This trade deal was very  good, and it looks like it even took the stock market out of correction  territory. So again, Laura, the people at home are smarter than a lot of  the media think. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, I think again, the Democrats have to actually come to  the table with solutions, not just identity politics, get Trump and impeach  him. </p><p>PIERSON:  But how could they possibly come with solutions, they don't even  know who they are? Are they Democrats? Are they liberals? Are they  socialists? There is a crisis going on in the Democrat Party and President  Trump is out there -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, it's a split (ph) personality. </p><p>PIERSON:  That's what it is. It's a split personality and the Trump  derangement syndrome just compounds the effect.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys. </p><p>BONDI:  And Laura, he's out there talking to the American people. He's out  there talking to the American people that they understand, saying we are  not going to get ripped off by other countries anymore. </p><p>PIERSON:  Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Real quick, I got to give Jan a final thought real quick. We're  way over. </p><p>RONIS:  Listen, he is going back to the same old rhetoric that he did when  he first got elected, trying to scare the American people, talking about  Hillary getting away with criminal activities, frightening everybody about  undocumented aliens. It's the same old, you know, art of -- the art of  politics is getting elected and re-elected, and I'll give him credit  because he is an expert at that but it's at the expense of the truth. It's  at the expense of what this country and its people.</p><p>PIERSON:  401(K), Jan, 401(K). </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, 4.2 percent GDP. </p><p>RONIS:  -- millions of people in this country -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys, we're out of time. All right, we are here in  Chicago. A new wave of violence striking the city. When we come back, we  are going to talk to one of the best reporters on the ground, and you don't  want to miss that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yet another wave of violence rocking the city of Chicago  tonight. Just yesterday, eight people were shot and wounded in a period of  eight hours. And with each day that goes by, Chicago city officials led by  Rahm Emanuel seemed more and more powerless to stop it. This week, Gianno  Caldwell, a Fox News political analyst and Chicago native, went out to  speak with members of the worst hit communities and find out what is  driving the bloodshed. Watchg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NINI, CHICAGO RESIDENT:  In this neighborhood, everybody want to be better  than the next person. Everybody want to rock the better jeans. You know  what you got on, the better shoes. Everyone want to be the one on top. </p><p>So these boys looking at it, like, hey, let me see your (inaudible) and let  me do this and that. That's why there's a lot of violence. And I believe,  you get some of these boys into a job, put money in their pockets so they  can survive, take care of what they need to take care of, maybe it'll stop  some of this stuff. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now with more is Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great  to see you tonight. You know, it was interesting what Ninin just said  there, and she said everyone wants to be on top, have what the other guy  has or better, I don't know if she was talking about house or car or shoes  or what. But -- </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Everything. All of the above.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- she said if they had a job maybe it would -- yes, maybe it  would be better. To get the job, you have to have the skills, you have to  have the educational background, a parent or role model who helps with the  education and the guidance. The problem is a lot of these kids don't have  any of that. And then the gangs walk in. </p><p>CADWELL:  Yes, Laura. I think what I really saw here this week, when doing  these interviews with a number of the high-ranking gang members throughout  the city of Chicago, is there is a deficit in personal responsibility. A  lot of parents that have left their homes who believe that their parents  maybe were too harsh on them as they were growing up, they allowed their  kids to run free. </p><p>And as a result, we see the bloodshed. We all did a study in 2015, which  said for every 100,000 residents in the city of Chicago, there is, on  average, one white person shot, 28 Hispanic shot, and a whopping 113  African-Americans shot in a city of 2.7 million people. This is beyond the  pale of what we should see in any American city. And I know, and I thank  you for your coverage on this, because you have done it from your heart,  this has not been political for you. </p><p>You see the same things that I see in a lot of the African-American  residents here in Chicago, which is no American city should be like this.  There should be no person in an American city that have to live through  this level of fear. </p><p>And what we are seeing and especially speaking to the gang bangers in the  city of Chicago, there is a lot of those folks feel that this was a life  that they were preconditioned for. This isn't something that they  necessarily chose, as one told me, this is the life that chose him. So this  is, I mean, is just unfortunate. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And Gianno, the need for investment or business to come in, as  we have talked about before, how do you solve this problem? Until the  streets are safe, we need more detectives, more police, more personal  responsibility, more role models, it is hard to get the business to come  in, even with tax incentives that Rahm Emanuel, as far as I know, hasn't  been willing to talk about. </p><p>But even with tax incentives, if you go in there in some Inglewood, some of  these other areas and worried about your safety, or your employee safety,  that is -- that is going to be a heavy lift. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It will be. But, you know, I was really happy to hear from an  individual who runs a program or an organization called ex-cons for  community and social change. His name is Tyrone Muhammad. He is actually an  ex-con. He went to jail I believe for about 30 years for murder. </p><p>He started a program when he got out of jail and he goes and gets more ex- cons and they go back into those communities in which they robbed and steal  from, the communities that they murdered and which led to bloodshed. </p><p>So, that was something that I thought was particularly encouraging because  they are talking to the youth. They're looking to put those individuals and  jobs.  And I was really happy to hear that because those are the stories  that we normally don't hear, those are stories that we normally don't see. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I actually -- Gianno, we actually have -- Gianno, we actually  have that part of your discussion with him. I think we are going to play it  now. Let's watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TYRONE MUHAMMAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECCSC:  Those guys involved with my  organization have served 20 years or more in prison. We are men who  recognize that we've made a mistake. We are not sitting around waiting on  something (inaudible) white person, the politicians, the legislation, to  change our condition. We know that we helped perpetrate some of the  violence in our community and we learned a long time ago why we was in  prison, that we would have to change it ourselves. </p><p>(END VIDE CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right Gianno, final thoughts real quick. </p><p>CALDWELL:  We need more of that in the city of Chicago. There needs to be  an expansion of personal responsibility because no one can rely on the  government to solve all of these problems. And that includes the violence  in Chicago. They are part of the solution but they are not the solution in  totality. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You need more police, you need more cops on the ground, you need  more detectives so they actually solve some of these crimes, and that is  where the mayor and city officials kick in. Gianno, thank you very much. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It's been a failure of leadership on the level of the city and as  well of the state, there's been a failure of leadership in Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we've been trying to get Rahm Emanuel on this show and  other alderman and not much luck there. So, we'll keep trying. Gianno,  thanks so much. </p><p>Now with the discussion on this, we're going to talk to Horace Cooper of  Project 21, and of course, Leo Terrell is with us, radio talk show host.  Both of you, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you. I don't  think this is an issue that should be political. It should be solved. </p><p>This should be solved both from within the community, with police, safe  leaders, and business can partner, but if it is not going to come from  within and a real move from within the community, I don't know how we are  going to solve this. </p><p>But I can tell by talking to folks today, you need more police on the  ground. If you don't have more police on the ground, you will never get any  of the good stuff to happen. Leo? </p><p>LEO TERRELL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well Laura, I can tell from your  sincerity that you are very serious about this. But it's just not police,  respectfully. When I just saw the president on Fox talking about African- American unemployment rate is down, what about in the south and west sides  of Chicago? There is poverty in Chicago youth, from 18 to 24. Giovanni  didn't talk about the unemployment rate in Chicago. </p><p>You got to have jobs they are and what I submit to you, Laura, is that  there are no jobs there. There's just not on the local level. We have a  Republican governor and the blame goes all the way around. But let's focus  on the absence of jobs. I'll support your argument about police but please,  acknowledge that great -- make America great again does not apply to  African-American youth between the ages of 18 and 24 beyond the south and  west side of Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Leo, I think you are right about that. I mean, I'm not --</p><p>TERRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I think you're right about that the jobs aren't there. Trump  didn't create Chicago. So, I mean, you are a really good civil rights  attorney, a Democrat, and I get that, but to say or imply -- </p><p>TERRELL:  Can I point out one thing? </p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- to imply that Trump caused Chicago is absurd, and it will not  stand. Horace? </p><p>HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21:  Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I mean, it starts before Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel has been  there since 2011, murder rates, ridiculous high. More than 2,000 people now  have been murdered in Chicago since he became mayor. Unacceptable.  Absolutely unacceptable. </p><p>COOPER:  Jobs -- jobs will never come to Chicago as long as it's Beirut on  Lake Michigan. Here's the truth. The truth is, it requires two basic  techniques. You  must increase the fear of apprehension on those who would  mug, rob, or rape grandma, the people who will not let Lucy go to school,  and they create an environment so Frank the father can't get a job. </p><p>You absolutely must start with creating apprehension -- excuse me, a risk  of apprehension, for those individuals. Once that risk is real, who do not  change, who will not conform, they must be removed. That means five, seven,  or 10-year sentences. When that happens, which we know it worked, it worked  in Richmond, it worked in New York City, it worked in Louisiana, in New  Orleans, it will work anywhere. When that happens, then we can talk about  jobs and personal responsibility. </p><p>TERRELL:  Hey, can I just say a little game called Jeopardy? How about  this? What do you got to lose? Give me a chance. OK, who made that  statement in 2016? The Democrats have always been in office --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lowest unemployment for African-American and how long?</p><p>TERRELL:  -- give me a chance. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TERRELL:  Remember that guy? </p><p>COOPER:  We have set five records for low unemployment in just the first 10  (ph) years. </p><p>TERRELL:  What about Chicago? We are talking about Chicago, Horace. We are  talking about Chicago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Guys, stop, stop, stop! Do you know that Democrats have been  running Chicago for I believe seven decades? Do you realize that? </p><p>TERRELL:  We have a Republican governor, Laura! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you realize there is not one -- there is not -- we are  talking about the city of Chicago. You, Leo, are very smart, you know just  like I do, the city is run by the city council and the mayor's office. It's  not run by Bruce Rauner, OK. </p><p>They do legislate legislation and allocation of funds, but the funds and  the local taxes in Chicago run the police and they assist in running the  schools. OK? So, lets' be honest. This is 70 years of Democratic  leadership, 70! </p><p>TERRELL:  Here's a good fellow (ph) response. Local governments don't  create jobs. You know, Laura, that the job creation starts up in -- </p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Why are we on this? </p><p>TERRELL:  There are no jobs! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you think, I mean honestly, if do you that Rahm Emanuel since  2011, has done a good job for the city of Chicago, because I can tell you,  most Democrats we talked to today in the streets, they want him gone. They  don't want him to return. They want a new person in. </p><p>TERRELL:  I'm not here to defend Rahm Emanuel. I'm not here -- I'm just  simply saying, you do acknowledge that jobs are critical. Horace simply  said lock everybody up. He doesn't have a job plan. </p><p>COOPER:  You will not create a thriving job market as long as grandma is  afraid to even go and get her prescriptions filled. </p><p>TERREL:  Talking points. </p><p>COOPER:  That Lucy can't go to school -- it's not a talking point. This is  a reality. </p><p>TERRELL:  It is, talking points. Pure tactic.</p><p>COOPER:  That Chicago papers profiled all of these victims that we are  ignoring. We don't have jets that fly in from Arizona to Washington, D.C. - -</p><p>TERRELL:  Talking points.</p><p>COOPER:  -- for all of the people who are dying in Chicago.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, you know what -- you know it's not a talking point. Leo, you  keep saying talking points.  You know what is not a talking point?  We  talked to a woman whose nephew's remains were burned and stored in a 55- gallon drum.  You know what his great crime was?  Walking home.  </p><p>TERRELL:  That's a horrible crime.  That's a horrible crime.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's what life is in some of these neighborhoods in Chicago.   Don't tell me it's a talking point.  That's someone's life, and it happens  way too often, predominately African-American.  And it's got to stop.  The  cauldron of death and Chicago, got to put an end to it.  It is ridiculous,  and Republicans and Democrats have got to come together.  And the people of  the city I think want to do something about it, but when you have failed  leadership, whether it's Republican or Democrat, it's got to be changed and  swept out of office.  </p><p>TERRELL:  I agree with you, Laura.  I agree with you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Great segment.  We are out of time.  </p><p>COOPER:  A jobs program will not stop cutthroat --  </p><p>TERRELL:  We are done, Horace.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, guys, we're out of time.  We're going to be covering this  for months and months and months.  Thank you so much.</p><p>And joining us now with more -- excuse me.  We're going to take a break.   When we come back, we are going to talk about what Andrew Cuomo said,  believe it or not, about a ICE.  You thought the ICE protests were bad  before.  We might have protests on the other side after you hear what he  said.  Don't got away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to abolish  ICE.  Where did this come from?  By the way, did you have any idea what ICE  does?  These are people that go into a nest of MS-13.  They call nest.   That is what it is.  It's a nest.  These are evil people in there.  </p><p>I can't say \"animals\" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I  called them animals.  I called them animals.  She went crazy.  I can't do  it.  </p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Nancy Pelosi gets a lot of boos, doesn't she?  That was  President Trump at Indiana earlier tonight.  And that situation, those  remarks, could well not stand in greater contrast of the rhetoric we are  hearing from Democrats.  Andrew Cuomo last night at his debate with Cynthia  Nixon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  New York state is the state that said we  will not cooperate with ICE.  They were a bunch of thugs.  He politicized  ICE.  they are a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, president of the  National Border Patrol union, and Esther Valdes, an immigration attorney.   Esther, good to see you.  Art, good to see you.  I'm going to have Art take  the first swing at the Cuomo comments.  I do not understand why the  Democrats keep going back to the well of maligning the great men and women  of the Immigration Customs Enforcement, but they must think it is going to  work somewhere, and maybe in New York.  Art?  </p><p>ART DEL CUETO:  They are doing it because they don't have anything else to  say.  When you lose the argument, you've got to bring a race.  That is  usually what these people have been doing.  It's amazing to hear someone  say something like that, and then call the ICE people thugs.  You are  saying you are not going to agree with law enforcement, but they are the  ones that are thugs?  It sounds like you're the thug.  </p><p>Every time I hear these guys go back and forth, I can't help but wonder  that they are competing and some kind of here, hold my beer, let's see how  stupid I can sound today contest.  It's just amazing.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, had his own  reaction to what Cuomo said last night.  Let's watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR:  What he is saying, his actions are  disgusting.  To call ICE agents thugs, think about it.  These are men and  women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and  daughters, that chose to enforce the laws of this country, strap a gun to  the hip every day, put a Kevlar vest on to go out to the community and  protect America, protect the communities.  He calls them thugs.  Actually,  ICE arrests thugs, MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, ICE arrests thugs and the Democrats are calling ICE  thugs, your reaction?  </p><p>ESTHER VALDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  It is notable that Governor Cuomo is  not a border state governor.  Otherwise he would have firsthand knowledge  of what ICE officers actually do.  They are the frontline defenders, and  here in San Diego they are the first line of defense to disrupt drug  trafficking rings, child molestation rings, and people who exploit men and  women.  I invite Governor Cuomo to come down here and see what ICE agents  actually do.  </p><p>And by and large, I interact with them as an immigration attorney at least  once a week when I'm at the detention facilities.  Those men and women are  some of our finest, bravest law enforcement agents that we have.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I've got to remind everyone who the senators are who are in  favor of abolishing ICE, and this is just a list.  I'm sure it will grow,  but this is where we are right now.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, OK, New  York, she'll be running for president, 2020, Elizabeth Warren in  Massachusetts, she'll be running in 2020, Bernie Sanders, Vermont, he'll be  running a 2020, Mark Pocan in Wisconsin, nobody can even recognize him on  the street, Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Earl Blumenauer from  Oregon, Nydia Velazquez, New York, goes on, Raul Grijalva, Mark DeSaulnier,  California, and that's just where we are right now.  Of course,  congressional candidates, Alexandria Cortez, Randy Bryce, so forth.  </p><p>Art, I don't know why, again, Democrats think that the men and women who  keep us safe, are breaking up a child sex trafficking rings, human  smuggling rings, of course narcotics operations funded by the cartels -- I  don't get it.  How is that going to appeal even to the inner city folks who  want a safe environment as well?  I'm presuming they want safer streets,  safer situations for their families.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  They should.  The thing is, they try to make this division, and  then they turn it around or they make it about race.  Listen, even when  I've come on your show, I see some of the comments that some of these  individuals say about myself.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lovely.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  As being Hispanic.  But I came to this country, my parents came  to this country legally.  There is a legal way to do it.  People can't  distinguish the difference between border patrol agents, between ICE  agents, between the immigration officers at our ports of entry.  They can't  distinguish the difference between a legal immigrant in an illegal  immigrant.  </p><p>It is just -- I don't know what their thought processes, but anything they  can do is they try to divide as much as possible so they appease a certain  group of people, and try to -- that's what it is.  It comes down to  division and race.  And the reality is, I've said it so many times, illegal  is not a race.  We are not out there separating families.  Whose to blame?   The families themselves.  An American citizen commits a crime with their  child in this country, what happens?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You get separated.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  You get separated, and you go through the court system.  What  is happening here is these people, they are such great parents that they  are turning over their children to drug smugglers, they are turning their  children over to people smugglers, they are abandoning them in the desert,  and we're the bad guys?  Come on.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  But it's our fault.  It's ICE's fault.  Guys, thank you so much.  </p><p>Charges of anti-conservative bias are roiling the big tech companies.   Kevin McCarthy has something to say about it.  Don't miss it, up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My administration is also  standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans.  Social media  giants, and I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate  political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results.  We will not  let large corporations silence conservative voices.  And it can.  It can go  the other way, too, some day.  We are not going to let them control what we  can and cannot see, read, and learn from.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You heard President Trump.  He wants social media companies to  be held accountable for alleged anti-conservative bias.  Next week, Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey will have his feet held to the fire when he testifies on  Capitol Hill.  And one of the individuals leading the charge on all of this  is House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who joins us now.  Congressman,  great to see you.  </p><p>This is what I have been told, congressman, time and time again by my  liberal friends, OK?  This is an algorithm.  This has nothing to do with  politics.  The algorithm was in place before Trump, and it's going to be in  place after Trump.  There is no political bias, it all relates to what  articles are popular and versus articles that are not as popular.  What is  your reaction to that?  </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  That's just not true.   Social media today is the modern-day town hall.  Sixty-seven percent of  adults get their news from somewhere on social media.  But let's just play  that out.  You see Prager University that puts out conservative videos, but  one happened to be about Israel with Alan Dershowitz, one happened to be  about baseball with George Will.  You know what?  Facebook wouldn't show  those because they said YouTube rated them similar to pornography.  </p><p>Then we found out recently that they said it was a couple of Facebook  employees.  Take, for instance, I follow your tweets.  You put something  out about Sweden last week in regards to conservatives gaming based upon  their immigration policy.  That algorithm, written by a human, said that  was sensitive, so certain people on Twitter could not see that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Swedish election is sensitive.  OK.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's sensitive.  So that is just an algorithm?  But if you  Google the California Republican Party right before the primary, they said  our ideology was Nazism, and they blame that on Wikipedia.  </p><p>But after we have raised this issue -- and I've had many conversations with  the president about it, that we have to stop this bias, look what happened  in Facebook just this week.  Their own employees, those conservatives who  have been intimidated based upon their own personal philosophy, put a group  together and rose up because they feel that has been going on as well.  You  look at what they did to Palmer Luckey and others.  Palmer is a brilliant  kid who invented Oculus, who Facebook actually purchased.  But when they  found out he had given money, his own personal money based upon who he  wanted to see become president, they wanted to push him out.  This is what  is happening in social media, they think it is just algorithms.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Congressman, let's get to solutions here.  A lot of pals are  working in antitrust and expert on antitrust issues, some kind of difficult  antitrust theories floating out there.  But there is another interesting  idea beyond antitrust, which is to consider Facebook and Twitter and so  forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public  utility.  \"Vanity Fair\" had a headline about Bannon saying, Steve Bannon  wants to nationalize Facebook and Google's data.  The cofounder of  Cambridge Analytica says big data should be placed in a public trust.  That  is going to your point that this really is the town square, and even though  it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising, we're  talking about Facebook especially, so we have to treat a different way.  Is  that something Congress is going to look at in consultation with the  executive branch?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I think Congress is going to look at everything from the  perspective of how powerful they have become.  I have spoken to Jack Dorsey  throughout the month, because the beginning of August, I sent a letter  requesting for him to come to Energy and Commerce.  And I want to give him  credit, he is showing up September 5th, and he and I philosophically  disagree, but we do we worry on one thing.  We believe in the First  Amendment.  But we also believe in transparency and accountability.  He is  coming forward.  I think the other companies CEOs need to go forward as  well, because the stories that they are telling and blaming other people,  and it's just an algorithm, is proving not to be true.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Google CEO said, no, I understand, but they are happy to  work with China on setting up the censorship tools that the communists in  China want instituted in Google.  They don't have any problem with that.  </p><p>I have to get your thoughts on today's funeral ceremonies for John McCain,  impassioned speeches, we had Vice President Biden speak, many others.  Your  thoughts?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I was there.  And I thought the very best speaker was a  very first speaker.  He was the first chief of staff to then congressman  John McCain.  And he told the story that John McCain told when he was a  POW, about a guard coming in, it's Christmas time, kind of loosening up the  ropes that had his arms time behind his back.  And right before he was  going off his time, he tied those ropes back.  He never seen this guard  before but he sees him out in the yard.  The guard walks up, doesn't say  anything to him, but with his foot in the gravel, he makes a cross, saying  about faith.  </p><p>And when you think of John McCain and what he went through, and every time  I watched put a jacket on, the difficulty, I had great respect for this  man.  I worked with him many times.  I had a difference of opinion, but I  thought that summed it up with a much more personal story, it was the  strongest story of the day.  It was a beautiful celebration of his life.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I would agree with you, an amazing tribute.  And I'm going to  ignore some of the not so thinly veiled hits on President Trump by some of  the people who participated, but I agree with you.  Just that image of  Senator McCain, and may he rest in peace.  Congressman McCarthy, thank you  so much for joining us tonight.  And we are going to be watching that  hearing with Dorsey next week.  </p><p>The Justice Department, by the way, is firing a major shot at Harvard  University and affirmative action.  Details ahead.  You do not want to miss  this segment with Michelle Malkin.  Don't go away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Harvard in the hot seat.  What happens when Harvard University  capped the number of Asian students who could be admitted?  Well, that  didn't go down so well.  Michelle Malkin joining us, and of course from  CRTV, and Cathy Areu, the publisher of \"Catalina Magazine.\" Also we have  news from Betsy DeVos at the Education Department involving Title IX and  sexual harassment on college campuses.  </p><p>But let's start with this Harvard story.  Michelle, you have been all over  this issue of affirmative action for years.  And now, we are at the point  where we are penalizing Asian students, and thankfully the U.S. Department  of Justice stepped in on behalf of fairness and merit on behalf of these  Asian students.  Tell us what you know.  </p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, this blatant racial  discrimination in the name of so-called social justice has punished high  achieving Asian-American students for a long time.  It's been obvious since  the late 1980s and 1990s when I was in college.  </p><p>And finally, we have the Trump Justice Department fighting with equality of  opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.  And what I love most about  what is happening, Laura, is Harvard is squirming under the microscope and  the bright, glaring sunlight of discovery.  For the longest time they had  kept their racially conscious and race unneutral policies under wraps, and  now it's being exposed.  </p><p>And what is happening is, you have a lot of liberal Asian-Americans who are  finally, finally having second thoughts about the social engineering that  has punished them at the expense of equality of opportunity.  And look, it  makes absolutely no sense to punish the children of legal immigrants from  all over Asia as some sort of social justice recompense to black students.   The reparations foundation of affirmative action here has been totally  blown up.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's go to Cathy.  Really short segment here.  Cathy, if it's  just a merit based analysis on admissions, the study from the Center for  Equal Opportunity shows that Asian-Americans would have 43 percent of the  admissions, Hispanics, two percent, African-Americans, on merit according  to the Center for Equal Opportunity, just one percent.  </p><p>CATHY AREU, \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE:  Right.  And what is merit?  Is merit  meaning SATs, is it meaning test scores?  So we are trying to say, this  against affirmative action.  And what's happening is that Harvard actually  has a system where there school population is diverse.  So the Trump  administration is trying to take away diversity at our institutions like  Harvard.  Harvard is fighting for diversity so that our student body can  look like our demographics in our country.  And there is nothing wrong with  that.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's move on really quickly.  No time here.  But Betsy DeVos  and Title IX.  Michelle, now it looks like men or anyone accused of sexual  harassment will have a few more rights aft UVA and of course some of the  other cases like Duke and so forth.  </p><p>MALKIN:  You think that civil libertarians would be cheering the fact that  we have administration that is restoring the rights of the accused and  restoring due process that has been sabotaged, particularly under the Obama  administration, by radicals who don't think that accused men should have  the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, that men who are  accused should have legal representation, that men who are accused should  be allowed to have access to exculpatory evidence, and that is what DeVos  is restoring.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Cathy, I owe you one because we're out of time.  When we come  back, final thoughts from Chicago.  Busy news night.  Stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Tomorrow night, we'll be back here in Chicago, and we will be  following up on our reporting on some of the other media sources out there.   We told you this week about CNN and a little loosey-goosey they were  playing with their source Lanny Davis.  Who is lying more?  And tomorrow,  what NBC reportedly did to put the kibosh on that Harvey Weinstein  reporting by Ronan Farrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Hey, Laura. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hey, Judge Jeanine. How are you? Fantastic  show tonight as always. Love the Bongino segment. Fantastic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIRRO: Well, we love Dan Bongino. He's a fighter wherever you need one.  Anyway, where are you tonight? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  We are in Chicago having a lot of fun, causing a little trouble,  but all in a good way, the good trouble in a good way. </p><p>PIRRO:  Make sure you have Giordano's pizza.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You know something, you are the second person who told me that  so I'm on it. Judge Jeanine, thank you so much. Great show. </p><p>PIRRO:  All right. Have a great show.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, welcome to THE INGRAHAM Angle.  I'm Laura Ingraham  live from Chicago tonight and we're going to explain why in just a little  bit. </p><p>The president just wrapping up a raucous rally in Indiana in Evansville.  We're going to breakdown his remarks throughout the hours so stick with us. </p><p>Also tonight, are congressional Republicans about to go to war with big  tech? House majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to join us later in the  hour to break it all down. The looming fight over bias in Silicon Valley. </p><p>Plus, the reason we are here, violence continues to rock this amazing  American city, and while its political leaders might be asleep at the  switch, we came to get answers. Fox's own Gianno Caldwell went to some of  the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere in this country to talk to gang  bangers and ex-cons. Some exclusive video you do not want to miss. </p><p>But first, as we just mentioned, the president is taking all comers tonight  in Evansville and if you are just getting caught up, here is what you may  have missed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York  Times,\" which, by the way, if I wasn't here, they would be out of business.  \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times,\" CNN. So, a writer for \"The New  York Times\" that pretends she knows what she's talking about, hasn't got a  clue. </p><p>And I'm telling you, the enthusiasm was the same, the place was packed, she  made the statement that President Trump was disappointed to see some empty  chairs. Yeah, they were going to the bathroom may be. And listen -- and he  was so disappointed at the tone in the room. NBC, which is probably worse  than CNN, but the word is they are firing the head of NBC. What a great  thing to do. How smart. That's what the worth. Who knows? With these  people, you never know.</p><p>By the way, take a look, Todd, everybody, governor, look how many cameras  you have back there. It's just like the academy awards. Look at it. They  can't get enough! But when they start screaming fake news, you see those  red lights go off for a little while. Excuse me, we have technical  difficulties. OK, then they go back. Right? Look at that. You know, in the  studio, you hear they go, \"listen, he's about ready to go, look.\" ladies  and gentlemen, we have technical difficulties. </p><p>We need Republicans in Congress. Today's Democrat Party is held hostage by  left-wing haters, angry mobs, deep state radicals, establishment cronies,  and their fake news allies. </p><p>You can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton -- I mean, look at  what she's getting away with. But let's see if she gets away with it. Let's  see. All I can say this, our Justice Department and our FBI, at the top of  it -- because inside, they have incredible people, but our Justice  Department, and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right  and doing it now because people are angry. People are angry. </p><p>What's happening is a disgrace. And at some point, I wanted to stay out,  but at some point, if it doesn't straighten out properly, I want them to do  their job, I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to.  Disgraceful. And the whole world is watching and the whole world gets it  and the whole world understands exactly what is going on. </p><p>The Democrats, they called themselves the resistance. That is what they are  good at. Resisting and obstructing. They are obstructionists. Every day,  they are resisting the will of the American people and trying to undermine  the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 like never  before delivered. </p><p>The most remarkable thing about the modern Democrat Party is how truly  undemocratic they really have become, right? The so-called resistance is  mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people. And we  are really -- we are getting rid of those bad ideas one by one so fast, and  it is driving them crazy. See, you have to understand, I have a better  education than they do from a much better school. </p><p>The elites, they are the elites. They are the elites. I went to a better  schools, I went to better everything. And by the way -- by the way -- are  you ready for this? I am president and they are not.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now for reaction, Katrina Pierson of course, senior  advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign. That's right. Already talking about  2020. Florida's republican attorney general Pam Bondi and attorney and  Democratic strategist, Jan Ronis. Great to see all of you tonight. </p><p>Pam, let's start -- let's start with you, Pam. Indiana -- I think this is  the president's third trip. He's heading to Charlotte, North Carolina for  the next rally. He is stacked for these rallies. He is going to hit every  close race, senate race. He'll do some house races, some people thought he  wasn't going to be this active on the campaign trail, but, boy, were they  wrong. </p><p>PAM BONDI, FLORIDA STATE ATTORNEY:  They sure were, Laura. They were wrong  and look at President Trump, look at his energy. He loves doing this. He  loves going out and supporting these candidates, and he knows how important  congress is to helping him pass the agenda that he needs to pass. </p><p>And he cares, and he is out there. I mean, this man must never, ever sleep.  I mean, the president is just working tirelessly to help all of these  races. And he loves it. He loves it. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Katrina, I'm here in Chicago and had a chance to talk to a lot  of folks earlier today. And believe it or not, even in liberal Chicago,  where I think it is like 83 percent or 87 percent of the city voted  democrat for Hillary in 2016, he has a lot of fans here. </p><p>But I think maybe two or three people, you know, in a room where I got to  talk to about eight people, said we love what the president is doing on the  economy, Katrina, but why does he have to harp on CNN or these other  networks. Just focus on your agenda, don't worry about these other side  issues because no one really cares. No one's watching those networks. They  are giving them too much -- too much publicity. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I don't think  anyone can deny that Donald Trump isn't a fighter. He is his number one  defender. We had a lot of experience about that on the first campaign. But  it's really important for him to continue to highlight and identify how the  fake news is doing an injustice to this country. </p><p>And, you know, as for tonight, Laura, there is nothing quite like or as fun  as a Trump rally. Even in this hostile political environment, the president  has deep opportunities do not just place a stamp of approval on candidates  that are going to help them keep America great, but it's the opportunity to  bypass those networks and speak directly to the people that talk about  those accomplishments. </p><p>And I have to tell you that this president has accomplished so much in his  first two years that we actually had to create a website, promises  kept.com, just to keep up with him. I was not one of those people that  expected him to just sit around and wait for the candidates to get going. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now, the thing that is going to happen tomorrow, and Jan, you  can chime in here, tomorrow it looks like they are going to announce  officially, they needed to do it by tomorrow, that Canada is going to join  in on this agreement with the United States and Mexico, replacing the old  NAFTA, a huge deal. Clinton, Obama, Bush, Hillary, they all promised --  Hillary if she was elected -- that they were going to change NAFTA. </p><p>No one thought President Trump was going to be able to do it. Just two days  ago, all the brilliant ones on cable news were saying, oh, Canada is not  going to join. This is never going to get through. Jan, on the issues of  trade and the economy, what is the Democrats' response to Trump's winning  on these issue? </p><p>JAN RONIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY:  Well, the Democratic response ought to be  that really -- that the NAFTA renegotiations are just NAFTA with a new  name. I mean, quite frankly, the differences are very subtle -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  No, they are not. Jan, you cannot come on this show. This is  actually something I know a lot about and I don't mean to interrupt you  right off the bat. But if you come on this show, and you start talking  smack about something you frankly don't know what you're talking about --  god bless you -- this is a completely redo of the NAFTA deal. </p><p>Do you understand what the rules of origin are all about? Do you get the  percentage of American components? Do you get that? Then you wouldn't have  said what you just said. </p><p>RONIS:  For example, the percentage of American components have gone up I  believe from 65 to 75. That's relatively a very small amount. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Right. OK.</p><p>RONIS:  And the wage increases don't apply to Mexico, which would still  allow Mexico to, you know, manufacture these cars at far lower prices than  in the United States. So it isn't -- you think the manufacturers will now  going to return to Mexico when they don't have to pay $16 an hour? They're  going to stay in Mexico. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  This is I've got to say. Yes, but you have intellectual property  protections, Pam Bondi, you have digital protections, this was a hard  bargain that was driven by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the whole team at  the USTR, Lusi Videgaray who came in the show a couple of days ago, is the  foreign minister. We finally got Trudeau and the gang in Canada on board. </p><p>The idea that this is a significant deal -- if it wasn't significant, then  why didn't Obama did something? Then why didn't, you know, why didn't  George W. Bush do anything with it? </p><p>BONDO:  Because they couldn't. </p><p>RONIS:  And in fact the word changes under way (ph) during the Obama  administration.</p><p>BONDI:  Because they couldn't do anything with it.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Never got anything done, Jan. You know it, I know it. I don't  want to be cranky tonight but you cannot come on this show and make claims  that are completely, patently false! This is a total redo of NAFTA. You  don't know what you're talking about. It's several -- I think it is 700  pages long. So don't come on the show and say it's ridiculous. Pam Bondi,  your turn. </p><p>BONDI:  Thank you. And the president and Jared and the staff, they have  been working on this nonstop. They were working on it all day today on  Canada. And with all the noise, everything going on, everything they are  trying to accuse the president of in the middle of all that, he is staying  laser focused and he is helping the American people. </p><p>He is bringing jobs to our country -- at 3.8 unemployment -- everything he  said, but what he did with Mexico and now Canada is unprecedented. And he  is a businessman. He is successful, and that is why our country is thriving  because of President Trump. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And by the way, news for Jan and everyone else watching, the  Europeans tonight announced -- another thing that the experts that would  never happen -- that they are going to eliminate, I believe, most tariffs  on automobiles. Why are they doing that do you think? Because they see what  Trump just did with Canada and with Mexico on NAFTA. </p><p>So, these barriers to effective and fair trade are systematically being  dismantled because of a smart trade policy, and that is what Democrats used  to be in favor of. I want to play for you, Katrina, something that Chuck  Todd said today about a bombshell tomorrow. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Here's what I've learned about Bob Mueller, not a  single person that has known him, been with him, worked with him would say,  if he didn't have anything -- if he would've ended this investigation if  there was no collusion, that he already would have ended this --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tell that though until he tells us. </p><p>TODD:  That's true. I think he knows more than anything he keeps quiet  between Labor Day and election day. I'm not missing work tomorrow. I  wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we are not missing work tomorrow, either, but that was one  of the more ridiculous things I've heard. Katrina -- and a rabbit is going  to come out of his hat. </p><p>PIERSON:  Laura, this is hypervigilance on behalf of the left. These are  the kinds of things that we have been hearing since the president took the  famous ride down the escalator and people are pretty much immune to it.  Clearly there was no collusion. </p><p>But look, no one is going to be listening to the talking heads on TV  particularly when their 401(K)s are going up. This trade deal was very  good, and it looks like it even took the stock market out of correction  territory. So again, Laura, the people at home are smarter than a lot of  the media think. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, I think again, the Democrats have to actually come to  the table with solutions, not just identity politics, get Trump and impeach  him. </p><p>PIERSON:  But how could they possibly come with solutions, they don't even  know who they are? Are they Democrats? Are they liberals? Are they  socialists? There is a crisis going on in the Democrat Party and President  Trump is out there -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, it's a split (ph) personality. </p><p>PIERSON:  That's what it is. It's a split personality and the Trump  derangement syndrome just compounds the effect.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys. </p><p>BONDI:  And Laura, he's out there talking to the American people. He's out  there talking to the American people that they understand, saying we are  not going to get ripped off by other countries anymore. </p><p>PIERSON:  Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Real quick, I got to give Jan a final thought real quick. We're  way over. </p><p>RONIS:  Listen, he is going back to the same old rhetoric that he did when  he first got elected, trying to scare the American people, talking about  Hillary getting away with criminal activities, frightening everybody about  undocumented aliens. It's the same old, you know, art of -- the art of  politics is getting elected and re-elected, and I'll give him credit  because he is an expert at that but it's at the expense of the truth. It's  at the expense of what this country and its people.</p><p>PIERSON:  401(K), Jan, 401(K). </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, 4.2 percent GDP. </p><p>RONIS:  -- millions of people in this country -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys, we're out of time. All right, we are here in  Chicago. A new wave of violence striking the city. When we come back, we  are going to talk to one of the best reporters on the ground, and you don't  want to miss that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yet another wave of violence rocking the city of Chicago  tonight. Just yesterday, eight people were shot and wounded in a period of  eight hours. And with each day that goes by, Chicago city officials led by  Rahm Emanuel seemed more and more powerless to stop it. This week, Gianno  Caldwell, a Fox News political analyst and Chicago native, went out to  speak with members of the worst hit communities and find out what is  driving the bloodshed. Watchg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NINI, CHICAGO RESIDENT:  In this neighborhood, everybody want to be better  than the next person. Everybody want to rock the better jeans. You know  what you got on, the better shoes. Everyone want to be the one on top. </p><p>So these boys looking at it, like, hey, let me see your (inaudible) and let  me do this and that. That's why there's a lot of violence. And I believe,  you get some of these boys into a job, put money in their pockets so they  can survive, take care of what they need to take care of, maybe it'll stop  some of this stuff. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining us now with more is Gianno Caldwell. Gianno, it's great  to see you tonight. You know, it was interesting what Ninin just said  there, and she said everyone wants to be on top, have what the other guy  has or better, I don't know if she was talking about house or car or shoes  or what. But -- </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Everything. All of the above.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- she said if they had a job maybe it would -- yes, maybe it  would be better. To get the job, you have to have the skills, you have to  have the educational background, a parent or role model who helps with the  education and the guidance. The problem is a lot of these kids don't have  any of that. And then the gangs walk in. </p><p>CADWELL:  Yes, Laura. I think what I really saw here this week, when doing  these interviews with a number of the high-ranking gang members throughout  the city of Chicago, is there is a deficit in personal responsibility. A  lot of parents that have left their homes who believe that their parents  maybe were too harsh on them as they were growing up, they allowed their  kids to run free. </p><p>And as a result, we see the bloodshed. We all did a study in 2015, which  said for every 100,000 residents in the city of Chicago, there is, on  average, one white person shot, 28 Hispanic shot, and a whopping 113  African-Americans shot in a city of 2.7 million people. This is beyond the  pale of what we should see in any American city. And I know, and I thank  you for your coverage on this, because you have done it from your heart,  this has not been political for you. </p><p>You see the same things that I see in a lot of the African-American  residents here in Chicago, which is no American city should be like this.  There should be no person in an American city that have to live through  this level of fear. </p><p>And what we are seeing and especially speaking to the gang bangers in the  city of Chicago, there is a lot of those folks feel that this was a life  that they were preconditioned for. This isn't something that they  necessarily chose, as one told me, this is the life that chose him. So this  is, I mean, is just unfortunate. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And Gianno, the need for investment or business to come in, as  we have talked about before, how do you solve this problem? Until the  streets are safe, we need more detectives, more police, more personal  responsibility, more role models, it is hard to get the business to come  in, even with tax incentives that Rahm Emanuel, as far as I know, hasn't  been willing to talk about. </p><p>But even with tax incentives, if you go in there in some Inglewood, some of  these other areas and worried about your safety, or your employee safety,  that is -- that is going to be a heavy lift. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It will be. But, you know, I was really happy to hear from an  individual who runs a program or an organization called ex-cons for  community and social change. His name is Tyrone Muhammad. He is actually an  ex-con. He went to jail I believe for about 30 years for murder. </p><p>He started a program when he got out of jail and he goes and gets more ex- cons and they go back into those communities in which they robbed and steal  from, the communities that they murdered and which led to bloodshed. </p><p>So, that was something that I thought was particularly encouraging because  they are talking to the youth. They're looking to put those individuals and  jobs.  And I was really happy to hear that because those are the stories  that we normally don't hear, those are stories that we normally don't see. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I actually -- Gianno, we actually have -- Gianno, we actually  have that part of your discussion with him. I think we are going to play it  now. Let's watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TYRONE MUHAMMAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECCSC:  Those guys involved with my  organization have served 20 years or more in prison. We are men who  recognize that we've made a mistake. We are not sitting around waiting on  something (inaudible) white person, the politicians, the legislation, to  change our condition. We know that we helped perpetrate some of the  violence in our community and we learned a long time ago why we was in  prison, that we would have to change it ourselves. </p><p>(END VIDE CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right Gianno, final thoughts real quick. </p><p>CALDWELL:  We need more of that in the city of Chicago. There needs to be  an expansion of personal responsibility because no one can rely on the  government to solve all of these problems. And that includes the violence  in Chicago. They are part of the solution but they are not the solution in  totality. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You need more police, you need more cops on the ground, you need  more detectives so they actually solve some of these crimes, and that is  where the mayor and city officials kick in. Gianno, thank you very much. </p><p>CALDWEL:  It's been a failure of leadership on the level of the city and as  well of the state, there's been a failure of leadership in Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, we've been trying to get Rahm Emanuel on this show and  other alderman and not much luck there. So, we'll keep trying. Gianno,  thanks so much. </p><p>Now with the discussion on this, we're going to talk to Horace Cooper of  Project 21, and of course, Leo Terrell is with us, radio talk show host.  Both of you, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you. I don't  think this is an issue that should be political. It should be solved. </p><p>This should be solved both from within the community, with police, safe  leaders, and business can partner, but if it is not going to come from  within and a real move from within the community, I don't know how we are  going to solve this. </p><p>But I can tell by talking to folks today, you need more police on the  ground. If you don't have more police on the ground, you will never get any  of the good stuff to happen. Leo? </p><p>LEO TERRELL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well Laura, I can tell from your  sincerity that you are very serious about this. But it's just not police,  respectfully. When I just saw the president on Fox talking about African- American unemployment rate is down, what about in the south and west sides  of Chicago? There is poverty in Chicago youth, from 18 to 24. Giovanni  didn't talk about the unemployment rate in Chicago. </p><p>You got to have jobs they are and what I submit to you, Laura, is that  there are no jobs there. There's just not on the local level. We have a  Republican governor and the blame goes all the way around. But let's focus  on the absence of jobs. I'll support your argument about police but please,  acknowledge that great -- make America great again does not apply to  African-American youth between the ages of 18 and 24 beyond the south and  west side of Chicago. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Leo, I think you are right about that. I mean, I'm not --</p><p>TERRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I think you're right about that the jobs aren't there. Trump  didn't create Chicago. So, I mean, you are a really good civil rights  attorney, a Democrat, and I get that, but to say or imply -- </p><p>TERRELL:  Can I point out one thing? </p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- to imply that Trump caused Chicago is absurd, and it will not  stand. Horace? </p><p>HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21:  Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  I mean, it starts before Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel has been  there since 2011, murder rates, ridiculous high. More than 2,000 people now  have been murdered in Chicago since he became mayor. Unacceptable.  Absolutely unacceptable. </p><p>COOPER:  Jobs -- jobs will never come to Chicago as long as it's Beirut on  Lake Michigan. Here's the truth. The truth is, it requires two basic  techniques. You  must increase the fear of apprehension on those who would  mug, rob, or rape grandma, the people who will not let Lucy go to school,  and they create an environment so Frank the father can't get a job. </p><p>You absolutely must start with creating apprehension -- excuse me, a risk  of apprehension, for those individuals. Once that risk is real, who do not  change, who will not conform, they must be removed. That means five, seven,  or 10-year sentences. When that happens, which we know it worked, it worked  in Richmond, it worked in New York City, it worked in Louisiana, in New  Orleans, it will work anywhere. When that happens, then we can talk about  jobs and personal responsibility. </p><p>TERRELL:  Hey, can I just say a little game called Jeopardy? How about  this? What do you got to lose? Give me a chance. OK, who made that  statement in 2016? The Democrats have always been in office --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lowest unemployment for African-American and how long?</p><p>TERRELL:  -- give me a chance. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TERRELL:  Remember that guy? </p><p>COOPER:  We have set five records for low unemployment in just the first 10  (ph) years. </p><p>TERRELL:  What about Chicago? We are talking about Chicago, Horace. We are  talking about Chicago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Guys, stop, stop, stop! Do you know that Democrats have been  running Chicago for I believe seven decades? Do you realize that? </p><p>TERRELL:  We have a Republican governor, Laura! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you realize there is not one -- there is not -- we are  talking about the city of Chicago. You, Leo, are very smart, you know just  like I do, the city is run by the city council and the mayor's office. It's  not run by Bruce Rauner, OK. </p><p>They do legislate legislation and allocation of funds, but the funds and  the local taxes in Chicago run the police and they assist in running the  schools. OK? So, lets' be honest. This is 70 years of Democratic  leadership, 70! </p><p>TERRELL:  Here's a good fellow (ph) response. Local governments don't  create jobs. You know, Laura, that the job creation starts up in -- </p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Why are we on this? </p><p>TERRELL:  There are no jobs! </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do you think, I mean honestly, if do you that Rahm Emanuel since  2011, has done a good job for the city of Chicago, because I can tell you,  most Democrats we talked to today in the streets, they want him gone. They  don't want him to return. They want a new person in. </p><p>TERRELL:  I'm not here to defend Rahm Emanuel. I'm not here -- I'm just  simply saying, you do acknowledge that jobs are critical. Horace simply  said lock everybody up. He doesn't have a job plan. </p><p>COOPER:  You will not create a thriving job market as long as grandma is  afraid to even go and get her prescriptions filled. </p><p>TERREL:  Talking points. </p><p>COOPER:  That Lucy can't go to school -- it's not a talking point. This is  a reality. </p><p>TERRELL:  It is, talking points. Pure tactic.</p><p>COOPER:  That Chicago papers profiled all of these victims that we are  ignoring. We don't have jets that fly in from Arizona to Washington, D.C. - -</p><p>TERRELL:  Talking points.</p><p>COOPER:  -- for all of the people who are dying in Chicago.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, you know what -- you know it's not a talking point. Leo, you  keep saying talking points.  You know what is not a talking point?  We  talked to a woman whose nephew's remains were burned and stored in a 55- gallon drum.  You know what his great crime was?  Walking home.  </p><p>TERRELL:  That's a horrible crime.  That's a horrible crime.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's what life is in some of these neighborhoods in Chicago.   Don't tell me it's a talking point.  That's someone's life, and it happens  way too often, predominately African-American.  And it's got to stop.  The  cauldron of death and Chicago, got to put an end to it.  It is ridiculous,  and Republicans and Democrats have got to come together.  And the people of  the city I think want to do something about it, but when you have failed  leadership, whether it's Republican or Democrat, it's got to be changed and  swept out of office.  </p><p>TERRELL:  I agree with you, Laura.  I agree with you.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Great segment.  We are out of time.  </p><p>COOPER:  A jobs program will not stop cutthroat --  </p><p>TERRELL:  We are done, Horace.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, guys, we're out of time.  We're going to be covering this  for months and months and months.  Thank you so much.</p><p>And joining us now with more -- excuse me.  We're going to take a break.   When we come back, we are going to talk about what Andrew Cuomo said,  believe it or not, about a ICE.  You thought the ICE protests were bad  before.  We might have protests on the other side after you hear what he  said.  Don't got away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats want to abolish  ICE.  Where did this come from?  By the way, did you have any idea what ICE  does?  These are people that go into a nest of MS-13.  They call nest.   That is what it is.  It's a nest.  These are evil people in there.  </p><p>I can't say \"animals\" anymore because Nancy Pelosi got very angry when I  called them animals.  I called them animals.  She went crazy.  I can't do  it.  </p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Nancy Pelosi gets a lot of boos, doesn't she?  That was  President Trump at Indiana earlier tonight.  And that situation, those  remarks, could well not stand in greater contrast of the rhetoric we are  hearing from Democrats.  Andrew Cuomo last night at his debate with Cynthia  Nixon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  New York state is the state that said we  will not cooperate with ICE.  They were a bunch of thugs.  He politicized  ICE.  they are a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, president of the  National Border Patrol union, and Esther Valdes, an immigration attorney.   Esther, good to see you.  Art, good to see you.  I'm going to have Art take  the first swing at the Cuomo comments.  I do not understand why the  Democrats keep going back to the well of maligning the great men and women  of the Immigration Customs Enforcement, but they must think it is going to  work somewhere, and maybe in New York.  Art?  </p><p>ART DEL CUETO:  They are doing it because they don't have anything else to  say.  When you lose the argument, you've got to bring a race.  That is  usually what these people have been doing.  It's amazing to hear someone  say something like that, and then call the ICE people thugs.  You are  saying you are not going to agree with law enforcement, but they are the  ones that are thugs?  It sounds like you're the thug.  </p><p>Every time I hear these guys go back and forth, I can't help but wonder  that they are competing and some kind of here, hold my beer, let's see how  stupid I can sound today contest.  It's just amazing.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, had his own  reaction to what Cuomo said last night.  Let's watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR:  What he is saying, his actions are  disgusting.  To call ICE agents thugs, think about it.  These are men and  women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and  daughters, that chose to enforce the laws of this country, strap a gun to  the hip every day, put a Kevlar vest on to go out to the community and  protect America, protect the communities.  He calls them thugs.  Actually,  ICE arrests thugs, MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Esther, ICE arrests thugs and the Democrats are calling ICE  thugs, your reaction?  </p><p>ESTHER VALDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  It is notable that Governor Cuomo is  not a border state governor.  Otherwise he would have firsthand knowledge  of what ICE officers actually do.  They are the frontline defenders, and  here in San Diego they are the first line of defense to disrupt drug  trafficking rings, child molestation rings, and people who exploit men and  women.  I invite Governor Cuomo to come down here and see what ICE agents  actually do.  </p><p>And by and large, I interact with them as an immigration attorney at least  once a week when I'm at the detention facilities.  Those men and women are  some of our finest, bravest law enforcement agents that we have.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I've got to remind everyone who the senators are who are in  favor of abolishing ICE, and this is just a list.  I'm sure it will grow,  but this is where we are right now.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, OK, New  York, she'll be running for president, 2020, Elizabeth Warren in  Massachusetts, she'll be running in 2020, Bernie Sanders, Vermont, he'll be  running a 2020, Mark Pocan in Wisconsin, nobody can even recognize him on  the street, Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, Earl Blumenauer from  Oregon, Nydia Velazquez, New York, goes on, Raul Grijalva, Mark DeSaulnier,  California, and that's just where we are right now.  Of course,  congressional candidates, Alexandria Cortez, Randy Bryce, so forth.  </p><p>Art, I don't know why, again, Democrats think that the men and women who  keep us safe, are breaking up a child sex trafficking rings, human  smuggling rings, of course narcotics operations funded by the cartels -- I  don't get it.  How is that going to appeal even to the inner city folks who  want a safe environment as well?  I'm presuming they want safer streets,  safer situations for their families.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  They should.  The thing is, they try to make this division, and  then they turn it around or they make it about race.  Listen, even when  I've come on your show, I see some of the comments that some of these  individuals say about myself.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, lovely.  </p><p>DEL CUETO:  As being Hispanic.  But I came to this country, my parents came  to this country legally.  There is a legal way to do it.  People can't  distinguish the difference between border patrol agents, between ICE  agents, between the immigration officers at our ports of entry.  They can't  distinguish the difference between a legal immigrant in an illegal  immigrant.  </p><p>It is just -- I don't know what their thought processes, but anything they  can do is they try to divide as much as possible so they appease a certain  group of people, and try to -- that's what it is.  It comes down to  division and race.  And the reality is, I've said it so many times, illegal  is not a race.  We are not out there separating families.  Whose to blame?   The families themselves.  An American citizen commits a crime with their  child in this country, what happens?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You get separated.</p><p>DEL CUETO:  You get separated, and you go through the court system.  What  is happening here is these people, they are such great parents that they  are turning over their children to drug smugglers, they are turning their  children over to people smugglers, they are abandoning them in the desert,  and we're the bad guys?  Come on.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  But it's our fault.  It's ICE's fault.  Guys, thank you so much.  </p><p>Charges of anti-conservative bias are roiling the big tech companies.   Kevin McCarthy has something to say about it.  Don't miss it, up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My administration is also  standing up for the free speech rights of all Americans.  Social media  giants, and I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate  political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results.  We will not  let large corporations silence conservative voices.  And it can.  It can go  the other way, too, some day.  We are not going to let them control what we  can and cannot see, read, and learn from.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  You heard President Trump.  He wants social media companies to  be held accountable for alleged anti-conservative bias.  Next week, Twitter  CEO Jack Dorsey will have his feet held to the fire when he testifies on  Capitol Hill.  And one of the individuals leading the charge on all of this  is House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who joins us now.  Congressman,  great to see you.  </p><p>This is what I have been told, congressman, time and time again by my  liberal friends, OK?  This is an algorithm.  This has nothing to do with  politics.  The algorithm was in place before Trump, and it's going to be in  place after Trump.  There is no political bias, it all relates to what  articles are popular and versus articles that are not as popular.  What is  your reaction to that?  </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  That's just not true.   Social media today is the modern-day town hall.  Sixty-seven percent of  adults get their news from somewhere on social media.  But let's just play  that out.  You see Prager University that puts out conservative videos, but  one happened to be about Israel with Alan Dershowitz, one happened to be  about baseball with George Will.  You know what?  Facebook wouldn't show  those because they said YouTube rated them similar to pornography.  </p><p>Then we found out recently that they said it was a couple of Facebook  employees.  Take, for instance, I follow your tweets.  You put something  out about Sweden last week in regards to conservatives gaming based upon  their immigration policy.  That algorithm, written by a human, said that  was sensitive, so certain people on Twitter could not see that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Swedish election is sensitive.  OK.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's sensitive.  So that is just an algorithm?  But if you  Google the California Republican Party right before the primary, they said  our ideology was Nazism, and they blame that on Wikipedia.  </p><p>But after we have raised this issue -- and I've had many conversations with  the president about it, that we have to stop this bias, look what happened  in Facebook just this week.  Their own employees, those conservatives who  have been intimidated based upon their own personal philosophy, put a group  together and rose up because they feel that has been going on as well.  You  look at what they did to Palmer Luckey and others.  Palmer is a brilliant  kid who invented Oculus, who Facebook actually purchased.  But when they  found out he had given money, his own personal money based upon who he  wanted to see become president, they wanted to push him out.  This is what  is happening in social media, they think it is just algorithms.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Congressman, let's get to solutions here.  A lot of pals are  working in antitrust and expert on antitrust issues, some kind of difficult  antitrust theories floating out there.  But there is another interesting  idea beyond antitrust, which is to consider Facebook and Twitter and so  forth like a public utility, and thus they could be regulated like a public  utility.  \"Vanity Fair\" had a headline about Bannon saying, Steve Bannon  wants to nationalize Facebook and Google's data.  The cofounder of  Cambridge Analytica says big data should be placed in a public trust.  That  is going to your point that this really is the town square, and even though  it is a private company, it dominates speech, dominates advertising, we're  talking about Facebook especially, so we have to treat a different way.  Is  that something Congress is going to look at in consultation with the  executive branch?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I think Congress is going to look at everything from the  perspective of how powerful they have become.  I have spoken to Jack Dorsey  throughout the month, because the beginning of August, I sent a letter  requesting for him to come to Energy and Commerce.  And I want to give him  credit, he is showing up September 5th, and he and I philosophically  disagree, but we do we worry on one thing.  We believe in the First  Amendment.  But we also believe in transparency and accountability.  He is  coming forward.  I think the other companies CEOs need to go forward as  well, because the stories that they are telling and blaming other people,  and it's just an algorithm, is proving not to be true.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Google CEO said, no, I understand, but they are happy to  work with China on setting up the censorship tools that the communists in  China want instituted in Google.  They don't have any problem with that.  </p><p>I have to get your thoughts on today's funeral ceremonies for John McCain,  impassioned speeches, we had Vice President Biden speak, many others.  Your  thoughts?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I was there.  And I thought the very best speaker was a  very first speaker.  He was the first chief of staff to then congressman  John McCain.  And he told the story that John McCain told when he was a  POW, about a guard coming in, it's Christmas time, kind of loosening up the  ropes that had his arms time behind his back.  And right before he was  going off his time, he tied those ropes back.  He never seen this guard  before but he sees him out in the yard.  The guard walks up, doesn't say  anything to him, but with his foot in the gravel, he makes a cross, saying  about faith.  </p><p>And when you think of John McCain and what he went through, and every time  I watched put a jacket on, the difficulty, I had great respect for this  man.  I worked with him many times.  I had a difference of opinion, but I  thought that summed it up with a much more personal story, it was the  strongest story of the day.  It was a beautiful celebration of his life.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I would agree with you, an amazing tribute.  And I'm going to  ignore some of the not so thinly veiled hits on President Trump by some of  the people who participated, but I agree with you.  Just that image of  Senator McCain, and may he rest in peace.  Congressman McCarthy, thank you  so much for joining us tonight.  And we are going to be watching that  hearing with Dorsey next week.  </p><p>The Justice Department, by the way, is firing a major shot at Harvard  University and affirmative action.  Details ahead.  You do not want to miss  this segment with Michelle Malkin.  Don't go away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Harvard in the hot seat.  What happens when Harvard University  capped the number of Asian students who could be admitted?  Well, that  didn't go down so well.  Michelle Malkin joining us, and of course from  CRTV, and Cathy Areu, the publisher of \"Catalina Magazine.\" Also we have  news from Betsy DeVos at the Education Department involving Title IX and  sexual harassment on college campuses.  </p><p>But let's start with this Harvard story.  Michelle, you have been all over  this issue of affirmative action for years.  And now, we are at the point  where we are penalizing Asian students, and thankfully the U.S. Department  of Justice stepped in on behalf of fairness and merit on behalf of these  Asian students.  Tell us what you know.  </p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Yes, this blatant racial  discrimination in the name of so-called social justice has punished high  achieving Asian-American students for a long time.  It's been obvious since  the late 1980s and 1990s when I was in college.  </p><p>And finally, we have the Trump Justice Department fighting with equality of  opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.  And what I love most about  what is happening, Laura, is Harvard is squirming under the microscope and  the bright, glaring sunlight of discovery.  For the longest time they had  kept their racially conscious and race unneutral policies under wraps, and  now it's being exposed.  </p><p>And what is happening is, you have a lot of liberal Asian-Americans who are  finally, finally having second thoughts about the social engineering that  has punished them at the expense of equality of opportunity.  And look, it  makes absolutely no sense to punish the children of legal immigrants from  all over Asia as some sort of social justice recompense to black students.   The reparations foundation of affirmative action here has been totally  blown up.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's go to Cathy.  Really short segment here.  Cathy, if it's  just a merit based analysis on admissions, the study from the Center for  Equal Opportunity shows that Asian-Americans would have 43 percent of the  admissions, Hispanics, two percent, African-Americans, on merit according  to the Center for Equal Opportunity, just one percent.  </p><p>CATHY AREU, \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE:  Right.  And what is merit?  Is merit  meaning SATs, is it meaning test scores?  So we are trying to say, this  against affirmative action.  And what's happening is that Harvard actually  has a system where there school population is diverse.  So the Trump  administration is trying to take away diversity at our institutions like  Harvard.  Harvard is fighting for diversity so that our student body can  look like our demographics in our country.  And there is nothing wrong with  that.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Let's move on really quickly.  No time here.  But Betsy DeVos  and Title IX.  Michelle, now it looks like men or anyone accused of sexual  harassment will have a few more rights aft UVA and of course some of the  other cases like Duke and so forth.  </p><p>MALKIN:  You think that civil libertarians would be cheering the fact that  we have administration that is restoring the rights of the accused and  restoring due process that has been sabotaged, particularly under the Obama  administration, by radicals who don't think that accused men should have  the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers, that men who are  accused should have legal representation, that men who are accused should  be allowed to have access to exculpatory evidence, and that is what DeVos  is restoring.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Cathy, I owe you one because we're out of time.  When we come  back, final thoughts from Chicago.  Busy news night.  Stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Tomorrow night, we'll be back here in Chicago, and we will be  following up on our reporting on some of the other media sources out there.   We told you this week about CNN and a little loosey-goosey they were  playing with their source Lanny Davis.  Who is lying more?  And tomorrow,  what NBC reportedly did to put the kibosh on that Harvey Weinstein  reporting by Ronan Farrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

So, we're going to be working on that today and a little bit tomorrow, and probably into the next couple of weeks, but I think we'll have a very, very substantial trade deal.</p><p>It'll be a very fair deal, and I think that this is something that your folks want to do and my folks want to do and we want to do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Momentarily, President Trump will be leaving 10 Downing Street for a separate meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. Benjamin Hall is in London this morning. He's got the very latest, Benjamin, good morning to you.</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. And, you know, if yesterday was really about the pomp and the pageantry, well today, there's so much about the politics and the protests.</p><p>We are in Trafalgar Square right now, and the people who've arranged this protests hoped to see 250,000 people descend on London, move down towards Downing Street where British Prime Minister will meet with President Trump, hoping to disrupt that.</p><p>But it's not only the people who are protesting, it's also the politicians. And we saw Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday, protesting, boycotting the bank that President Trump attended. And then we are planning -- we hope to see him here. If you can imagine, he will come towards 10 Downing Street and speak out against Trump's visit while he is in that meeting with Theresa May.</p><p>And, in fact, the Labour leader yesterday, tweeted this. He said that tomorrow's protest, today, against the state visit. This is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those that the President has attacked in America, around the world, and in our own country.</p><p>But after what was a perfectly executed day yesterday, in which there were hardly any protests, well there's been widespread praise of the President and the visit from within the British government, and frankly, disdain from some of the politicians who boycotted the banquet.</p><p>The foreign secretary saying, he thought the people had to put this aside, that on a special occasion, to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day, and now is the time to think about the special relationship and the bigger things, and so that's what we are hearing from the government, the oppositions (INAUDIBLE) very different.</p><p>And here in Trafalgar Square, we're seeing the crowds really start to grow. A number of different people out, campaigning for different causes. We've seen climate change, we've seen the LGBTQ community, a lot of socialist worker parties, and these protesters being (INAUDIBLE) across London.</p><p>But President Trump is sticking to the plan. He is here for the bilateral today and talking, just as you heard, about big trade deals in the future. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Benjamin, thank you, Benjamin Hall in London, this morning. Tune in today at 8:45 Eastern this morning. FOX Business is taking you to the President's joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. We will take you there live, this morning. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got it right here.</p><p>Meanwhile, we want to take a look at Silicon Valley this morning, under the microscope, once again. The biggest names in technology slammed on Wall Street yesterday, amid a new regulatory threat, Congress, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, all set in their sights on the industry's largest companies.</p><p>Joining me right now is Antitrust Attorney, Andrei Barlow, along with Brett Larson, morning anchor on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\". Great to see you both, thank you so much for joining us. And Andre, I want to kick it off with you, your thoughts on what's taking place right now? We see the Department of Justice readying an antitrust suit against Google.</p><p>ANDRE BARLOW, ANTITRUST ATTORNEY: Well, you know, I think it's premature to talk about lawsuits, you know, what we are really dealing with is we have some leaks here of potential investigations, right? The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are the two agencies that work on antitrust investigations and they split the work between them.</p><p>And they've come up with an agreement that the Department of Justice will investigate Google and Apple, and the FTC will investigate Amazon and Facebook, going forward. Now, these are just preliminary talks in terms of splitting up the work here.</p><p>And what we're really talking about is potential investigations. These investigations take a really long time, so nothing is going to happen immediately and it's too early to talk about lawsuits when what we are dealing with is a lot of speculation. We don't know exactly what the Department of Justice is going to examine with respect to Google, and or the FTC with Facebook or Amazon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BARLOW: So, these are just preliminary, you know, decisions to divvy up the work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, at this point, the Department of Justice is preparing on antitrust suit against Google. The Wall Street Journal has been reporting that, Brett, and we know that, right now, Google is basically the dominant player within its business. It also --</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All search goes through Google, 95 percent of search requests go through Google. I mean, obviously, there's a dominant --</p><p>LARSON: You've got a clear face there, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- antitrust suit may very well target.</p><p>LARSON: And it's not just the search that goes through Google. It's also a lot of ad revenue that goes through Google, so they are a dominant player, in terms of reaching eyeballs. And, you know, I've read -- a lot of what we've read, you know, everybody talks about Ma Bell, we all remember the Bell System and how the government stepped in to break that up.</p><p>It's similar but it's very different in terms of communication. We're also -- when you talk about Facebook and you look at the social media giant, I mean, this is the way that people are communicating with each other. Facebook isn't responsible for multi -- several billion eyeballs, every day, in terms of just sharing everything from photos to messages, to advertising, to videos, so everything.</p><p>It's all happening in this one place. And we've seen where with their dominance, they're able to affect the conversation. If you imagine, 90 percent of search goes through Google, it's not -- it's not -- or more than 90 percent, it's not out of the realm to say well, Google could put their finger on the scale and say, we want to conversation to go this way. We want the conversation to go that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is it -- is it more about the dominant position these companies are in, or is it more about the privacy breaches that we've seen? I mean, the FTC has already spent more than a year, investigating Facebook around issues related to how it handles users' data.</p><p>LARSON: Right. And Facebook is not doing themselves any favors. Facebook seems to, you know, move fast and break things and then come back and apologize for it. So they haven't really set the standard of, well, we're going to play within the boundaries of the law, to make sure that we are doing everything correctly.</p><p>And it seems as though they're almost daring the government to step in and say, OK, we have to come in here and figure out what's going on, put a set of rules in place, and you have to abide by these sets of rules. Same could be said for Google, there's really no -- there's no regulation, there's no law, there's no rule that oversees their business practices.</p><p>And in many instances, because we don't really understand what it is they do. Those algorithms are like the secret sauce for Coca-Cola or KFC.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's right. They don't want to call themselves media companies for just that reason.</p><p>LARSON: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because they would be regulated differently, Andre. Can these companies defend themselves or are we going to see actual break-ups here, because this is one thing that many people on both sides of the aisle agree with. That these companies have become too powerful.</p><p>BARLOW: Correct. There is bipartisan support to investigate. Look, the government's job is to investigate, to bring enforcement actions, and to remedy anti-competitive behavior. So, the question would be, well, what would the remedy be here?</p><p>You know, these companies also, you know -- consumers drive a lot of benefit from all of these companies. You know, we are talking about these double-sided digital platforms where, you know, consumers are receiving, you know, free apps.</p><p>You know, there's the innovation and the launch of new products that all consumers are benefiting from, and at the same time, what the government has to balance is what type of exclusionary conduct is going on that harms other rivals from competing.</p><p>LARSON: Right.</p><p>BARLOW: And that's the question. If there is that type of conduct going on, then there needs to be a remedy for that. But those remedies are usually handled what we would call behavioral-type remedies.</p><p>You know, prohibitions or restrictions on their conduct, going forward, instead of a full break-up. It's very difficult for the government or a court to implement a break-up when you don't quite understand the industry to begin with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARLOW: What they can figure out is what type of activity they are engaging in, and is that activity really harming consumers, right? Although they provide a lot of benefit consumers, is that -- is that harm to consumers through some of this exclusionary conduct. But, remember, we don't know if there really is exclusionary conduct, we know that there are some complaints from rivals.</p><p>LARSON: Yes, I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Final word.</p><p>LARSON: You bring up a good point. It's hard to regulate a company that gives away their products for free, and in so doing, are they keeping other people out of the business. No one is going to step in and say we're going to be the next best search engine because --</p><p>BARTIROMO: A number of people in Congress will also say to you that they have been censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's another thing that certainly, folks like Kevin McCarthy, the GOP leader, are looking at. Thank you, Andre Barlow and Brett Larson. Good to see you both, gentlemen, thank you. You can catch Brett on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" on SiriusXM Radio 115.</p><p>Apple, unveiling new privacy features, meanwhile, at its annual Developers Conference, Cheryl Casone on that angle right now, in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Well, Apple has introduced an anonymous log-in option and tools that block apps from tracking your location. Company is trying to stand out from Google and Facebook which track their users.</p><p>But Apple, along with Google, Facebook, and Amazon, reportedly all going to face potential antitrust investigations, shares of all four companies closing sharply lower yesterday, a lot of market capital raised. Apple shares in the premarket, we don't have those up, we'll get those up in just a moment for you.</p><p>OK, Instagram users experiencing issues starting late last night, with many in the U.S. and other countries, including Japan and India, saying they were not able to access their feed or dash board or post photos of their lunch. The problems coming a day after Gmail, Snapchat, YouTube, and other social media accounts faced outages.</p><p>Well, President Trump expected to sign long delayed disaster aid legislation, after months of in-fighting. The House overwhelmingly approving the $19 billion-dollar measure which provides money for relief efforts across the country.</p><p>Among the funds, more than $3 billion will go towards repairing and rebuilding damaged military facilities. Another $3 billion headed to farmers whose crops were destroyed by storms and flooding. And those are your headlines, Maria, back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. Quick break right here, and then, day two of President Trump's visit to the U.K. This hour, a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, ahead of a joint press conference in the 8:00 hour. FOX Business is taking you there, live, stay with us for that.</p><p>And then the crisis at the border, agents respond to an officer, involved shooting, as a judge hands the Trump administration, a victory, over wall funding, all that, right after this, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news right now, President Trump arriving at 10 Downing Street, he is set to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May. As you see, they are there now, posing for pictures, just arriving.</p><p>We will have a press conference coming up live, in the 8:00 a.m. hour, and we will take you there live, when the President and the Prime Minister address reporters. We will bring you back there.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning, as we continue to follow the live happenings in London, my exclusive interview coming up, with the CEO of Wal-Mart, Doug McMillon is here this morning, in the studio.</p><p>Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee Member, Sean Duffy, joining us this morning, along with California Congressman and House Armed Services Committee Member, John Garamendi.</p><p>Hold Texas, Hold the Nation Author and Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, Allen West, is here, along with my exclusive interview with Duff &amp; Phelps CEO, Noah Gottdiener, joining us, as well, big three hours ahead. Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>But first, crisis at the border, a federal judge handing the Trump administration a victory, rejecting a lawsuit from the House, challenging border wall funding, the judge ruling Congress, lacks the authority to sue in this case. Meanwhile, lanes are back open at the San Ysidro border crossing in San Diego, after customs and border patrol agents were involved in a shooting last night.</p><p>A driver attempting to enter the U.S., failed to stop for an inspection, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, as always, Global Economics Editor for the Wall Street Journal, Jon Hilsenrath, and FOX News Contributor, Columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek, great to see you this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lots to talk about this morning. Good morning to you. Jon, let's kick it off with your front-page story in the Journal this morning. Economy hits milestone as threats take shape,</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, those threats, having a lot to do with trade.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right. So, this month, June 2019, the economy hits the 10- year mark of its expansion. We've never had an economic expansion go beyond 10 years. And one of the things that really stood out to me in reporting the story was, I looked at what happened in other countries and long expansions that go beyond 10 years, even though the United States has never had one, are actually pretty common.</p><p>Australia, right now, is in its 28th year of expansion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, 28 years.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The U.K., Canada, many other countries, went from 15 years or more, in the 1990s and 2008, so it's possible to keep this thing going. It doesn't have to end just because we reach the 10-year mark. Trade is the obvious big concern on everybody's minds. Are we going to drive ourselves into recession in the trade war?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: Trade and possible regulation. I mean, who would have thought that this administration would go after all these tech companies on antitrust grounds or other regulatory issues, that has been the leading group in the market and I think just sentiment wise, that's kind of got people rattled, you know.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And who ever thought that President Trump would be on the same side with as Jerry Nadler on, you know, oversight of the big tech companies.</p><p>PEEK: And Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Exactly.</p><p>PEEK: -- break them up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz want to break them up.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, but people didn't listen to President Trump on the campaign trail, than when he was running for the presidency, again, his stance on trade.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial page writing over the weekend, about his protectionist leanings and how (INAUDIBLE) been, kind of, saved from that, somewhat, in the trade fights with the tariffs on the Mexican imports, basically, as a target on immigration, is that protection -- kind of protectionist move by the President, they're concerned about that.</p><p>But, again, he is a populist, he is not really a conservative, and he was very much that way when he was running for the presidency.</p><p>HILSENRATH: No, I think that we have seen two sides of Trump's economic views during his presidency, the first couple of years were all about tax cuts and deregulation, the markets loved that. They took off and the economy did really well. The other side of it now is this protectionist mindset.</p><p>He has goals in mind and a lot of people agree with him that the Chinese have to be challenged about their trade practices, but it's not -- it's not easy going as it is with tax cuts and deregulation, there's a price to pay for that, in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's anybody's guess, though, if the tariffs actually stick for Mexico. I mean, Mexico, there's a little window of opportunity here before the 10th, Mexico reportedly exploring possible retaliation to the U.S. tariff threat, but is still hoping for a solution.</p><p>President Trump has proposed a five percent tariff starting next week over immigration, but even Kevin McCarthy, GOP leader, on Sunday, said to me, let's see what happens this upcoming week when Secretary Pompeo meets with his counterpart, in Washington.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're creating a level of economic uncertainty with business. That is when business spending is slowing, when profits are in a recession, according to the GDP data, fourth quarter and the first quarter. You have factory activity slowing to the lowest levels since 2016, even before the election.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You create a level of I don't know what this President is going to do, in terms of trade, so much cross border. A supply chain work between the U.S. and Mexico, you have businesses that will sit back and say, I'm going to wait to invest and hire until after the election.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: -- created this uncertainty, so there wasn't any business investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He uses tariffs as leverage, now he's using the tariffs as leverage over the border wall. We've got more to say on this. Coming up, the President Trump arrived at 10 Downing Street for a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, more on that when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Day two of President Trump's visit to U.K. this morning, the President and the First Lady now inside the British Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. President Trump and Theresa May will hold a bilateral meeting and then they'll hold a press conference later this morning, which we are taking you there, live.</p><p>Joining me right now is the White House Reporter for the Washington Examiner, Rob Crilly, Rob, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ROB CRILLY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President talked a bit about the potential for a trade deal with the U.K., what's your take away, so far, from the President's meeting in the U.K.?</p><p>CRILLY: Well, I think the take away, so far, is how much he's enjoying it. We saw all the pomp and ceremony of a full state visit yesterday, the state banquet, and Mr. Trump looked relaxed, like he was really in his element. We saw a different side of his character.</p><p>It was a really nicely written up by the London Times, saying he'd turned from a swaggering president into a school boy. He looked like he was on best behavior, minding his manners. Now, everything switches today.</p><p>We're pivoting from the politics -- sorry, from the pomp, to the politics. So now, we're going to get into the nitty-gritty. We're going to start hearing about a trade deal. We'll probably be hearing a little bit about Huawei, the Chinese Telecommunications company, so now, we really get down to business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Everybody's take, Liz?</p><p>PEEK: Yes, I think -- look, I think there's a lot of work to be accomplished today. It could be a very good day for Theresa May and for Donald Trump, I mean, the British Brexit situation is a compete mess, if they go barreling out of the E.U., which seemed more increasingly likely.</p><p>They need the United States to step in and say, yes, we want to do a deal, so let's see what happens, but I think it could be very positive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How has the reception to the President been, in London, Rob, because the last time he went there, it was pretty chilly, but today, it looks different?</p><p>CRILLY: I think it's very different, I mean, first of all, the main protests are expected to be getting underway in about the next half an hour to an hour, so things could change. But, I think the overall feeling, is if London is just getting on with their business.</p><p>There is a sense here that Donald Trump is not popular, but as we were just talking about, both sides need each other right now. Britain's in a terrible mess over Brexit. It needs to start striking some deals and it needs friends in the world.</p><p>And, I think, although, Donald Trump's personal popularity ratings are fairly modest, shall we say, in London, people here are actually in favor of this state visit, because they know we need to get some of these trade deals done.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, wrote that really quite frankly, mean, editorial about President Trump, the equivalent of a 3-year- old child at barbecue, eating rocks for attention, and he certainly got it.</p><p>And then the mayor of New York City had to pile on, and that's more embarrassing than anything for both the mayor of London and the United States, but to that point, can the people who don't like President Trump, whether it's a protest or the mayor of London, remember, this visit is about the 75th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion which is on Thursday.</p><p>And it's about, basically, the combined -- the unity and the combined strength and the long-standing relationship between the United States and Britain that basically saved the world from Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler.</p><p>I don't -- and all the people who sacrificed their lives, storming the beaches of France, that day, 75 years ago, I don't know why that people keep losing sight of that, certainly, the Queen didn't.</p><p>CRILLY: I think, I mean, actually, there was something interesting happened in the state banquet last night and there were two toasts. Both the Queen and President Trump spoke about D-Day and the Second World War. It's interesting they highlighted different facts.</p><p>President Trump spoke very much about Britain standing alone through the wall, through the blitz, standing up to Nazism by itself. The Queen, in contrast, talked about how nations have come together to fight off the Nazis and how that had laid the framework for the post war common wealth of nations coming together, if you like.</p><p>So, they both emphasize different lessons to take away. But yes, this is very clever scheduling. This is all about the pomp of the state visit, the commemorations of the 75th Anniversary of D-Day, which I think has taken some of the -- apart from what we talked about with the mayor of London, I think it's taken a little bit of the heat out of the situation, very cleverly done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And remember, Americans know, and I made a joke about it yesterday, but we watched the Crown on Netflix, and it might seem silly, but it is a stark reminder of who the Queen is, and what she has lived through, and living through the blitz, staying with her family, in London, during the bombings and her dedication to service and duty and I think that's on display.</p><p>PEEK: It's also interesting that they are talking about the special relationship, those words apparently never came out of Obama's mouth. He never actually had a great affection for the U.K., so according to some people who were in that administration, in the U.K., this is a very welcome change in tone.</p><p>And so, yes, President Trump may not be personally terribly popular, I think America's, sort of, renewal of that special relationship is extremely popular.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Speaking of symbolism, he sent back that statute of Churchill.</p><p>PEEK: At least that was -- yes, that was something that was debated on and off, but yes, that was not taken well by the Brits, for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For sure. All right, Rob, thank you, great insights from you, Rob Crilly joining us there. Tune in today at 8:45 a.m. Eastern, FOX is going to take you live to the President's joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, that would be live at 8:45 this morning, right here, so join us for that.</p><p>First, the regulation, threat, to technology. A closer look at the impact on investors, take a look at the stocks yesterday getting creamed, as you see Facebook down 7-1/2 percent.</p><p>And then, we are just shy of record. James Holzhauer loses after 32 straight Jeopardy wins. Then he tweeted about -- actually, the one holding the record. What happened last night, when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back to Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, June 4th.

There was 1-2/3 percent. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, lost nearly a $140 billion in value yesterday alone.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at markets there which are bouncing along with the US this morning. FT-100 up 15 points, quarter of a percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 10 points, and the DAX index in Germany, higher by a 106, that's almost one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, read across the board.

A bit of a tech wreck yesterday. Take a look at technology stocks taking a nosedive over fears that the industry could face regulatory scrutiny relating to antitrust laws.</p><p>Lawmakers have been investigating Google and Facebook, Amazon and Apple could reportedly be next. Joining us right now is Tengler Wealth Management Chief Investment Strategist Nancy Tengler. Nancy, good to see you.</p><p>NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, TENGLER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you approach these names knowing that this is where the growth has been in terms of sectors?</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, with trepidation -- I mean, those of us who lived through Microsoft, and the antitrust situation are cautious. We had written in the fourth quarter of 28 -- 2017, sorry that we thought the group was going to come under pressure. That they were to this administration like oil was to the Obama administration.</p><p>So, we trimmed back, but being a portfolio manager is like being a perpetual state of dissatisfaction, we didn't term enough. So, we're watching and if we think that this is going to be more bluster than substance, then we might actually step back in and round out our position.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does it surprise you guys that the Republicans are actually looking at the tech sector and suggesting we could see further regulation?</p><p>TENGLER: Except, Nancy put her finger on it, which is that this administration is no great fan of the tech sector, which, by the way, help Obama get elected in 2008 and 2012. He had a very close relationship, so, even as issues arose with the tech sector, that administration was not likely to do much about it. I mean, you know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But here is the very different story, yes.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think there's also a perception among Republicans that they aren't treated fairly on platforms like Twitter, Google, and Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So, I think that kind of adds the incentive on their front to crack down on some of these -- some of this.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They said --</p><p>HILSENRATH: It is not surprising that Google and Facebook right now are the two that seem to be getting the most attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they say that they're censoring conservative speech.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes. And I think to the governance bothers me more than the regulatory issues. I mean, I think the fact that you have these super- voting shares with the CEO. There is no accountability to shareholders.</p><p>So, as a shareholder, that's really what drives our decision to not be overweight those two stocks in particular. Because we have no we have no say.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Nancy, what's going to lead the market now if tech is under the scrutiny of Washington, and there isn't any momentum. What sector leads the market if it's going to keep going up, or --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just made a face when you asked that. I was just current like that when you were asking that so -- that's why. Just because again because -- Again, because, so many sectors are very trade sensitive and with a lot of the trade negotiators not wrapping up still up in the air --</p><p>HILSENRATH: I didn't mean it in a leaning way, but it might be the case that there isn't a sector to lead.</p><p>TENGLER: Well, I mean, look, if I told you I knew, I would be lying, but I do think from a valuation standpoint, health care which had been in the crosshairs is now looking attractive again. And so, we moved to an overweight in that group.</p><p>A little bit bold, but I do think that the drug pricing threats are probably not going to be as onerous as expected, and will not hurt the big cap pharma and biotech companies, is not.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Is it possible financials take a leave?</p><p>TENGLER: Maybe.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You know, we were talking beforehand that you know, maybe the Fed is going to be cutting interest rates over the next few months. If not if they're June meeting, then, maybe the September meeting is the financial sector. And, you know, and they've got deregulation at their -- at their back now.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, when did they're back. Agreed. Although we've -- that's been the longest wrong call on Wall Street. You know, people have been talking about that group outperforming for three years. So, we've added to consumer discretionary. Some taking the closer look at energy because it's been so beat up. But it's a difficult game right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because of the broader issues of trade and tariffs.</p><p>TENGLER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, there's really very few places to hide in environment. The president could face backlash from GOP members of Congress now who oppose, threatened tariffs on Mexico. Mexico is warning of retaliation, and then, breaking this morning, the Chinese government is charging Chinese citizens in the United States have been subject to interrogation and harassment by law enforcement. This is what the Chinese government is saying that fight is getting worse.</p><p>Now, we do have a little window of opportunity here for Mexico. Maybe they come up with something where Mexico does something substantial at the border to hold off the dogs in terms of the president putting this tariffs in place. But the Chinese fight is only getting worse.</p><p>TENGLER: Well, and yes, exactly. And all of us got it wrong. I was in Washington right before trade talks broke down. Meeting with all policymakers and they were all universal and saying, \"We're going to get this deal done.</p><p>But also, going after India at this particular time and taking away their developing nation's benefit, I just think there's too many fronts where people are starting to think, OK, wait a minute, this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do you want to get out of the way not put any money to work and stocks right here while this is all settling out or do you want to own equities?</p><p>TENGLER: For the law, I invest my client's portfolios for next three to five years. So, this is an opportunity, I think to pick away at some of the stocks that we wouldn't have access to because they were too expensive.</p><p>So, it's always a turning point to want to run in the other direction. But the right thing to do is to really just dig in and look at quality and dividends. Because with lower rates, dividend stocks are much more attractive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And John, you wrote this morning in the Wall Street Journal cover's page story about the risks to the economy right now.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You mentioned trade. You also mentioned interest rates and a mistake from the Fed.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right, and the market is signaling right now that the fed might have made a mistake. You know, I wanted to ask leniency about the treasury market, investors are piling at the 10-year treasury notes right now, in part, because they're not seeing opportunities and stocks. And what the market is signaling in the process is with long-term interest rates lower than the Fed's target interest rate that the fed might have interest rates too high. They might have to cut rates to make sure that this expansion doesn't run into a wall.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. That inversion keeps widening and wind again yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, why is this been since April of 2007? So, again, that's been lasting, at least, for a week now.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, I mean, certainly, those of us that look at the underlying economic numbers would say the rest of the world is contracting, the U.S. is still somewhat expansionary in metrics.</p><p>But, I am worried about the inversion, and I'm worried about the fact that there is -- there doesn't seem to be leadership coming out of the fed. We will see today. We will see what they say if they are listening event.</p><p>But I'm -- I find it ironic, by the way, that we're here when three months ago, you know, the president and Steve Moore, for example, were getting castigated for calling for a lower rate. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and now it's sort of beginning to get the bait in. That we're going to see well.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at the inversion whether or not that leads to recession is anybody's guess. But still, we are looking at the possibility that the fed lowers rate this year.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then -- and then Steve Moore.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: And markets are expecting that now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then, Steve Moore, said Friday, he had no idea why the president would use tariffs on Mexico to deal immigration when it has nothing to do with trade.</p><p>TENGLER: Right. Yes.</p><p>PEEK: I think he's just frustrated, you know because Congress won't act, and this is what he can do. But if we (INAUDIBLE) the space next year, I totally agree.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: I was going to say, he needs to look out because we know, we're getting into election season.</p><p>PEEK: No question.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And a lot of the fiscal stimulus that really help the economy could be weighing in.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Yes, they know, no question.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Economists are saying we might have growth of less than two percent in the second quarter. Of course, they said that in the first quarter and they were wrong, but -- you know, if this economy slows down and the market loses its momentum --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: And it is slowing down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wonder if this move is partly to shake-up Washington a bit. I mean, USMCA is sitting there. Nancy Pelosi is refusing to bring it to the floor for a vote. A lot of people say that if she were to bring it to the floor to a vote, it would pass.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's sitting on it. Is this President Trump's way to shake it up so much that all of the sudden, the Democrats say, \"Wait, don't tariff Mexico. Let's get USMCA across.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think his -- His whole presidency is about shaking of Washington. That's like -- clearly, clearly the case --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And no, but it also shakes up Mexico, and Mexico still has to ratify the dog on the thing. And it violates the world trade organization as well. So, what are you doing?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they are in Washington this week. We will see what happens with those meetings. Secretary Pompeo and his counterpart from Mexico. Nancy, it's good to see you.</p><p>TENGLER: You, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Nancy Tengler there. Plus, rap's first billionaire. Jay-Z's new milestone. Plus, tennis champs Serena Williams' financial feeds as well. All that coming up when we come right back after this. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The IRS is auditing Uber. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, certainly affecting the stock in the premarket, Maria. Right now, here's the breaking news, Uber say that the IRS is examining federal income tax records for 2013, 2014. The stock had been up earlier in the premarket, now it's down one percent. They also say that state and foreign tax authorities are looking at its records. It expects tax benefits to be reduced within the next 12 months by at least $141 million. Again, shares of Uber down more than one percent on the premarket on this news.</p><p>Also, this Carnival Cruise agreeing to pay $20 million penalty to settle a pollution violations case. Federal prosecutors say, the world's largest cruise line continue to pollute the oceans, despite a previous conviction on similar charges. Carnival CEO Arnold Donald admitting the company's responsibility for probation violations. Meanwhile, Carnival adding new feature to its app. This will allow its users to order beer, soda, water, have it delivered to any spot on the ship. Carnival has been running a pizza anywhere service since last year; now you get your beer with your pizza on Carnival.</p><p>And Wal-Mart is trying to attract more workers extending its college benefits, retailers says it's going to offer free SAT prep course for its workers that are still in high school and free college classes for its older students. This comes as Wal-Mart and other companies are seeking to recruit higher-quality, entry-level employees in a very tight labor market. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMalin joining Maria for an exclusive interview 8:20 a.m. Eastern Time this morning. And a \"Jeopardy!\" champion dethroned after 32 straight wins.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY: Emma, it's up to you. If you came up with correct response, you're going to be the new \"Jeopardy!\" champion. Did you, you did, what did you wager? Oh, gosh, 20,000, what a payday. 46,801. What a game, oh, my gosh. We're going to say goodbye to James. We'll be seeing him again, folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: James Holzhauer taken down by librarian Emma Boettcher. Holzhauer ended the streak to $60,000 short, Maria, of the record that was held by Ken Jennings, that was it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow! Well, he had some run.</p><p>CASONE: He did. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was. Congratulations to him. Cheryl, thank you. You want to say something?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Alex Trebek is fighting that cancer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, he is. And he looks good. He looks good.</p><p>PEEK: He looks good, right? Energetic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break, and then Jay-Z and Serena Williams making history. Taking a look at Forbes latest world's richest list. Wait until you see who's on it. Stay with us</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jay-Z and Serena Williams making major money moves. Lauren Simonetti with all the details now. What a great list -- Forbes list.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We are talking about a lot of money, let's start with Jay-Z, the first hip-hop artist, the first rapper, if you will to amass a $1 billion fortune. And if you look at how and where he has his money, this is like ultra-premium brands. He's got his champagne company, $310 million. If you look at his portfolio, a $70 million investment in Uber believe it or not. He had his (INAUDIBLE) company at $100 million and the same amount for the Tidal, the streaming service. So, he is well-rounded, very much using his skill set not just in music but in other things too to amass this fortune. I was looking at some of his art -- he's big in art world. He is has about $70 million art collection. So, it's pretty unbelievable.</p><p>I also want to show you Serena Williams. You're going to like this, Maria. She's the first athlete to make the list of the richest self-made woman, and it's $225 million for her, but she invests in 34 start-ups that are focused on women and focused on minorities, it's called Serena Ventures, that's her company. And just to give you an idea of some of these, Floravere, they make bridal gowns and sell them direct to consumer. She does a lot of personal care products, so she's all about using herself as the message as she preaches these companies as part of her brand. So, congratulations to both of them.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I thought I saw coin base on that list. A digital currency, that's an interesting addition to her list.</p><p>PEEK: -- advising her on all those investments.</p><p>SIMONETTI: She has a seat on the boards of many companies and she talks to, you know, Sheryl Sandberg and others as well.</p><p>PEEK: Interesting.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm looking at the wedding dresses. Out of curiosity.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Her husband is a -- with Reddit as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's one of the founders over there.</p><p>SIMONETTI: He's one of investors there too. He's actually worth more than she is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lauren, thank you. All right, Lauren Simonetti, still ahead my exclusive interview with the CEO of Wal-Mart, Doug McMilan; he'll give us his take on what the trade fights need for prices at Wal-Mart, whether or not we're going to see increases coming and that's at 8:20 a.m. Eastern this morning.

Now is the  time for action. Every pledge that Washington democrats made, to pass that  bill, turned out to be a lie. It was a big, fat, ugly lie. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump fighting for a victory  against the D.C. swamp still, President Trump just calling out republican  senators saying now is the time to get things done after meeting with  victims of Obamacare earlier today. Senate republicans expected to vote  sometime this week, perhaps as early as tomorrow to begin debate on  Obamacare reform.</p><p>Welcome to Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Liz MacDonald in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>The Dow closing down 66 points today, the NASDAQ ending at an all-time high  with big tech earnings. But Alphabet, the parent of the search giant Google  just reported a drop in second quarter profit. It was hurt by more than  $2.7 billion fine from European antitrust regulators. </p><p>Now let's get back to the president, speaking on healthcare reform this  afternoon pushing to get Obamacare reform through before the August recess.  He issued a warning yesterday, saying \"If republicans do not repeal and  replace Obamacare the disastrous Obamacare, the repercussions will be far  greater than any of them understand.\" </p><p>This as new CBO numbers demolish the democrat fear mongering, the analysis  showing nearly three quarters of the 22 million estimated who will drop  coverage under Obamacare reform, will do so voluntarily, they'll choose to  drop it when the individual mandate tax goes away. That's according to the  CBO analysis brought to us by the National Review.</p><p>In other words, 16 million will voluntarily drop out of the market by 2026  because it will no longer face a financial penalty for doing so. No talk of  that in Congress, instead of the democrats like Chuck Schumer they say they  want to buy partisan fix with the GOP. </p><p>But behind the scenes, democrats now in both the House and the Senate, they  see a jackpot pass to victory in winning back Congress next year, their big  plan is big government health Medicare for all, which in theory provides  nearly universal coverage through the government rather than private  insurer.</p><p>Bow Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on ABC on Sunday that quote,  \"We are going to look at broader things for the nation's healthcare system,  singer payer is one of them.\"</p><p>Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren already mapping out victory next year  on single payer. Jimmy Carter just moments ago saying the U.S. eventually  will have single payer, and the CEO of one of five largest public insurers  in the U.S. he is a CEO, he is Mark Bertolini, though he's not for single  payer he reportedly recently did say at a private conference that U.S.  should start considering it. </p><p>And business titan Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are also recently  supporting the single payer idea. </p><p>Let's take it to former Florida Congressman, he is retired lieutenant  colonel Allen West. He joins me now. Colonel, what do you think of this  democrat momentum behind single payer and Medicare for all? </p><p>ALLEN WEST, FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, it's good to be  with you, Liz. And first of all, that has always been the intention for the  Democrat Party. If you really look at Obamacare the Patient Protection  Affordable Care Act was doomed to fail. When we look at co-ops when we look  at the exchanges, we look at the lack of insurance coverage out there this  is all resolved. </p><p>It is not affordable. We know that. It is not protective patients. And I  find it very interesting that Jimmy Carter would come out and speak about a  single pair system because it was in 1978 that President Carter said that  every American had the right to own a home with his Community Reinvestment  Act. </p><p>And 30 years later we had a financial collapse that was due to the mortgage  crisis here in the United States of America which began with his logic. So  here once again we're going to try to have a Medicaid or Medicare for all,  when the almost 66 percent of federal budget right now, Medicare, Medicaid,  and social security that interest of the debt is consumed by these  mandatory spending programs, that means that we're not going to be able to  afford. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Irving Institute, to your point, says that Medicare for  all will cost $32 trillion over 10 years, the first is cost alone, Colonel,  $2.5 trillion, that's more than the market value of Google, Apple,  Microsoft, AT, and Facebook combined. </p><p>WEST:  No, you're absolutely right. And so it ends up consuming, which is  one-sixth of our economy healthcare, it will end up consuming our entire  budget. And it's interesting that recently out in California they tried to  go with a single payer system there, and they pulled the legislation  because it will cost too much. What does that tell you? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we're going to get to that in a second. But first this,  sir. Minnesota democrat and deputy chair of the DNC, he is Keith Ellison he  is now pushing for America to become like Cuba when it comes to healthcare.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEITH ELLISON, (D) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Why is it the countries  like Cuba or Canada or Russia or a lot of places in this world spend half  of what we spend per capita and they got better health outcomes than we do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Canada, I mean, they are flying here for their health outcomes. </p><p>WEST:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And does this show the ignorance of democrats like Keith  Ellison. I mean, in Cuba it's been showing time and again that party  elites, the military foreign tourists, they get the best medical care while  the Cuban workers and the Cuban people are left with dirty hospitals and  disarray and shortages of medicine. </p><p>WEST:  You're absolutely right. And you know, when I represented the people  down in South Florida, I never saw any boats leaving South Florida to go to  Cuba for healthcare. Just the same as when we have these snowbirds that  came down from Canada, they would have an incredible influx of Canadians  coming in for healthcare appointments, things that they could not get done  because of the single payer system in Canada. </p><p>So, I think he fells and if he really thinks socialize medicine is so great  maybe he can go down to Venezuela and get a, you know, a medical  appointment there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, it's an interesting point. You know, Colonel, Vermont  Senator Bernie Sanders t what you were just noting earlier, he is ripping  into California democrats for pulling back on a $400 billion single payer  healthcare bill, they are worried in California about cost concerns, that's  400 billion is more than double the size of California's budget. And didn't  Bernie Sanders home State of Vermont single payer almost bankrupt the  state? I mean 400 billion quickly becomes 800 billion, right?</p><p>WEST:  No, you're absolutely right. And when you think about the CalPERS  the pension plan out there for the government bureaucracy and the union  that they have in California, you talk about a state that's going bankrupt.  We see cities in the State of California that are going bankrupt. </p><p>And so they know that this is a failing system. Single payer does not work.  Ask the parents of Charlie Gard over in England how they feel about the  single payer system when the government is making the decisions about  whether or not their child can live. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It's a good point. Meantime, the president's son-in-law, he is  White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, he was on Capitol Hill  testifying behind closed-doors. He was not under oath on the investigation  of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. Let's take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW:  I did not collude with  Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no  improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses.  And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested information.  Donald Trump had a better message and ran a smarter campaign and that is  why he won. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Mr. Kushner also said he did not read e-mails that  showed the president's eldest son Donald Trump, Jr. accepted this June 2016  meeting with the idea that he would get damaging information about Hillary  Clinton. Colonel, what do you think of Mr. Kushner today? </p><p>WEST:  Well, I think that he did what was the right thing, to go and put  this to rest, but it's never going to be put to rest. You know, we need the  people there on Capitol Hill the House and Senate republicans who are in  charge to say enough of this already, enough of taxpayer funds that have  been wasted on this witch-hunt that is a conviction that is looking for  evidence. That's basically what it is.</p><p>Let's talk about Hillary Clinton and her uranium deals. Let's talk about  the fact that we are going to have more flexibility after our reelection  with Russia with what President Obama said. let's talk about the leaks that  are emanating out of Washington, D.C. of classified information. That's  where the focus should be.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Mr. Kushner is expected to basically testify before a  House panel, House intelligence tomorrow. We believe it's not under oath  that it could be behind closed. It's not going to be held public. </p><p>To your point, President Trump tweeting out, \"So why aren't the committees  investigators and of course, our beleaguered A.G. Jeff Sessions looking  into crooked Hillary's crimes and Russia relations.\" Another shot Jeff  Sessions there. What do you think of President Trump's tweet right there? </p><p>WEST:  You know, if this one thing you never want to criticize a member of  your team, especially an attorney general. And I think that that does not  do bode well for bolstering his position of influence and his position of  power as the attorney general when you have the president that is putting  out those types of tweets. Or when you have the interview that he did last  week in New York Times. If you got a problem with Attorney General Sessions  you need to do it off line behind closed doors. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Kushner said that raising questions about Russian  election activity ridicules people who voted for Trump, saying Donald Trump  had a better message and ran a smatter campaign, and that is why he won. He  is saying suggesting otherwise, ridicules those who voted for him.</p><p>I mean, here is the thing, Colonel, we have a number of probes into Russia,  including Robert Mueller, they'll get to the bottom of it. Do you agree  with Jared Kushner on that point? </p><p>WEST:  Well, I think that this is a big distraction, when you look at the  polling out there the American people are not concerned about Russia. The  American people are concerned about getting back to work. The American are  concerned about affordable healthcare. The American people are concerned  about economic growth and they are concerned national security. </p><p>But you see once again, the Democrat Party is becoming a party of  distractions not even resistance. So I think we need to get discipline, we  need to get focused and someone needs to tell Mr. Mueller, you got 30 days  or 60 days whatever, if you don't come up with something based upon your  original guidance and the purpose, then you should be -- this thing should  be ended. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Colonel. Good to see you. Come back soon. </p><p>WEST:  Always a pleasure, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Search giant Google's parent company Alphabet reporting a  second quarter profit that dropped sharply versus a year before. It was  hurt by a big $2.74 billion anti-trust fine out of Europe. Shares off  almost 3 percent in after-hours trading despite being up more than 25  percent year-to-date.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer taking a page from President Trump's  playbook, and now the democrats now plan to focus on jobs. The man who  confronted Hillary for killing coal jobs during the election is here. He is  West Virginia coal miner Bo Copley, he will respond. </p><p>Also later in show, a musician calling out millennials with a parody song,  he is here to talk about it later in the show, so stick around, it's pretty  funny.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  When you lose an election with  someone who has a 40 percent popularity, you look in the mirror and say  what did we do wrong. And the number one things that we did wrong is we  didn't have -- we didn't tell people what we stood before, even today. Week  after week, month after month, we're going to roll out specific pieces here  that are quite different than the Democratic Party you head in the past, we  were too cautious, we were too namby-pamby. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer now acknowledging  that democrats have a big brand image problem. He is now trying to argue  that the democrats lost the last election, well, they lost four elections  since 2010 because the democrats did not tell the working voter what the  democrats stand for. </p><p>Polls show that majority think democrats stand for just opposing Trump. But  now Schumer said democrats are trying to sell a better deal for the  American worker. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  We're going to raise people's wages and create better paying  jobs. We're going to cut down on their everyday expenses they have to pay.  And we're going to give them the tools they need to compete in the 21th  century. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  No details on exactly how the democrats' plan to do that. U.S.  voters saw what the democrats stood for going back to 2010. They rejected  their big tax, big government spending big government regulation back --  starting in 2010 through 2016. </p><p>And despite all of this attack even Chuck Schumer himself said a few years  ago, that Obama should not have focused on big government spending on that  $800 billion stimulus plan, instead he should have focused on jobs and  growth. </p><p>And we just showed you government data showing 863,000 jobs have been added  since President Trump took office. The U.S. labor market rebounded in June  ending 222,000 jobs. </p><p>Let's go to West Virginia coal miner who confronted Hillary Clinton about  trying to get rid of coal jobs during the last election, he is Bo Copley,  he joins me now. Good to see you, Bo. What do you think of what Chuck  Schumer is now saying? </p><p>BO COPLEY, COAL MINER:  Thanks for having us on, Liz. </p><p>I think it's interesting that I guess they see now that, you know, the  working class people were a huge factor in what got Donald Trump elected as  president. I don't think that -- I don't think their message was not what  we stand for, you know, not telling people what we stand for is how we lost  the election. I think they told people what they stood for. And I think it  was a complete paradox to what the working class American is. </p><p>I think what they telling people that they stood for was handouts and a lot  of free things that they were promising that came off of the backs of the  working class. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, the democrats have been saying,  you know, you didn't build that. The government helped you build that,  you're too stupid to understand Obamacare, that was Jonathan Gruber, the  economist who said that. </p><p>And Schumer is now saying, Bo, that Trump actually used, he used American  workers to get elected. Do you agree with that? </p><p>COPLEY:  Absolutely, he used them. He told us what we wanted to hear, and  we put him into office. And so far he is trying very hard to deliver on the  promises that he made us. So, you know, I don't know if use is the right  word, but he told us what we wanted to hear, and so far he is working very  hard to make that happen. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. So, I mean, it's been eight years where I think the  American voter has seen what the democrats are about. And I think it's  really about, you know, incumbency is the problem. I mean, Nancy Pelosi has  been around since the Reagan era, Chuck Schumer has been around for 30  years. </p><p>And what they're suggesting, Bo is it looks like more big government Bernie  Sanders ideas and small government pro-growth tax cut like JFK. What do you  think?</p><p>COPLEY:  Well, you know, if you look at our state, Liz, our state is  predominantly been a democratic state, and that's one of the reasons why  we're doing what we're doing. I'm a firm believer in term limits, and  that's one of the reasons why we're running for Senate. </p><p>You know, we have a democratic representative in Joe Manchin who as you  know was for Hillary Clinton and was opposed to President Trump. And you  know, his alliance with Democratic Party -- our state has turned completely  around so much so that we haven't carried a democratic president since Bill  Clinton a second term. </p><p>And you know, I think the people of this state have realized that how far  that the Democratic Party has shifted over the last 20 to 30 years, and  that they are starting to see that you know, they're not the party that  they should be and they're not representing the state the way that they  should. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, so we had Hillary Clinton and the democrats going  after coal jobs, and now Chuck Schumer saying he wants to go after the big  companies and the grocery business and healthcare, and the cable business.  I mean, to that end, the democrats have also reportedly settled on a new  slogan and tag line for next year's elections, Bo. </p><p>And it sound really familiar, Bo. I want you to take a listen to the  democrat -- what the democrat's new slogan sound like. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, Bo, they are being made fun of for their new slogan. What  do you think? Their new slogan by the way, Bo, is a better deal, let's show  it. A better jobs, better wages, better future. I mean, let's see, make  America great again versus that, what do you think? </p><p>COPLEY:  Well, I am all for making America great again for sure. You know,  you can slice things up the way you want to and serve it the way that you  want to. But ultimately, you have to know what kind of substance is behind  this kind of promises; you can't just throw those out there. </p><p>So they may be able to make a better wage or whatever the rest of that tag  is. But we need to see how they plan on doing it and see if it's something  that's viable to the American people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, they're making it like there is a big government pizza pie  of income that the government get the slice up at hands out, but that's not  how it works, right, Bo? You've seen that. </p><p>COPLEY:  Well, I know for us, in any thin we've ever wanted we had to go  out and work for it. So I'm not sure that, I'm not sure how much the  government is slicing up and handing out, I'm sure we are to a plenty of  people.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COPLEY:  And I think that's a -- I think those are the kind of people that  we have to kind of trying wean off of the kinds of the programs that we  have right now. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Bo Copley, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for coming on.  We love having you on.</p><p>COPLEY:  Thanks for having us on, Liz. And if you don't care, go out and  take a look at boforw.com.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COPLEY:  And check out our policies. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure. Thank you, Bo. Thanks again. </p><p>Now this, even as gas prices drop to a 12-year low, Senate Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer claiming the prices have only gone up. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  People hate it when their cable bills go up, their airline fees.  They know that gas prices they're sticky, you know, when the domestic price  goes -- when the price for oil goes up on the market. It goes right up but  it never goes down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, national average price of gas settling today $2.28 a  gallon of regular, down from $2.32, per gallon when President Trump took  office. Gas prices actually going down. </p><p>Next, newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci  taking on CNN for the first time. We've got the highlights. </p><p>Also a musician deciding to write a song, calling out today's millennial,  his video now going viral, he is here talk about it later in the show, so  stick around </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony  Scaramucci taking on CNN for the first time in his official role. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, HOST, CNN:  A lot of people, Anthony, will read that op-ed,  they'll read the tweets that you spent the weekend deleting that were pro- gun control.</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  Pro-action on climate change and they all think, wowm this guy is  willing to suppress everything he believes in order to get close to power.  What is your answer?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's true.</p><p>TAPPER:  What is your answer to that?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's totally -- especially that's a ridiculous Washington  sort of narrative. Let me tell you something about demagoguery that I don't  like, OK? Demagoguery, OK, creates a lot of nonsense like this. He's going  to win again, Jake, he's going to win again. I will bring a box of Kleenex  over here to CNN. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAPPER:  You don't -- we don't need Kleenex.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He will win in 2020. He is going to win, Jake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a look at Time Warner stock, the parent company of  CNN closing slightly in the green for the day. The stock is up year over  year.</p><p>Joining me now Donald J. Trump for president advisory board member, he is  Jeff DeWit. Good to see you, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF DEWIT, FORMER ARIZONA STATE TREASURER:  Great to see you, Liz. Thanks  for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It looks like you are already working on President Trump's next  election, right? </p><p>DEWIT:  Well, you know, there are a lot of people out there that can't wait  to support him in all the upcoming elections. And he know he's going to  have a lot to say even over the midterms because he does control a big  voting block of patriotic Americans.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p>DEWIT:  They are going to support the candidates that support him.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you see what Jake tapper was asking Scaramucci, you  deleted tweets, you know, he's just trying to get close to power, you did  not support President Trump, you're for other candidates. What did you  think of that interview there? </p><p>DEWIT:  I thought Anthony handled himself very well, you know, he is very,  very sharp, he's very capable and he's very popular within the campaign. He  is a doer and I think he brings an authentic voice to this. I don't want to  saying about Sean, he's a great guy. But Anthony really brings that  business minded voice that really speaks more for Donald Trump I think.</p><p>I thought Anthony handled himself very well. So far everything he has done  has been great. You know, look, people have evolve from their views, and so  if you're looking for something from a long time with some things he said,  yes, things are different as they evolve. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DEWIT:  You know, there is a famous quote in politics that it says, if  you're not a democrat in your 20s you don't have a heart, and if you  haven't turn a republican by your 30s you don't have a brain. So, people  have evolved in their views. But I know where Anthony stands now and he  aligns wholly with Donald Trump's agenda. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You see, it's interesting throughout this whole process you see  whether it's a democrat or a republican guest, the journalists asking the  question, doesn't like to be asked questions back or challenge, that's  clear here in what we're seeing unfold in Washington, the D.C. beltway and  the media coverage.</p><p>You know, Anthony Scaramucci also vowed to take drastic action to stop  White House leaks. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  If the leaks don't stop, I'm going to pare down the staff  because it's just not right for us. I think it's not fair to the president;  it's actually not fair to America or the people in the government. But  something is going on inside the White House that the president does not  like and we're going to fix it.</p><p>I would like to reset the culture inside that commerce department so that  people recognize that I'm actually there to serve them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jeff, where are the leaks coming from? </p><p>DEWIT:  You know, the leaks are from people that have their own political  agenda. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Who? </p><p>DEWIT:  Either they're leftover from Obama. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it just Obama?</p><p>DEWIT:  I don't know. Personally, I can't name names.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it just Obama officials? Well, who...</p><p>DEWIT:  No, you know, there are people in there that seem to have their own  agenda, but what they don't realize they're not just trying -- thwarting  the Donald Trump agenda. But they are actually causing harm for our  country. I mean, this puts our country at risk. </p><p>The fact that Russia knows now that we can listen to the conversations  between, you know, Putin and his ambassador, I don't -- that was because of  a leak. Now Russia obviously is going to scramble their communications or  do something different, that's something that should never be out there. </p><p>But it's also dragging good people through the mud. You look at Jared  Kushner who on his own, he went down, he has to go down, he shows  everything. But this is someone who is a patriotic American, a hardworking  very successful man, who is a great dad and a great husband, but now has to  go down and have all his business looked into because of these leaks...</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DEWIT:  ... for people just trying to thwart it. So these are great people  that are getting drag to the mud and they shouldn't be. And again, go back  to Comey hearings.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DEWIT:  There is no evidence that Russia did anything in the campaign. I  can tell you as the COO of the campaign, there was no involvement with  other countries.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. And to your point, Susan Rice is no longer expected to  testify about unmasking. She's no longer expected to testify for lawmakers.</p><p>We did have President Trump's son-in-law, White House senior adviser, Jared  Kushner, as you point out, Jeff. He met with Senate intelligence committee  today. He said he did not collude with Russians. He is expected to speak to  House intelligence tomorrow, where is this headed? </p><p>DEWIT:  Well, it's headed nowhere, because we all inside the campaign know  that there is nothing there. We won because Donald Trump is a great  candidate with a superior message that resonated to all the hardworking  patriotic Americans in the Midwest that were sick of the politicians  shipping their jobs overseas. That's why Donald Trump won.</p><p>And if the race were held again today, he would beat Hillary Clinton by a  bigger margin. So it's going nowhere. I think what the best thing was Chuck  Schumer yesterday, basically and the Democratic Party admitting why they  lost, as you point out, which is because they don't have a message anymore. </p><p>They don't have an economic platform, and now they're adapting Donald  Trump's message to try to promote that. So it's going to go nowhere. And to  see good people like Jared get dragged through the mud, it's not fair. It's  not fair to him and it's not fair to America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>DEWIT:  Let's move on, let's get down to the business of fixing our  country. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jeff DeWit, good to see you. Thanks for coming on the show. </p><p>DEWIT:  Always great, Liz. Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Next up, the wildfires in Canada pushing up the price of lumber  as that fire threatens the supply to U.S. homebuilders. </p><p>Canada's wildfires it turned out to be the toughest on the lumber industry  in over a decade. Homebuilders in the U.S. now fear that prices might climb  even higher as wholesalers try to restock in the midst of this price surge  due to the really just destructive fire. It's real tragedy going on there. </p><p>We have a New York Times reporter feeling the heat after accusing white  women of showing racism on sidewalks. Coming up, hear how he thinks white  women show racism. Also, you know, getting a better education -- is getting  a better education for your children is that racist? Is school choice  racist? </p><p>The American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten seems to  think so. We're going to have her comments after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is getting a better education for your children racist? The  American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten think that  school choice is racist. She also said that's a movement to give parents  more say over where their children go to school has its roots in, not just  racism but also sexism, classism, xenophobia and homophobia. Calling the  programs, quote, polite cousins of segregation.</p><p>Let's look at education stocks like Strayer Education and American Public  closing in the red today. </p><p>Joining me now, Independent Women's Forum, Patrice Onwuka, and democrat  strategist, Danielle McLaughlin. First to you, Patrice. Randi Weingarten  continues to say quote, \"This privatization and this investment are only  slightly more polite cousins of segregation.\" Is that a little over broad? </p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  It  absolutely is. It's a great way of trying to whip up some support by  claiming racism when, in fact, when we look at the most segregated schools  and district they happened to be in democratically controlled cities. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Danielle, school choice, doesn't actually help low  income minority children? I mean, Florida's private school choice program  the largest in the nation, 68 percent of the scholarship recipients are  minorities, right? </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  Sure. And there is a place for  charter schools. I think we can all agree upon that public schools have  allowed just some educated in this country 90 percent of children go to  public schools. </p><p>So, I think what critics are saying is that we need the funding, we need to  make sure that those public schools are taken care of because public  schools means community and that's a very important part of just our  society in general. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And reform, right? So, we have a New York Times reporter, let's  switch gears now, you guys, the New York Times reporting now facing a blow  back for an essay calling out white women saying white women are racist. In  the piece titled was that racist. Greg Howard writes, quote, \"When white  women are in my path on the street, they almost always continue straight,  forcing me to one side without changing their course. Why only and  specifically white women, do they refuse to acknowledge me, because they  have been taught that they should fear black men. And that any  acknowledgment of black men can invite danger.\" </p><p>Let's just take a quick check on New York Times stock closing the day in  the green of about 5 bucks year over year. Patrice, is what he's describing  is that racism? </p><p>ONWUKA:  No, I think it's looking for racism where it isn't. I mean,  certainly, there is a sense of entitlement that's replaced common courtesy,  but you know, when you're looking for racism in every single place, you  become kind of a chicken little, and then the real instances where it does  occur become, you know, it look absurd. People don't believe them anymore.</p><p>And I talked to a black man who happens to be my husband about this issue,  and he said, you know what? I think it has a lot more to do with people not  being courteous than it is for some sort of targeting by this, by white  women against black men. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Danielle, another quote from that piece read quote.  \"As a black man, I learned that body checking, bumping or even rubbing  against a random white woman can be personally hazardous.\" What did you  make of the piece, is this race basing what he is describing? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I didn't think it was race basing. I thought it was certainly  provocative and that's what this is meant to be if the call and states it  very clearly that this is what this is meant to be about. Challenging, I'm  a white woman, I walk the streets of New York City, I'm not engaging in any  of these behaviors. </p><p>And I think it's problematic when you take your own personal experience and  you expand it out to an entire population. And actually I agree that this - - I don't think this is an instance of racism. We should be focused on the  real instances of racism with the institutional or otherwise. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. So, Patrice, if this column this story was  edited before publication, why do you supposed the New York Times did not  pull the story and instead chose to ran with it? </p><p>NWUKA:  Because it's provocative, it gets people talking about it. I mean,  we've seen on Twitter how it blew up as a good way of drawing people into  this whole discussion. Apparently they are soliciting stories from people  talking about the question was this racist. You know, what's my, somebody  calling out tall, black marquees at Starbucks, an example of racism. When  in fact it was just, the guy was tall, and black and his copy was tall and  black and his name was Marquee (Ph). </p><p>So, it's another way of just kind of seeding racism where it doesn't  necessarily need to be, and again, attracting readers and viewership. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Patrice and Danielle, thanks so much for your thoughts there.  Good to see you, guys. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  KKR betting big on healthy living. Now the private equity  giants plans to buy WebMD health corp for 2.8 billion bucks. KKR will  combine WebMD's web site with its internet brand Unit which own sites like  Dentalplans.com and allaboutcounselling.com extending its footprints in the  web health market. </p><p>Next up, ruthless human smugglers blamed for the deaths of now 10 people  left in a truck in 100-degree Texas in San Antonio at a Wal-Mart. My next  guest says, sanctuary city are partly to blame. Former Immigration and  Customs agent, he is also border patrol agent, he is David Ward. He joins  me next. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The death toll now rising to 10 in what police are calling a  horrific human smuggling case where people died inside a sweltering 18- wheelering in San Antonio, about 150 miles from the U.S./Mexico border. Two  died after the incident. Eight died inside the truck. A total of 39 people  were inside the tractor. </p><p>At one point it was estimated 100 people were there in. At least two of  those who were injured were 15-year-old school age children. The driver now  in federal custody he is facing criminal charges, federal charges filed  today in federal court.</p><p>Joining me now, former Immigration and Customs agent and former U.S Border  Patrol agent, he is David Ward. David, one of the immigrant passengers said  people took turns breathing through a hole in the wall of the tractor  trailer. Now, sir, we know that border crossings are down under President  Trump, but what needs to be done to stop awful crimes like this? </p><p>DAVID WARD, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS:   Look, they are going to continue smuggling until we curtail the sanctuary  cities and until we put a secure border on our -- a secure fence on our  border. The cartels thrive on alien smuggling in addition to narcotics  trafficking. And both issues involve sanctuary cities. We have a huge  opioid problem. We have a huge alien smuggling problem and it all revolves  around sanctuary cities. </p><p>MACDONALD:  How do we know that this case of the 10 who are now dead and  the 39 injured, how do you know that this is connected to sanctuary cities? </p><p>WARD:  By the statements that were made that they were going to Houston,  and I believe there were other statements made in another sanctuary city,  those are sanctuary cities in the United States, the smugglers have opened  up their operations there. There is over 500 sanctuary cities in the United  States, but there is also over 500 cities that are influenced by Mexican  cartels and also the same cities. </p><p>If you got the DEA map of the drug cartel cities in the United States, and  the DEA just map of all the sanctuary city they are one and the same. So  any time you have a large operation like this it's going to have involve  sanctuary cities. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And sir, in response to this incident, Texas lieutenant  governor, he is Dan Patrick, he applauded laws against sanctuary cities in  a Facebook post. Writing quote, \"Today's tragedy is why I made passing  Texas Senate bill 4 to ban sanctuary cities in the state a top priority.  Now sanctuary cities entice to believe they can come to America in Texas  and live outside the law. Sanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and  cartels.\"</p><p>What is your reaction to that? </p><p>WARD:  Well, I absolutely agree with the governor. In fact, I don't  understand a lot of these chiefs of police in the sanctuary cities who come  out and state that if they enforce immigration law that they wouldn't have  witnesses to testify in their cases, criminal cases. </p><p>The thing of it is that the same people that are witnesses are actually the  ones committing the crimes. And until they got a hand on the sanctuary  cities our crime is going to continue to go up. Look at the opioid problem,  we have thousands of people dying now. It's so bad that the Reagan they put  opioid treatment into the new healthcare bill. That's how bad it is.</p><p>If they would address the illegal alien population in these cities they  would take that attraction away. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, sir, the acting head of the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement basically agency, naming the worst sanctuary cities in the  country as Chicago, New York City and San Francisco, he is calling them  quote, \"un-American,\" do you agree with that? </p><p>WARD:  Absolutely. All these officials have taken an oath to our U.S.  Constitution to support and defend all the laws of this country. And yet,  here they are pushing away the immigration law, making it difficult for  immigration agents to even operate in those city, turning their backs on  our officers and in fact, they even are endangering our officers who are  out there trying to do their job in the sanctuary cities, but not getting  the support they needed from their local counterparts. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mr. Ward, thank you for coming on the show. We really  appreciate it.</p><p>WARD:  You're quite welcome, Liz. Have a good day. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We're awaiting President Trump's speech at the National Boy  Scout jamboree in West Virginia. We will bring it to you when the president  arrives. </p><p>Next up, we have this story for you. Millennials often criticized as  spoiled and bratty, lazy. Maybe that's unfair, not very nice. But we've got  one musician he decides to write a song about that. He is musician Micah  Tyler, he is here to talk about the motivation beyond -- behind his  millennial parody, it's now going viral. You're going to stay for this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Pretty funny. Millennials often criticized as spoiled, entitled  even lazy. That inspired my next guest to write a song. Musician Micah  Tyler has a new album coming out called different, it's debuting October  20th. </p><p>Music industry sellers, streamers, producer like Sony, Apple, Sirius. Let's  take a look at their stock, they're closing the day mixed today. Amazon is  hitting a new all-time high. </p><p>Let's bring in Micah Tyler to talk about his song. Good to see you, Micah. </p><p>MICAH TYLER, MUSICIAN:  Hey, good to see you, guys too. Thanks for having  me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How did come up with the song? It's pretty funny. </p><p>TYLER:  Well, it's one of those things. The little inspiration probably  came from the mirror, I'm actually a millennial myself. And I got a call  from a church conference. The church that I parody with over in Dallas, the  church it's called Watermark Church. And they had called me and asked me if  I would bring up and make up some different songs. </p><p>I've appeared for them before, kind of interim people but they want the  intros in different topics that have some stigmas that have some  stereotypes attach to them, one of the topics was millennials. They asked  me to make a song that would kind of intro the topic, and in context it  made a lot more sense.</p><p>The video played listing every stereotype that I could find that I could or  think of that they've given me, and then we made the song, it was followed  by this talk about how millennials are more in the stereotypes that are  attached to them, that were a generation that history hope to be looked  back on us being -- trying to explore new things and dream really big and  go out there and make a difference with this growing up and not be, you  know, held to our coffee and Instagrams. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I think you just have -- yes, that's a good point. You just  have a line in the song, I think that millennial could be our next  president. But here is another part of the song that is funny. Let's --  it's at the end. Let's take a listen. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you took that into a funeral dirge there, Micah. You agree  that we are going to have a millennial president. What are you worried  about? </p><p>TYLER:  Listen, the thing is if we want to live up to the generalities that  have been in place on your generation, then yes. We're in for quite four  years one day. But you know, this is all totally done, tongue in cheek, it  must be something really fun. It was just done for this conference, we  didn't even know that it was going to be put up on Facebook, we did it last  April. </p><p>The church posted it and it kind of went nuts and the last year it had over  100 million views. It got (Inaudible) research and someone posted it last  week it has another, you know, 15 million view this week. But again, the  context of it was to be something fun, to kind of just laugh at ourselves a  little bit, some of the labels that have been attached to us. But you know,  I'm hoping we can get it together. I had hope for our generation. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, one of my Twitter followers, what song is Micah  parodying? What's the name of it? Tweet me your answer. </p><p>TYLER:  Fine.</p><p>MACDONALD:  College students in Berkeley and NYU burned things down to  block conservative speakers from speaking. So, what is -- when you those  stories what was your reaction? </p><p>TYLER:  Here's the deal. We -- it would be really hard thing if every time  that some one person did something we would completely blanket an entire  generation, and entire people group, an entire age whatever, with some  decisions that people have their own freewill to be able to make. All I can  do...</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>TYLER:  ... is try to be encouraging and try to be positive out there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  There you go, Micah, your new album, Different, out October  20th. We wish you good luck, sir. Thanks for coming on. </p><p>Donald Trump just tweeting out any senator who votes again starting debate  is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare. The  president also posted of his remarks echoing that earlier today. </p><p>This follows Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying on the floor  that the vote to proceed on debating health reform will start tomorrow.  Senate majority whip John Cornyn says Senate John McCain diagnosed with  brain cancer, he is trying to get approval for his travel arrangements to  possibly show up for a vote. We're on that story for you. We'll be right  back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  President Trump about to speak to the boy scouts in West  Virginia at the National Boy Scouts jamboree. Fox Business will bring it to  you live when the president speaks. </p><p>That does it for us tonight. Thank you for having us in your homes.

Now is the  time for action. Every pledge that Washington democrats made, to pass that  bill, turned out to be a lie. It was a big, fat, ugly lie. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump fighting for a victory  against the D.C. swamp still, President Trump just calling out republican  senators saying now is the time to get things done after meeting with  victims of Obamacare earlier today. Senate republicans expected to vote  sometime this week, perhaps as early as tomorrow to begin debate on  Obamacare reform.</p><p>Welcome to Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Liz MacDonald in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>The Dow closing down 66 points today, the NASDAQ ending at an all-time high  with big tech earnings. But Alphabet, the parent of the search giant Google  just reported a drop in second quarter profit. It was hurt by more than  $2.7 billion fine from European antitrust regulators. </p><p>Now let's get back to the president, speaking on healthcare reform this  afternoon pushing to get Obamacare reform through before the August recess.  He issued a warning yesterday, saying \"If republicans do not repeal and  replace Obamacare the disastrous Obamacare, the repercussions will be far  greater than any of them understand.\" </p><p>This as new CBO numbers demolish the democrat fear mongering, the analysis  showing nearly three quarters of the 22 million estimated who will drop  coverage under Obamacare reform, will do so voluntarily, they'll choose to  drop it when the individual mandate tax goes away. That's according to the  CBO analysis brought to us by the National Review.</p><p>In other words, 16 million will voluntarily drop out of the market by 2026  because it will no longer face a financial penalty for doing so. No talk of  that in Congress, instead of the democrats like Chuck Schumer they say they  want to buy partisan fix with the GOP. </p><p>But behind the scenes, democrats now in both the House and the Senate, they  see a jackpot pass to victory in winning back Congress next year, their big  plan is big government health Medicare for all, which in theory provides  nearly universal coverage through the government rather than private  insurer.</p><p>Bow Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on ABC on Sunday that quote,  \"We are going to look at broader things for the nation's healthcare system,  singer payer is one of them.\"</p><p>Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren already mapping out victory next year  on single payer. Jimmy Carter just moments ago saying the U.S. eventually  will have single payer, and the CEO of one of five largest public insurers  in the U.S. he is a CEO, he is Mark Bertolini, though he's not for single  payer he reportedly recently did say at a private conference that U.S.  should start considering it. </p><p>And business titan Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are also recently  supporting the single payer idea. </p><p>Let's take it to former Florida Congressman, he is retired lieutenant  colonel Allen West. He joins me now. Colonel, what do you think of this  democrat momentum behind single payer and Medicare for all? </p><p>ALLEN WEST, FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, it's good to be  with you, Liz. And first of all, that has always been the intention for the  Democrat Party. If you really look at Obamacare the Patient Protection  Affordable Care Act was doomed to fail. When we look at co-ops when we look  at the exchanges, we look at the lack of insurance coverage out there this  is all resolved. </p><p>It is not affordable. We know that. It is not protective patients. And I  find it very interesting that Jimmy Carter would come out and speak about a  single pair system because it was in 1978 that President Carter said that  every American had the right to own a home with his Community Reinvestment  Act. </p><p>And 30 years later we had a financial collapse that was due to the mortgage  crisis here in the United States of America which began with his logic. So  here once again we're going to try to have a Medicaid or Medicare for all,  when the almost 66 percent of federal budget right now, Medicare, Medicaid,  and social security that interest of the debt is consumed by these  mandatory spending programs, that means that we're not going to be able to  afford. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Irving Institute, to your point, says that Medicare for  all will cost $32 trillion over 10 years, the first is cost alone, Colonel,  $2.5 trillion, that's more than the market value of Google, Apple,  Microsoft, AT, and Facebook combined. </p><p>WEST:  No, you're absolutely right. And so it ends up consuming, which is  one-sixth of our economy healthcare, it will end up consuming our entire  budget. And it's interesting that recently out in California they tried to  go with a single payer system there, and they pulled the legislation  because it will cost too much. What does that tell you? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we're going to get to that in a second. But first this,  sir. Minnesota democrat and deputy chair of the DNC, he is Keith Ellison he  is now pushing for America to become like Cuba when it comes to healthcare.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEITH ELLISON, (D) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE:  Why is it the countries  like Cuba or Canada or Russia or a lot of places in this world spend half  of what we spend per capita and they got better health outcomes than we do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Canada, I mean, they are flying here for their health outcomes. </p><p>WEST:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And does this show the ignorance of democrats like Keith  Ellison. I mean, in Cuba it's been showing time and again that party  elites, the military foreign tourists, they get the best medical care while  the Cuban workers and the Cuban people are left with dirty hospitals and  disarray and shortages of medicine. </p><p>WEST:  You're absolutely right. And you know, when I represented the people  down in South Florida, I never saw any boats leaving South Florida to go to  Cuba for healthcare. Just the same as when we have these snowbirds that  came down from Canada, they would have an incredible influx of Canadians  coming in for healthcare appointments, things that they could not get done  because of the single payer system in Canada. </p><p>So, I think he fells and if he really thinks socialize medicine is so great  maybe he can go down to Venezuela and get a, you know, a medical  appointment there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, it's an interesting point. You know, Colonel, Vermont  Senator Bernie Sanders t what you were just noting earlier, he is ripping  into California democrats for pulling back on a $400 billion single payer  healthcare bill, they are worried in California about cost concerns, that's  400 billion is more than double the size of California's budget. And didn't  Bernie Sanders home State of Vermont single payer almost bankrupt the  state? I mean 400 billion quickly becomes 800 billion, right?</p><p>WEST:  No, you're absolutely right. And when you think about the CalPERS  the pension plan out there for the government bureaucracy and the union  that they have in California, you talk about a state that's going bankrupt.  We see cities in the State of California that are going bankrupt. </p><p>And so they know that this is a failing system. Single payer does not work.  Ask the parents of Charlie Gard over in England how they feel about the  single payer system when the government is making the decisions about  whether or not their child can live. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It's a good point. Meantime, the president's son-in-law, he is  White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, he was on Capitol Hill  testifying behind closed-doors. He was not under oath on the investigation  of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. Let's take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW:  I did not collude with  Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no  improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses.  And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested information.  Donald Trump had a better message and ran a smarter campaign and that is  why he won. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Mr. Kushner also said he did not read e-mails that  showed the president's eldest son Donald Trump, Jr. accepted this June 2016  meeting with the idea that he would get damaging information about Hillary  Clinton. Colonel, what do you think of Mr. Kushner today? </p><p>WEST:  Well, I think that he did what was the right thing, to go and put  this to rest, but it's never going to be put to rest. You know, we need the  people there on Capitol Hill the House and Senate republicans who are in  charge to say enough of this already, enough of taxpayer funds that have  been wasted on this witch-hunt that is a conviction that is looking for  evidence. That's basically what it is.</p><p>Let's talk about Hillary Clinton and her uranium deals. Let's talk about  the fact that we are going to have more flexibility after our reelection  with Russia with what President Obama said. let's talk about the leaks that  are emanating out of Washington, D.C. of classified information. That's  where the focus should be.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. Mr. Kushner is expected to basically testify before a  House panel, House intelligence tomorrow. We believe it's not under oath  that it could be behind closed. It's not going to be held public. </p><p>To your point, President Trump tweeting out, \"So why aren't the committees  investigators and of course, our beleaguered A.G. Jeff Sessions looking  into crooked Hillary's crimes and Russia relations.\" Another shot Jeff  Sessions there. What do you think of President Trump's tweet right there? </p><p>WEST:  You know, if this one thing you never want to criticize a member of  your team, especially an attorney general. And I think that that does not  do bode well for bolstering his position of influence and his position of  power as the attorney general when you have the president that is putting  out those types of tweets. Or when you have the interview that he did last  week in New York Times. If you got a problem with Attorney General Sessions  you need to do it off line behind closed doors. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Kushner said that raising questions about Russian  election activity ridicules people who voted for Trump, saying Donald Trump  had a better message and ran a smatter campaign, and that is why he won. He  is saying suggesting otherwise, ridicules those who voted for him.</p><p>I mean, here is the thing, Colonel, we have a number of probes into Russia,  including Robert Mueller, they'll get to the bottom of it. Do you agree  with Jared Kushner on that point? </p><p>WEST:  Well, I think that this is a big distraction, when you look at the  polling out there the American people are not concerned about Russia. The  American people are concerned about getting back to work. The American are  concerned about affordable healthcare. The American people are concerned  about economic growth and they are concerned national security. </p><p>But you see once again, the Democrat Party is becoming a party of  distractions not even resistance. So I think we need to get discipline, we  need to get focused and someone needs to tell Mr. Mueller, you got 30 days  or 60 days whatever, if you don't come up with something based upon your  original guidance and the purpose, then you should be -- this thing should  be ended. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Colonel. Good to see you. Come back soon. </p><p>WEST:  Always a pleasure, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Search giant Google's parent company Alphabet reporting a  second quarter profit that dropped sharply versus a year before. It was  hurt by a big $2.74 billion anti-trust fine out of Europe. Shares off  almost 3 percent in after-hours trading despite being up more than 25  percent year-to-date.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer taking a page from President Trump's  playbook, and now the democrats now plan to focus on jobs. The man who  confronted Hillary for killing coal jobs during the election is here. He is  West Virginia coal miner Bo Copley, he will respond. </p><p>Also later in show, a musician calling out millennials with a parody song,  he is here to talk about it later in the show, so stick around, it's pretty  funny.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  When you lose an election with  someone who has a 40 percent popularity, you look in the mirror and say  what did we do wrong. And the number one things that we did wrong is we  didn't have -- we didn't tell people what we stood before, even today. Week  after week, month after month, we're going to roll out specific pieces here  that are quite different than the Democratic Party you head in the past, we  were too cautious, we were too namby-pamby. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer now acknowledging  that democrats have a big brand image problem. He is now trying to argue  that the democrats lost the last election, well, they lost four elections  since 2010 because the democrats did not tell the working voter what the  democrats stand for. </p><p>Polls show that majority think democrats stand for just opposing Trump. But  now Schumer said democrats are trying to sell a better deal for the  American worker. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  We're going to raise people's wages and create better paying  jobs. We're going to cut down on their everyday expenses they have to pay.  And we're going to give them the tools they need to compete in the 21th  century. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  No details on exactly how the democrats' plan to do that. U.S.  voters saw what the democrats stood for going back to 2010. They rejected  their big tax, big government spending big government regulation back --  starting in 2010 through 2016. </p><p>And despite all of this attack even Chuck Schumer himself said a few years  ago, that Obama should not have focused on big government spending on that  $800 billion stimulus plan, instead he should have focused on jobs and  growth. </p><p>And we just showed you government data showing 863,000 jobs have been added  since President Trump took office. The U.S. labor market rebounded in June  ending 222,000 jobs. </p><p>Let's go to West Virginia coal miner who confronted Hillary Clinton about  trying to get rid of coal jobs during the last election, he is Bo Copley,  he joins me now. Good to see you, Bo. What do you think of what Chuck  Schumer is now saying? </p><p>BO COPLEY, COAL MINER:  Thanks for having us on, Liz. </p><p>I think it's interesting that I guess they see now that, you know, the  working class people were a huge factor in what got Donald Trump elected as  president. I don't think that -- I don't think their message was not what  we stand for, you know, not telling people what we stand for is how we lost  the election. I think they told people what they stood for. And I think it  was a complete paradox to what the working class American is. </p><p>I think what they telling people that they stood for was handouts and a lot  of free things that they were promising that came off of the backs of the  working class. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, the democrats have been saying,  you know, you didn't build that. The government helped you build that,  you're too stupid to understand Obamacare, that was Jonathan Gruber, the  economist who said that. </p><p>And Schumer is now saying, Bo, that Trump actually used, he used American  workers to get elected. Do you agree with that? </p><p>COPLEY:  Absolutely, he used them. He told us what we wanted to hear, and  we put him into office. And so far he is trying very hard to deliver on the  promises that he made us. So, you know, I don't know if use is the right  word, but he told us what we wanted to hear, and so far he is working very  hard to make that happen. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. So, I mean, it's been eight years where I think the  American voter has seen what the democrats are about. And I think it's  really about, you know, incumbency is the problem. I mean, Nancy Pelosi has  been around since the Reagan era, Chuck Schumer has been around for 30  years. </p><p>And what they're suggesting, Bo is it looks like more big government Bernie  Sanders ideas and small government pro-growth tax cut like JFK. What do you  think?</p><p>COPLEY:  Well, you know, if you look at our state, Liz, our state is  predominantly been a democratic state, and that's one of the reasons why  we're doing what we're doing. I'm a firm believer in term limits, and  that's one of the reasons why we're running for Senate. </p><p>You know, we have a democratic representative in Joe Manchin who as you  know was for Hillary Clinton and was opposed to President Trump. And you  know, his alliance with Democratic Party -- our state has turned completely  around so much so that we haven't carried a democratic president since Bill  Clinton a second term. </p><p>And you know, I think the people of this state have realized that how far  that the Democratic Party has shifted over the last 20 to 30 years, and  that they are starting to see that you know, they're not the party that  they should be and they're not representing the state the way that they  should. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, so we had Hillary Clinton and the democrats going  after coal jobs, and now Chuck Schumer saying he wants to go after the big  companies and the grocery business and healthcare, and the cable business.  I mean, to that end, the democrats have also reportedly settled on a new  slogan and tag line for next year's elections, Bo. </p><p>And it sound really familiar, Bo. I want you to take a listen to the  democrat -- what the democrat's new slogan sound like. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, Bo, they are being made fun of for their new slogan. What  do you think? Their new slogan by the way, Bo, is a better deal, let's show  it. A better jobs, better wages, better future. I mean, let's see, make  America great again versus that, what do you think? </p><p>COPLEY:  Well, I am all for making America great again for sure. You know,  you can slice things up the way you want to and serve it the way that you  want to. But ultimately, you have to know what kind of substance is behind  this kind of promises; you can't just throw those out there. </p><p>So they may be able to make a better wage or whatever the rest of that tag  is. But we need to see how they plan on doing it and see if it's something  that's viable to the American people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, they're making it like there is a big government pizza pie  of income that the government get the slice up at hands out, but that's not  how it works, right, Bo? You've seen that. </p><p>COPLEY:  Well, I know for us, in any thin we've ever wanted we had to go  out and work for it. So I'm not sure that, I'm not sure how much the  government is slicing up and handing out, I'm sure we are to a plenty of  people.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COPLEY:  And I think that's a -- I think those are the kind of people that  we have to kind of trying wean off of the kinds of the programs that we  have right now. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Bo Copley, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for coming on.  We love having you on.</p><p>COPLEY:  Thanks for having us on, Liz. And if you don't care, go out and  take a look at boforw.com.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>COPLEY:  And check out our policies. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure. Thank you, Bo. Thanks again. </p><p>Now this, even as gas prices drop to a 12-year low, Senate Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer claiming the prices have only gone up. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCHUMER:  People hate it when their cable bills go up, their airline fees.  They know that gas prices they're sticky, you know, when the domestic price  goes -- when the price for oil goes up on the market. It goes right up but  it never goes down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, national average price of gas settling today $2.28 a  gallon of regular, down from $2.32, per gallon when President Trump took  office. Gas prices actually going down. </p><p>Next, newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci  taking on CNN for the first time. We've got the highlights. </p><p>Also a musician deciding to write a song, calling out today's millennial,  his video now going viral, he is here talk about it later in the show, so  stick around </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony  Scaramucci taking on CNN for the first time in his official role. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, HOST, CNN:  A lot of people, Anthony, will read that op-ed,  they'll read the tweets that you spent the weekend deleting that were pro- gun control.</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  Pro-action on climate change and they all think, wowm this guy is  willing to suppress everything he believes in order to get close to power.  What is your answer?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's true.</p><p>TAPPER:  What is your answer to that?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  That's totally -- especially that's a ridiculous Washington  sort of narrative. Let me tell you something about demagoguery that I don't  like, OK? Demagoguery, OK, creates a lot of nonsense like this. He's going  to win again, Jake, he's going to win again. I will bring a box of Kleenex  over here to CNN. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAPPER:  You don't -- we don't need Kleenex.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  He will win in 2020. He is going to win, Jake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a look at Time Warner stock, the parent company of  CNN closing slightly in the green for the day. The stock is up year over  year.</p><p>Joining me now Donald J. Trump for president advisory board member, he is  Jeff DeWit. Good to see you, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF DEWIT, FORMER ARIZONA STATE TREASURER:  Great to see you, Liz. Thanks  for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It looks like you are already working on President Trump's next  election, right? </p><p>DEWIT:  Well, you know, there are a lot of people out there that can't wait  to support him in all the upcoming elections. And he know he's going to  have a lot to say even over the midterms because he does control a big  voting block of patriotic Americans.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p>DEWIT:  They are going to support the candidates that support him.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you see what Jake tapper was asking Scaramucci, you  deleted tweets, you know, he's just trying to get close to power, you did  not support President Trump, you're for other candidates. What did you  think of that interview there? </p><p>DEWIT:  I thought Anthony handled himself very well, you know, he is very,  very sharp, he's very capable and he's very popular within the campaign. He  is a doer and I think he brings an authentic voice to this. I don't want to  saying about Sean, he's a great guy. But Anthony really brings that  business minded voice that really speaks more for Donald Trump I think.</p><p>I thought Anthony handled himself very well. So far everything he has done  has been great. You know, look, people have evolve from their views, and so  if you're looking for something from a long time with some things he said,  yes, things are different as they evolve. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DEWIT:  You know, there is a famous quote in politics that it says, if  you're not a democrat in your 20s you don't have a heart, and if you  haven't turn a republican by your 30s you don't have a brain. So, people  have evolved in their views. But I know where Anthony stands now and he  aligns wholly with Donald Trump's agenda. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You see, it's interesting throughout this whole process you see  whether it's a democrat or a republican guest, the journalists asking the  question, doesn't like to be asked questions back or challenge, that's  clear here in what we're seeing unfold in Washington, the D.C. beltway and  the media coverage.</p><p>You know, Anthony Scaramucci also vowed to take drastic action to stop  White House leaks. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  If the leaks don't stop, I'm going to pare down the staff  because it's just not right for us. I think it's not fair to the president;  it's actually not fair to America or the people in the government. But  something is going on inside the White House that the president does not  like and we're going to fix it.</p><p>I would like to reset the culture inside that commerce department so that  people recognize that I'm actually there to serve them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jeff, where are the leaks coming from? </p><p>DEWIT:  You know, the leaks are from people that have their own political  agenda. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Who? </p><p>DEWIT:  Either they're leftover from Obama. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it just Obama?</p><p>DEWIT:  I don't know. Personally, I can't name names.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it just Obama officials? Well, who...</p><p>DEWIT:  No, you know, there are people in there that seem to have their own  agenda, but what they don't realize they're not just trying -- thwarting  the Donald Trump agenda. But they are actually causing harm for our  country. I mean, this puts our country at risk. </p><p>The fact that Russia knows now that we can listen to the conversations  between, you know, Putin and his ambassador, I don't -- that was because of  a leak. Now Russia obviously is going to scramble their communications or  do something different, that's something that should never be out there. </p><p>But it's also dragging good people through the mud. You look at Jared  Kushner who on his own, he went down, he has to go down, he shows  everything. But this is someone who is a patriotic American, a hardworking  very successful man, who is a great dad and a great husband, but now has to  go down and have all his business looked into because of these leaks...</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DEWIT:  ... for people just trying to thwart it. So these are great people  that are getting drag to the mud and they shouldn't be. And again, go back  to Comey hearings.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DEWIT:  There is no evidence that Russia did anything in the campaign. I  can tell you as the COO of the campaign, there was no involvement with  other countries.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. And to your point, Susan Rice is no longer expected to  testify about unmasking. She's no longer expected to testify for lawmakers.</p><p>We did have President Trump's son-in-law, White House senior adviser, Jared  Kushner, as you point out, Jeff. He met with Senate intelligence committee  today. He said he did not collude with Russians. He is expected to speak to  House intelligence tomorrow, where is this headed? </p><p>DEWIT:  Well, it's headed nowhere, because we all inside the campaign know  that there is nothing there. We won because Donald Trump is a great  candidate with a superior message that resonated to all the hardworking  patriotic Americans in the Midwest that were sick of the politicians  shipping their jobs overseas. That's why Donald Trump won.</p><p>And if the race were held again today, he would beat Hillary Clinton by a  bigger margin. So it's going nowhere. I think what the best thing was Chuck  Schumer yesterday, basically and the Democratic Party admitting why they  lost, as you point out, which is because they don't have a message anymore. </p><p>They don't have an economic platform, and now they're adapting Donald  Trump's message to try to promote that. So it's going to go nowhere. And to  see good people like Jared get dragged through the mud, it's not fair. It's  not fair to him and it's not fair to America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>DEWIT:  Let's move on, let's get down to the business of fixing our  country. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jeff DeWit, good to see you. Thanks for coming on the show. </p><p>DEWIT:  Always great, Liz. Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Next up, the wildfires in Canada pushing up the price of lumber  as that fire threatens the supply to U.S. homebuilders. </p><p>Canada's wildfires it turned out to be the toughest on the lumber industry  in over a decade. Homebuilders in the U.S. now fear that prices might climb  even higher as wholesalers try to restock in the midst of this price surge  due to the really just destructive fire. It's real tragedy going on there. </p><p>We have a New York Times reporter feeling the heat after accusing white  women of showing racism on sidewalks. Coming up, hear how he thinks white  women show racism. Also, you know, getting a better education -- is getting  a better education for your children is that racist? Is school choice  racist? </p><p>The American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten seems to  think so. We're going to have her comments after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is getting a better education for your children racist? The  American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten think that  school choice is racist. She also said that's a movement to give parents  more say over where their children go to school has its roots in, not just  racism but also sexism, classism, xenophobia and homophobia. Calling the  programs, quote, polite cousins of segregation.</p><p>Let's look at education stocks like Strayer Education and American Public  closing in the red today. </p><p>Joining me now, Independent Women's Forum, Patrice Onwuka, and democrat  strategist, Danielle McLaughlin. First to you, Patrice. Randi Weingarten  continues to say quote, \"This privatization and this investment are only  slightly more polite cousins of segregation.\" Is that a little over broad? </p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  It  absolutely is. It's a great way of trying to whip up some support by  claiming racism when, in fact, when we look at the most segregated schools  and district they happened to be in democratically controlled cities. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Danielle, school choice, doesn't actually help low  income minority children? I mean, Florida's private school choice program  the largest in the nation, 68 percent of the scholarship recipients are  minorities, right? </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  Sure. And there is a place for  charter schools. I think we can all agree upon that public schools have  allowed just some educated in this country 90 percent of children go to  public schools. </p><p>So, I think what critics are saying is that we need the funding, we need to  make sure that those public schools are taken care of because public  schools means community and that's a very important part of just our  society in general. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And reform, right? So, we have a New York Times reporter, let's  switch gears now, you guys, the New York Times reporting now facing a blow  back for an essay calling out white women saying white women are racist. In  the piece titled was that racist. Greg Howard writes, quote, \"When white  women are in my path on the street, they almost always continue straight,  forcing me to one side without changing their course. Why only and  specifically white women, do they refuse to acknowledge me, because they  have been taught that they should fear black men. And that any  acknowledgment of black men can invite danger.\" </p><p>Let's just take a quick check on New York Times stock closing the day in  the green of about 5 bucks year over year. Patrice, is what he's describing  is that racism? </p><p>ONWUKA:  No, I think it's looking for racism where it isn't. I mean,  certainly, there is a sense of entitlement that's replaced common courtesy,  but you know, when you're looking for racism in every single place, you  become kind of a chicken little, and then the real instances where it does  occur become, you know, it look absurd. People don't believe them anymore.</p><p>And I talked to a black man who happens to be my husband about this issue,  and he said, you know what? I think it has a lot more to do with people not  being courteous than it is for some sort of targeting by this, by white  women against black men. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Danielle, another quote from that piece read quote.  \"As a black man, I learned that body checking, bumping or even rubbing  against a random white woman can be personally hazardous.\" What did you  make of the piece, is this race basing what he is describing? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I didn't think it was race basing. I thought it was certainly  provocative and that's what this is meant to be if the call and states it  very clearly that this is what this is meant to be about. Challenging, I'm  a white woman, I walk the streets of New York City, I'm not engaging in any  of these behaviors. </p><p>And I think it's problematic when you take your own personal experience and  you expand it out to an entire population. And actually I agree that this - - I don't think this is an instance of racism. We should be focused on the  real instances of racism with the institutional or otherwise. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. So, Patrice, if this column this story was  edited before publication, why do you supposed the New York Times did not  pull the story and instead chose to ran with it? </p><p>NWUKA:  Because it's provocative, it gets people talking about it. I mean,  we've seen on Twitter how it blew up as a good way of drawing people into  this whole discussion. Apparently they are soliciting stories from people  talking about the question was this racist. You know, what's my, somebody  calling out tall, black marquees at Starbucks, an example of racism. When  in fact it was just, the guy was tall, and black and his copy was tall and  black and his name was Marquee (Ph). </p><p>So, it's another way of just kind of seeding racism where it doesn't  necessarily need to be, and again, attracting readers and viewership. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Patrice and Danielle, thanks so much for your thoughts there.  Good to see you, guys. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  KKR betting big on healthy living. Now the private equity  giants plans to buy WebMD health corp for 2.8 billion bucks. KKR will  combine WebMD's web site with its internet brand Unit which own sites like  Dentalplans.com and allaboutcounselling.com extending its footprints in the  web health market. </p><p>Next up, ruthless human smugglers blamed for the deaths of now 10 people  left in a truck in 100-degree Texas in San Antonio at a Wal-Mart. My next  guest says, sanctuary city are partly to blame. Former Immigration and  Customs agent, he is also border patrol agent, he is David Ward. He joins  me next. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The death toll now rising to 10 in what police are calling a  horrific human smuggling case where people died inside a sweltering 18- wheelering in San Antonio, about 150 miles from the U.S./Mexico border. Two  died after the incident. Eight died inside the truck. A total of 39 people  were inside the tractor. </p><p>At one point it was estimated 100 people were there in. At least two of  those who were injured were 15-year-old school age children. The driver now  in federal custody he is facing criminal charges, federal charges filed  today in federal court.</p><p>Joining me now, former Immigration and Customs agent and former U.S Border  Patrol agent, he is David Ward. David, one of the immigrant passengers said  people took turns breathing through a hole in the wall of the tractor  trailer. Now, sir, we know that border crossings are down under President  Trump, but what needs to be done to stop awful crimes like this? </p><p>DAVID WARD, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS:   Look, they are going to continue smuggling until we curtail the sanctuary  cities and until we put a secure border on our -- a secure fence on our  border. The cartels thrive on alien smuggling in addition to narcotics  trafficking. And both issues involve sanctuary cities. We have a huge  opioid problem. We have a huge alien smuggling problem and it all revolves  around sanctuary cities. </p><p>MACDONALD:  How do we know that this case of the 10 who are now dead and  the 39 injured, how do you know that this is connected to sanctuary cities? </p><p>WARD:  By the statements that were made that they were going to Houston,  and I believe there were other statements made in another sanctuary city,  those are sanctuary cities in the United States, the smugglers have opened  up their operations there. There is over 500 sanctuary cities in the United  States, but there is also over 500 cities that are influenced by Mexican  cartels and also the same cities. </p><p>If you got the DEA map of the drug cartel cities in the United States, and  the DEA just map of all the sanctuary city they are one and the same. So  any time you have a large operation like this it's going to have involve  sanctuary cities. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And sir, in response to this incident, Texas lieutenant  governor, he is Dan Patrick, he applauded laws against sanctuary cities in  a Facebook post. Writing quote, \"Today's tragedy is why I made passing  Texas Senate bill 4 to ban sanctuary cities in the state a top priority.  Now sanctuary cities entice to believe they can come to America in Texas  and live outside the law. Sanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and  cartels.\"</p><p>What is your reaction to that? </p><p>WARD:  Well, I absolutely agree with the governor. In fact, I don't  understand a lot of these chiefs of police in the sanctuary cities who come  out and state that if they enforce immigration law that they wouldn't have  witnesses to testify in their cases, criminal cases. </p><p>The thing of it is that the same people that are witnesses are actually the  ones committing the crimes. And until they got a hand on the sanctuary  cities our crime is going to continue to go up. Look at the opioid problem,  we have thousands of people dying now. It's so bad that the Reagan they put  opioid treatment into the new healthcare bill. That's how bad it is.</p><p>If they would address the illegal alien population in these cities they  would take that attraction away. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, sir, the acting head of the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement basically agency, naming the worst sanctuary cities in the  country as Chicago, New York City and San Francisco, he is calling them  quote, \"un-American,\" do you agree with that? </p><p>WARD:  Absolutely. All these officials have taken an oath to our U.S.  Constitution to support and defend all the laws of this country. And yet,  here they are pushing away the immigration law, making it difficult for  immigration agents to even operate in those city, turning their backs on  our officers and in fact, they even are endangering our officers who are  out there trying to do their job in the sanctuary cities, but not getting  the support they needed from their local counterparts. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Mr. Ward, thank you for coming on the show. We really  appreciate it.</p><p>WARD:  You're quite welcome, Liz. Have a good day. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We're awaiting President Trump's speech at the National Boy  Scout jamboree in West Virginia. We will bring it to you when the president  arrives. </p><p>Next up, we have this story for you. Millennials often criticized as  spoiled and bratty, lazy. Maybe that's unfair, not very nice. But we've got  one musician he decides to write a song about that. He is musician Micah  Tyler, he is here to talk about the motivation beyond -- behind his  millennial parody, it's now going viral. You're going to stay for this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Pretty funny. Millennials often criticized as spoiled, entitled  even lazy. That inspired my next guest to write a song. Musician Micah  Tyler has a new album coming out called different, it's debuting October  20th. </p><p>Music industry sellers, streamers, producer like Sony, Apple, Sirius. Let's  take a look at their stock, they're closing the day mixed today. Amazon is  hitting a new all-time high. </p><p>Let's bring in Micah Tyler to talk about his song. Good to see you, Micah. </p><p>MICAH TYLER, MUSICIAN:  Hey, good to see you, guys too. Thanks for having  me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How did come up with the song? It's pretty funny. </p><p>TYLER:  Well, it's one of those things. The little inspiration probably  came from the mirror, I'm actually a millennial myself. And I got a call  from a church conference. The church that I parody with over in Dallas, the  church it's called Watermark Church. And they had called me and asked me if  I would bring up and make up some different songs. </p><p>I've appeared for them before, kind of interim people but they want the  intros in different topics that have some stigmas that have some  stereotypes attach to them, one of the topics was millennials. They asked  me to make a song that would kind of intro the topic, and in context it  made a lot more sense.</p><p>The video played listing every stereotype that I could find that I could or  think of that they've given me, and then we made the song, it was followed  by this talk about how millennials are more in the stereotypes that are  attached to them, that were a generation that history hope to be looked  back on us being -- trying to explore new things and dream really big and  go out there and make a difference with this growing up and not be, you  know, held to our coffee and Instagrams. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I think you just have -- yes, that's a good point. You just  have a line in the song, I think that millennial could be our next  president. But here is another part of the song that is funny. Let's --  it's at the end. Let's take a listen. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you took that into a funeral dirge there, Micah. You agree  that we are going to have a millennial president. What are you worried  about? </p><p>TYLER:  Listen, the thing is if we want to live up to the generalities that  have been in place on your generation, then yes. We're in for quite four  years one day. But you know, this is all totally done, tongue in cheek, it  must be something really fun. It was just done for this conference, we  didn't even know that it was going to be put up on Facebook, we did it last  April. </p><p>The church posted it and it kind of went nuts and the last year it had over  100 million views. It got (Inaudible) research and someone posted it last  week it has another, you know, 15 million view this week. But again, the  context of it was to be something fun, to kind of just laugh at ourselves a  little bit, some of the labels that have been attached to us. But you know,  I'm hoping we can get it together. I had hope for our generation. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, one of my Twitter followers, what song is Micah  parodying? What's the name of it? Tweet me your answer. </p><p>TYLER:  Fine.</p><p>MACDONALD:  College students in Berkeley and NYU burned things down to  block conservative speakers from speaking. So, what is -- when you those  stories what was your reaction? </p><p>TYLER:  Here's the deal. We -- it would be really hard thing if every time  that some one person did something we would completely blanket an entire  generation, and entire people group, an entire age whatever, with some  decisions that people have their own freewill to be able to make. All I can  do...</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>TYLER:  ... is try to be encouraging and try to be positive out there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  There you go, Micah, your new album, Different, out October  20th. We wish you good luck, sir. Thanks for coming on. </p><p>Donald Trump just tweeting out any senator who votes again starting debate  is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare. The  president also posted of his remarks echoing that earlier today. </p><p>This follows Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying on the floor  that the vote to proceed on debating health reform will start tomorrow.  Senate majority whip John Cornyn says Senate John McCain diagnosed with  brain cancer, he is trying to get approval for his travel arrangements to  possibly show up for a vote. We're on that story for you. We'll be right  back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  President Trump about to speak to the boy scouts in West  Virginia at the National Boy Scouts jamboree. Fox Business will bring it to  you live when the president speaks. </p><p>That does it for us tonight. Thank you for having us in your homes.

Senate republicans expected to vote sometime this week, perhaps as early as tomorrow to begin debate on Obamacare reform.</p><p>Welcome to Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Liz MacDonald in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>The Dow closing down 66 points today, the NASDAQ ending at an all-time high with big tech earnings. But Alphabet, the parent of the search giant Googlejust reported a drop in second quarter profit. It was hurt by more than $2.7 billion fine from European antitrust regulators.</p><p>Now let's get back to the president, speaking on healthcare reform this afternoon pushing to get Obamacare reform through before the August recess. He issued a warning yesterday, saying \"If republicans do not repeal and replace Obamacare the disastrous Obamacare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand.\"</p><p>This as new CBO numbers demolish the democrat fear mongering, the analysis showing nearly three quarters of the 22 million estimated who will drop coverage under Obamacare reform, will do so voluntarily, they'll choose to drop it when the individual mandate tax goes away. That's according to the CBO analysis brought to us by the National Review.</p><p>In other words, 16 million will voluntarily drop out of the market by 2026 because it will no longer face a financial penalty for doing so. No talk of that in Congress, instead of the democrats like Chuck Schumer they say they want to buy partisan fix with the GOP.</p><p>But behind the scenes, democrats now in both the House and the Senate, they see a jackpot pass to victory in winning back Congress next year, their big plan is big government health Medicare for all, which in theory provides nearly universal coverage through the government rather than private insurer.</p><p>Bow Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on ABC on Sunday that quote, \"We are going to look at broader things for the nation's healthcare system, singer payer is one of them.\"</p><p><person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>already mapping out victory next year on single payer. Jimmy Carter just moments ago saying the U.S. eventually will have single payer, and the CEO of one of five largest public insurers in the U.S. he is a CEO, he is Mark Bertolini, though he's not for single payer he reportedly recently did say at a private conference that U.S. should start considering it.</p><p>And business titan Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are also recently supporting the single payer idea.</p><p>Let's take it to former Florida Congressman, he is retired lieutenant colonel Allen West. He joins me now. Colonel, what do you think of this democrat momentum behind single payer and Medicare for all?</p><p>ALLEN WEST, FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: Well, it's good to be with you, Liz. And first of all, that has always been the intention for the Democrat Party. If you really look at Obamacare the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act was doomed to fail. When we look at co-ops when we look at the exchanges, we look at the lack of insurance coverage out there this is all resolved.</p><p>It is not affordable. We know that. It is not protective patients. And I find it very interesting that Jimmy Carter would come out and speak about a single pair system because it was in 1978 that President Carter said that every American had the right to own a home with his Community Reinvestment Act.</p><p>And 30 years later we had a financial collapse that was due to the mortgage crisis here in the United States of America which began with his logic. So here once again we're going to try to have a Medicaid or Medicare for all, when the almost 66 percent of federal budget right now, Medicare, Medicaid, and social security that interest of the debt is consumed by these mandatory spending programs, that means that we're not going to be able to afford.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Irving Institute, to your point, says that Medicare for all will cost $32 trillion over 10 years, the first is cost alone, Colonel, $2.5 trillion, that's more than the market value of Google, Apple, Microsoft, AT, and Facebook combined.</p><p>WEST: No, you're absolutely right. And so it ends up consuming, which is one-sixth of our economy healthcare, it will end up consuming our entire budget. And it's interesting that recently out in California they tried to go with a single payer system there, and they pulled the legislation because it will cost too much. What does that tell you?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, we're going to get to that in a second. But first this, sir. Minnesota democrat and deputy chair of the DNC, he is Keith Ellison he is now pushing for America to become like Cuba when it comes to healthcare. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEITH ELLISON, (D) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: Why is it the countries like Cuba or Canada or Russia or a lot of places in this world spend half of what we spend per capita and they got better health outcomes than we do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Canada, I mean, they are flying here for their health outcomes.</p><p>WEST: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: And does this show the ignorance of democrats like Keith Ellison. I mean, in Cuba it's been showing time and again that party elites, the military foreign tourists, they get the best medical care while the Cuban workers and the Cuban people are left with dirty hospitals and disarray and shortages of medicine.</p><p>WEST: You're absolutely right. And you know, when I represented the people down in South Florida, I never saw any boats leaving South Florida to go to Cuba for healthcare. Just the same as when we have these snowbirds that came down from Canada, they would have an incredible influx of Canadians coming in for healthcare appointments, things that they could not get done because of the single payer system in Canada.</p><p>So, I think he fells and if he really thinks socialize medicine is so great maybe he can go down to Venezuela and get a, you know, a medical appointment there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, it's an interesting point. You know, Colonel, Vermont Senator <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>t what you were just noting earlier, he is ripping into California democrats for pulling back on a $400 billion single payer healthcare bill, they are worried in California about cost concerns, that's 400 billion is more than double the size of California's budget. And didn't <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>home State of Vermont single payer almost bankrupt the state? I mean 400 billion quickly becomes 800 billion, right?</p><p>WEST: No, you're absolutely right. And when you think about the CalPERS the pension plan out there for the government bureaucracy and the union that they have in California, you talk about a state that's going bankrupt. We see cities in the State of California that are going bankrupt.</p><p>And so they know that this is a failing system. Single payer does not work. Ask the parents of Charlie Gard over in England how they feel about the single payer system when the government is making the decisions about whether or not their child can live.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's a good point. Meantime, the president's son-in-law, he is White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, he was on Capitol Hill testifying behind closed-doors. He was not under oath on the investigation of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED KUSHNER, <person><nameText>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S </nameText></person>SON-IN-LAW: I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses. And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested information. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>had a better message and ran a smarter campaign and that is why he won.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Mr. Kushner also said he did not read e-mails that showed the president's eldest son <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>Jr. accepted this June 2016 meeting with the idea that he would get damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Colonel, what do you think of Mr. Kushner today?</p><p>WEST: Well, I think that he did what was the right thing, to go and put this to rest, but it's never going to be put to rest. You know, we need the people there on Capitol Hill the House and Senate republicans who are in charge to say enough of this already, enough of taxpayer funds that have been wasted on this witch-hunt that is a conviction that is looking for evidence. That's basically what it is.</p><p>Let's talk about Hillary Clinton and her uranium deals. Let's talk about the fact that we are going to have more flexibility after our reelection with Russia with what President Obama said. let's talk about the leaks that are emanating out of Washington, D.C. of classified information. That's where the focus should be.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Mr. Kushner is expected to basically testify before a House panel, House intelligence tomorrow. We believe it's not under oath that it could be behind closed. It's not going to be held public.</p><p>To your point, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tweeting out, \"So why aren't the committees investigators and of course, our beleaguered A.G. Jeff Sessions looking into crooked Hillary's crimes and Russia relations.\" Another shot Jeff Sessions there. What do you think of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>tweet right there?</p><p>WEST: You know, if this one thing you never want to criticize a member of your team, especially an attorney general. And I think that that does not do bode well for bolstering his position of influence and his position of power as the attorney general when you have the president that is putting out those types of tweets. Or when you have the interview that he did last week in New York Times. If you got a problem with Attorney General Sessions you need to do it off line behind closed doors.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Kushner said that raising questions about Russian election activity ridicules people who voted for Trump, saying <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>had a better message and ran a smatter campaign, and that is why he won. He is saying suggesting otherwise, ridicules those who voted for him.</p><p>I mean, here is the thing, Colonel, we have a number of probes into Russia, including Robert Mueller, they'll get to the bottom of it. Do you agree with Jared Kushner on that point?</p><p>WEST: Well, I think that this is a big distraction, when you look at the polling out there the American people are not concerned about Russia. The American people are concerned about getting back to work. The American are concerned about affordable healthcare. The American people are concerned about economic growth and they are concerned national security.</p><p>But you see once again, the Democrat Party is becoming a party of distractions not even resistance. So I think we need to get discipline, we need to get focused and someone needs to tell Mr. Mueller, you got 30 days or 60 days whatever, if you don't come up with something based upon your original guidance and the purpose, then you should be -- this thing should be ended.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Colonel. Good to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>WEST: Always a pleasure, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Search giant Google's parent company Alphabet reporting a second quarter profit that dropped sharply versus a year before. It was hurt by a big $2.74 billion anti-trust fine out of Europe. Shares off almost 3 percent in after-hours trading despite being up more than 25 percent year-to-date.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer taking a page from <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>playbook, and now the democrats now plan to focus on jobs. The man who confronted Hillary for killing coal jobs during the election is here. He is West Virginia coal miner Bo Copley, he will respond.</p><p>Also later in show, a musician calling out millennials with a parody song, he is here to talk about it later in the show, so stick around, it's pretty funny.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) UNITED STATES SENATOR: When you lose an election with someone who has a 40 percent popularity, you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong. And the number one things that we did wrong is we didn't have -- we didn't tell people what we stood before, even today. Week after week, month after month, we're going to roll out specific pieces here that are quite different than the Democratic Party you head in the past, we were too cautious, we were too namby-pamby.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer now acknowledging that democrats have a big brand image problem. He is now trying to argue that the democrats lost the last election, well, they lost four elections since 2010 because the democrats did not tell the working voter what the democrats stand for.</p><p>Polls show that majority think democrats stand for just opposing Trump. But now Schumer said democrats are trying to sell a better deal for the American worker. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: We're going to raise people's wages and create better paying jobs. We're going to cut down on their everyday expenses they have to pay. And we're going to give them the tools they need to compete in the 21th century.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: No details on exactly how the democrats' plan to do that. U.S. voters saw what the democrats stood for going back to 2010. They rejected their big tax, big government spending big government regulation back -- starting in 2010 through 2016.</p><p>And despite all of this attack even Chuck Schumer himself said a few years ago, that Obama should not have focused on big government spending on that $800 billion stimulus plan, instead he should have focused on jobs and growth.</p><p>And we just showed you government data showing 863,000 jobs have been added since <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>took office. The U.S. labor market rebounded in June ending 222,000 jobs.</p><p>Let's go to West Virginia coal miner who confronted Hillary Clinton about trying to get rid of coal jobs during the last election, he is Bo Copley, he joins me now. Good to see you, Bo. What do you think of what Chuck Schumer is now saying?</p><p>BO COPLEY, COAL MINER: Thanks for having us on, Liz.</p><p>I think it's interesting that I guess they see now that, you know, the working class people were a huge factor in what got <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>elected as president. I don't think that -- I don't think their message was not what we stand for, you know, not telling people what we stand for is how we lost the election. I think they told people what they stood for. And I think it was a complete paradox to what the working class American is.</p><p>I think what they telling people that they stood for was handouts and a lot of free things that they were promising that came off of the backs of the working class.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's a good point. I mean, the democrats have been saying, you know, you didn't build that. The government helped you build that, you're too stupid to understand Obamacare, that was Jonathan Gruber, the economist who said that.</p><p>And Schumer is now saying, Bo, that Trump actually used, he used American workers to get elected. Do you agree with that?</p><p>COPLEY: Absolutely, he used them. He told us what we wanted to hear, and we put him into office. And so far he is trying very hard to deliver on the promises that he made us. So, you know, I don't know if use is the right word, but he told us what we wanted to hear, and so far he is working very hard to make that happen.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. So, I mean, it's been eight years where I think the American voter has seen what the democrats are about. And I think it's really about, you know, incumbency is the problem. I mean, Nancy Pelosi has been around since the Reagan era, Chuck Schumer has been around for 30 years.</p><p>And what they're suggesting, Bo is it looks like more big government <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>ideas and small government pro-growth tax cut like JFK. What do you think?</p><p>COPLEY: Well, you know, if you look at our state, Liz, our state is predominantly been a democratic state, and that's one of the reasons why we're doing what we're doing. I'm a firm believer in term limits, and that's one of the reasons why we're running for Senate.</p><p>You know, we have a democratic representative in Joe Manchin who as you know was for Hillary Clinton and was opposed to <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>And you know, his alliance with Democratic Party -- our state has turned completely around so much so that we haven't carried a democratic president since Bill Clinton a second term.</p><p>And you know, I think the people of this state have realized that how far that the Democratic Party has shifted over the last 20 to 30 years, and that they are starting to see that you know, they're not the party that they should be and they're not representing the state the way that they should.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, so we had Hillary Clinton and the democrats going after coal jobs, and now Chuck Schumer saying he wants to go after the big companies and the grocery business and healthcare, and the cable business. I mean, to that end, the democrats have also reportedly settled on a new slogan and tag line for next year's elections, Bo.</p><p>And it sound really familiar, Bo. I want you to take a listen to the democrat -- what the democrat's new slogan sound like. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, Bo, they are being made fun of for their new slogan. What do you think? Their new slogan by the way, Bo, is a better deal, let's show it. A better jobs, better wages, better future. I mean, let's see, make America great again versus that, what do you think?</p><p>COPLEY: Well, I am all for making America great again for sure. You know, you can slice things up the way you want to and serve it the way that you want to. But ultimately, you have to know what kind of substance is behind this kind of promises; you can't just throw those out there.</p><p>So they may be able to make a better wage or whatever the rest of that tag is. But we need to see how they plan on doing it and see if it's something that's viable to the American people.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, they're making it like there is a big government pizza pie of income that the government get the slice up at hands out, but that's not how it works, right, Bo? You've seen that.</p><p>COPLEY: Well, I know for us, in any thin we've ever wanted we had to go out and work for it. So I'm not sure that, I'm not sure how much the government is slicing up and handing out, I'm sure we are to a plenty of people.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>COPLEY: And I think that's a -- I think those are the kind of people that we have to kind of trying wean off of the kinds of the programs that we have right now.</p><p>MACDONALD: Bo Copley, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for coming on. We love having you on.</p><p>COPLEY: Thanks for having us on, Liz. And if you don't care, go out and take a look at boforw.com.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>COPLEY: And check out our policies.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sure. Thank you, Bo. Thanks again.</p><p>Now this, even as gas prices drop to a 12-year low, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claiming the prices have only gone up. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: People hate it when their cable bills go up, their airline fees. They know that gas prices they're sticky, you know, when the domestic price goes -- when the price for oil goes up on the market. It goes right up but it never goes down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, national average price of gas settling today $2.28 a gallon of regular, down from $2.32, per gallon when <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>took office. Gas prices actually going down.</p><p>Next, newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci taking on CNN for the first time. We've got the highlights.</p><p>Also a musician deciding to write a song, calling out today's millennial, his video now going viral, he is here talk about it later in the show, so stick around</p><p>MACDONALD: Newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci taking on CNN for the first time in his official role.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, HOST, CNN: A lot of people, Anthony, will read that op-ed, they'll read the tweets that you spent the weekend deleting that were pro- gun control.</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: Pro-action on climate change and they all think, wowm this guy is willing to suppress everything he believes in order to get close to power. What is your answer?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: That's true.</p><p>TAPPER: What is your answer to that?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: That's totally -- especially that's a ridiculous Washington sort of narrative. Let me tell you something about demagoguery that I don't like, OK? Demagoguery, OK, creates a lot of nonsense like this. He's going to win again, Jake, he's going to win again. I will bring a box of Kleenex over here to CNN.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAPPER: You don't -- we don't need Kleenex.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: He will win in 2020. He is going to win, Jake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's take a look at Time Warner stock, the parent company of CNN closing slightly in the green for the day. The stock is up year over year.</p><p>Joining me now Donald J. Trump for president advisory board member, he is Jeff DeWit. Good to see you, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF DEWIT, FORMER ARIZONA STATE TREASURER: Great to see you, Liz. Thanks for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD: It looks like you are already working on <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>next election, right?</p><p>DEWIT: Well, you know, there are a lot of people out there that can't wait to support him in all the upcoming elections. And he know he's going to have a lot to say even over the midterms because he does control a big voting block of patriotic Americans.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>DEWIT: They are going to support the candidates that support him.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you see what Jake tapper was asking Scaramucci, you deleted tweets, you know, he's just trying to get close to power, you did not support <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>you're for other candidates. What did you think of that interview there?</p><p>DEWIT: I thought Anthony handled himself very well, you know, he is very, very sharp, he's very capable and he's very popular within the campaign. He is a doer and I think he brings an authentic voice to this. I don't want to saying about Sean, he's a great guy. But Anthony really brings that business minded voice that really speaks more for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>I think.</p><p>I thought Anthony handled himself very well. So far everything he has done has been great. You know, look, people have evolve from their views, and so if you're looking for something from a long time with some things he said, yes, things are different as they evolve.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>DEWIT: You know, there is a famous quote in politics that it says, if you're not a democrat in your 20s you don't have a heart, and if you haven't turn a republican by your 30s you don't have a brain. So, people have evolved in their views. But I know where Anthony stands now and he aligns wholly with <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>agenda.</p><p>MACDONALD: You see, it's interesting throughout this whole process you see whether it's a democrat or a republican guest, the journalists asking the question, doesn't like to be asked questions back or challenge, that's clear here in what we're seeing unfold in Washington, the D.C. beltway and the media coverage.</p><p>You know, Anthony Scaramucci also vowed to take drastic action to stop White House leaks. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCARAMUCCI: If the leaks don't stop, I'm going to pare down the staff because it's just not right for us. I think it's not fair to the president; it's actually not fair to America or the people in the government. But something is going on inside the White House that the president does not like and we're going to fix it.</p><p>I would like to reset the culture inside that commerce department so that people recognize that I'm actually there to serve them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Jeff, where are the leaks coming from?</p><p>DEWIT: You know, the leaks are from people that have their own political agenda.</p><p>MACDONALD: Who?</p><p>DEWIT: Either they're leftover from Obama.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Is it just Obama?</p><p>DEWIT: I don't know. Personally, I can't name names.</p><p>MACDONALD: Is it just Obama officials? Well, who...</p><p>DEWIT: No, you know, there are people in there that seem to have their own agenda, but what they don't realize they're not just trying -- thwarting the <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>agenda. But they are actually causing harm for our country. I mean, this puts our country at risk.</p><p>The fact that Russia knows now that we can listen to the conversations between, you know, Putin and his ambassador, I don't -- that was because of a leak. Now Russia obviously is going to scramble their communications or do something different, that's something that should never be out there.</p><p>But it's also dragging good people through the mud. You look at Jared Kushner who on his own, he went down, he has to go down, he shows everything. But this is someone who is a patriotic American, a hardworking very successful man, who is a great dad and a great husband, but now has to go down and have all his business looked into because of these leaks...</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>DEWIT: ... for people just trying to thwart it. So these are great people that are getting drag to the mud and they shouldn't be. And again, go back to Comey hearings.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>DEWIT: There is no evidence that Russia did anything in the campaign. I can tell you as the COO of the campaign, there was no involvement with other countries.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right. And to your point, Susan Rice is no longer expected to testify about unmasking. She's no longer expected to testify for lawmakers.</p><p>We did have <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>son-in-law, White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, as you point out, Jeff. He met with Senate intelligence committee today. He said he did not collude with Russians. He is expected to speak to House intelligence tomorrow, where is this headed?</p><p>DEWIT: Well, it's headed nowhere, because we all inside the campaign know that there is nothing there. We won because <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is a great candidate with a superior message that resonated to all the hardworking patriotic Americans in the Midwest that were sick of the politicians shipping their jobs overseas. That's why <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>won.</p><p>And if the race were held again today, he would beat Hillary Clinton by a bigger margin. So it's going nowhere. I think what the best thing was Chuck Schumer yesterday, basically and the Democratic Party admitting why they lost, as you point out, which is because they don't have a message anymore.</p><p>They don't have an economic platform, and now they're adapting <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>message to try to promote that. So it's going to go nowhere. And to see good people like Jared get dragged through the mud, it's not fair. It's not fair to him and it's not fair to America.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>DEWIT: Let's move on, let's get down to the business of fixing our country.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jeff DeWit, good to see you. Thanks for coming on the show.</p><p>DEWIT: Always great, Liz. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Next up, the wildfires in Canada pushing up the price of lumber as that fire threatens the supply to U.S. homebuilders.</p><p>Canada's wildfires it turned out to be the toughest on the lumber industry in over a decade. Homebuilders in the U.S. now fear that prices might climb even higher as wholesalers try to restock in the midst of this price surge due to the really just destructive fire. It's real tragedy going on there.</p><p>We have a New York Times reporter feeling the heat after accusing white women of showing racism on sidewalks. Coming up, hear how he thinks white women show racism. Also, you know, getting a better education -- is getting a better education for your children is that racist? Is school choice racist?</p><p>The American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten seems to think so. We're going to have her comments after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Is getting a better education for your children racist? The American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten think that school choice is racist. She also said that's a movement to give parents more say over where their children go to school has its roots in, not just racism but also sexism, classism, xenophobia and homophobia. Calling the programs, quote, polite cousins of segregation.</p><p>Let's look at education stocks like Strayer Education and American Public closing in the red today.</p><p>Joining me now, Independent Women's Forum, Patrice Onwuka, and democrat strategist, Danielle McLaughlin. First to you, Patrice. Randi Weingarten continues to say quote, \"This privatization and this investment are only slightly more polite cousins of segregation.\" Is that a little over broad?</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: It absolutely is. It's a great way of trying to whip up some support by claiming racism when, in fact, when we look at the most segregated schools and district they happened to be in democratically controlled cities.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Danielle, school choice, doesn't actually help low income minority children? I mean, Florida's private school choice program the largest in the nation, 68 percent of the scholarship recipients are minorities, right?</p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST: Sure. And there is a place for charter schools. I think we can all agree upon that public schools have allowed just some educated in this country 90 percent of children go to public schools.</p><p>So, I think what critics are saying is that we need the funding, we need to make sure that those public schools are taken care of because public schools means community and that's a very important part of just our society in general.</p><p>MACDONALD: And reform, right? So, we have a New York Times reporter, let's switch gears now, you guys, the New York Times reporting now facing a blow back for an essay calling out white women saying white women are racist. In the piece titled was that racist. Greg Howard writes, quote, \"When white women are in my path on the street, they almost always continue straight, forcing me to one side without changing their course. Why only and specifically white women, do they refuse to acknowledge me, because they have been taught that they should fear black men. And that any acknowledgment of black men can invite danger.\"</p><p>Let's just take a quick check on New York Times stock closing the day in the green of about 5 bucks year over year. Patrice, is what he's describing is that racism?</p><p>ONWUKA: No, I think it's looking for racism where it isn't. I mean, certainly, there is a sense of entitlement that's replaced common courtesy, but you know, when you're looking for racism in every single place, you become kind of a chicken little, and then the real instances where it does occur become, you know, it look absurd. People don't believe them anymore.</p><p>And I talked to a black man who happens to be my husband about this issue, and he said, you know what? I think it has a lot more to do with people not being courteous than it is for some sort of targeting by this, by white women against black men.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Danielle, another quote from that piece read quote. \"As a black man, I learned that body checking, bumping or even rubbing against a random white woman can be personally hazardous.\" What did you make of the piece, is this race basing what he is describing?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I didn't think it was race basing. I thought it was certainly provocative and that's what this is meant to be if the call and states it very clearly that this is what this is meant to be about. Challenging, I'm a white woman, I walk the streets of New York City, I'm not engaging in any of these behaviors.</p><p>And I think it's problematic when you take your own personal experience and you expand it out to an entire population. And actually I agree that this - - I don't think this is an instance of racism. We should be focused on the real instances of racism with the institutional or otherwise.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's a good point. So, Patrice, if this column this story was edited before publication, why do you supposed the New York Times did not pull the story and instead chose to ran with it?</p><p>NWUKA: Because it's provocative, it gets people talking about it. I mean, we've seen on Twitter how it blew up as a good way of drawing people into this whole discussion. Apparently they are soliciting stories from people talking about the question was this racist. You know, what's my, somebody calling out tall, black marquees at Starbucks, an example of racism. When in fact it was just, the guy was tall, and black and his copy was tall and black and his name was Marquee (Ph).</p><p>So, it's another way of just kind of seeding racism where it doesn't necessarily need to be, and again, attracting readers and viewership.</p><p>MACDONALD: Patrice and Danielle, thanks so much for your thoughts there. Good to see you, guys.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: KKR betting big on healthy living. Now the private equity giants plans to buy WebMD health corp for 2.8 billion bucks. KKR will combine WebMD's web site with its internet brand Unit which own sites like Dentalplans.com and allaboutcounselling.com extending its footprints in the web health market.</p><p>Next up, ruthless human smugglers blamed for the deaths of now 10 people left in a truck in 100-degree Texas in San Antonio at a Wal-Mart. My next guest says, sanctuary city are partly to blame. Former Immigration and Customs agent, he is also border patrol agent, he is David Ward. He joins me next. Don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: The death toll now rising to 10 in what police are calling a horrific human smuggling case where people died inside a sweltering 18- wheelering in San Antonio, about 150 miles from the U.S./Mexico border. Two died after the incident. Eight died inside the truck. A total of 39 people were inside the tractor.</p><p>At one point it was estimated 100 people were there in. At least two of those who were injured were 15-year-old school age children. The driver now in federal custody he is facing criminal charges, federal charges filed today in federal court.</p><p>Joining me now, former Immigration and Customs agent and former U.S Border Patrol agent, he is David Ward. David, one of the immigrant passengers said people took turns breathing through a hole in the wall of the tractor trailer. Now, sir, we know that border crossings are down under <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>but what needs to be done to stop awful crimes like this?</p><p>DAVID WARD, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS: Look, they are going to continue smuggling until we curtail the sanctuary cities and until we put a secure border on our -- a secure fence on our border. The cartels thrive on alien smuggling in addition to narcotics trafficking. And both issues involve sanctuary cities. We have a huge opioid problem. We have a huge alien smuggling problem and it all revolves around sanctuary cities.</p><p>MACDONALD: How do we know that this case of the 10 who are now dead and the 39 injured, how do you know that this is connected to sanctuary cities?</p><p>WARD: By the statements that were made that they were going to Houston, and I believe there were other statements made in another sanctuary city, those are sanctuary cities in the United States, the smugglers have opened up their operations there. There is over 500 sanctuary cities in the United States, but there is also over 500 cities that are influenced by Mexican cartels and also the same cities.</p><p>If you got the DEA map of the drug cartel cities in the United States, and the DEA just map of all the sanctuary city they are one and the same. So any time you have a large operation like this it's going to have involve sanctuary cities.</p><p>MACDONALD: And sir, in response to this incident, Texas lieutenant governor, he is Dan Patrick, he applauded laws against sanctuary cities in a Facebook post. Writing quote, \"Today's tragedy is why I made passing Texas Senate bill 4 to ban sanctuary cities in the state a top priority. Now sanctuary cities entice to believe they can come to America in Texas and live outside the law. Sanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and cartels.\"</p><p>What is your reaction to that?</p><p>WARD: Well, I absolutely agree with the governor. In fact, I don't understand a lot of these chiefs of police in the sanctuary cities who come out and state that if they enforce immigration law that they wouldn't have witnesses to testify in their cases, criminal cases.</p><p>The thing of it is that the same people that are witnesses are actually the ones committing the crimes. And until they got a hand on the sanctuary cities our crime is going to continue to go up. Look at the opioid problem, we have thousands of people dying now. It's so bad that the Reagan they put opioid treatment into the new healthcare bill. That's how bad it is.</p><p>If they would address the illegal alien population in these cities they would take that attraction away.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, sir, the acting head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement basically agency, naming the worst sanctuary cities in the country as Chicago, New York City and San Francisco, he is calling them quote, \"un-American,\" do you agree with that?</p><p>WARD: Absolutely. All these officials have taken an oath to our U.S. Constitution to support and defend all the laws of this country. And yet, here they are pushing away the immigration law, making it difficult for immigration agents to even operate in those city, turning their backs on our officers and in fact, they even are endangering our officers who are out there trying to do their job in the sanctuary cities, but not getting the support they needed from their local counterparts.</p><p>MACDONALD: Mr. Ward, thank you for coming on the show. We really appreciate it.</p><p>WARD: You're quite welcome, Liz. Have a good day.</p><p>MACDONALD: We're awaiting <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>speech at the National Boy Scout jamboree in West Virginia. We will bring it to you when the president arrives.</p><p>Next up, we have this story for you. Millennials often criticized as spoiled and bratty, lazy. Maybe that's unfair, not very nice. But we've got one musician he decides to write a song about that. He is musician Micah Tyler, he is here to talk about the motivation beyond -- behind his millennial parody, it's now going viral. You're going to stay for this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Pretty funny. Millennials often criticized as spoiled, entitled even lazy. That inspired my next guest to write a song. Musician Micah Tyler has a new album coming out called different, it's debuting October 20th.</p><p>Music industry sellers, streamers, producer like Sony, Apple, Sirius. Let's take a look at their stock, they're closing the day mixed today. Amazon is hitting a new all-time high.</p><p>Let's bring in Micah Tyler to talk about his song. Good to see you, Micah.</p><p>MICAH TYLER, MUSICIAN: Hey, good to see you, guys too. Thanks for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD: How did come up with the song? It's pretty funny.</p><p>TYLER: Well, it's one of those things. The little inspiration probably came from the mirror, I'm actually a millennial myself. And I got a call from a church conference. The church that I parody with over in Dallas, the church it's called Watermark Church. And they had called me and asked me if I would bring up and make up some different songs.</p><p>I've appeared for them before, kind of interim people but they want the intros in different topics that have some stigmas that have some stereotypes attach to them, one of the topics was millennials. They asked me to make a song that would kind of intro the topic, and in context it made a lot more sense.</p><p>The video played listing every stereotype that I could find that I could or think of that they've given me, and then we made the song, it was followed by this talk about how millennials are more in the stereotypes that are attached to them, that were a generation that history hope to be looked back on us being -- trying to explore new things and dream really big and go out there and make a difference with this growing up and not be, you know, held to our coffee and Instagrams.</p><p>MACDONALD: I think you just have -- yes, that's a good point. You just have a line in the song, I think that millennial could be our next president. But here is another part of the song that is funny. Let's -- it's at the end. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD: So you took that into a funeral dirge there, Micah. You agree that we are going to have a millennial president. What are you worried about?</p><p>TYLER: Listen, the thing is if we want to live up to the generalities that have been in place on your generation, then yes. We're in for quite four years one day. But you know, this is all totally done, tongue in cheek, it must be something really fun. It was just done for this conference, we didn't even know that it was going to be put up on Facebook, we did it last April.</p><p>The church posted it and it kind of went nuts and the last year it had over 100 million views. It got (Inaudible) research and someone posted it last week it has another, you know, 15 million view this week. But again, the context of it was to be something fun, to kind of just laugh at ourselves a little bit, some of the labels that have been attached to us. But you know, I'm hoping we can get it together. I had hope for our generation.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, one of my Twitter followers, what song is Micah parodying? What's the name of it? Tweet me your answer.</p><p>TYLER: Fine.</p><p>MACDONALD: College students in Berkeley and NYU burned things down to block conservative speakers from speaking. So, what is -- when you those stories what was your reaction?</p><p>TYLER: Here's the deal. We -- it would be really hard thing if every time that some one person did something we would completely blanket an entire generation, and entire people group, an entire age whatever, with some decisions that people have their own freewill to be able to make. All I can do...</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>TYLER: ... is try to be encouraging and try to be positive out there.</p><p>MACDONALD: There you go, Micah, your new album, Different, out October 20th. We wish you good luck, sir. Thanks for coming on.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>just tweeting out any senator who votes again starting debate is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare. The president also posted of his remarks echoing that earlier today.</p><p>This follows Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying on the floor that the vote to proceed on debating health reform will start tomorrow. Senate majority whip John Cornyn says Senate John McCain diagnosed with brain cancer, he is trying to get approval for his travel arrangements to possibly show up for a vote.

The executive order also demands the social media giants provide transparency requirements for their moderation practices! A statement from the White House Press Secretary[3] says the following: On Monday, the Department of Commerce, as directed by President Donald J. Trump's Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship, filed a petition to clarify the scope of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. The petition requests that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) clarify that Section 230 does not permit social media companies that alter or editorialize users' speech to escape civil liability. </p><p>The petition also requests that the FCC clarify when an online platform curates content in 'good faith,' and requests transparency requirements on their moderation practices, similar to requirements imposed on broadband service providers under Title I of the Communications Act. President Trump will continue to fight back against unfair, un-American, and politically biased censorship of Americans online. The original order was signed on May 28th of this year, but yesterday's effort directs the FCC to clarify that social media companies that editorialize or alter (or delete or block, by extension) users' speech cannot escape civil liability. The president spoke about this when he signed the order: [embedded content] One would be led to believe that this executive order would immediately guarantee that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, et. al., would immediately release their censorship actions taken against their subscribers. However, at the time of this writing, I remain in a state we call 'Facebook Jail' where I am unable to post articles fromThe Duran across to Facebook interest groups I do not personally administer. The censorship as of this moment appears to be alive and well, and further so, as the CEO's interviewed in yesterday's hearing[4] all denied that their companies practice censorship, despite an enormous body of evidence to the contrary. It would seem that they are not going to let go of their power easily. The US Commerce Department said the following on their website:[5]Today, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) filed a petition for rulemaking with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on behalf of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross seeking to clarify regulations related to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The petition was filed[6] in response to the May 2020 Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship. It calls on the FCC to make clear when online platforms can claim section 230 protections if they restrict access to content in a manner not specifically outlined under the Act. 'Many Americans rely on online platforms to stay informed and connected, sharing their thoughts and ideas on issues important to them, which can oftentimes lead to free and open debate around public policies and upcoming elections,' said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. 'It has long been the policy of the United States to foster a robust marketplace of ideas on the Internet and the free flow of information around the world. President Trump is committed to protecting the rights of all Americans to express their views and not face unjustified restrictions or selective censorship from a handful of powerful companies.' The petition also seeks further clarity from the FCC: Whether, and to what degree, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act provides protection for social media's content moderation decisions The conditions under which content moderation and editorial decisions by social media companies shape content to such a degree that section 230 no longer protects them Social media's disclosure obligations with respect to their content moderation practicesThe full text of the petition itself can be read by following this linked text.[7]We reprint the comments from Section III of this document, entitled 'The Commission Should Act to Protect Free Speech Online' below.

I'm Jesse Watters along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Lisa Boothe, and Greg.  It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a Fox News alert, President Trump refusing to back down on his border battle to build the wall, Trump issuing the first veto of his presidency to overrule a resolution that blocks his national emergency declaration at the border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  The protection of the nation is my highest duty.  Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that if sign into law would put countless Americans in danger, very grave danger.  It is definitely a national emergency.  Rarely have we had such a national emergency.</p><p>Reckless Resolution, Trump Slams Democrat Sponsored Proposal On National Emergency; Presidential Pushback, President Trump Clashed With Congress Over National Emergency; New Zealand Mosque Attack; Gunman Fires More Than 200 Bullets During New Zealand Mosque Attack; Gunman Live-Streamed Mosque Shooting; Social Media Companies Struggle To Remove Mosque Shooting Video From Platform; Media's Beto-Mania, Some In The Media Fawn Over The 2020 Candidate; Pelosi Struggles To Name Beto's Accomplishments; Pelosi: Beto Brought A Lot Of Vitality To Congress; Beto Faces Qualification Questions; Beto Jumps In: Beto O'Rourke Joins Crowded 2020 Presidential Field; Top General Warns About Google Working With China; Dunford: The Work Google Is Doing In China Is More Of A Direct Benefit To The Chinese Military; Military Leaders Slam Google's Work In China; Big Problems For Big Tech?

It is a tremendous national emergency.</p><p>It is a tremendous crisis.  People hate the word invasion, but that's what it is.  It's an invasion of drugs and criminals and people.  Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it, and I'm very proud to veto it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS:  So, Mr. Gutfeld, I watched this press conference in full and I think he stole one of your lines.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  What did he say?</p><p>WATTERS:  He said they were border deniers, and then even reality deniers, I think.  What do you think?  Do you think he's watching THE FIVE?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Maybe, perhaps.  I don't think he watches much Fox though.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know -- you look back at an era growing up, the 90's would be grunge, you know, the 80's acid wash, the 70's Jimmy Carter.  This year is going to be the wall.  Because I feel like -- that's every day we're always talking about the wall.  It's part of his kind of -- like the bigger picture which is safe at home, an appreciation of law enforcement, so you have a lot of the police there.  You have -- trying to eradicate the terror threat and you have military -- the military buildup, so all these things are part of one vision.</p><p>So he tends to see it as that.  And other people see it as fear mongering because that kind of belief can be seen as fear mongering.  You want a strong military.  You want a wall.  You want law enforcement -- oh, my God, you're scaring people.  So, unfortunately something that he believes in can be recast as something wrong.  They brought up a fact in there that I -- you know, made me think about the other half of this story, the number one leading cause of death for people under 50 -- what he said drug overdose.  One of the officers said that there.</p><p>So I say, what about that?  You know, the fault isn't in the dealers alone.  You know, the drugs keep coming because we keep using.  And I think there is -- there's a refusal to admit that often the drug war doesn't make things any better.  We're seeing this with the opioid mess where we're trying to reduce -- we're reducing the legal ways to get opioids and that ends up in overdoses on fentanyl, which is one of the gentlemen spoke about his son dying on fentanyl.  So we still haven't addressed maybe the underpinnings of this story which is our desire for oblivion.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's right.  People like to get zonked out of their minds and, you know --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Great summary.</p><p>WATTERS:  You've done it.  You've done it.  I'm sure Juan has done it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Agree on my point.</p><p>WATTERS:  Juan, now, speaking of zonked out of their minds, Nancy Pelosi says she's going to hold a vote to overturn this veto, but she needs, I guess, two thirds of the Senate to uphold the override and that's just not possible mathematically.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Not at the moment.  But what we saw was the tremendous number -- I think it was 13 Republicans who voted with the 40 -- with the Democrats in the Senate.  And so what you're getting there is not veto-proof majority, but you're getting in that direction.</p><p>WATTERS:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And what you've got to understand here is that you have essentially a manufactured crisis --</p><p>WATTERS:  Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- you have 50 --</p><p>WATTERS:  Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Remember, I'm zonked out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Because in Trump world I'm zonked out.  So allow me to speak.</p><p>WATTERS:  OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But you get 58 national security officials saying this is not right.  Don't do it.  You have in terms of the polling in the country, 64 percent oppose the emergency declaration, 58 percent oppose the wall.  This isn't close, folks.  But for Trump it's all about Trump and Trump's political promises --</p><p>WATTERS:  I'll hit you back with that line.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm shocked.  I'm amazed that we're here on day 30 of the national emergency.  Cover your head.</p><p>WATTERS:  Those 50 people were mostly Obama people.  And if you listen to the actual sheriffs --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, yeah.</p><p>WATTERS: -- if you watch the press conference, they don't say it's manufactured.  They say it's a huge crisis, Lisa.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS HOST:  Yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And they invited a lot of these congressmen and women and senators to come down and see it for themselves before they cast their next vote.</p><p>BOOTHE:  Juan, you're zonked out, my friend, because even President Obama in 2014 was talking about the crisis we had along the border.  He did so in the Rose Garden.  He talked about traffickers bringing unaccompanied minors across the border, calling on Congress to do something because we had a humanitarian crisis.  That humanitarian crisis remains today.</p><p>There's been 260,000 illegal immigrants apprehended at the border.  Ninety percent -- since October, 90 percent increase from last year.  ICE is giving pregnancy tests to young girls over the age of 10 because of the amount of rapes and sexual assaults that are experienced along the journey.  So, of course, we have a humanitarian crisis.  The question is if a national emergency the way to solve it?  I don't know.</p><p>But the point being is that what we're seeing right now is everyone exercising their authority under the national emergencies act.  President Trump has broad authority to declare a national emergency under the act.  Congress also gave themselves the authority to try to rescind that national emergency.  President Trump has the authority to then veto, and then Congress can try to find the votes, two thirds in the House and Senate to override it.</p><p>So, essentially, everyone is exercising the authorities that they have under the act.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  What you just said, though, if this is not the caravan.  This is not like someone invading our country, Lisa.  We have a humanitarian --</p><p>GUTFELD:  But you saw the caravan (INAUDIBLE) crisis first off, Juan.  You were the first person.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I say -- look --</p><p>BOOTHE:  How is it not a crisis?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's so different than talking about --</p><p>GUTFELD:  How is it?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- an invasion where you send troops and you declare a national --</p><p>GUTFELD:  People die no matter what you call it.  People die.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  By the way, never, never has any national emergency been declared to get around the fact that Congress won't fund.  This is an exceptional --</p><p>WATTERS:  Why did they write the act that way, Juan?  I mean, did Congress write an unconstitutional act?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no, no.  They say it's never been done is all I'm saying.  They wrote it.</p><p>WATTERS:  Dagen, I don't see how this plays out in any other way that it gets just tied up in the courts.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST:  Yeah, it will get tied up in the courts.  I think that there were four additional states that signed on to this lawsuit challenging the emergency order bringing it to 20.  You could get an emergency injunction that stops this in its tracks for the time being.  But, listen, Juan doesn't recognize what's going on here with the Republicans because they're not being hypocritical unlike the Democrats.</p><p>Unlike Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who basically just sat back and let President Obama violate the separation of powers.  Let's go through the list.  As the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, a blank check on recess appointments, environmental and financial regulations, Obamacare spending without appropriations, work permits for illegal immigrants and more all rebuked by the court system.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  So that's why you have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why -- at least the Republicans who voted against the president are voting based on their concern that the Democrats will then turn around and abuse the emergency power.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's my point to you.  So what you're saying is he shouldn't be doing it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where were you guys when Obama was doing this over and over and over again.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Nobody has ever, including Obama, ever said I'm going around the constitution --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, Juan --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p><p>BOOTHE:  What do you think happened with DACA, Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That was not about funding.</p><p>BOOTHE:  It was a massive overreach with DACA --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOOTHE: -- and DACA got stuck by the courts because --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm just saying it wasn't about the constitution --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- why President Trump at least so far doesn't seem to be annoyed with these Republicans because he ain't calling them name on twitter yet.  Maybe Mitt Romney deserves that stupid op-ed in blowing out the birthday candles individually.</p><p>WATTERS:  You know he mentioned that, actually.  He goes, if I wanted to pressure him I would have brought the pressure.  He goes, I didn't need it because we had the votes.  But if they want to see pressure, they'll know what pressure is.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The only reason why we're here is that the Democrats can't admit that they want what Trump wants because they can't admit that they agree with him.  We're all talking about the same thing.  We want an enforced border but they can't admit it because that means Trump's right.  That's all this is about.  It's petty political team sport.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm glad you said that because I think Democrats do want it, but I think for the longest time what you hear from Republicans, oh, Democrats don't.  But you're right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  We have a history here -- a history of Democrats funding this kind of stuff --</p><p>WATTERS:  I'm not so sure the Democrats really want --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Trump has made it about him and his political promise --</p><p>GUTFELD:  But Democrats made it about him as well.</p><p>WATTERS:  All right.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Let's face it, they've made it about him.  He is a large character, Juan.  So it's hard not to --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait, it was his campaign promise.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.  And so they've made it about him.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, no.  He says --</p><p>GUTFELD:  They can't give it to him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- because, guess what, Republicans in the first two years didn't do this, did they?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yeah, because they needed more votes in the Senate.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh.</p><p>WATTERS:  Disturbing new details in the New Zealand terror attack that killed 49 people, plus President Trump's reaction to that up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Earlier today, I spoke with Prime Minister Arden of New Zealand to express the sorrow of our entire nation following the monstrous terror attacks at two mosques.  These sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing.  You've all been seeing what went on.  It's a horrible, horrible thing.  I told the prime minister that the United States is with them all the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump reacting to the horrific New Zealand terror attacks.  The prime minister there calling it one of her country's darkest days after a gunman opened fire in two mosques killing 49 people.  A suspect has been arrested and charged with murder, as reports indicate he live streamed the murders on social media, on Facebook.  Jonathan Hunt has more of the details.  Jonathan, what can you tell us?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, the live streamed video of this attack is horrific to watch.  We will not show it but we have watched it for the sake of accurately reporting what happened.  You see on the video the gunman drive calmly toward the mosque, playing music and talking to himself.  He approaches the entrance and fires his first shots at two men.  They drop to the ground.  One tries to crawl away desperately.</p><p>The gunman walks up behind him and fires several more shots.  The man stops moving.  Then the gunman moves into the main prayer room where two large groups of worshipers are already cowering in two separate corners.  The shooter fires dozens of rounds into each group.  One man appears to run at the gunman but is shot at point blank range.  The shooter then turns his attention to the groups again firing even more shots.</p><p>He reloads several times, walks back into the hallway and then back into the main room.  Many of the men there are already dead.  Some appear to be wounded.  The gunman walks slowly toward them taking kill shots finishing off his victims with bullets to the head or body.  By our count, the gunman fires around 187 rounds within just the first two and a half minutes of the attack.</p><p>Once he leaves the mosque, he shoots several people on the street.  Including a woman wearing traditional Muslim dress.  She's wounded.  She lies on the street crying out for help.  The gunman walks up to her and once again delivers the final shots directly to the woman's head.  He then gets back in his car.  He drives over that woman's body and continues to shoot other people from his vehicle.</p><p>There is no sign at that point of any police officers.  The video stops after about 16 gut-wrenching minutes and by our count, 236 shots fired.  Now the gunman also left online a manifesto of sorts.  It's long, it's rambling in places, precise in others.  The gunman makes his motivation very clear, intimidating, repelling, and killing what he repeatedly calls Muslim invaders.</p><p>He says mass immigration is a threat to civilization.  And at one point he poses a question to himself are you a supporter of President Trump?  His answer, quote, as a symbol of renewed white entity and common purpose, sure, as a policy maker and leader, dear God, no.  The gunman who was taken into custody alive also said in his manifesto that he hopes to go to trial where he will plead not guilty because in his view he was taking action against what he calls an occupying force.</p><p>Leaders around the world, including President Trump have refuted that idea saying it was an act of pure hate, pure evil.  I used to live in Christchurch for a time after 9/11, Dagen.  I can tell you it is a beautiful and peaceful place.  It is like a snapshot from the 1950's, immune, somehow, to the problems of the modern world.  Well, it is around 10 AM Saturday in Christchurch right now and everybody there and across New Zealand is literally and figuratively waking up to a whole new reality.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonathan, thank you so much.  Greg, I want to focus on the social media aspect of this that this was live streamed on Facebook and only removed by Facebook after it was flagged to them by the New Zealand police.  It showed up on other social media sites on YouTube and on Twitter.  They're not doing anything to stop this.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, I don't -- two things.  I don't know what you can do right now -- a few weeks ago on Twitter they were suspending people for tweeting the phrase learn to code.  So if you're spreading yourself that thin chasing that stuff, it's like having the FBI go after gum chewing on the subway.  You're not going to get the real crime.  They're trying to figure this out.  I've said this a couple of days ago, technology is ahead of humanity.  We aren't catching up to it so we have this vulnerability.</p><p>The biggest issue -- we talk about this after every shooting is the copycat effect.  That's why we never mention the guy's name.  That's why we try not to cover it, blanket coverage, because blanket coverage enlarges the spotlight which is what they want.  Each shooter cites previous shooters.  That is a fact.  Each one inspires the next.</p><p>My worry is that because he filmed it he gave it a wider -- wider reach for more people to see, expanding his footprint and it is our -- I wound not just go after social media, it is our responsibility in the media to shrink that footprint to as small as possible.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jesse, and I should correct myself, I said they're not doing anything.  Facebook says that it has 15,000 contractors and employees reviewing content as part of a 30,000 person team working on it.  But I can say this, since they launched livestreaming there have been murders.  There have been suicides.  In fact, there was a man in Thailand who killed his 11-month-old daughter in a live video and that was two years ago, and we still have this going on.</p><p>WATTERS:  Well, I don't know what anybody can do about that because we live in a free society.  So people can use technology however they want, and you have to catch up with the fact afterwards.  And that's the unfortunate situation.  Now, I don't understand how the media can lie about this guy's manifesto.  I read it.  The manifesto, if you read it, does not attribute this guy's philosophy to Donald Trump.  This is a direct quote, the nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China.</p><p>This guy was an eco-nationalist.  Meaning, he was a racist and thought that the immigrant population of the earth was too fertile and they were overpopulating everything and were causing climate change and they needed to be eradicated.  He said he's not a conservative.  He's not a Nazi.  And like Greg said, he was celebrating these wacko European mass shooters more than anything.</p><p>So for the media to link Donald Trump and frame Donald Trump for some lunatic's actions halfway around the world is so irresponsible and it's exactly what the guy wanted.  If you read the manifesto the guy wanted division in his country.  He wanted the left to overreact and take away guns from Republicans, and wanted to balkanize North America because that would create more racial purity in his opinion.</p><p>So, we were very responsible when the Bernie bro shot up Steve Scalise's baseball game.  We didn't attribute that to Bernie.  We didn't attribute that to the left-wing media.  We've said everyone is individually responsible for themselves.  But the media doesn't do that when it's on the other side.  They only frame Republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it's easy to tweet that this -- Trump was somehow responsible.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yeah, I could say the Israeli-Palestinian violence that's happening today, I could point to Omar and say she instigated the anti-Semitism hate against Israel and that's why.  But I wouldn't do that because that's not true.</p><p>BOOTHE:  I would say, one, I think it just takes a special kind of evil to target people in a house of worship that's supposed to be a place of refuge.  They were praying.  It's absolutely despicable and disgusting.  We obviously pray for the victims and their families as well.  I'm with Greg.  I really struggle in the fact that -- I think there's a responsibility to deny these killers what they want.  And this guy wants to live in infamy.</p><p>Clearly, he wrote a manifesto because he wanted it out.  And I'm all about denying that by not giving the manifesto any time and not giving him what he wants.  And to Greg's point about the copy cats, I spent all day today looking at statistics and studies about it and it's real and it's scary.  Dr. Steven Pitt who's a psychiatric -- did psychiatric autopsy of the Columbine shooting, he said that the shooters predicted with chilling and stunning accuracy how their actions would encourage other similarly disaffected individuals for doing the same thing.</p><p>You'll get things like the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting.  During the trial there were two similar shootings in movie theaters in two weeks after that.  ABC in 2014 did an investigation found that 17 school shooters and 36 others that tried were all partially inspired by Columbine.  The Newtown shooter had clippings, as you've said, of previous mass murders that took place.</p><p>So, clearly, these guys want infamy and we should deny it to them.  And sometimes we give it to them.  The Rolling Stone did that cover of the Boston bomber, put them on the cover.  Remember after the Virginia Tech shooting, images of the guys with the gun.  Let's deny them what they want.  Don't give them the infamy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Juan, what about shutting down people's ability to use social media?  Is that something the Democrats would be on board with?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  We're going to talk about that -- we're going to talk about later in this show because what we're seeing is an increased emphasis on either regulating or moderating, or even in Elizabeth Warren's terms breaking up some of the power because these folks are interested in money.  It's unbelievable that this 17-minute video, the police want it stopped.  It just keeps running and, of course, it spreads and it spreads to a specific niche population that's interested, you know, kind of the gamers and a little bit of a hate people all combined here for young men.  I think it's very troubling.</p><p>I just want to say, I think, imagine if a Muslim had committed such an act, I can imagine that there are a lot of people who would have gone bananas on the Muslim community here in the United States and around the world.  But what I think is the reality is, we have white nationalists anger spreading globally, his manifesto was called the great replacement and they're talking about, you know, just like we saw in Charlottesville, you will not replace us.</p><p>And we see this kind of anger being spread in such a way that I think we have to address the idea that this white nationalist fervor is now without borders because of the internet, and because -- we can't ignore it or play it down because it doesn't fit one ideology or the other --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We need to go.  But the problem is after the rage that you saw here in the United States was directed at President Trump for something -- a massacre that happened in New Zealand.  Some in the media can't get enough of Beto O'Rourke or how the heck you say his first name.  He's all the buzz over the 2020 candidates.  Is it overblown?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOOTHE:  Some in the media are overcome with Beto mania after the guy who lost to Ted Cruz officially announced he's running for president.  Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look, I'm a little light hearted today because I like this feeling.  It got a new levity to it.  But it's not like we in the press created it.  There's something out there that is magical.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, he has a vibrancy, a youthfulness to him.  He has a message which is largely cheerful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Seeing him is like -- it's like a Jesus Christ Superstar seeing this guy in front of people.  He's got that celebrity aura about him.  And in that moment he was owning that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOTHE:  Safe to say they like him.  But the question a lot of us are asking is what has he actually accomplished.  Here's Nancy Pelosi responding, attempting to answer the question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: -- brought vitality to Congress. When he came, he came as a real champion for the environment. He got a great deal of support from the environmental community in his district. Preserving our planet and protecting our people, there are at least two areas in addition to his vitality in so many other ways.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOTHE: So, Juan, to me it looks like she's struggling to answer the question. So why Beto what has he done?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think -- around town the big cliche was Abe Lincoln he only had one term as the Congressman before he became President. But, I think clearly, the voters in El Paso liked him. And I think if you wanted to look at the actual record he was pretty good, not only on environment, but on military spending.</p><p>Today, though, I must say the guns out for Robert Francis or that's what White House likes to call him or Beto, The Washington Post had a front page story about how Republican donors had been key to the start of his camp -- of his career as a politician. And he had backed spending for some malls that pushed people out of low-income neighborhoods.</p><p>And then you also have to keep in mind that he, and I think this is really important, Lisa, sometimes I think the Right can't hear this, but he did lose to Ted Cruz. But for the people for people on the Left the idea that in Texas he challenged Ted Cruz and raised a record amount of money like $80 million, I think, really makes him a superstar.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, you're right, he did raise a record amount of money, Jesse, but part of that was because he was running against Ted Cruz, someone that the media hates, that the left hates, so they really protected him, and his record really wasn't examined.</p><p>Now that's going to be a little bit different, Jesse. I was talking yesterday about the fact that he supports the Green New Deal allegedly, but took more money from the fossil fuel industry than anyone else besides Ted Cruz. So this stuff is going to surface and do you think it's going to end up having an impact on him?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it will. He will not release his new fundraising numbers, which is interesting. I'm not so sure they're going to beat Sanders'. They might not even beat Kamala's. Like you said, if he doesn't have a demon as the Left sees Ted Cruz as, maybe they're not going to put money in his pockets, but we'll see.</p><p>I think Chris Matthews has another throw up of his leg. It's clear he's the media darling right now and there's already Beto backlash. POLITICO says no woman got that kind of coverage and they don't like how this white male who has this privilege is being romanticized in the media. He's got the Vanity Fair cover.</p><p>They had all the reporters down there in El Paso for the counter Trump rally, and he's only been to Iowa once. And when he got up on that table in the coffee shop there were more media reporters than there were voters. So we'll see about him. The weirder he gets, I kind of like him, to be honest with you.</p><p>He was in a hacking group. He wrote some crazy stuff about murder. I don't know, he's kind of unpredictable, and that's kind of interesting and he's more fun to cover than some of the other candidates.</p><p>BOOTHE: Interesting. So the hacking group is what that just does it for you.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it -- that does it for me.</p><p>BOOTHE: All right. Greg, there's a Morning Consult poll that found that 49 percent of those polled either hadn't heard of him or have no opinion on him. Do you think he's going to be able to differentiate himself?</p><p>GUTFELD: Those people are idiots, because Beto is awesome. You guys are so mean to the guy. Look, you know what? Why does the media love him? Because he is them.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you look at him, he's just lily-white, non-threatening, liberal who likes their kind of music, right. He's kind of edgy in an inoffensive way. He looks like he probably does Pilates, I don't know. Or maybe has one of those new bikes that everybody's talking about.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, the Peloton.</p><p>GUTFELD: Peloton, thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: Why are you looking at me? I don't know that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- like he runs the Peloton --</p><p>WATTERS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: But he is the Republican with his minuses, would get nowhere. Obviously, the drunk driving arrests and they're running away from the scene, and the fact that he married an heiress. I mean, that's stuff. But if you're a Republican, would be endless --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a second, wait a second -- I know what you're going to say to me. But I believe we have a President who has no political experience.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And who has a lot of problem --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, but he hasn't been arrested.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: But you want to talk, yes, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: The Mueller report is not out.</p><p>GUTFELD: The Mueller report -- you want to talk collusion. Now you want to talk collusion, look at the -- like how -- what a coincidence that he declared when the cover came out. I mean, that's -- so that's with Vanity Fair.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, media loves him.</p><p>GUTFELD: So they like -- the thing that gets me mad -- not mad, but I find it humorous actually. How does the media not notice when they're fanboying. Like -- how can they -- when they are talking about somebody they love, do they go death, and they can't hear how hilarious they sound when they're talking about.</p><p>They're basically vomiting Valentine's -- projectile Valentine's and it's like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have more man talk about how he's kind of a himbo and women don't see that. Quite frankly --</p><p>GUTFELD: The men, you're right the men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Himbo, it's like a male bimbo.</p><p>GUTFELD: The men are more into him than the women.</p><p>WATTERS: That's a fancy thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way is just want to say couple of things. Well, Jesse, if I squint move my chair way, you kind of look like --</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, don't you dare.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my god.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I looked at their website, there's nothing about policy. There's just some merch for sale and a couple of photos of Beto, one where he has sweat dripping down his face.</p><p>GUTFELD: We're going to get that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. So here are -- I wrote some suggestions of things he could sell on his website to raise more money. How about a beard kit that you staple on, so you at least, look like you can split wood? I think that's his voting bus --</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Well, maybe he'll show up in Iowa like that, maybe we'll see. All right. Well, America's top general is ripping Google, find out why next. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: America's top general warning about the potential dangers of Google's relationship China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENERAL JOSEPH DUNFORD, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CHAIRMAN: The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military. We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit.</p><p>In fact, frankly, indirect maybe not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: The company recently dropped its bid for a $10 billion Pentagon contract saying that would conflict with its corporate values, apparently not so with the Chinese. In fact, this is so interesting to me, Dagen, what General Dunford said was, you have a $5 trillion share of the Chinese economy that is state-run.</p><p>So when Google does business with the Chinese military, it essentially then is funneling that information, that strategy and technology into the Chinese economy as well. This is all thievery.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And then the company because of outrage within the liberal walls of Google decided to not do business with the U.S. Defense Department. So let's be clear, Google is not in favor of protecting the land and the nation and the people that allowed Google to be formed in the first place.</p><p>It is this kind of delusional moralizing from the people at Google. There motto used to be \"Don't be Evil\", well they got rid of that clearly if they're doing business with the Chinese, and the delusional moralizing that really hurts America.</p><p>And I just want to point -- I just quickly do the imitation of Ruth Porat, the CFO, after Hillary Clinton lost and they had this big company meeting. She was talking about Hillary losing and what a massive that it was and it was really painful, that's Google.</p><p>BOOTHE: Sounds upset.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I think that's Google. That's who works at Google.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jesse, so what they refused to do for the Pentagon was work on cloud storage type technology and they said it was in violation of the company's principles, a lot of the workers said this. How do you interpret this?</p><p>WATTERS: Well, do the company's principles adhere to the Communist Chinese principles?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I hope not.</p><p>WATTERS: They had some pretty crazy principles over in China -- one-child policy, no freedom of speech. The Chinese have a \"Project Dragonfly\" that Google was working on with them, where they can censor all sorts of Internet content, and it looks like Google's OK with that.</p><p>What they're doing, Juan, is they're putting profits above patriotism. And you have to ask yourself, is Google an American company anymore? Or do they -- are they just this amorphous multinational conglomerate that just does whatever they want to whoever they want in search for the highest bidder?</p><p>$21 billion in revenue over there in Asia, that's a pretty penny. And like you said in the beginning, if you invest Google in China, in a commercial enterprise, they just transfer that right to the state-owned corporations. So there's a direct pipeline from commercial interests to the military-industrial complex which is run by the Communist Chinese, and they steal it on top of that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Lisa, Elizabeth Warren has been trying to say we should break up some of the Facebook, Google, Amazon, that they're just too big and too powerful. Jesse, you suggested maybe they don't have any sense of loyalty to the United States?</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, and a lot of this comes from the criticism over data, which I think is one of the biggest fake news stories of all time. The Obama team did the exact same thing at Cambridge Analytica did. The only reason anyone cared about it was because they got caught in President Trump's orbit campaigns.</p><p>Both the RNC and the DNC have massive databases of consumer information for voters across the country. Every politician that was sitting on those Committees pointing the fingers, has Mark Zuckerberg has used consumer data in way to target voters, it's all such a sham.</p><p>Not only that, there's literally no privacy anymore. You look at location services, it's a $21 billion industry in 2018, people following, you what you're doing via apps to reach you via advertising and things of that nature. Vizio was caught two years ago of like collecting data on people via smart TV.</p><p>So point is, there's no privacy, the whole thing's a sham. And the only reason anyone cared about it was because of President Trump.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think Greg disagrees. Because Greg thinks that, in fact, we should -- a lot of times people don't realize they're giving up their privacy.</p><p>GUTFELD: You have read my mind, just like Facebook. It's true. I hate Google for two reasons. The one reason that Juan is talking about is because they got me, right? I got suckered into the free Google which is -- look at this marvelous search engine. It's all your, search away, search away, and then you are the product. Because once every -- once you're using, they're just mining you, so you become the product.</p><p>#2, their employees were -- a few of their employees were upset, because they were helping with the drone -- making the drone program in the Pentagon more precise. Precise drones will help eliminate mass warfare, that's what it's about. You don't have to carpet-bomb anymore if you have precise drones.</p><p>So what they were arguing about was -- I mean, what they were defined was actually, progress that would help save millions of lives.</p><p>WATTERS: Instead of Google, Ask Jeeves --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Let's go back.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. They're rushing us, because there's so much fun about to happen, an explosion of \"Fan Mail Friday\", with maestro Gutfeld next on THE FIVE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes, Fan Mail Friday, let's get started. We don't have enough time here. Instagram question. If you were a college professor, Juan, what would you teach?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I was a philosophy major in college and I -- but I don't know much about philosophy these days. I discovered my thesis the other day in the basement. I couldn't even understand what's this guy is writing about.</p><p>GUTFELD: We feel that same way.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But now it's like I'm all steeped in politics and history, I should have majored in something that would have been useful. My mom would have appreciated it.</p><p>GUTFELD: How about you Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: I would do like history of rock and roll or bowling or something like that.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bowling, interesting.</p><p>BOOTHE: -- you still get paid and it's not really -- its I mean --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, were you in that College scam?</p><p>GUTFELD: Dagen?</p><p>BOOTHE: I deny it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would teach --</p><p>BOOTHE: Not that you know of.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would teach speech to everybody.</p><p>GUTFELD: Speech.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in an Ivy League school.</p><p>GUTFELD: Very good, very good. Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: I wouldn't teach. I would coach.</p><p>BOOTHE: Which sport?</p><p>GUTFELD: Why don't you teach coaching? How about that?</p><p>WATTERS: Not qualified.</p><p>GUTFELD: See, I would do a class called errands.</p><p>WATTERS: Errands?</p><p>GUTFELD: Errands. And then I would show up and just give each student an errand to run, and then I would just kick back.</p><p>WATTERS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: And they've learned, yes, right. There you go. Quick one. All right Sherry U. writes, \"What is the nicest thing you have done for someone else this week?</p><p>WATTERS: Why are you looking at me like that?</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: You know, I can't come up with anything. Jesus -- god, did I give a homeless guy anything? I might have -- I tipped. OK. When I get change at the Starbucks, I put the rest of the change in the tip jar.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's very good.</p><p>WATTERS: Because you probably pocket it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, when they're not looking, I take the whole tip jar.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I don't think you're giving yourself enough credit. I bet people in your life appreciate.</p><p>WATTERS: I must have done something.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what the thing -- the problem with Jesse is he's done so much, he can't remember. He can't remember.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Have you Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I always do this. I stopped a lady in the street who looked really nice -- perfect stranger and told her that she looked really pretty.</p><p>GUTFELD: See, we can't do that. If I do that, I'm like -- I'm gone. Did you just told that woman she looked good?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's how you get arrested.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, yes. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: So I going to get two things, one, I mentored a young man. I took him to dinner and hung out with him. But secondly, I agreed to give us free speech at event.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's really good. Wow. Lisa.</p><p>WATTERS: He's like the Dana of the table now.</p><p>GUTFELD: Lisa.</p><p>BOOTHE: I don't know this week, but next month I'm watching my special-needs aunt for my parents, so they can go on vacation.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's real good.</p><p>BOOTHE: And it's a vacation I bought for them.</p><p>GUTFELD: The question has said what \"Have you done this week\", so you cheated --</p><p>BOOTHE: I know.</p><p>GUTFELD: -- by looking ahead. I could do that too. Like, next week I'm planning on schooling these orphans on errands.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think there was a pregnant lady on the subway who got on and you didn't get your -- out of the seat and give her the seat, I'm just --</p><p>GUTFELD: I give money to the guys that play music on the subway, because I like the music.</p><p>WATTERS: I thought you will do fine with the guy that plays music on the subway.</p><p>GUTFELD: Damn it Jesse, \"One More Thing\" is next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And usurped his money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Time now for \"One More Thing\". Bernie Sanders has a big bandage on his head. Check out the Senator from Vermont there, gashed his head on the corner of the glass shower door. He's got seven stitches. Went to a walk-in clinic, keeps campaigning in South Carolina.</p><p>GUTFELD: Tough guy.</p><p>WATTERS: He's a very tough guy. Now I actually understand what happened. I myself too gashed my head --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: -- in the bathroom on Black Friday about two years ago. They did a great job with the makeup there. But there is a Band-Aid on my head, so Bernie and I have a lot in common.</p><p>GUTFELD: Run with him.</p><p>BOOTHE: Jesse that could be your nice thing this week that you just did for Bernie.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right.</p><p>BOOTHE: You may feel better.</p><p>WATTERS: I made feel better Bernie, wow, that's a low bar. All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, take a look at this scene from a month ago. Yes, that's Duke basketball star Zion Williamson falling to the floor as his Nikes tore apart. Will now take a look at this video as the star returns to the court last night</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: 29 points with a perfect night of shooting. 13 for 13, he also had 14 rebounds 5 steals. That kind of performance is going to put him at the center of March Madness. And guess what he was wearing Nikes. Yes, he's stuck with the brand. The shoemaker made a special size 15 with extra padding for the 6'7'', 285 pound college freshman. By the way NCAA tournament teams will be selected this weekend good luck to your team guys.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: And they have Tar Heels this weekend too, I think.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Big game. All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. Tomorrow night, Saturday, March 16th, 10:00 p.m. another Greg Gutfeld Show with Johnny Joey Jones, Jimmy Failla, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. And I think Jesse has a show too, but he forgot to--</p><p>WATTERS: I did.</p><p>GUTFELD: He forgot to promote it. So Jesse Show as well which is on at 8:00. Anyway animals are great, right?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Animals are Great!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Every now and then you find an animal that's not just strange, but strangely sexy. Check out the dance of the Bateleur eagle -- Bateleur is French for tightrope walker. And I got to tell you something, there's something really interesting. I want one of these.</p><p>WATTERS: Is that a real thing?</p><p>GUTFELD: That is a real thing. That is not a man in a furry suit, although, I have been known to dress up like that on the weekends, downtown just to make some extra money.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. That's -- it's called the</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Animals are Great!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: That was real. I think might be high.</p><p>WATTERS: Before we get to dig and I'm going to plug my show. 8:00 p.m. we have Dana Loesch and we have Kellyanne Conway in. I interview a birth striker, she won't have kids, because she's afraid the climate is going to kill the earth. All right, there it is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So man's flying into the Berlin Airport from Cairo with, what he says, were some cakes, little chocolate cakes. Officers stopped him and said -- he said, \"I have nothing to declare\". And they said, \"Let's look in this box\". They're not cakes, they were tortoises -- living Moroccan tortoises.</p><p>WATTERS: That's trouble.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That the border veterinarian, who knew there were veterinarians at the border, that's good to hear, confiscated the animals. Hopefully, they're safe. The guy faces up to $56,000 fine, could end up in prison. If you love tortoises and turtles, go to the turtle conservancy to figure out how to save them all.</p><p>BOOTHE: So real quick, so I wouldn't go out of time. But tune in next Thursday to Fox &amp; Friends our March 21st -- Thursday, March 21st, I'm doing the interview with John's Crazy Socks with Co-Founder John Lee Cronin and a young man an entrepreneur with Down Syndrome. I hung out with him, his dad and the rest of the team. Please tune in, it's really special.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, that is nice.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I met him in the green room.</p><p>BOOTHE: He's lovely. It was a beautiful day. It was really cool.</p><p>WATTERS: Can you score me some free socks --</p><p>GUTFELD: Of course, Jesse. You always want the free stuff, don't you?</p><p>WATTERS: Don't you?</p><p>BOOTHE: You wear socks? What kind -- what kind, I can put a word in.</p><p>WATTERS: Anything that matches like a nice navy suit.</p><p>BOOTHE: OK.</p><p>WATTERS: That's it for us. We'll see you back here on Monday. Have a nice weekend everybody.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2193264787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNX-KWD1-JBHT-D0KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7287\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Jesse Watters along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Lisa Boothe, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a Fox News alert, President Trump refusing to back down on his border battle to build the wall, Trump issuing the first veto of his presidency to overrule a resolution that blocks his national emergency declaration at the border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The protection of the nation is my highest duty. Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that if sign into law would put countless Americans in danger, very grave danger. It is definitely a national emergency. Rarely have we had such a national emergency.</p><p>Reckless Resolution, Trump Slams Democrat Sponsored Proposal On National Emergency; Presidential Pushback, President Trump Clashed With Congress Over National Emergency; New Zealand Mosque Attack; Gunman Fires More Than 200 Bullets During New Zealand Mosque Attack; Gunman Live-Streamed Mosque Shooting; Social Media Companies Struggle To Remove Mosque Shooting Video From Platform; Media's Beto-Mania, Some In The Media Fawn Over The 2020 Candidate; Pelosi Struggles To Name Beto's Accomplishments; Pelosi: Beto Brought A Lot Of Vitality To Congress; Beto Faces Qualification Questions; Beto Jumps In: Beto O'Rourke Joins Crowded 2020 Presidential Field; Top General Warns About Google Working With China; Dunford: The Work Google Is Doing In China Is More Of A Direct Benefit To The Chinese Military; Military Leaders Slam Google's Work In China; Big Problems For Big Tech?

It is a tremendous national emergency.</p><p>It is a tremendous crisis. People hate the word invasion, but that's what it is. It's an invasion of drugs and criminals and people. Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it, and I'm very proud to veto it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So, Mr. Gutfeld, I watched this press conference in full and I think he stole one of your lines.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: What did he say?</p><p>WATTERS: He said they were border deniers, and then even reality deniers, I think. What do you think? Do you think he's watching THE FIVE?</p><p>GUTFELD: Maybe, perhaps. I don't think he watches much Fox though.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: You know -- you look back at an era growing up, the 90's would be grunge, you know, the 80's acid wash, the 70's Jimmy Carter. This year is going to be the wall. Because I feel like -- that's every day we're always talking about the wall. It's part of his kind of -- like the bigger picture which is safe at home, an appreciation of law enforcement, so you have a lot of the police there. You have -- trying to eradicate the terror threat and you have military -- the military buildup, so all these things are part of one vision.</p><p>So he tends to see it as that. And other people see it as fear mongering because that kind of belief can be seen as fear mongering. You want a strong military. You want a wall. You want law enforcement -- oh, my God, you're scaring people. So, unfortunately something that he believes in can be recast as something wrong. They brought up a fact in there that I -- you know, made me think about the other half of this story, the number one leading cause of death for people under 50 -- what he said drug overdose. One of the officers said that there.</p><p>So I say, what about that? You know, the fault isn't in the dealers alone. You know, the drugs keep coming because we keep using. And I think there is -- there's a refusal to admit that often the drug war doesn't make things any better. We're seeing this with the opioid mess where we're trying to reduce -- we're reducing the legal ways to get opioids and that ends up in overdoses on fentanyl, which is one of the gentlemen spoke about his son dying on fentanyl. So we still haven't addressed maybe the underpinnings of this story which is our desire for oblivion.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right. People like to get zonked out of their minds and, you know --</p><p>GUTFELD: Great summary.</p><p>WATTERS: You've done it. You've done it. I'm sure Juan has done it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Agree on my point.</p><p>WATTERS: Juan, now, speaking of zonked out of their minds, Nancy Pelosi says she's going to hold a vote to overturn this veto, but she needs, I guess, two thirds of the Senate to uphold the override and that's just not possible mathematically.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Not at the moment. But what we saw was the tremendous number -- I think it was 13 Republicans who voted with the 40 -- with the Democrats in the Senate. And so what you're getting there is not veto-proof majority, but you're getting in that direction.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And what you've got to understand here is that you have essentially a manufactured crisis --</p><p>WATTERS: Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- you have 50 --</p><p>WATTERS: Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Remember, I'm zonked out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Because in Trump world I'm zonked out. So allow me to speak.</p><p>WATTERS: OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you get 58 national security officials saying this is not right. Don't do it. You have in terms of the polling in the country, 64 percent oppose the emergency declaration, 58 percent oppose the wall. This isn't close, folks. But for Trump it's all about Trump and Trump's political promises --</p><p>WATTERS: I'll hit you back with that line.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm shocked. I'm amazed that we're here on day 30 of the national emergency. Cover your head.</p><p>WATTERS: Those 50 people were mostly Obama people. And if you listen to the actual sheriffs --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.</p><p>WATTERS: -- if you watch the press conference, they don't say it's manufactured. They say it's a huge crisis, Lisa.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: And they invited a lot of these congressmen and women and senators to come down and see it for themselves before they cast their next vote.</p><p>BOOTHE: Juan, you're zonked out, my friend, because even President Obama in 2014 was talking about the crisis we had along the border. He did so in the Rose Garden. He talked about traffickers bringing unaccompanied minors across the border, calling on Congress to do something because we had a humanitarian crisis. That humanitarian crisis remains today.</p><p>There's been 260,000 illegal immigrants apprehended at the border. Ninety percent -- since October, 90 percent increase from last year. ICE is giving pregnancy tests to young girls over the age of 10 because of the amount of rapes and sexual assaults that are experienced along the journey. So, of course, we have a humanitarian crisis. The question is if a national emergency the way to solve it? I don't know.</p><p>But the point being is that what we're seeing right now is everyone exercising their authority under the national emergencies act. President Trump has broad authority to declare a national emergency under the act. Congress also gave themselves the authority to try to rescind that national emergency. President Trump has the authority to then veto, and then Congress can try to find the votes, two thirds in the House and Senate to override it.</p><p>So, essentially, everyone is exercising the authorities that they have under the act.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What you just said, though, if this is not the caravan. This is not like someone invading our country, Lisa. We have a humanitarian --</p><p>GUTFELD: But you saw the caravan (INAUDIBLE) crisis first off, Juan. You were the first person.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yeah, I say -- look --</p><p>BOOTHE: How is it not a crisis?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's so different than talking about --</p><p>GUTFELD: How is it?</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- an invasion where you send troops and you declare a national --</p><p>GUTFELD: People die no matter what you call it. People die.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, never, never has any national emergency been declared to get around the fact that Congress won't fund. This is an exceptional --</p><p>WATTERS: Why did they write the act that way, Juan? I mean, did Congress write an unconstitutional act?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no. They say it's never been done is all I'm saying. They wrote it.</p><p>WATTERS: Dagen, I don't see how this plays out in any other way that it gets just tied up in the courts.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah, it will get tied up in the courts. I think that there were four additional states that signed on to this lawsuit challenging the emergency order bringing it to 20. You could get an emergency injunction that stops this in its tracks for the time being. But, listen, Juan doesn't recognize what's going on here with the Republicans because they're not being hypocritical unlike the Democrats.</p><p>Unlike Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who basically just sat back and let President Obama violate the separation of powers. Let's go through the list. As the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, a blank check on recess appointments, environmental and financial regulations, Obamacare spending without appropriations, work permits for illegal immigrants and more all rebuked by the court system.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So that's why you have --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why -- at least the Republicans who voted against the president are voting based on their concern that the Democrats will then turn around and abuse the emergency power.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's my point to you. So what you're saying is he shouldn't be doing it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where were you guys when Obama was doing this over and over and over again.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Nobody has ever, including Obama, ever said I'm going around the constitution --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, Juan --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p><p>BOOTHE: What do you think happened with DACA, Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That was not about funding.</p><p>BOOTHE: It was a massive overreach with DACA --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOOTHE: -- and DACA got stuck by the courts because --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm just saying it wasn't about the constitution --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what -- why President Trump at least so far doesn't seem to be annoyed with these Republicans because he ain't calling them name on twitter yet. Maybe Mitt Romney deserves that stupid op-ed in blowing out the birthday candles individually.</p><p>WATTERS: You know he mentioned that, actually. He goes, if I wanted to pressure him I would have brought the pressure. He goes, I didn't need it because we had the votes. But if they want to see pressure, they'll know what pressure is.</p><p>GUTFELD: The only reason why we're here is that the Democrats can't admit that they want what Trump wants because they can't admit that they agree with him. We're all talking about the same thing. We want an enforced border but they can't admit it because that means Trump's right. That's all this is about. It's petty political team sport.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm glad you said that because I think Democrats do want it, but I think for the longest time what you hear from Republicans, oh, Democrats don't. But you're right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We have a history here -- a history of Democrats funding this kind of stuff --</p><p>WATTERS: I'm not so sure the Democrats really want --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Trump has made it about him and his political promise --</p><p>GUTFELD: But Democrats made it about him as well.</p><p>WATTERS: All right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Let's face it, they've made it about him. He is a large character, Juan. So it's hard not to --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait, it was his campaign promise.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And so they've made it about him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no. He says --</p><p>GUTFELD: They can't give it to him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- because, guess what, Republicans in the first two years didn't do this, did they?</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah, because they needed more votes in the Senate.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh.</p><p>WATTERS: Disturbing new details in the New Zealand terror attack that killed 49 people, plus President Trump's reaction to that up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Earlier today, I spoke with Prime Minister Arden of New Zealand to express the sorrow of our entire nation following the monstrous terror attacks at two mosques. These sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing. You've all been seeing what went on. It's a horrible, horrible thing. I told the prime minister that the United States is with them all the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump reacting to the horrific New Zealand terror attacks. The prime minister there calling it one of her country's darkest days after a gunman opened fire in two mosques killing 49 people. A suspect has been arrested and charged with murder, as reports indicate he live streamed the murders on social media, on Facebook. Jonathan Hunt has more of the details. Jonathan, what can you tell us?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Dagen, the live streamed video of this attack is horrific to watch. We will not show it but we have watched it for the sake of accurately reporting what happened. You see on the video the gunman drive calmly toward the mosque, playing music and talking to himself. He approaches the entrance and fires his first shots at two men. They drop to the ground. One tries to crawl away desperately.</p><p>The gunman walks up behind him and fires several more shots. The man stops moving. Then the gunman moves into the main prayer room where two large groups of worshipers are already cowering in two separate corners. The shooter fires dozens of rounds into each group. One man appears to run at the gunman but is shot at point blank range. The shooter then turns his attention to the groups again firing even more shots.</p><p>He reloads several times, walks back into the hallway and then back into the main room. Many of the men there are already dead. Some appear to be wounded. The gunman walks slowly toward them taking kill shots finishing off his victims with bullets to the head or body. By our count, the gunman fires around 187 rounds within just the first two and a half minutes of the attack.</p><p>Once he leaves the mosque, he shoots several people on the street. Including a woman wearing traditional Muslim dress. She's wounded. She lies on the street crying out for help. The gunman walks up to her and once again delivers the final shots directly to the woman's head. He then gets back in his car. He drives over that woman's body and continues to shoot other people from his vehicle.</p><p>There is no sign at that point of any police officers. The video stops after about 16 gut-wrenching minutes and by our count, 236 shots fired. Now the gunman also left online a manifesto of sorts. It's long, it's rambling in places, precise in others. The gunman makes his motivation very clear, intimidating, repelling, and killing what he repeatedly calls Muslim invaders.</p><p>He says mass immigration is a threat to civilization. And at one point he poses a question to himself are you a supporter of President Trump? His answer, quote, as a symbol of renewed white entity and common purpose, sure, as a policy maker and leader, dear God, no. The gunman who was taken into custody alive also said in his manifesto that he hopes to go to trial where he will plead not guilty because in his view he was taking action against what he calls an occupying force.</p><p>Leaders around the world, including President Trump have refuted that idea saying it was an act of pure hate, pure evil. I used to live in Christchurch for a time after 9/11, Dagen. I can tell you it is a beautiful and peaceful place. It is like a snapshot from the 1950's, immune, somehow, to the problems of the modern world. Well, it is around 10 AM Saturday in Christchurch right now and everybody there and across New Zealand is literally and figuratively waking up to a whole new reality. Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jonathan, thank you so much. Greg, I want to focus on the social media aspect of this that this was live streamed on Facebook and only removed by Facebook after it was flagged to them by the New Zealand police. It showed up on other social media sites on YouTube and on Twitter. They're not doing anything to stop this.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I don't -- two things. I don't know what you can do right now -- a few weeks ago on Twitter they were suspending people for tweeting the phrase learn to code. So if you're spreading yourself that thin chasing that stuff, it's like having the FBI go after gum chewing on the subway. You're not going to get the real crime. They're trying to figure this out. I've said this a couple of days ago, technology is ahead of humanity. We aren't catching up to it so we have this vulnerability.</p><p>The biggest issue -- we talk about this after every shooting is the copycat effect. That's why we never mention the guy's name. That's why we try not to cover it, blanket coverage, because blanket coverage enlarges the spotlight which is what they want. Each shooter cites previous shooters. That is a fact. Each one inspires the next.</p><p>My worry is that because he filmed it he gave it a wider -- wider reach for more people to see, expanding his footprint and it is our -- I wound not just go after social media, it is our responsibility in the media to shrink that footprint to as small as possible.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jesse, and I should correct myself, I said they're not doing anything. Facebook says that it has 15,000 contractors and employees reviewing content as part of a 30,000 person team working on it. But I can say this, since they launched livestreaming there have been murders. There have been suicides. In fact, there was a man in Thailand who killed his 11-month-old daughter in a live video and that was two years ago, and we still have this going on.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, I don't know what anybody can do about that because we live in a free society. So people can use technology however they want, and you have to catch up with the fact afterwards. And that's the unfortunate situation. Now, I don't understand how the media can lie about this guy's manifesto. I read it. The manifesto, if you read it, does not attribute this guy's philosophy to Donald Trump. This is a direct quote, the nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China.</p><p>This guy was an eco-nationalist. Meaning, he was a racist and thought that the immigrant population of the earth was too fertile and they were overpopulating everything and were causing climate change and they needed to be eradicated. He said he's not a conservative. He's not a Nazi. And like Greg said, he was celebrating these wacko European mass shooters more than anything.</p><p>So for the media to link Donald Trump and frame Donald Trump for some lunatic's actions halfway around the world is so irresponsible and it's exactly what the guy wanted. If you read the manifesto the guy wanted division in his country. He wanted the left to overreact and take away guns from Republicans, and wanted to balkanize North America because that would create more racial purity in his opinion.</p><p>So, we were very responsible when the Bernie bro shot up Steve Scalise's baseball game. We didn't attribute that to Bernie. We didn't attribute that to the left-wing media. We've said everyone is individually responsible for themselves. But the media doesn't do that when it's on the other side. They only frame Republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because it's easy to tweet that this -- Trump was somehow responsible.</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah, I could say the Israeli-Palestinian violence that's happening today, I could point to Omar and say she instigated the anti- Semitism hate against Israel and that's why. But I wouldn't do that because that's not true.</p><p>BOOTHE: I would say, one, I think it just takes a special kind of evil to target people in a house of worship that's supposed to be a place of refuge. They were praying. It's absolutely despicable and disgusting. We obviously pray for the victims and their families as well. I'm with Greg. I really struggle in the fact that -- I think there's a responsibility to deny these killers what they want. And this guy wants to live in infamy.</p><p>Clearly, he wrote a manifesto because he wanted it out. And I'm all about denying that by not giving the manifesto any time and not giving him what he wants. And to Greg's point about the copy cats, I spent all day today looking at statistics and studies about it and it's real and it's scary. Dr. Steven Pitt who's a psychiatric -- did psychiatric autopsy of the Columbine shooting, he said that the shooters predicted with chilling and stunning accuracy how their actions would encourage other similarly disaffected individuals for doing the same thing.</p><p>You'll get things like the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting. During the trial there were two similar shootings in movie theaters in two weeks after that. ABC in 2014 did an investigation found that 17 school shooters and 36 others that tried were all partially inspired by Columbine. The Newtown shooter had clippings, as you've said, of previous mass murders that took place.</p><p>So, clearly, these guys want infamy and we should deny it to them. And sometimes we give it to them. The Rolling Stone did that cover of the Boston bomber, put them on the cover. Remember after the Virginia Tech shooting, images of the guys with the gun. Let's deny them what they want. Don't give them the infamy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Juan, what about shutting down people's ability to use social media? Is that something the Democrats would be on board with?</p><p>WILLIAMS: We're going to talk about that -- we're going to talk about later in this show because what we're seeing is an increased emphasis on either regulating or moderating, or even in Elizabeth Warren's terms breaking up some of the power because these folks are interested in money. It's unbelievable that this 17-minute video, the police want it stopped. It just keeps running and, of course, it spreads and it spreads to a specific niche population that's interested, you know, kind of the gamers and a little bit of a hate people all combined here for young men. I think it's very troubling.</p><p>I just want to say, I think, imagine if a Muslim had committed such an act, I can imagine that there are a lot of people who would have gone bananas on the Muslim community here in the United States and around the world. But what I think is the reality is, we have white nationalists anger spreading globally, his manifesto was called the great replacement and they're talking about, you know, just like we saw in Charlottesville, you will not replace us.</p><p>And we see this kind of anger being spread in such a way that I think we have to address the idea that this white nationalist fervor is now without borders because of the internet, and because -- we can't ignore it or play it down because it doesn't fit one ideology or the other --</p><p>MCDOWELL: We need to go. But the problem is after the rage that you saw here in the United States was directed at President Trump for something -- a massacre that happened in New Zealand. Some in the media can't get enough of Beto O'Rourke or how the heck you say his first name. He's all the buzz over the 2020 candidates. Is it overblown?</p><p>BOOTHE: Some in the media are overcome with Beto mania after the guy who lost to Ted Cruz officially announced he's running for president. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, I'm a little light hearted today because I like this feeling. It got a new levity to it. But it's not like we in the press created it. There's something out there that is magical.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, he has a vibrancy, a youthfulness to him. He has a message which is largely cheerful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Seeing him is like -- it's like a Jesus Christ Superstar seeing this guy in front of people. He's got that celebrity aura about him. And in that moment he was owning that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOTHE: Safe to say they like him. But the question a lot of us are asking is what has he actually accomplished. Here's Nancy Pelosi responding, attempting to answer the question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: -- brought vitality to Congress. When he came, he came as a real champion for the environment. He got a great deal of support from the environmental community in his district. Preserving our planet and protecting our people, there are at least two areas in addition to his vitality in so many other ways.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOTHE: So, Juan, to me it looks like she's struggling to answer the question. So why Beto what has he done?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think -- around town the big cliche was Abe Lincoln he only had one term as the Congressman before he became President. But, I think clearly, the voters in El Paso liked him. And I think if you wanted to look at the actual record he was pretty good, not only on environment, but on military spending.</p><p>Today, though, I must say the guns out for Robert Francis or that's what White House likes to call him or Beto, The Washington Post had a front page story about how Republican donors had been key to the start of his camp -- of his career as a politician. And he had backed spending for some malls that pushed people out of low-income neighborhoods.</p><p>And then you also have to keep in mind that he, and I think this is really important, Lisa, sometimes I think the Right can't hear this, but he did lose to Ted Cruz. But for the people for people on the Left the idea that in Texas he challenged Ted Cruz and raised a record amount of money like $80 million, I think, really makes him a superstar.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, you're right, he did raise a record amount of money, Jesse, but part of that was because he was running against Ted Cruz, someone that the media hates, that the left hates, so they really protected him, and his record really wasn't examined.</p><p>Now that's going to be a little bit different, Jesse. I was talking yesterday about the fact that he supports the Green New Deal allegedly, but took more money from the fossil fuel industry than anyone else besides Ted Cruz. So this stuff is going to surface and do you think it's going to end up having an impact on him?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it will. He will not release his new fundraising numbers, which is interesting. I'm not so sure they're going to beat Sanders'. They might not even beat Kamala's. Like you said, if he doesn't have a demon as the Left sees Ted Cruz as, maybe they're not going to put money in his pockets, but we'll see.</p><p>I think Chris Matthews has another throw up of his leg. It's clear he's the media darling right now and there's already Beto backlash. POLITICO says no woman got that kind of coverage and they don't like how this white male who has this privilege is being romanticized in the media. He's got the Vanity Fair cover.</p><p>They had all the reporters down there in El Paso for the counter Trump rally, and he's only been to Iowa once. And when he got up on that table in the coffee shop there were more media reporters than there were voters. So we'll see about him. The weirder he gets, I kind of like him, to be honest with you.</p><p>He was in a hacking group. He wrote some crazy stuff about murder. I don't know, he's kind of unpredictable, and that's kind of interesting and he's more fun to cover than some of the other candidates.</p><p>BOOTHE: Interesting. So the hacking group is what that just does it for you.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it -- that does it for me.</p><p>BOOTHE: All right. Greg, there's a Morning Consult poll that found that 49 percent of those polled either hadn't heard of him or have no opinion on him. Do you think he's going to be able to differentiate himself?</p><p>GUTFELD: Those people are idiots, because Beto is awesome. You guys are so mean to the guy. Look, you know what? Why does the media love him? Because he is them.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you look at him, he's just lily-white, non-threatening, liberal who likes their kind of music, right. He's kind of edgy in an inoffensive way. He looks like he probably does Pilates, I don't know. Or maybe has one of those new bikes that everybody's talking about.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, the Peloton.</p><p>GUTFELD: Peloton, thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: Why are you looking at me? I don't know that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- like he runs the Peloton --</p><p>WATTERS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: But he is the Republican with his minuses, would get nowhere. Obviously, the drunk driving arrests and they're running away from the scene, and the fact that he married an heiress. I mean, that's stuff. But if you're a Republican, would be endless --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a second, wait a second -- I know what you're going to say to me. But I believe we have a President who has no political experience.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And who has a lot of problem --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, but he hasn't been arrested.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: But you want to talk, yes, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: The Mueller report is not out.</p><p>GUTFELD: The Mueller report -- you want to talk collusion. Now you want to talk collusion, look at the -- like how -- what a coincidence that he declared when the cover came out. I mean, that's -- so that's with Vanity Fair.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, media loves him.</p><p>GUTFELD: So they like -- the thing that gets me mad -- not mad, but I find it humorous actually. How does the media not notice when they're fanboying. Like -- how can they -- when they are talking about somebody they love, do they go death, and they can't hear how hilarious they sound when they're talking about.</p><p>They're basically vomiting Valentine's -- projectile Valentine's and it's like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have more man talk about how he's kind of a himbo and women don't see that. Quite frankly --</p><p>GUTFELD: The men, you're right the men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Himbo, it's like a male bimbo.</p><p>GUTFELD: The men are more into him than the women.</p><p>WATTERS: That's a fancy thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way is just want to say couple of things. Well, Jesse, if I squint move my chair way, you kind of look like --</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, don't you dare.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my god.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I looked at their website, there's nothing about policy. There's just some merch for sale and a couple of photos of Beto, one where he has sweat dripping down his face.</p><p>GUTFELD: We're going to get that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. So here are -- I wrote some suggestions of things he could sell on his website to raise more money. How about a beard kit that you staple on, so you at least, look like you can split wood? I think that's his voting bus --</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Well, maybe he'll show up in Iowa like that, maybe we'll see. All right. Well, America's top general is ripping Google, find out why next. Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIAMS: America's top general warning about the potential dangers of Google's relationship China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENERAL JOSEPH DUNFORD, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CHAIRMAN: The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military. We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit.</p><p>In fact, frankly, indirect maybe not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: The company recently dropped its bid for a $10 billion Pentagon contract saying that would conflict with its corporate values, apparently not so with the Chinese. In fact, this is so interesting to me, Dagen, what General Dunford said was, you have a $5 trillion share of the Chinese economy that is state-run.</p><p>So when Google does business with the Chinese military, it essentially then is funneling that information, that strategy and technology into the Chinese economy as well. This is all thievery.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And then the company because of outrage within the liberal walls of Google decided to not do business with the U.S. Defense Department. So let's be clear, Google is not in favor of protecting the land and the nation and the people that allowed Google to be formed in the first place.</p><p>It is this kind of delusional moralizing from the people at Google. There motto used to be \"Don't be Evil\", well they got rid of that clearly if they're doing business with the Chinese, and the delusional moralizing that really hurts America.</p><p>And I just want to point -- I just quickly do the imitation of Ruth Porat, the CFO, after Hillary Clinton lost and they had this big company meeting. She was talking about Hillary losing and what a massive that it was and it was really painful, that's Google.</p><p>BOOTHE: Sounds upset.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I think that's Google. That's who works at Google.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jesse, so what they refused to do for the Pentagon was work on cloud storage type technology and they said it was in violation of the company's principles, a lot of the workers said this. How do you interpret this?</p><p>WATTERS: Well, do the company's principles adhere to the Communist Chinese principles?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I hope not.</p><p>WATTERS: They had some pretty crazy principles over in China -- one-child policy, no freedom of speech. The Chinese have a \"Project Dragonfly\" that Google was working on with them, where they can censor all sorts of Internet content, and it looks like Google's OK with that.</p><p>What they're doing, Juan, is they're putting profits above patriotism. And you have to ask yourself, is Google an American company anymore? Or do they -- are they just this amorphous multinational conglomerate that just does whatever they want to whoever they want in search for the highest bidder?</p><p>$21 billion in revenue over there in Asia, that's a pretty penny. And like you said in the beginning, if you invest Google in China, in a commercial enterprise, they just transfer that right to the state-owned corporations. So there's a direct pipeline from commercial interests to the military- industrial complex which is run by the Communist Chinese, and they steal it on top of that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Lisa, Elizabeth Warren has been trying to say we should break up some of the Facebook, Google, Amazon, that they're just too big and too powerful. Jesse, you suggested maybe they don't have any sense of loyalty to the United States?</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, and a lot of this comes from the criticism over data, which I think is one of the biggest fake news stories of all time. The Obama team did the exact same thing at Cambridge Analytica did. The only reason anyone cared about it was because they got caught in President Trump's orbit campaigns.</p><p>Both the RNC and the DNC have massive databases of consumer information for voters across the country. Every politician that was sitting on those Committees pointing the fingers, has Mark Zuckerberg has used consumer data in way to target voters, it's all such a sham.</p><p>Not only that, there's literally no privacy anymore. You look at location services, it's a $21 billion industry in 2018, people following, you what you're doing via apps to reach you via advertising and things of that nature. Vizio was caught two years ago of like collecting data on people via smart TV.</p><p>So point is, there's no privacy, the whole thing's a sham. And the only reason anyone cared about it was because of President Trump.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think Greg disagrees. Because Greg thinks that, in fact, we should -- a lot of times people don't realize they're giving up their privacy.</p><p>GUTFELD: You have read my mind, just like Facebook. It's true. I hate Google for two reasons. The one reason that Juan is talking about is because they got me, right? I got suckered into the free Google which is -- look at this marvelous search engine. It's all your, search away, search away, and then you are the product. Because once every -- once you're using, they're just mining you, so you become the product.</p><p>#2, their employees were -- a few of their employees were upset, because they were helping with the drone -- making the drone program in the Pentagon more precise. Precise drones will help eliminate mass warfare, that's what it's about. You don't have to carpet-bomb anymore if you have precise drones.</p><p>So what they were arguing about was -- I mean, what they were defined was actually, progress that would help save millions of lives.</p><p>WATTERS: Instead of Google, Ask Jeeves --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Let's go back.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. They're rushing us, because there's so much fun about to happen, an explosion of \"Fan Mail Friday\", with maestro Gutfeld next on THE FIVE.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes, Fan Mail Friday, let's get started. We don't have enough time here. Instagram question. If you were a college professor, Juan, what would you teach?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I was a philosophy major in college and I -- but I don't know much about philosophy these days. I discovered my thesis the other day in the basement. I couldn't even understand what's this guy is writing about.</p><p>GUTFELD: We feel that same way.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But now it's like I'm all steeped in politics and history, I should have majored in something that would have been useful. My mom would have appreciated it.</p><p>GUTFELD: How about you Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: I would do like history of rock and roll or bowling or something like that.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bowling, interesting.</p><p>BOOTHE: -- you still get paid and it's not really -- its I mean --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, were you in that College scam?</p><p>GUTFELD: Dagen?</p><p>BOOTHE: I deny it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would teach --</p><p>BOOTHE: Not that you know of.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would teach speech to everybody.</p><p>GUTFELD: Speech.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in an Ivy League school.</p><p>GUTFELD: Very good, very good. Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: I wouldn't teach. I would coach.</p><p>BOOTHE: Which sport?</p><p>GUTFELD: Why don't you teach coaching? How about that?</p><p>WATTERS: Not qualified.</p><p>GUTFELD: See, I would do a class called errands.</p><p>WATTERS: Errands?</p><p>GUTFELD: Errands. And then I would show up and just give each student an errand to run, and then I would just kick back.</p><p>WATTERS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: And they've learned, yes, right. There you go. Quick one. All right Sherry U. writes, \"What is the nicest thing you have done for someone else this week?</p><p>WATTERS: Why are you looking at me like that?</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: You know, I can't come up with anything. Jesus -- god, did I give a homeless guy anything? I might have -- I tipped. OK. When I get change at the Starbucks, I put the rest of the change in the tip jar.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's very good.</p><p>WATTERS: Because you probably pocket it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, when they're not looking, I take the whole tip jar.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I don't think you're giving yourself enough credit. I bet people in your life appreciate.</p><p>WATTERS: I must have done something.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what the thing -- the problem with Jesse is he's done so much, he can't remember. He can't remember.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Have you Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I always do this. I stopped a lady in the street who looked really nice -- perfect stranger and told her that she looked really pretty.</p><p>GUTFELD: See, we can't do that. If I do that, I'm like -- I'm gone. Did you just told that woman she looked good?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's how you get arrested.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, yes. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: So I going to get two things, one, I mentored a young man. I took him to dinner and hung out with him. But secondly, I agreed to give us free speech at event.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's really good. Wow. Lisa.</p><p>WATTERS: He's like the Dana of the table now.</p><p>GUTFELD: Lisa.</p><p>BOOTHE: I don't know this week, but next month I'm watching my special- needs aunt for my parents, so they can go on vacation.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's real good.</p><p>BOOTHE: And it's a vacation I bought for them.</p><p>GUTFELD: The question has said what \"Have you done this week\", so you cheated --</p><p>BOOTHE: I know.</p><p>GUTFELD: -- by looking ahead. I could do that too. Like, next week I'm planning on schooling these orphans on errands.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think there was a pregnant lady on the subway who got on and you didn't get your -- out of the seat and give her the seat, I'm just --</p><p>GUTFELD: I give money to the guys that play music on the subway, because I like the music.</p><p>WATTERS: I thought you will do fine with the guy that plays music on the subway.</p><p>GUTFELD: Damn it Jesse, \"One More Thing\" is next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And usurped his money.</p><p>WATTERS: Time now for \"One More Thing\". Bernie Sanders has a big bandage on his head. Check out the Senator from Vermont there, gashed his head on the corner of the glass shower door. He's got seven stitches. Went to a walk-in clinic, keeps campaigning in South Carolina.</p><p>GUTFELD: Tough guy.</p><p>WATTERS: He's a very tough guy. Now I actually understand what happened. I myself too gashed my head --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: -- in the bathroom on Black Friday about two years ago. They did a great job with the makeup there. But there is a Band-Aid on my head, so Bernie and I have a lot in common.</p><p>GUTFELD: Run with him.</p><p>BOOTHE: Jesse that could be your nice thing this week that you just did for Bernie.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right.</p><p>BOOTHE: You may feel better.</p><p>WATTERS: I made feel better Bernie, wow, that's a low bar. All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, take a look at this scene from a month ago. Yes, that's Duke basketball star Zion Williamson falling to the floor as his Nikes tore apart. Will now take a look at this video as the star returns to the court last night</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: 29 points with a perfect night of shooting. 13 for 13, he also had 14 rebounds 5 steals. That kind of performance is going to put him at the center of March Madness. And guess what he was wearing Nikes. Yes, he's stuck with the brand. The shoemaker made a special size 15 with extra padding for the 6'7'', 285 pound college freshman. By the way NCAA tournament teams will be selected this weekend good luck to your team guys.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: And they have Tar Heels this weekend too, I think.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Big game. All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. Tomorrow night, Saturday, March 16th, 10:00 p.m. another Greg Gutfeld Show with Johnny Joey Jones, Jimmy Failla, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. And I think Jesse has a show too, but he forgot to--</p><p>WATTERS: I did.</p><p>GUTFELD: He forgot to promote it. So Jesse Show as well which is on at 8:00. Anyway animals are great, right?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Animals are Great!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Every now and then you find an animal that's not just strange, but strangely sexy. Check out the dance of the Bateleur eagle -- Bateleur is French for tightrope walker. And I got to tell you something, there's something really interesting. I want one of these.</p><p>WATTERS: Is that a real thing?</p><p>GUTFELD: That is a real thing. That is not a man in a furry suit, although, I have been known to dress up like that on the weekends, downtown just to make some extra money.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. That's -- it's called the</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Animals are Great!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: That was real. I think might be high.</p><p>WATTERS: Before we get to dig and I'm going to plug my show. 8:00 p.m. we have Dana Loesch and we have Kellyanne Conway in. I interview a birth striker, she won't have kids, because she's afraid the climate is going to kill the earth. All right, there it is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So man's flying into the Berlin Airport from Cairo with, what he says, were some cakes, little chocolate cakes. Officers stopped him and said -- he said, \"I have nothing to declare\". And they said, \"Let's look in this box\". They're not cakes, they were tortoises -- living Moroccan tortoises.</p><p>WATTERS: That's trouble.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That the border veterinarian, who knew there were veterinarians at the border, that's good to hear, confiscated the animals. Hopefully, they're safe. The guy faces up to $56,000 fine, could end up in prison. If you love tortoises and turtles, go to the turtle conservancy to figure out how to save them all.</p><p>BOOTHE: So real quick, so I wouldn't go out of time.
