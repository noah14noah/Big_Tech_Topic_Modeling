I'm just trying to get a Thank you for your time this sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together. UK Council for Child Internet Safety was set up following my recommendation so they could work together. Ten years later this hasn't happened and government now is saying, let's see if we can get a voluntary code of practice. It is now too late. We lost over -- got over 500 reports of sexual offences against children. That's 15 day in 2016 and 17 and last year when finally the law came in, the anti- grooming law, in six months we have 1300 offences against children. So it is enough now. The social media companies have been left to mark their own home work, they haven't done it. My recommendation was ten years ago, it hasn't been done. It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can get a voluntary code of practice up and running. We need a mandatory code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper. Grooming is seen under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. So already we are seeing that really important aspects are being left out and the point is this can be done. We know these big tech companies have bots and algorithms that can target advertising the people. In Germany, they will find social media companies that don't remove extremist content. We also know, as we recently heard, that a whistleblower said there was a backlog of child engage in reports. -- endangerment. It is not being done properly. We are talking about child safety and social media companies have had ten years and they haven't done anything in a joined up way that the public understands. It's not enough now for the to give them more time and then say, maybe we will think about legislation. Time is up. There are quotes from Theresa May. She was speaking in Davos. I suspect you followed this. The quote was, shareholders should pressure the Burmese to take their responsibility towards protecting their users seriously. screen. And on BBC radio London. I am back in 30 minutes. seriously. I think the towards protecting their users responsibility lies with everybody and I think you have had a great piece prior to talking to me with fantastic parents who obviously really preparing their children to use the online space safely and are aware of how their children are using the online space. It is everyone's responsibility but this was a government review that I was asked to do 10 years ago the recommendations were made and most of them, some of them have been followed through but most haven't.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-11176877ea724e55983872472e83a922</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJD-PWB1-DY08-33FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder.

I understand why companies may not wish to have that, at a thinker would be good. Tanya Byron who made the original reccomendations in that report ten years ago joins us now from London. Thank you for your time this morning. I'm just trying to get a sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together. UK Council for Child Internet Safety was set up following my recommendation so they could work together. Ten years later this hasn't happened and government now is saying, let's see if we can get a voluntary code of practice. It is now too late. We lost over -- got over 500 reports of sexual offences against children. That's 15 day in 2016 and 17 and last year when finally the law came in, the anti- grooming law, in six months we have 1300 offences against children. So it is enough now. The social media companies have been left to mark their own home work, they haven't done it. My recommendation was ten years ago, it hasn't been done. It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can and running. We need a mandatory get a voluntary code of practice up code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper. Grooming is seen under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. So already we are seeing that really important aspects are being left out and the point is this can be done. We know these big tech companies have bots and algorithms that can target advertising the people. In Germany, they will find social media companies that don't remove extremist content. We also know, as we recently heard, that a whistleblower said there was a backlog of child engage in reports. -- endangerment. It is not being done properly. We are talking about child safety and social media companies have had ten years and they haven't done anything in a joined up way that the public understands. It's not enough now for the to give them more time and then say, maybe we will think about legislation. Time is up. There are quotes from Theresa May. She was followed this. The quote was, speaking in Davos. I suspect you shareholders should pressure the Burmese to take their responsibility towards protecting their users seriously. screen. And on BBC radio London.

Tanya Byron who made the original years ago joins us now from London. reccomendations in that report ten Thank you for your time this morning. I'm just trying to get a sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together. UK Council for Child Internet Safety was set up following my recommendation so they could work together. Ten years later this hasn't happened and government now is saying, let's see if we can get a voluntary code of practice. It is now too late. We lost over -- got over 500 reports of sexual offences against children. That's 15 day in 2016 and 17 and last year when finally the law came in, the anti- grooming law, in six months we have 1300 offences against children. So it is enough now. The social media companies have been left to mark their own home work, they haven't done it. My recommendation was ten years ago, it hasn't been done. It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can get a voluntary code of practice up and running. We need a mandatory code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper. Grooming is seen under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. So already we are seeing that really important aspects are being left out and the point is this can be done.

I'm just trying to get a Thank you for your time this sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together.

The social media companies have been left to mark their own home work, they haven't done it. My recommendation was ten years ago, it hasn't been done. It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can get a voluntary code of practice up and running. We need a mandatory code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper. Grooming is seen under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. So already we are seeing that really important aspects are being left out and the point is this can be done. We know these big tech companies have bots and algorithms that can target advertising the people. In Germany, they will find social media companies that don't remove extremist content. We also know, as we recently heard, that a whistleblower said there was a backlog of child engage in reports. -- endangerment. It is not being done properly. We are talking about child safety and social media companies have had ten years and they haven't done anything in a joined up way that the public understands. It's not enough now for the to give them more time and then say, maybe we will think about legislation. Time is up. There are quotes from Theresa May. She was speaking in Davos. I suspect you followed this. The quote was, shareholders should pressure the Burmese to take their responsibility towards protecting their users seriously. screen. And on BBC radio London. I am back in 30 minutes. seriously. I think the towards protecting their users responsibility lies with everybody and I think you have had a great piece prior to talking to me with fantastic parents who obviously really preparing their children to use the online space safely and are aware of how their children are using the online space. It is everyone's responsibility but this was a government review that I was asked to do 10 years ago the recommendations were made and most of them, some of them have been followed through but most haven't.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-8c82cf7669da4dcdbda88887be95494e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJD-PWB1-DY08-33GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm just trying to get a Thank you for your time this sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together. UK Council for Child Internet Safety was set up following my recommendation so they could work together. Ten years later this hasn't happened and government now is saying, let's see if we can get a voluntary code of practice. It is now too late. We lost over -- got over 500 reports of sexual offences against children. That's 15 day in 2016 and 17 and last year when finally the law came in, the anti- grooming law, in six months we have 1300 offences against children. So it is enough now.

It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can get a voluntary code of practice up and running. We need a mandatory code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper.

In terms of a voluntary code, I think it would be better if we were to put something more permanent in law because I think you can't actually do enough for children's safety and for everyone's safety, so, yes, those things will be good. I understand why companies may not wish to have that, at a thinker would be good. reccomendations in that report ten Tanya Byron who made the original years ago joins us now from London. morning. I'm just trying to get a Thank you for your time this sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together. UK Council for Child Internet Safety was set up following my recommendation so they could work together. Ten years later this hasn't happened and government now is saying, let's see if we can get a voluntary code of practice. It is now too late. We lost over -- got over 500 reports of sexual offences against children. That's 15 day in 2016 and 17 and last year when finally the law came in, the anti- grooming law, in six months we have 1300 offences against children. So it is enough now. The social media companies have been left to mark their own home work, they haven't done it. My recommendation was ten years ago, it hasn't been done. It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can get a voluntary code of practice up and running. We need a mandatory code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper. Grooming is seen under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. So already we are seeing that really important aspects are being left out and the point is this can be done. We know these big tech companies have bots and algorithms that can target advertising the people. In Germany, they will find social media companies that don't remove extremist content. We also know, as we recently heard, that a whistleblower said there was a backlog of child engage in reports. -- endangerment. It is not being done properly. We are talking about child safety and social media companies have had ten years and they haven't done anything in a joined up way that the public understands. It's not enough now for the to give them more time and then say, maybe we will think about legislation. Time is up. There are quotes from Theresa May. She was speaking in Davos. I suspect you followed this. The quote was, shareholders should pressure the Burmese to take their responsibility towards protecting their users seriously. screen. And on BBC radio London. I am back in 30 minutes. seriously. I think the towards protecting their users responsibility lies with everybody and I think you have had a great piece prior to talking to me with fantastic parents who obviously really preparing their children to use the online space safely and are aware of how their children are using the online space. It is everyone's responsibility but this was a government review that I was asked to do 10 years ago the recommendations were made and most of them, some of them have been followed through but most haven't.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-bbcffce1ebd64b60bfe3c0f1eb0232b4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJD-PWB1-DY08-33DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Theresa May will today urge EU leaders to stand together to face down Russian aggression following the Salisbury poisoning. The speech comes a day after the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson escalated tensions with Russia by comparing President Putin's promotion of the World Cup with Adolf Hitler's use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Our Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, has more. It was an invitation some had refused. REPORTER: Ambassador, why are you taking part in this meeting?

The European Union is targeting the big tech companies with a new tax that could see them pay billions more every year. I'll have all the details. In sport, England suffer a dramatic collapse on day one of the first Test against New Zealand. </p><p>Not even Stuart Broad's 400th Test wicket can mask the embarrassment of England's sixth-lowest Test score of just 58 runs. And Carol has the weather. Good morning. From the roof of Broadcasting House in London. Today eastern areas will see the brightest of the weather, in the West, cloud ahead of a band of rain accompanied by windy conditions. Temperature wise, pretty good shape. More in 15 minutes. Thanks. Good morning. First, our main story. Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has apologised for allowing the data of 50 million users to be harvested by the political consultancy firm, Cambridge Analytica. the need for better regulation Speaking to CNN, he accepted of the social media network. From Washington, Chris Buckler reports. Facebook contains a world of personal information. More than 2 billion users have entrusted it with details including their age, whether they're in a relationship and perhaps crucially, their political leanings. All the data, the targeting... Four days, Mark Zuckerberg or silent while damaging allegations were broadcast around the world of how Cambridge Analytica took advantage of information from Facebook users. Now he is promising a full forensic audit and he says anyone who's data may have been compromised will be told. He knows his social network will continue to be tested by those looking to exploit it. There was a lot of hard work we need to do to make it harder for nation states like Russia to do election interference, to make it so that trolls and others cannot spread fake news. We have to do this for the 2018 midterms in the US, a huge deal, but there is a big election in India this year, in Brazil, big elections around the world. Politicians on both the UK and the US also have questions for Mr Zucker -- Mark Zuckerberg. With talk of greater regulation, the face of Facebook may find he has little choice. Reports that the new blue British passport will be made by a European company has good -- has triggered an angry reaction from some Conservative MPs. Both the same newspaper and Telegraph says a FrenchDutch security firm has won the contract. The Home Office has not confirmed a decision but it said in a statement it had carried out a fair and open competition to ensure value for money. Theresa May will today urge EU leaders to stand together to face down Russian aggression following the Salisbury poisoning. The speech comes a day after the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson escalated tensions with Russia by comparing President Putin's promotion of the World Cup with Adolf Hitler's use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Our Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, has more. It was an invitation some had refused. REPORTER: Ambassador, why are you taking part in this meeting? But these foreign diplomats had accepted, to come and hear Moscow's side of the story on the nerve agent attack. Britain sent a diplomat to the Foreign Ministry, but the British Ambassador stayed away. This is what he missed. TRANSLATION: The British authorities are either unable to ensure protection from such a terrorist act on their territory or they themselves, directly or indirectly - I'm not accusing anyone - have directed this attack against a Russian citizen. Hello, my name is Emma Nottingham, and I'm from the British Embassy. Off camera, the British diplomat hits back. Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a military grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia in what we see as an attempted assassination. \"What's going on in their heads?\" He replies. \"Take a break from your Russophobia and your island mentality.\" ARCHIVE: Berlin's great day dawns with the arrival of the Olympic Flame... In Britain, a Labour MP suggested that Vladimir Putin would use the World Cup like Adolf Hitler had used the 1936 Olympics, \"a brutal, corrupt regime.\" \"to cover up,\" as he put it, The Foreign Secretary agreed. with 1936 is certainly right I think the comparison and I think it's an emetic</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-d269df7c33644e66be15327440cbd18e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXN-G971-JBH6-C07N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

I'll have all the details. In sport, England suffer a dramatic collapse on day one of the first Test against New Zealand. Not even Stuart Broad's 400th Test wicket can mask the embarrassment of England's sixth-lowest Test score of just 58 runs. </p><p>And Carol has the weather. Good morning. From the roof of Broadcasting House in London. Today eastern areas will see the brightest of the weather, in the West, cloud ahead of a band of rain accompanied by windy conditions. Temperature wise, pretty good shape. More in 15 minutes. Thanks. Good morning. First, our main story. has apologised for allowing the data Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, of 50 million users to be harvested by the political consultancy firm, Cambridge Analytica. Speaking to CNN, he accepted the need for better regulation of the social media network. From Washington, Chris Buckler reports. Facebook contains a world of personal information. More than 2 billion users have entrusted it with details including their age, whether they're in a relationship and perhaps crucially, their political leanings. All the data, the targeting... Four days, Mark Zuckerberg or silent while damaging allegations were broadcast around the world of how Cambridge Analytica took advantage of information from Facebook users. Now he is promising a full forensic audit and he says anyone who's data may have been compromised will be told. He knows his social network will continue to be tested by those looking to exploit it. There was a lot of hard work we need to do to make it harder for nation states like Russia to do election interference, to make it so that trolls and others cannot spread fake news. We have to do this for the 2018 midterms in the US, a huge deal, but there is a big election in India this year, in Brazil, big elections around the world. Politicians on both the UK and the US also have questions for Mr Zucker -- Mark Zuckerberg. With talk of greater regulation, the face of Facebook may find he has little choice. Reports that the new blue British passport will be made by a European company has good -- has triggered an angry reaction from some Conservative MPs. Both the same newspaper and Telegraph says a FrenchDutch security firm has won the contract. The Home Office has not confirmed a decision but it said in a statement it had carried out a fair and open competition to ensure value for money. Theresa May will today urge EU leaders to stand together to face down Russian aggression following the Salisbury poisoning. The speech comes a day after the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson escalated tensions with Russia by comparing President Putin's promotion of the World Cup with Adolf Hitler's use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Our Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, has more. It was an invitation some had refused. REPORTER: Ambassador, why are you taking part in this meeting? But these foreign diplomats had accepted, to come and hear Moscow's side of the story on the nerve agent attack. Britain sent a diplomat to the Foreign Ministry, but the British Ambassador stayed away. This is what he missed. TRANSLATION: The British authorities are either unable to ensure protection from such a terrorist act on their territory or they themselves, directly or indirectly - I'm not accusing anyone - have directed this attack against a Russian citizen. Hello, my name is Emma Nottingham, and I'm from the British Embassy. Off camera, the British diplomat hits back. Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a military grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia in what we see as an attempted assassination. \"What's going on in their heads?\" He replies. \"Take a break from your Russophobia and your island mentality.\" ARCHIVE: Berlin's great day dawns with the arrival of the Olympic Flame... In Britain, a Labour MP suggested that Vladimir Putin would use the World Cup like Adolf Hitler had used the 1936 Olympics, \"to cover up,\" as he put it, \"a brutal, corrupt regime.\" The Foreign Secretary agreed.

Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS: And I'm Christine Romans. It is Tuesday, June 4th. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East, everyone.</p><p>And this is day two of the president's three day state visit to the U.K. Over the next few hours, things could get interesting. There's the president right now sitting down talking about trade. The president and British prime minister may be spending a lot of time together.</p><p>First up on the schedule, this business roundtable at St. James Palace. Then the president and prime minister host a breakfast attended by the duke of York and prominent U.S. and British business leaders. Bilateral trade talks follow later in the day.</p><p>It's anyone's guess how this is going to go. The two leaders have a rocky relationship before the president publicly second guessed the outgoing prime minister this week on her Brexit strategy.</p><p>Let's go live to London and bring in CNN's Nic Robertson.</p><p>We have heard the president commenting at that business round table saying many people might be surprised to know the U.S. is the largest export market for the U.K. Maybe that caught the president by surprise, I'm not sure, but they are trying to talk about the two trade ties between these two countries, both countries embroiled in trade disputes everywhere you look.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Indeed. If that wasn't odd enough that they're engaging in the language, the trade issues go on around the world. President Trump arriving here, having criticized the Theresa May, the way she's handling Brexit, saying that her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could be a good prime minister.</p><p>Today in this business meeting this morning, President Trump said that Theresa May should stick around to work out this new trade deal 2000 the between the two countries, it had been an honor to work with her. She has been working in the best interests of the country, the new trade deal he said would be fair and substantive.</p><p>It's kind of a mirror of when President Trump came last summer when again he criticized Theresa May for Boris Johnson, and then the following day said that he got on fine with Theresa May, she was doing a great job. More of that this year.</p><p>I think the tough talks after this business meeting where it is all about how much business Britain does with the United States, vice versa? Theresa May's message here will be, it's deep, it's good, it's substantive, but we could do more in the future.</p><p>Perhaps the tougher talks will come when they get to Downing Street in an hour or so's time. That will be about the issues that divide the two countries, Iran being one of them. That will be a big issue, so China, potentially doing business for the British government with Huawei, the 5G operator there. Those could be more divisive issues.</p><p>This business meeting underway right now, all about the raid and strength and depth of relationship between the two countries and President Trump is saying that Theresa May should stick around to work out this deal. ROMANS: Nic, what does a successful trip look like. Is it just no gaps, no mistakes or is it some kind of a trade deal.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Successful for who, for the British, I think, you know, there would be a subtle political messaging that conservative party right now doesn't need wrinkles as it works out the new leader, so it really doesn't need President Trump saying that he backs one leader over another.</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>ROBERTSON: That would be success I think on the British side. For President Trump, it really has to be able to walk away, having had a successful state visit and not made gaffes with the queen present, you know, would be dug up in future years, maybe when he's no longer president. So, you know, both sides have an interest in getting the staging of it right.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, the president seems to do well with pomp and circumstance, so, you know, playing by the book over the last 18 hours or so.</p><p>Nic Robertson, thank you so much at 10 Downing Street. Thanks, sir.</p><p>BRIGGS: They do expect protests today but yesterday was pomp and circumstance, with the president and first lady attending a state banquet hosted by the queen at Buckingham palace. The president walked with the queen.</p><p>[05:05:00] Both the queen and Mr. Trump celebrated the special relationship between the U.S. and Britain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She has embodied the spirit of dignity, spirit and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart. On behalf of all Americans, I offer a toast to the eternal friendship of our people, the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations, and to the long cherished and truly remarkable reign of her majesty, the queen.</p><p>QUEEN ELIZABETH II, UNITED KINGDOM: Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to President and Mrs. Trump to the continued friendship between our two nations and to the health, prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Prior to the event, the first couple had tea with Charles and Camilla. Earlier in the day, Britain rolled out the red carpet for President Trump, receiving him with the royal troops salute.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Back home, congressional Republicans may be planning a revolt to block President Trump's new tariffs on Mexico. And according to \"The Washington Post,\" the vote could also block billions of dollars in border wall funding announced by the president in February when he declared a national emergency.</p><p>Senate Majority Whip John Thune tells \"The Post\", we have a lot of members who are very concerned about where this is headed. Congress is going to want to be heard from in terms of trying to limit Trump's tariff authority. The president, of course, threatening to impose a 5 percent tariff on Mexican imports beginning next week, the rate raising incrementally to 25 percent by October 1st.</p><p>BRIGGS: A setback for Democrats in their bid to stop President Trump from building a border wall. A federal judge in Washington ruling the president can transfer funds from appropriated accounts to pay for construction. The judge also says the House lacks standing to even challenge the president and it concludes the court should get involved in the fight between the president and Congress. The ruling not expected to impact other lawsuits by House Democrats and various states to block construction.</p><p>ROMANS: House is launching a top-to-bottom antitrust probe with Google, Amazon, Facebook, some of those targets.</p><p>Rhode Island Congressman David Cicilline leading the investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): This is a broad investigation of the whole marketplace. So, it involved a whole range of companies. But it's really to look at competition in the digital marketplace, to look at anti-competitive behavior and determine whether our existing antitrust statutes are working, whether they need to be modernized and updated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: It's been scandal after scandal for tech, right? Critics have called for tough regulations. They demanded the companies be broken up.</p><p>The investigation comes as the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission recently agreed to divide oversight of the tech industry.</p><p>Congressman Cicilline says this is the first time Congress has launched a significant antitrust investigation in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CICILLINE: And, frankly, you know, I don't have a lot of confidence that this administration has been particularly aggressive in their antitrust enforcement. In fact, they very often have co out on the side of monopolists and big mergers. So, I think, again, they have a responsibility in particular, enforcement actions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Officials have notified Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook of the coming investigation. Amazon and Google declined to comment to us. Apple and Facebook did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p><p>BRIGGS: The House passing a $19.1 million disaster aid package sending it to the president for his signature. The Senate passed the bill last week. President Trump has said he supports it. The legislation will speed relief funds to communities hard hit by tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and other disaster. The bill also includes money for Puerto Rico which is still rebuilding after Hurricane Maria.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. The long reign of \"Jeopardy\" champ James Holzhauer is over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREBEK: So, Emma, it's up to you. If you came up with the correct response, you're going to be the new \"Jeopardy\" champion. Did you? You did. What did you wager? Oh, gosh, $20,000. What a payday? $46,801. What a game? Oh my god.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Well done, Emma Boettcher, a librarian from Chicago dethroned the champ. Holzhauer's remarkable run ended after 32 straight wins, he was less than $60,000 away from Ken Jennings all time record.</p><p>Don't shed a tear for this guy. The professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, he won a total of $2.46 million during his \"Jeopardy\" reign.</p><p>BRIGGS: He'll be all right.</p><p>ROMANS: You told a \"Jeopardy\" fact I did not know, that Emma Boettcher wrote a paper --</p><p>BRIGGS: A masters paper at North Korea.</p><p>ROMANS: A piece, a dissertation on \"Jeopardy!\".</p><p>BRIGGS: She has been studying it a while. She was first an undergrad and masters at North Carolina.</p><p>Ahead, people around the world are publicly marking 30 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, but not in China.</p><p>[05:10:04] We're live in Beijing, next.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Thirty years ago today, the world witnessed a massacre in Tiananmen Square, hundreds of people killed in Beijing as the People's Liberation Army cracked down on pro-democracy protesters.</p><p>[05:15:04] That iconic image, tank man.</p><p>Events will be held, speeches will be made around the world today but you won't hear about it in China. Any coverage or discussion of this event will be tightly censored there.</p><p>Let's go live to Beijing and bring in CNN's Matt Rivers.</p><p>And, you know, those pictures, that moment really galvanized the United States about, you know, the fact that China, which has grown into a huge trading partner of the United States has fundamental beliefs and standards that are very at odds with the United States, even today. You know, you cannot talk about this event. You cannot Google this event. You cannot, you know, talk about democracy on a search engine. I mean, those basic Democratic rights don't exist.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, I mean, frankly they just don't. To illustrate that point, Christine, we were out on the streets of Beijing all morning, 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., and it was an ordinary Tuesday. There was no memorials, no remembrance events for the hundreds if not thousands to have people that were killed. Nobody is talking about it.</p><p>Chinese state media is not allowed to print anything about it. If you go on the internet all mentions about the massacre will be censored. The Chinese population here is basically not allowed to talk about this events and that is specifically because of a policy in place by China's government. They do not want to talk about this, because talking about an atrocity committed by the government here, well, that's not in the government's own interest. So, they're not going to do it.</p><p>And the result is that you have a population here who fundamentally doesn't have all the information they could have about a seminal event in the history. It's not just state media. Earlier today, we were doing live shots on the street, in an area where a lot of the killings happened on June 4, 30 years ago, and we were blocked by the police.</p><p>First, it was the police uniformed and told us we were violating a nonexistent traffic violation, which was obviously a lie, and then it was police who were not in uniform who came over and literally physically shoved us out of the way. We stopped broadcasting because we didn't want to escalate the situation.</p><p>All of that goes to show you, China's government does not want to talk about this, and they're going to do everything they can not only for Western journalists but also for state media the and domestic population to erase this incident from the history books.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, so interesting, the State Department, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued, what I think is a remarkable statement about this anniversary and talked about the Tiananmen mothers who have never stopped seeking accountability, despite great personal risk, the mothers, the parents who lost children, lost their kids, he says over the decades that followed Tiananmen, the U.S. hoped that China's integration into the international system would lead to a more open tolerant society. Those hopes have been dashed. I think that's a remarkable statement from the U.S. secretary of state.</p><p>RIVERS: Yes, absolutely. And he goes on to say that there is no dissent, no room for dissent in a one party system. And that's exactly the case right now.</p><p>China responded, calling the U.S. arrogant, saying the human rights situation has never been better here but that is absolutely not true. I have been here for four years now. We have reported on all kinds of human rights abuses, wide range of human rights abuses.</p><p>So, what the secretary of state is saying there, Christine, is absolutely right. China's government, though, you better believe they're not going to admit that.</p><p>ROMANS: Of course, in the middle of a trade war. So, it's multiple levels.</p><p>All right. Matt Rivers, thank you so much for that.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. We'll talk little sports ahead. The Stanley Cup final now, a three-game series after the St. Louis Blues rebound to take game four against the Bruins. Andy Scholes has that story in the \"Bleacher Report\".</p><p>[05:23:34] BRIGGS: Let's talk some hockey. Blues bouncing back in game four against the Boston Bruins to even the Stanley Cup Final at two games apiece.</p><p>Andy Scholes has more in this morning's \"Bleacher Report\".</p><p>Hey, buddy.</p><p>ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Dave.</p><p>You know, the fans in St. Louis have been waiting forever to celebrate a Stanley Cup final win on home ice. They mean that literally. They had never won a game at home in their history. They got blown out game three.</p><p>But that didn't discourage all the fans. Actor Jon Hamm, a St. Louis native, rocking a big beard on hand cheering on the Blues, the team wasting no time giving the fans something to go nuts about. Ryan O'Reilly scoring 43 seconds into the game. This was tied in the third period when O'Reilly again comes through, knocking this out of the air for another goal.</p><p>That was your winner. Blues take it to even the series two games apiece. The fans finally getting to celebrate a home win in the Stanley Cup Final.</p><p>And yes, that is a fan dancing to the song \"Gloria\" holding a chinchilla. How you get a chinchilla into the arena, I don't know, but if you were wondering, that chinchilla's name is Boris.</p><p>NBA finals continues on Wednesday. In the meantime, Raptors star Kawhi Leonard has filed a lawsuit against Nike over the use of his logo. This is Kawhi's claw logo that he said he created back in 2011. [05:25:05] And Kawhi, you know, has massive hands on the logo, the big hands made with his initial K and L. The lawsuit claims that Nike filed an application for copyright registration on Kawhi's logo and falsely represented in the application that Nike had authored the logo.</p><p>Kawhi was a member of Nike's Jordan brand but left them and he's been with New Balance since the start of the season.</p><p>A Nike spokesperson told CNN Sports: We do not comment on pending litigation.</p><p>All right. Will the dreaded four NFL preseason finally will be shortened? Well, Commissioner Roger Goodell says he feels it's time for a change.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GODDELL, NFL COMMISSIONER: I think things have evolved over the years. I'm not sure, you know, talking to coaches at four preseason games is necessary anymore to get ready for a season to evaluate players, to develop players. There are other ways of doing that. And we have had a lot of discussions about that, and I feel like what we should be is always of the highest quality, and I'm not sure preseason games meet that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHOLES: Yes, the change would have to be collectively bargained. Players have been against an 18 game regular season, citing safety concerns.</p><p>All right. Finally, what would you do if your prom date broke up with you right before the dance. Invite Juju Smith-Schuster, of course. Anthony Molinaro ended up no date for prom, so he direct messaged the Steelers wide receiver and as you can see, he accepted. They wore matching turquoise velvet tuxedos.</p><p>Dave, the prop picks are pretty great, although Anthony and Juju, they opted out of that typical prom pose together, and kind of just stood side by side instead.</p><p>BRIGGS: Who picked the suits? He further ingratiates to that loyal fan base there. I want more chinchilla if we can later in the series, Scholes. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>SCHOLES: All right.</p><p>BRIGGS: Romans?</p><p>ROMANS: His name is Boris, if you were wondering.</p><p>BRIGGS: Why was there a chinchilla there?</p><p>ROMANS: Well-delivered, well-delivered.</p><p>All right. Thank you.</p><p>President Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May get down to business today. More on the meeting happening right now and the rest of Trump's state visit. That's all next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019060403CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8F-V511-JB20-G2WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>BOSTON BRUINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ST LOUIS BLUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The past few weeks have been way too noisy across the technology space with demands coming from politicians, activists and users for splitting up giant technology companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google (known as Big Tech) into smaller, manageable units so that they can be easily regulated and their powers put to good use rather than for purposes that could throttle competition, fairness and ethics in the market.Ah, that sounds meaningful.In fact, the cry for breaking up Big Tech got suitably louder just a fortnight ago when, on March 8, US senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, who is a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, triggered a debate in the US \u2014 home to Big Tech \u2014 and across the globe when she called for breaking up Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook and Google. </p><p>The fact that nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon and over 70 per cent of all Internet traffic through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook, is a problem we must address sooner or later.That's a worry!Indeed. Warren's call reverberated across activist forums, corporate boardrooms and policy-making circles, where several influential figures endorsed the demand saying that Big Tech can cause serious damage to the global economy given the way it is controlling markets and cornering businesses. They point to the example of the investment banks of the US and elsewhere that grew too big to fail before collapsing in 2008-09, causing irreparable damage to the economies across the world.That's a clear and present danger, come to think of it!Considering the way the new, tech-powered economy is growing and how the tech giants amass revenues while controlling access to data, it is important to ensure the tech companies respect individual privacy and fairness in business and build a level-playing field where even nimble players can come up and compete with them (much like these companies that entered the business-scape and built a fortune by overriding the old-guard).But is breaking them up a good idea?The jury is still out. People like Senator Warren think Big Tech has already grown beyond measures and we already have the signs here. Facebook's Cambridge Analytica mass-profiling scandal \u2014 which was unearthed in 2018, prompting several countries including those in the European Union to come up stronger laws (such as the GDPR) to protect individual data \u2014 is an example.Again, if you look at how Google is controlling the search space and thriving on gobbling consumer data, allegedly under the pretext of offering 'free' search and mail services to consumers, is also worrying, say activists, because there are hardly any signs that Big Tech is interested in offering a solution to such monopolistic behaviour. On the contrary, there are signs that they are continuing with their expansion of what writer Shoshana Zuboff calls 'Surveillance Capitalism'. Still, many think a Big Tech break-up can hurt innovation and growth.How?Just last week, the EU's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Recode that splitting tech giants should be the last option because breaking up 'private property', if done without proper and convincing reasons, can hurt innovation. But Warren cites the example of how Microsoft was split into small businesses, diluting its absolute monopoly over services. But some experts say that's not a great model as Microsoft still commands monopoly in key segments. So, it looks like the fix is to bring in more regulations to guard privacy and data, raise more civil society voice for transparency in Big Tech, discourage big mergers and buyouts, and build collective awareness on use and abuse of data by tech companies.

At one event was Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who promised legislation that could break up Facebook or Alphabet's Google.</p><p>At another was Senator Amy Klobuchar (Democrat, Minnesota), who declared that she wanted to make antitrust \"cool again\" - a clear swipe at the same companies.</p><p>Then there was the European bureaucrat who has won global notoriety and who probably more so than almost anyone else make US technology executives quake in fear and anger: Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>The EU's competition commissioner can't run for the White House, though Warren and Klobuchar might envy her accomplishments. They're only threatening to curb the internet titans; Vestager has already led an antitrust crackdown.</p><p>But the Dane, whose five-year term is up this year, clearly indicated she wanted to stay on the world stage. Usually a cautious speaker who keeps her own counsel, she was at an SXSW event on Monday in a red satin dress and pale blue sneakers winning audiences with pointed humour.</p><p>She said she eschews the kind of pants-suits Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel wear.</p><p>\"Men realise you're a woman even if you dress like a man with a suit-like jacket and a white blouse,\" she said. \"So why bother? Better stay true to the value of diversity.\" (Cheers from the crowd.)</p><p>The EU's antitrust chief isn't pledging to string up Google and Amazon.com except as \"a very last resort.\" But at another SXSW event she admitted she was \"kind of running for office\".</p><p>She is about to gamble on a bid for a top EU post, building on the high-profile investigations that have made her a star of European politics.</p><p>She is seen as \"a warrior queen taking on the big tech might of the US\" says Dennis Abbott, a consultant at Burson Cohn Wolfe in Brussels. She topped a BCW popularity poll of 28 EU commissioners.</p><p>Vestager needs to leverage her fame to the next big step in her political career. Next Thursday, she is set to be named as one of several candidates on the slate for the centre-left Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) coalition, the third-biggest group in the European Parliament, which hopes to make big gains in EU-wide elections in May when it's expected to merge with French President Emmanuel Macron's faction.</p><p>\"ALDE is going to do well - the only centrist, pro-European group which is going to increase its size after these elections,\" says Doru Peter Frantescu, chief executive officer of VoteWatch Europe, a Brussels-based think tank.</p><p>Macron, who's trying to counter populists and eurosceptics in the election, hopes allies such as Vestager can help spur support for the European project.</p><p>\"Europe is an amazing place. We've made it so far since World War II, when Europe was destroyed physically and spiritually,\" Vestager told an SXSW audience. \"Europe is the best place to live ever in the history of the world, especially if you're a woman,\" she said. \"If we lack something, it's confidence.\"</p><p>Vestager has confidence in spades - and many believe she may have her eye on the EU's most powerful post: president of the European Commission, a position held by Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg.</p><p>Nabbing that will be difficult, says Frantescu, because the bigger parties usually rotate the top jobs among themselves. A good showing for ALDE and big losses for the centre-right might change that dynamic and at least give Vestager a chance to haggle for another top post.</p><p>\"There's a strong tradition for a man, 60ish,\" she said, downplaying her chances. \"It would be a glitch in history if a woman from a rather small European country could end up as president of the European Commission.</p><p>Being female is an advantage in a field of mostly middle-aged male candidates, says Nicholas Whyte, a Brussels-based senior director at consulting firm Apco Worldwide.</p><p>\"Gender balance becomes important when handing out the top jobs,\" he says. That plus Vestager's history of challenging corporate tax arrangements and squeezing huge fines out of wealthy US companies make her a viable candidate.</p><p>Most European governments cheered her probes into multinationals' tax deals with smaller low-tax EU countries such as Ireland. Apple was ordered by the EU to pay Irish back taxes of more than 13billion (R212bn). Google was fined 6.7bn for its handling of ads and phone apps.</p><p>Vestager isn't universally loved in the EU. French and German ministers - with notable silence from Macron - howled last month when she blocked their prized plans to merge Siemens and Alstom's rail operations to create a \"European champion\" to battle a Chinese trainmaker. Vestager said she was just doing her job: preventing the creation of huge companies that could dominate the European market and gain the power to increase prices at will.</p><p>If all else fails, could she continue as the commission's antitrust chief?</p><p>\"Her chance of appointment in the next commission depends entirely on the whim of the Danish government,\" says Whyte.</p><p>Copenhagen would have to nominate her as their representative and Vestager isn't a member of the ruling party - she served as deputy prime minister in a previous government.</p><p>Again, she will have to count on her popularity. A majority of Danes want her to stay on as commissioner, according to a recent Danish poll for the Altinget newspaper.</p><p>\"It would be extraordinary if I could\" stay, she said in Austin. \"In my experience, you never get something if you don't ask for it. So I have said I would be more than happy to have another mandate as competition commissioner.\"</p><p>At SXSW, she was preaching to the converted. \"Can we get a show of hands if you believe these tech giants have become too powerful and need regulation?\" CNN editor-in-chief Meredith Artley asked an audience waiting to hear Vestager speak in a packed hotel ballroom.</p><p>Almost every hand went up.</p><p>Now, she has to get the EU's voters to be true believers, too. | Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPARG-109073959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPARG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-H9S1-JCV0-11H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312414</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Argus Weekend (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 17, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Weyland Tech Inc (OTCQX:WEYL[1]) is eyeing many opportunities and has already outperformed its 2018 revenue numbers, company CEO, Brent Suen stated in a recent interview with Investorideas.com. Listen to the podcast       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3\">https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3</url>[2]Investorideas.com talks to CEO of Weyland Tech, Inc (OTCQX: $WEYL) about Fintech in Indonesia\"For 2018 we had top line revenues of $22.6 million,\" he said. </p><p>\"This year, in the first nine months of operations ... based on our preliminary announcement ... we're already exceeding last year's entire full-year numbers in the first nine months of this year. That is due to distribution partners, or what we call white label partnerships, who are seeing considerably higher growth from the additional functionality that we added in over this past nine months.\" Weyland, a developer and global provider of mobile business software applications, operates its CreateApp platform-as-a-service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Suen indicated that a top priority of the company is an uplisting, which would enhance the company's profile and opportunities. \"The biggest one is the uplisting to Nasdaq, and that's key to expanding a much higher level of visibility which in turn would enable, or certainly imply, a higher market cap,\" he said. \"And subsequently the ability to fund a more exponential expansion plan.\" \"We believe that, upon gaining shareholder approval for management's discretion on a reverse split, we will be able to exercise a modest reverse split and immediately qualify for Nasdaq,\" he continued. \"We expect that to happen before the end of the year. And we're also, alongside that, evaluating merger and acquisition opportunities that would not only increase our scale, but would also increase the pipeline for products and services and also geographic expansion.\" Weyland typically enters markets with its CreateApp platform-as-a-service (PaaS) application, which allows micro and small businesses to design apps themselves, and market and promote their goods and services to their end customers much more affordably than having a third party designer. \"Our app, CreateApp, enables the business owner to do a number of things, but the four primary ones are: a) to market and promote their goods and services, b) to enable them to sell online through the phone, c) to pay for them through the phone, and then d) have them delivered through logistics delivery or courier if it's nearby. What's interesting about ours is that it can be created by our customer within one to two hours at a maximum, and that's with zero technical skills,\" he said. \"It's extremely important because most micro to small business owners ... typically wouldn't have the time, expertise or resources available to build their own app. So what we provide is a very simple and streamlined toolkit to do so. Further, [for] the app itself, what we price to our clients at an average of $20 to $25 per month. And that compared to having a native app custom built by a professional services firm is actually quite inexpensive.\" The company is taking a different approach to the Indonesian market, where roughly 70 percent of the population is unbanked, according to Suen, and therefore rely on alternatives such as e-wallets. Because of this, Weyland has entered the Indonesian market via its subsidiary, Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), and its ewallet Atozpay. \"When you don't have bank accounts or credit cards ... trying to sell things through the phone - e-commerce and m-commerce - is extraordinarily difficult to do in that type of environment,\" he said. \"So what has ended up happening is that the prevalence of mobile payments or e-wallets, of which Atozpay is, has gained tremendous traction in Indonesia.\" On the subject of Indonesia, with it being the fourth-most populous country in the world and boasting a growing confluence of big tech players and equity funds, Suen posits that it holds tremendous potential for investors. \"What I've found in the past two years of being back [in the U.S.], when I talk to potential investors ... about Indonesia, most of the response, very naturally is, 'that's an entire world away',\" he said. \"There are currently over 15 tech companies based in Indonesia that have what are called unicorn valuations,\" he said. \"So, anything valued at a billion dollars or more would imply that it's a Unicorn valuation. Several are actually higher than ten billion and this is notable because every major global tech giant has investments in these 15.\" \"Not only are the big strategic tech companies making investments in these 15, we are also seeing the world's leading private equity funds investing as well,\" he added. \"What you have is a landscape that's a who's who of global tech companies, a who's who of private equity funds and venture capital funds, and what we're going to see very soon is an impending wave of IPOs here in the US.\" Suen said that the company's activities in Indonesia, coupled with its other developments, position it favorably for strategic investments or possibly acquisition. \"It puts us on the path for potential strategic investment in or an acquisition of, our Indonesian subsidiary by one of these larger companies,\" he said. \"What we believe will happen, is someone like Grab[3] - which is currently a $16 billion valued company operating in Southeast Asia in its entirety - we believe that they will be a strategic investor in Weyland Indonesia Perkasa, or potentially acquire us.\" The Investorideas.com podcasts are also available on iTunes, Spotify, Tunein, Stitcher, Spreaker.com, iHeartRadio and Google Play Music.

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].Breaking Misconceptions: The Trials and Tribulations of a US Crypto Trading Venue By Merav Shor, Counsel, Regulatory Affairs, eToro USA   Q1 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] If you ask the everyday, non-crypto[3] savvy U.S. consumer who follows financial news whether cryptocurrency business activity is regulated, the response would likely be 'No'. The modern misconception to the average user is that these assets are unregistered securities. The SEC's focus on high-profile crypto companies, such as Telegram and Ripple, has garnered the most attention from users and media outlets. The SEC's continuous rejection of bitcoin[4] ETF proposals is also often discussed. </p><p>And perhaps to a lesser extent, the FinCEN's enforcement actions against operators of cryptocurrency exchanges (sometimes individuals) who have failed to register as a money services business and comply with the resulting anti-money laundering obligations. An often-overlooked area of regulation, however, is the state-by-state regulatory framework surrounding the activity of U.S. crypto-trading venues\u2014a key player in the introduction of digital assets to everyday American consumers.Regulatory Process That Crypto Trading Venues Must OvercomeA closer look at the applicable U.S. regulatory regime reveals the arduous process that crypto trading venues must overcome before they may open their gates to U.S. consumers. Considering the 'bearish' crypto sentiment held by regulators who interpret the regulatory framework can provide great insight on the stumbling blocks to U.S. crypto innovation. The framework discussed below does not pertain to firms engaged in the trading of digital assets that are classified as securities under U.S. federal securities law. This article does not presume to encompass the entire body of law and regulatory requirements that cryptocurrency trading platforms are subject to, but it provides a general overview of US regulations in the crypto-space.I. Unregulated? Not Quite. Introduction to the U.S. Infinite Licensing MazeObtaining and maintaining a federal money services business (MSB) license is not a straightforward first step. At the federal level, a MSB is subject to the requirements of the antimoney laundering, counter financing of terror and criminal activity provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. It also must comply with the OFAC's sanctions requirements. Establishing the required compliance policies, procedures, and controls, and operationalizing them is by no means a trivial endeavor. A particularly challenging compliance task for crypto MSBs is the requirement under the Funds Travel Rule. This is due to the fact that blockchain protocols were not designed to facilitate the transmission of the information contemplated by the rule. In fact, the Funds Travel Rule is the violation most commonly cited in examinations of MSB crypto exchanges according to FinCEN's Director Blanco. Since FinCEN takes the position that transmission of virtual currency falls under the definition of 'money transmission', crypto MSBs are required to include certain information with a 'transmittal order' of at least $3,000 USD denominated in virtual currency. Such information includes the amount, the name and address of the sender, the execution date of the transmittal order, the identity of the recipient's financial institution, and other pieces of data. An indirect consequence of federal regulation is the high compliance threshold imposed on crypto businesses by their banking partners. Forming U.S. banking relationships as a crypto firm is extremely difficult. Crypto businesses can expect more stringent oversight from their U.S. banking partners. This is true even more so now than a couple of years ago, given the recent OCC sanction against a NY based private bank serving cryptocurrency corporate clients. A retail facing crypto company is subject to a whole suite of additional federal consumer protection laws. To name a few, the GLBA mandates the safeguarding of consumers' personal financial information, and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and FTC Act prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with a consumer transaction or the offering of a financial product or service. Following the federal MSB registration is the daunting process of deciphering the state-by-state money transmission licensing regime. A vast majority of states have a money transmission licensing regime that may or may not apply to a specific firm's business model. A state-by-state legal analysis is warranted before moving forward. Sometimes firms will reach out to state financial regulators asking 'do I need a license based on my business model?' But many times state regulators will not provide a clear answer. Early stage crypto firms will then have to decide for themselves whether or not they need to apply for a license in a particular state or rely on legal counsel's advice. Continuous monitoring of changes in legislation, as well as changes in the business model that may affect the analysis is also necessary. Licensure requirements are oftentimes quite burdensome, and include, for instance, the posting of surety bonds in each state. A tougher financial standard is often applied by underwriters to crypto clients as well as higher bond requirements imposed by certain states. Despite the wellintended measure of establishing the National Multistate Licensing System ('NMLS'), a onestop shop for electronic state license application submissions, the process is far from streamlined. Many states have unique requirements, for example their own specific fingerprint cards for control persons, and a few still require a paper application submitted outside of NMLS with an old-fashioned handwritten check sent via mail. Adding a layer of complexity to the convoluted state licensing regime are state initiatives creating a specific license for cryptocurrency business activity. This is not unique to trading platforms and may apply to various types of crypto related businesses. The most well-known for its stringent requirements and long processing times is the highly sought-after NY State Bitlicense. This license does not replace the money transmitter license in NY State, and in many cases a crypto applicant will be required to apply for both the Bitlicense and the Money Transmitter license or other type of license (such as a Trust license) in the state. NYDFS notably maintains the highest threshold in the country for approval of crypto related business activity. It may be advisable to apply with other states first to gain knowledge, improve the application materials, and be better positioned. Other states have introduced bills contemplating their own version of a Bitlicense with NJ being the latest to release such a bill that is mainly aimed at better informing consumers on the risks involved in trading cryptocurrencies.II. State Consumer Protection Laws and Other Regulations to ConsiderIn addition to state money transmission laws and related obligations, state consumer protection laws also apply to the activity of crypto trading firms. These include states' versions of the prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices, as well as state data privacy laws that are currently experiencing a surge across the country. State privacy laws mandate the provision of different rights to consumers in their respective states. California's CCPA introduces new rights such as the right of a consumer to request the deletion of their personal information, and the right to know which categories of his or her personal information are being collected, along with the business purposes for which the information was shared. Crypto retail companies must also consider state escheatment laws, tax reporting obligations, and more. Going back to the beginning of this article, one must not forget to consider the implication of U.S. federal and state securities laws. Prior to offering opportunities to transact in a digital asset, the crypto company must ask whether a particular asset may be classified as a security and consider the risks involved. A separate article could be written on this matter and how such an analysis should look like. Briefly, it is fair to say that despite some guidance released from the SEC, clarity has yet to be provided. Specifically, it would be beneficial to know what the SEC means by 'sufficient decentralization' that would potentially extricate a token from the definition of a security. An additional point to consider is the CFTC jurisdiction over market manipulation and fraud in crypto spot trading transactions. Crypto trading firms must implement controls that address such risks. In addition, they must be mindful of the Commodities Exchange Act's 'actual delivery' requirement of the cryptocurrency-commodity. If there is no actual delivery of the cryptocurrency within 28 days the transaction may be classified as a retail commodity transaction which must be traded on a licensed domestic futures exchange or a foreign board of trade.III. The Consequences of Regulatory Barriers to EntryThe need to navigate a labyrinth of constant-changing laws, regulations and licensing obligations, creates high barriers to market entry for new players. Market share is being concentrated in the hands of early mover crypto-incumbents like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken, whereas younger innovators are slowed down. This reality stifles competition and innovation, and deprives consumers of a wider selection of crypto financial products that they would have otherwise had. A nearly unanimous sentiment expressed in the Facebook Congressional hearings around Libra is that the mistrusted tech giant is not the best suited to lead crypto innovation to mass adoption. As a side note, the original Libra contemplated by Facebook has very few and far between characteristics in common with what is widely known as a 'cryptocurrency' such as Bitcoin. However, it seems that the Libra project has the potential to directly or indirectly promote mainstream adoption of the more decentralized cryptocurrencies as well. If Congress is so clearly opposed to the idea that big tech will lead crypto innovation, then it should consider taking action towards reducing market entry costs. Trust will drive greater adoption and continued innovation in the crypto space. Awareness and appreciation of the rigorous process that U.S. crypto firms face will help facilitate the building of these bonds. Perhaps then we'll see less state initiatives for additional crypto licensing regimes, and an easing of the stringent standard applied by some regulators. The latter is of special importance for driving crypto innovation and adoption in the U.S.Disclaimer: This article should not be construed as legal advice.

Q1 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[1] If you ask the everyday, non-crypto[2] savvy U.S. consumer who follows financial news whether cryptocurrency business activity is regulated, the response would likely be 'No'. The modern misconception to the average user is that these assets are unregistered securities. The SEC's focus on high-profile crypto companies, such as Telegram and Ripple, has garnered the most attention from users and media outlets. </p><p>The SEC's continuous rejection of bitcoin[3] ETF proposals is also often discussed. And perhaps to a lesser extent, the FinCEN's enforcement actions against operators of cryptocurrency exchanges (sometimes individuals) who have failed to register as a money services business and comply with the resulting anti-money laundering obligations. An often-overlooked area of regulation, however, is the state-by-state regulatory framework surrounding the activity of U.S. crypto-trading venues\u2014a key player in the introduction of digital assets to everyday American consumers.Regulatory Process That Crypto Trading Venues Must OvercomeA closer look at the applicable U.S. regulatory regime reveals the arduous process that crypto trading venues must overcome before they may open their gates to U.S. consumers. Considering the 'bearish' crypto sentiment held by regulators who interpret the regulatory framework can provide great insight on the stumbling blocks to U.S. crypto innovation. The framework discussed below does not pertain to firms engaged in the trading of digital assets that are classified as securities under U.S. federal securities law. This article does not presume to encompass the entire body of law and regulatory requirements that cryptocurrency trading platforms are subject to, but it provides a general overview of US regulations in the crypto-space.I. Unregulated? Not Quite. Introduction to the U.S. Infinite Licensing MazeObtaining and maintaining a federal money services business (MSB) license is not a straightforward first step. At the federal level, a MSB is subject to the requirements of the antimoney laundering, counter financing of terror and criminal activity provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. It also must comply with the OFAC's sanctions requirements. Establishing the required compliance policies, procedures, and controls, and operationalizing them is by no means a trivial endeavor. A particularly challenging compliance task for crypto MSBs is the requirement under the Funds Travel Rule. This is due to the fact that blockchain protocols were not designed to facilitate the transmission of the information contemplated by the rule. In fact, the Funds Travel Rule is the violation most commonly cited in examinations of MSB crypto exchanges according to FinCEN's Director Blanco. Since FinCEN takes the position that transmission of virtual currency falls under the definition of 'money transmission', crypto MSBs are required to include certain information with a 'transmittal order' of at least $3,000 USD denominated in virtual currency. Such information includes the amount, the name and address of the sender, the execution date of the transmittal order, the identity of the recipient's financial institution, and other pieces of data. An indirect consequence of federal regulation is the high compliance threshold imposed on crypto businesses by their banking partners. Forming U.S. banking relationships as a crypto firm is extremely difficult. Crypto businesses can expect more stringent oversight from their U.S. banking partners. This is true even more so now than a couple of years ago, given the recent OCC sanction against a NY based private bank serving cryptocurrency corporate clients. A retail facing crypto company is subject to a whole suite of additional federal consumer protection laws. To name a few, the GLBA mandates the safeguarding of consumers' personal financial information, and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and FTC Act prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with a consumer transaction or the offering of a financial product or service. Following the federal MSB registration is the daunting process of deciphering the state-by-state money transmission licensing regime. A vast majority of states have a money transmission licensing regime that may or may not apply to a specific firm's business model. A state-by-state legal analysis is warranted before moving forward. Sometimes firms will reach out to state financial regulators asking 'do I need a license based on my business model?' But many times state regulators will not provide a clear answer. Early stage crypto firms will then have to decide for themselves whether or not they need to apply for a license in a particular state or rely on legal counsel's advice. Continuous monitoring of changes in legislation, as well as changes in the business model that may affect the analysis is also necessary. Licensure requirements are oftentimes quite burdensome, and include, for instance, the posting of surety bonds in each state. A tougher financial standard is often applied by underwriters to crypto clients as well as higher bond requirements imposed by certain states. Despite the wellintended measure of establishing the National Multistate Licensing System ('NMLS'), a onestop shop for electronic state license application submissions, the process is far from streamlined. Many states have unique requirements, for example their own specific fingerprint cards for control persons, and a few still require a paper application submitted outside of NMLS with an old-fashioned handwritten check sent via mail. Adding a layer of complexity to the convoluted state licensing regime are state initiatives creating a specific license for cryptocurrency business activity. This is not unique to trading platforms and may apply to various types of crypto related businesses. The most well-known for its stringent requirements and long processing times is the highly sought-after NY State Bitlicense. This license does not replace the money transmitter license in NY State, and in many cases a crypto applicant will be required to apply for both the Bitlicense and the Money Transmitter license or other type of license (such as a Trust license) in the state. NYDFS notably maintains the highest threshold in the country for approval of crypto related business activity. It may be advisable to apply with other states first to gain knowledge, improve the application materials, and be better positioned. Other states have introduced bills contemplating their own version of a Bitlicense with NJ being the latest to release such a bill that is mainly aimed at better informing consumers on the risks involved in trading cryptocurrencies.II. State Consumer Protection Laws and Other Regulations to ConsiderIn addition to state money transmission laws and related obligations, state consumer protection laws also apply to the activity of crypto trading firms. These include states' versions of the prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices, as well as state data privacy laws that are currently experiencing a surge across the country. State privacy laws mandate the provision of different rights to consumers in their respective states. California's CCPA introduces new rights such as the right of a consumer to request the deletion of their personal information, and the right to know which categories of his or her personal information are being collected, along with the business purposes for which the information was shared. Crypto retail companies must also consider state escheatment laws, tax reporting obligations, and more. Going back to the beginning of this article, one must not forget to consider the implication of U.S. federal and state securities laws. Prior to offering opportunities to transact in a digital asset, the crypto company must ask whether a particular asset may be classified as a security and consider the risks involved. A separate article could be written on this matter and how such an analysis should look like. Briefly, it is fair to say that despite some guidance released from the SEC, clarity has yet to be provided. Specifically, it would be beneficial to know what the SEC means by 'sufficient decentralization' that would potentially extricate a token from the definition of a security. An additional point to consider is the CFTC jurisdiction over market manipulation and fraud in crypto spot trading transactions. Crypto trading firms must implement controls that address such risks. In addition, they must be mindful of the Commodities Exchange Act's 'actual delivery' requirement of the cryptocurrency-commodity. If there is no actual delivery of the cryptocurrency within 28 days the transaction may be classified as a retail commodity transaction which must be traded on a licensed domestic futures exchange or a foreign board of trade.III. The Consequences of Regulatory Barriers to EntryThe need to navigate a labyrinth of constant-changing laws, regulations and licensing obligations, creates high barriers to market entry for new players. Market share is being concentrated in the hands of early mover crypto-incumbents like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken, whereas younger innovators are slowed down. This reality stifles competition and innovation, and deprives consumers of a wider selection of crypto financial products that they would have otherwise had. A nearly unanimous sentiment expressed in the Facebook Congressional hearings around Libra is that the mistrusted tech giant is not the best suited to lead crypto innovation to mass adoption. As a side note, the original Libra contemplated by Facebook has very few and far between characteristics in common with what is widely known as a 'cryptocurrency' such as Bitcoin. However, it seems that the Libra project has the potential to directly or indirectly promote mainstream adoption of the more decentralized cryptocurrencies as well. If Congress is so clearly opposed to the idea that big tech will lead crypto innovation, then it should consider taking action towards reducing market entry costs. Trust will drive greater adoption and continued innovation in the crypto space. Awareness and appreciation of the rigorous process that U.S. crypto firms face will help facilitate the building of these bonds. Perhaps then we'll see less state initiatives for additional crypto licensing regimes, and an easing of the stringent standard applied by some regulators. The latter is of special importance for driving crypto innovation and adoption in the U.S.Disclaimer: This article should not be construed as legal advice.

It's understandable that Franklin Foer, former editor of the New Republic and now a national correspondent for the Atlantic, uses this quote in his book World Without Mind: The Existenial Threat ofBig Tech (Penguin, $27, 272 pp.). We are living through another such crisis, and both journalism and American democracy again lie in adjoining beds in the trauma ward.</p><p>Foer's own story has become the stuff of modern media tragedy. He rejoined the New Republic as editor when it was bought by Chris Hughes, the young, wealthy co-founder of Facebook. Foer initially saw Hughes as TNR's savior. Instead, Hughes presided over its effective demise. As Foer tells it, an early warning sign was the obsessive focus on Web traffic data. Another was the hiring as CEO of Guy Vidra, a former Yahoo executive who described TNR rhapsodically as a \"vertically integrated digital media company.\" Foer soon learned that his bosses were actively seeking his replacement. He quit, followed by most of the magazine's best writers and editors. Foer tells his story here, but those seeking a detailed memoir will be disappointed. World Without Mind draws on Foer's experience to tell a larger story about the ills of modern media-and, thus, of contemporary politics and public discourse.</p><p>A physician treating such patients will necessarily look for the cause of the disease. The patients themselves will hunt for someone to blame. Foer here is both physician and patient, and he looks for a culprit other than himself and his fellow elite journalists. He finds it in \"Big Tech\": companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, which run our new media landscape.</p><p>One should always review a book as it is, not the book the author might have written. But when that book gives short shrift to an important aspect of its subject, it's fair to say so. Foer isn't wrong to blame Big Tech for the state of modern journalism. But he neglects other culprits. They include journalists themselves, who have collaborated with Big Tech to degrade the profession-and called the result good. Another culprit is surely us, the readers. With or without the influence of Big Tech, we display our preference for chaff over wheat with every click.</p><p>Without indulging in the fiction of a golden age, Foer is nostalgic for better times in the profession. I was a journalist for a short while: a graduate of Columbia's journalism school and briefly an intern at Newsday and reporter at Roll Call. I share his nostalgia. I remember what it meant, as a journalism student newly arrived in New York, to experience the thrill of buying the Sunday New York Times on Saturday night. \"Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive,\" writes Wordsworth. But to get the Sunday paper the night before was very heaven.</p><p>Swollen with sections and bleeding fresh ink, the Sunday Times seemed to live up to the paper's motto: \"All the News That's Fit to Print.\" It felt authoritative. Even a selective reader couldn't help but encounter unexpected stories. That involuntary exposure to what felt like all the world's news was a big part of its value. It involved not a leap of faith, but an act of trust: trust in the reporters and editors who produced the paper. One trusted their expertise, their (relative) disinterestedness, their professionalism.</p><p>Today's Times experience is different. I'm aware of the dangers of nostalgia, but I still insist that today's Times is not just a shadow, but a deliberate rejection, of its older self. Its squad of editors may have been top-heavy and stifling, but they were essential to one's pact of trust with the paper. The Times recently announced it would get rid of many of its copy editors, describing it in PR-speak as an effort to \"significantly shift the balance of editors to reporters at the Times.\" When I think of all the times my own reporting was rescued from error, bias, and short-sightedness by some newsroom Gorgon, I shudder to see this mass defenestration of editors described in positive terms.</p><p>Equally worrisome was the simultaneous decision to eliminate the public editor, or ombudsperson. That position was filled by someone experienced in journalism and authorized to call the Times to account each week. The real tragedy of that position's elimination has to do with what the Times has said will replace it: the mob. As a memo cheerfully put it: \"Our followers on social media and our readers across the internet have come together to collectively serve as a modern watchdog.\" The Times's strength comes from its professionalism and expertise. Its editorial page regularly laments the effects of online shouters on civil discourse and respect for truth. Yet it handed over one of its more important methods of self-scrutiny to cranks and amateurs-to the paper's most credulous fans and most reflexive haters.</p><p>These changes are part of a broader suite of alterations, all of them ultimately related to Foer's broader thesis. The Times's desperation shows in its feverish \"adaptation\" to the internet. The online Times has become the paper's primary outlet. That fact drives its voice and content in ways that have changed its mission and degraded the institution. Sober print headlines are replaced online by clickbait headlines and summaries, frequently opinionated and often misleading. In keeping with the online preference for commentary-which is cheap to produce and attracts \"eyeballs\"-over conventional reporting, it has added an army of opinion-mongers to what was formerly a small stable of columnists. Meanwhile, by encouraging reporters to maintain Twitter feeds, it has turned even its \"straight\" news staff into opinionated gossips.</p><p>In an effort to draw readers, the Times has shifted from a \"paper of record\" model to a crowd-sourced conversational model. It overflows with soft interviews, chats between Times writers, \"advice\" that exploits readers' fears (a classic recent headline: \"We Need to Talk Some More About Your Dirty Sponges\"), and pleas for readers to share their \"experiences.\" This is not a first rough draft of history. It's about de-emphasizing what an internal memo called \"dutiful\" pieces-that is, the news-and trying to get readers to \"engage\" more with the Times, as if it were your buddy, not a newspaper. The internet gives the Times unlimited space for all the news that's fit to transmit. Instead, it's drowning in opinion, lifestyle, and trivia-what Foer calls \"a deluge of ephemera dissecting the ephemeral.\" Its desperate need for clicks, shares, and eyeballs is exemplified by the fact that the Times's mobile app now allows you to \"share\" a story on social media from the headline itself, without having to go through the pretense of clicking through to the story. That's not adaptation; it's surrender.</p><p>For Foer, the real culprit here is the environment created by Big Tech. It disdains expertise and scoffs at antiquated \"gatekeepers\" while extolling the democratization of discussion. In the end, it doesn't give a damn about content; only profit and monopoly. But the danger is deeper than that. As new generations have grown up in this environment, and as resisters are offered buyouts or otherwise disposed of, contemporary journalists have internalized the new norms. Reporters have gone from putting up with these changes to praising them.</p><p>Praising the current state of affairs inevitably leads to the oedipal need to bury the older, professional model. Exhibit A is Foer's old magazine. For the new New Republic to rise, it had to kill its predecessor. Identity politics, an obsession for the new TNR, was the weapon of choice. The lead article of the first post-Foer issue of TNR was an extensive essay cataloguing and indicting all the old magazine's sins on issues of race. How misguided its former staff must have been! And, by implication, how righteous and worthy its new staff! Reading the new TNR, henceforth, would involve more than merely staying informed; it would be an act of virtue.</p><p>Of course, the story had plenty of examples to work with. That would be true for any hundred-year-old magazine. What the story didn't say is that a show of virtue can hide a multitude of sins. The new TNR is frankly awful. A magazine that once wrote about congressional appropriations now brims with stories on \"cultural appropriation.\" A magazine that loved \"contrarian\" pieces is now the voice of conformist prescription. That its writers are treated as public intellectuals shows how low that phrase has sunk. They are neither especially intellectual nor, to the extent that they exist to tell a bubble of like-minded readers what to think, especially public. It is truly a magazine for our times, alas.</p><p>One response to these laments can be summed up in a name: Trump. Foer's Big Tech culprits aside, the nature of contemporary journalism is often justified by arguing that desperate times demand desperate measures. A science article in Slate last winter argued that in a polarized, \"post-truth\" age, liberals must \"Give Up on Facts\" and fight error with emotion. We need less disinterestedness and less empathy for the millions of Americans on the \"other side,\" goes the argument, and more strategic efforts to sell people on the \"right\" beliefs. Reporters should be less \"neutral,\" more adversarial.</p><p>I have no particular problem with the prognosis. The diagnosis and prescription are another matter. In an age of polarization, insulation, and distrust, there is not just room but a need for professionalism, and for institutions that do not exploit the currents of passion. When the Washington Post started prominently displaying the new post-Trump motto \"Democracy Dies in Darkness,\" many cheered. They were wrong. When newspapers are defined by marketing slogans (a working group \"brainstormed more than 500 would-be slogans,\" reported the Post), readers should worry. Aggressive reporting is not synonymous with adversarialism or inconsistent with tough but disinterested professional journalism. Vastly expanding the ranks of columnists while thinning the herd of actual reporters is no cure for \"Darkness.\" And a paper whose self-righteous slogan is really a quest for eyeballs will inevitably look for readers in less high-minded ways. A recent search on the Post's website showed 89 results for \"avocado toast,\" 108 for \"Harambe,\" and over 3,000 for \"Kardashian.\" That's not light: it's journalism lite. Modern journalism is trying to survive, not \"resist.\"</p><p>If I have strayed somewhat from the framing of Foer's own argument, that's because it's not terribly novel or interesting. For Foer, the real problem lies in the media environment and the companies that have created it. The litany of complaints is familiar. They are destroying individual privacy. They collect user data to manipulate our preferences. They rhapsodize about freedom but provide a new, panoptic form of imprisonment. They treat the traditional media \"gatekeepers\" with contempt while acting as unacknowledged gatekeepers themselves. They obsess over quantitative data, not quality. They copy and link without creating, and thus damage the laws of intellectual property that encourage invention and creativity. Above all, they are too damn big. They constitute a monopoly over ideas that must be broken. (In an odd footnote, Foer declares that he is not using the term \"monopoly\" in any technical sense, but instead wants to \"revive 'monopoly' as a core piece of political rhetoric.\" A footnote like that should make readers wary of the entire book.)</p><p>We have read all this before, and we have read all the well-worn creation stories and anecdotes that fill the first half of the book. One could safely begin reading this book at page 93; Foer's argument for the importance of editors and other professional gatekeepers needed a tougher gatekeeper itself. Nor, for the most part, are Foer's proposed solutions novel. Aping the utopian talk of Big Tech's gurus, Foer proposes that we \"take back the mind.\" Reverse-mirroring their utopian belief in non-regulation, he urges government to create \"a whole new apparatus\" for regulating Big Tech, including a \"Data Protection Authority.\" Emulating the typical sweeping statements of Big Tech, he pronounces the stakes of such a struggle to be \"nothing less than the fate of individuality and the fitness of democracy.\"</p><p>I have no quarrel with Foer's complaints about Big Tech or his proposals to counter it. That they aren't novel doesn't make them wrong. (There is one novel element: Foer points to the rise of organic and \"artisanal\" food as a model for media reform. I doubt somehow that Alice Waters holds the keys to radical change in the tech industry.) The real problem is his surprising narrowness of vision.</p><p>Foer rightly argues that the old media \"gatekeepers\" held real value. They were imperfect, but their professionalism and ability to sort dross from substance was vital to civil society. Given his sweeping language about the death of individual autonomy and creativity and its effects across society, however, Foer's concerns turn out to be remarkably narrow and mundane. The people he wants to rescue from Big Tech are a small, relatively elite, not especially impressive group: \"Intellectuals, freelance writers, investigative journalists, and midlist novelists.\" He longs for the renaissance of \"the middlebrow culture of midcentury America.\"</p><p>We do indeed need more investigative journalists, and the turn of the major press toward commentators rather than \"dutiful\" reporters is tragic. It would be nice if we had more intellectuals, even the \"middlebrow\" sort, rather than what passes for them these days. But is this the key to \"the fate of individuality and the fitness of democracy\"? It's easy to deplore the state of social media today and their effect on social discourse, whatever democratizing potential they hold. But midlist authors and middlebrow publications? Some count the world well lost for love; but does it really need to be remade for the sake ofJennifer Weiner, Time magazine, or the latest Harvard Crimson alumnus on the make?</p><p>Foer's untiring focus on Big Tech as the culprit behind all our present ills is also a problem. Whether he's right or wrong, that approach gives us too small a share of the blame. The algorithms and other approaches that shape what we read and buy are important and less transparent than they should be. We may not be fully aware of the forces behind our own choices. But, as Foer acknowledges, they're still our choices. The people (myself included) who walk around all day staring at their devices or waste half their time at work on the internet may look like zombies, but we aren't. We still have other options, the best efforts of Big Tech notwithstanding.</p><p>That's true for the major news media too. Papers like the Times start changing out of the need to survive and adapt. They end up convincing themselves that these disturbing changes are a good thing: that a mass of self-selecting readercommentators is better than an independent, professionally experienced public editor; that getting attention is a good in itself; and that partisan engagement is more \"honest\" than professional disinterestedness. However dire their circumstances, they have made choices-the wrong choices, and worse still when they are reinforced by the inevitable rationalizations.</p><p>When I was at journalism school, my mentor encouraged us to set aside what he called a \"fuck you\" fund that would enable us to tell off editors or publishers who expected us to abandon our ethics or professionalism. Many journalists have done just that over the years. (Remember all the people who followed Foer out the door of \u0422\u041d\u041a.) I wonder how many, or few, contemporary reporters have said just that when told to maintain a Twitter feed and keep it \"exciting,\" \"engaging,\" or \"opinionated.\" Surely that's why some reporters and editors took buyouts. Some who remain have made a devil's bargain for their jobs. But others like being minor-league online celebrities, at whatever cost. I wonder how much better mainstream journalism would be if more reporters stayed on staff, but told the bosses and their gaggles of consultants that they have no intention of having a Twitter feed, or will only use it to link, without any \"engaging\" commentary, to their properly edited published pieces. They might not last long. But pushing back is a choice. More of them should make it.</p><p>More broadly, Foer argues that through our addiction to the endless ephemera that make up online content, we have forgotten the true value of reading. It gives us the blessings of \"contemplation, moments of isolation, where the mind can follow its own course to its own conclusions.\" He's right. In the grip of our online impulses, guided by the algorithms of Facebook and others, we are losing the value of serious reading: of thinking seriously about words and ideas rather than \"following\" or \"linking\" to them. We are indeed \"surrendering far more than we intend\" by drowning ourselves in ephemera. But the newspapers and middlebrow authors Foer extols are, for the most part, ephemera. Even the great old Sunday Times, luxuriated in on Saturday night and Sunday morning, was forgotten by Monday.</p><p>Foer's book talks big but dreams small. We need better journalism for the sake of the polity. But we need much more than that for our own sakes. The ultimate act of free will calls for more than just cutting back on Twitter or Facebook. It involves throwing away one's newspapers and magazines (Commonweal excepted, of course) and skipping the five-minute headlines on NPR. One can be informed without being informed up to the minute. There will still be important stories and we will still find and read them. But filling up one's limited time and brain capacity with momentarily \"urgent\" trivia is another matter. Filling them with midlist novelists isn't much better.</p><p>Foer's book is aimed at a fairly narrow readership. His real audience is the educated upper-middle class. The irony is that he urges them to think radically but demands so little from them. They-we-should do more than reject Big Tech's algorithms. We should also question the only slightly less algorithmic habits that are his idea of \"free will:\" the Times here, the old TNR there, a \"well-reviewed\" book thrown in for good measure. My own form of \"resistance\"-not just to Trump, but to our degraded culture of ephemera, of shouting matches between desperate and condescending elites and populists and trolls-is more radical than that. In the past year, I have turned away from the Times and toward Ovid, Horace, the Greek Anthology, Gibbon, and Philip Larkin. (Surely the last two are \"contemporary\" enough.) Good newspapers and magazines are fine; we need more of them. But there are better uses for our precious time.</p><p>Avoiding ephemera and devoting oneself amid all the noise to the timeless and classic is not escapism or a way to deny the needs of our own times. Real civic commitment starts locally, not with airy pronouncements about national issues, most of which are about signaling one's opinion rather than acting on it. Knowledge at that level doesn't involve following the times or the Times. It means talking to one's neighbors, attending school-board meetings, working for candidates for lowly local offices. That work can and should be done with humility, commitment, passion, and-with time and a great deal of luck-wisdom.</p><p>That sort of wisdom won't come from the Times or the New Republic: certainly not their current iterations, and not even those institutions at their former best. Foer concludes World Without Mind by writing, \"We have deluded ourselves into caring more deeply about convenience and efficiency than about the things that last.\" Amen to that. But it's an odd lament for a book that is ultimately about fixing journalism, which even at its best was never meant to last. Taking back journalism-rescuing it from algorithms, consultants, opinionated Twitter feeds by reporters, and the obsession with page hits, and returning it to a state of serious, aggressive but disinterested professionalism-is a good in itself, a good for democracy, and a necessary start. If we really want to \"take back the mind\" and care about \"the things that last,\" however, we will need to do more than that. We need an intellectual and spiritual life that lies not only beyond the reach of Big Tech, but beyond even the best ephemeral journalism or the finest midlist middlebrow writing. We should go all in. We have nothing to lose but our iPhones.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMWEL-1963403001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMWEL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PYK-CJY1-DY0W-44J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317820</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Commonweal Foundation Nov 10, 2017</copyright><publicationName>Commonweal</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 00103330</issn><volume>Vol. 144</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 10, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Commission's concern is that Amazon is simultaneously acting as a ref and player: Amazon sells goods directly as a first party but also operates a platform on which it hosts goods sold by third parties (resellers) and those goods sometimes compete. And, next step, Amazon is said to choose which markets to enter as a private-label seller at least in part by utilizing information it gleans from the third-party sales it hosts. Assuming there is a problem  Were Amazon's activities thought to be a problem, the natural remedies, whether through antitrust or more direct sector, industry-specific regulation, might be to bar Amazon from both being a direct seller and a platform. </p><p>India has already passed a statute that effectuates some of those results, though it seems targeted at non-domestic companies.A broad regulation that barred Amazon from being simultaneously a seller of first-party inventory and of third-party inventory presumably would lead to a dissolution of the company into separate companies in each of those businesses. A different remedy\u2014a classic that goes back at least as far in the United States as the 1887 Commerce Act\u2014would be to impose some sort of nondiscrimination obligation on Amazon and perhaps to couple that with some sort of business-line restriction\u2014a quarantine\u2014that would bar Amazon from entering markets though private labels. But is there a problem? Private labels have been around a long time and large retailers have faced buy-vs.-build decisions along the way. Large, sophisticated retailers like A...n a different era and Walmart and Costco today, just to choose two examples, are constantly rebalancing their inventory between that which they buy from third parties and that which they produce for themselves. As I discuss below, being a platform matters for the buy-vs.-build decision, but it is far from clear that being both a store and a platform simultaneously matters importantly for how we should look at these issues.Of course, when Amazon opened for business in July 1995 it didn't quite face these issues immediately. Amazon sold books\u2014it billed itself as 'Earth's Biggest Bookstore[2]'\u2014but there is no private label possibility for books, no effort to substitute into just selling say 'The Wit and Wisdom of Jeff Bezos.' You could of course build an ebooks platform\u2014call that a Kindle\u2014but that would be a decade or so down the road. But as Amazon expanded into more pedestrian goods, it would, like other retailers, naturally make decisions about which inventory to source internally and which to buy from third parties.In September 1999, Amazon opened up what was being described as an online mall. Amazon called it zShops[3] and the idea was clear: many customers came to Amazon to buy things that Amazon wasn't offering and Amazon would bring that audience and a variety of transaction services to third parties. Third parties would in turn pay Amazon a monthly fee and a variety of transaction fees. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos noted (as reported in The Wall Street Journal[4]) that those prices had been set in a way to make Amazon generally 'neutral' in choosing whether to enter a market through first-party inventory or through third-party inventory.Note that a traditional retailer and the original Amazon faced a natural question which was which goods to carry in inventory? When Amazon opened its platform, Amazon changed powerfully the question of which goods to stock. Even a Walmart Supercenter has limited physical shelf space and has to take something off of the shelves to stock a new product. By becoming a platform, Amazon largely outsourced the product selection and shelf space allocation question to third parties. The new Amazon resellers would get access to Amazon's substantial customer base\u2014its audience\u2014and to a variety of transactional services that Amazon would provide them.An online retailer has some real informational advantages over physical stores, as the online retailer sees every product that customers search for. It is much harder, though not impossible, for a physical store to capture that information. But as Amazon became a platform it would no longer just observe search queries for goods but it would see actual sales by the resellers. And a physical store isn't a platform in the way that Amazon is as the physical store is constrained by limited shelf space. But the real target here is the marginal information Amazon gets from third-party sales relative to what it would see from product searches at Amazon, its own first-party sales and from clicks on the growing amount of advertising it sells on its website.All of that might matter for running product and inventory experiments and the corresponding pace of learning what goods customers want at what price. A physical store has to remove some item from its shelves to experiment with a new item and has to buy the item to stock it, though how much of a risk it is taking there will depend on whether the retailer can return unsold goods to the inventory supplier. A platform retailer like Amazon doesn't have to make those tradeoffs and an online mall could offer almost an infinite inventory of items. A store or product ready for every possible search. A possible strategy All of this suggests a possible business strategy for a platform: let third parties run inventory experiments where the platform gets to see the results. Products that don't sell are failed experiments and the platform doesn't enter those markets. But when a third-party sells a product in real numbers, start selling that product as first-party inventory. Amazon then would face buy vs. build on that and that should make clear that the private brands question is distinct from the question of whether Amazon can leverage third-party reseller information to their detriment. It can certainly do just that by buying competing goods from a wholesaler and stocking that item as first-party Amazon inventory.If Amazon is playing this strategy, it seems to be playing it slowly and poorly. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos includes a letter each year to open Amazon's annual report to shareholders. In the 2018 letter[5], Bezos opened by noting that '[s]omething strange and remarkable has happened over the last 20 years.' What was that? In 1999, the relevant number was 3%; five years later, in 2004, it was 25%, then 31% in 2009, 49% in 2014 and 58% in 2018. These were the percentage of physical gross merchandise sales by third-party sellers through Amazon. In 1993, 97% of Amazon's sales were of its own first-party inventory but the percentage of third-party sales had steadily risen over 20 years and over the last four years of that period, third-party inventory sales exceeded Amazon's own internal sales. As Bezos noted, Amazon's first-party sales had grown dramatically\u2014a 25% annual compound growth rate over that period\u2014but in 2018, total third-party sales revenues were $160 billion while Amazon's own first-party sales were at $117 billion. Bezos had a perspective on all of that\u2014'Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly.'\u2014but if you believed the original vision behind creating the Amazon platform, Amazon should be indifferent between first-party sales and third-party sales, as long as all of that happens at Amazon. This isn't new Given all of that, it isn't crystal clear to me why Amazon gets as much attention as it does. The heart of this dynamic isn't new. Sears started its catalogue business in 1888[6] and then started using the Craftsman[7] and Kenmore[8] brands as in-house brands in 1927. Sears was acquiring inventory from third parties and obviously knew exactly which ones were selling well and presumably made decisions about which markets to enter and which to stay out of based on that information. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, has a number of well-known private brands and firms negotiating with Walmart know full well that Walmart can enter their markets, subject of course to otherwise applicable restraints on entry such as intellectual property laws.As suggested above, I think that is possible to tease out advantages that a platform has regarding inventory experimentation. It can outsource some of those costs to third parties, though sophisticated third parties should understand where they can and cannot have a sustainable advantage given Amazon's ability to move to build-or-bought first-party inventory. We have entire bodies of law\u2014 copyright, patent, trademark and more\u2014that limit the ability of competitors to appropriate works, inventions and symbols. Those legal systems draw very carefully considered lines regarding permitted and forbidden uses. And antitrust law generally favors entry into markets and doesn't look to create barriers that block firms, large or small, from entering new markets. In conclusion There is a great deal more to say about a company as complex as Amazon, but two thoughts in closing. One story here is that Amazon has built a superior business model in combining first-party and third-party inventory sales and that is exactly the kind of business model innovation that we should applaud. Amazon has enjoyed remarkable growth but Walmart is still vastly larger than Amazon (ballpark numbers for 2018 are roughly $510 billion in net sales for Walmart[9] vs. roughly $233 billion for Amazon[10] - including all 3rd party sales, as well as Amazon Web Services). The second story is the remarkable growth of sales by resellers at Amazon.If Amazon is creating private-label goods based on information it sees on its platform, nothing suggests that it is doing that particularly rapidly. And even if it is entering those markets, it still might do that were we to break up Amazon and separate the platform piece of Amazon (call it Amazon Platform) from the original first-party version of Amazon (say Amazon Classic) as traditional retailers have for a very, very long time been making buy-vs.-build decisions on their first-party inventory and using their internal information to make those decisions. The post Breaking Up Amazon? Platforms, Private Labels and Entry[11] appeared first on Truth on the Market[12].

Unfortunately, there is some risk that today's charged political season may turn these investigations and debates into political theater. It's imperative, however, to pass new anti-monopoly laws and regulations to ensure giant tech companies don't improperly foreclose competition in digital markets whether it involves online commerce or social discourse. The possibility of breaking up the digital oligopoly should indeed be seriously considered.</p><p> \"Competition is our fundamental national economic policy,\" declared the Supreme Court a half-century ago as a matter of guiding principle. In recent decades, this principle has become more honored in its violation than in its observance. Public policy has failed to ensure that competition is not restricted or undermined in ways that are detrimental to public welfare and democracy. It's time to play by the rules of American capitalism. Every too-big-to-fail corporation is a policy failure.</p><p> Istvan Dobozi ,  Sarasota, Fla.</p><p> The writer is a former lead economist at the World Bank. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-c6118eeab49f11ea9a1dd3db1cbe07ce</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6070-YBP1-DXXY-33WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"262\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Unfortunately, there is some risk that today's charged political season may turn these investigations and debates into political theater. It's imperative, however, to pass new anti-monopoly laws and regulations to ensure giant tech companies don't improperly foreclose competition in digital markets whether it involves online commerce or social discourse. The possibility of breaking up the digital oligopoly should indeed be seriously considered.</p><p> \"Competition is our fundamental national economic policy,\" declared the Supreme Court a half-century ago as a matter of guiding principle. In recent decades, this principle has become more honored in its violation than in its observance. Public policy has failed to ensure that competition is not restricted or undermined in ways that are detrimental to public welfare and democracy. It's time to play by the rules of American capitalism. Every too-big-to-fail corporation is a policy failure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Istvan Dobozi</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sarasota, Fla.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The writer is a former lead economist at the World Bank.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-c6118eeab49f11ea9a1dd3db1cbe07ce</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6070-T8X1-JCDY-T0K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"265\"/><timeReceived>11:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Democratic senator from Massachusetts recently laid out her vision for antitrust action against Amazon, Facebook, and Google, citing each company's laundry list of anti-competitive practices that have created what is essentially a monopolistic market. Through the use of stricter regulations and the reversal of large mergers, Ms. Warren's proposal would seek to bring fairness and balance to the digital marketplace, a change which could help restore economic competitiveness and, in turn, heal the wounds inflicted upon our civic life. </p><p>According to Ms. Warren, as each of these companies has grown larger and amassed more power - all three are among the five most valuable companies in the world - \"they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people.\" By acquiring hundreds of other companies, Amazon, Facebook, and Google control a disproportionate amount of Internet traffic and commerce. Ninety percent of all Internet searches go through Google. The search engine giant and Facebook account for 58 percent of digital ads. And Amazon accounts for nearly 50 percent of all e-commerce spending. Along the way to this enormous power, each company has been able to buy out meaningful competitors and price out lesser ones. Amazon snatched up Whole Foods, Facebook snagged WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google has made over 200 acquisitions alone, including YouTube. By reversing and blocking these mergers, other tech companies would suddenly have to compete with the behemoths. And, as Ms. Warren has noted, \"Healthy competition can solve a lot of problems.\" But as one might imagine, the companies in question have not responded well to this proposal and others like it. Each company has spent millions of dollars lobbying against stricter regulations on the tech giants. Google has even been financing professors to write papers defending its market dominance. But in reacting to Ms. Warren's recent proposal, one of these companies - Facebook - fell right into a trap. The senator purchased Facebook ads noting that effective campaign messaging in the 21st Century can only be achieved through social media giants, thus highlighting their disproportionate grasp on our democracy, Facebook censored the ads. And while the ensuing backlash has forced Facebook to reverse its decision, the initial censorship went a long way toward proving Ms. Warren's point. The size and ubiquity of companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google have left many Americans feeling helpless, as though there is nothing to be done to limit their power on our economy, on our businesses or on our lives. Ms. Warren's proposal reminds us that, in actuality, our politicians possess the tools necessary to level the playing field and protect our democracy. Ms. Warren has admitted that antitrust action is not a cure-all. But her proposals for breaking up America's Big Tech companies is a good place to start, offering a road map for a digital market that prioritizes fair competition over profit maximization.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBLADE-24911716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBLADE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1F-C701-DYG0-5010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">280840</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Blade All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Toledo Blade (Ohio)</publicationName><edition>FINAL Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Two years later it would pay $19bn for WhatsApp.</p><p>Seizing on this exchange during last month's sensational antitrust hearings in the US, Democratic senator Jerry Nadler told Zuckerberg: &amp; Facebook, by its own admission ... saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook. So rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.&amp; These are hearings into whether the big tech firms have abused their dominance, rather than the dilemma of how social networks have become toxic environments used to spread untruths and conspiracy theories, hate speech, misogyny, racism and other patent garbage like anti-vaxxing. That is another problem entirely, and a reckoning that is itself inevitable.</p><p>Due to current conditions, instead of appearing in person in Washington, the CEOs of the big firms - Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google's holding company, Alphabet - video-conferenced in.</p><p>Have these titans of tech taken advantage of their powerful positions in their respective fields? Short answer: yes - and then some.</p><p>In another 2012 e-mail before the Instagram purchase, Facebook's then CFO David Ebersman asked Zuckerberg if the social-media giant wanted to &amp; neutralise a potential competitor&amp; or to &amp; integrate [its] products with ours&amp; Zuckerberg replied: &amp; There are network effects around social products, and a finite number of different social mechanics to invent. Once someone wins at a specific mechanic, it's difficult for others to supplant them without doing something different.&amp; If those antitrust lawmakers were looking for a smoking gun, this seems a good piece of evidence - that last sentence specifically.</p><p>Washington has fallen out of love with Silicon Valley after years of scandals - including the manipulation of election results and the general free-for-all of racism, misogyny and hate speech on social media. It now has its anticompetition sights set on big tech. And it has lots of ammunition, as is clear from the e-mails the lawmakers subpoenaed from the firms.</p><p>Zuckerberg clearly knew he had said something wrong in that April 5 e-mail, because he added 45 minutes later: &amp; I didn't mean to imply we'd be buying them [Instagram] to prevent them from competing with us in any way.&amp; He knew someone might read these e-mails and correctly conclude that Facebook had killed off the competition by buying it.</p><p>On the same day Facebook announced it was buying the photo-sharing app, Zuckerberg wrote in another e-mail: &amp; Instagram was our threat,&amp; adding: &amp; One thing about startups, though, is you can often acquire them.&amp; It certainly looks like an antitrust smoking gun, doesn't it?</p><p>Apple got off lightest at the hearings, with Cook able to parry questions about the company's App Store dominance with some glib replies.</p><p>The App Store is the biggest contributor to Apple's services business, generating more than $50bn in sales in 2018. But the 30% cut Apple takes on those sales is a source of consternation for other developers, including Spotify. The leading music-streaming app has launched its own anticompetitive complaint against Apple.</p><p>&amp; Apple's apps have ranked first recently for at least 700 searches,&amp; The New York Times reported last year, after an analysis of six years of data compiled by app analytics firm Sensor Tower. &amp; Some searches produced as many as 14 Apple apps before showing results from rivals.&amp; In September 2013, the newspaper added, Spotify was the number one item in a search for &amp; music&amp; However, when Apple launched Apple Music into the App Store in June 2016, Spotify had fallen to fourth. &amp; In February 2018, Apple apps suddenly appear in the top six results for 'music',&amp; growing to eight at the end of 2018, with Spotify dropping to 23rd.</p><p>Spotify complained to European regulators in March 2019 that Apple was abusing its role as gatekeeper of the App Store. By April that year, all but two of Apple's apps had disappeared from the top result for &amp; music&amp; The most frequent complaint against Amazon's cloud service is similar to that about Apple - that it copies the features of would-be competitors and then effectively puts them out of business.</p><p>But US lawmakers were quizzing Bezos on much more heinous allegations of anticompetitive behaviour, relating to the 2009 purchase of smaller competitor Diapers.com.</p><p>One internal Amazon e-mail read: &amp; These guys are our #1 short-term competitor ... [We] need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost.&amp; Apparently Amazon was happy to lose as much as $200m to drive down the price of nappies, force a cheaper takeover of Diapers.com and then let prices rise again.</p><p>Happy times for parents with kids born that year - not so much for antitrust laws.</p><p>&amp; We have a name for this,&amp; said Democratic congressman Joe Neguse. &amp; It is 'monopoly'.&amp; For once, the sharply divided US lawmakers seem aligned in their assault on the tech CEOs.</p><p>Previous visits were friendly affairs, where the lawmakers seemed to fawn over the executives and request investment in their states. But this blistering hearing was more inquisition than back-slapping camaraderie.</p><p>While the CEOs tried to peddle their usual zero-to-hero, living-the-American-dream entrepreneurial story, they were met with pointed questions based on the subpoenaed e-mail records.</p><p>The more tech-savvy Democrats appeared to have done their homework and asked key questions - clearly having been properly briefed on the antitrust infringements the hearing was called to address. Like good investigative journalists or prosecutors, they asked questions to which they already had the answers.</p><p>Those from Planet Republican used the chance to push their own conspiracy theories about the social networks censoring conservative voices. You only need to look at said social media to see this is patently untrue.</p><p>Both sides of the American political spectrum, arguably the most polarised it has ever been in that country's history, have a common foe in the tech firms.</p><p>The current scandals engulfing social media - from Cambridge Analytica to the toxic environment, the spread of disinformation and hate speech, to the emergence of &amp; surveillance capitalism&amp; are monstrous in their own right. But proving those claims is going to take a while; it's a lot easier to prove fairly plausible claims of illegal monopolistic behaviour than to prove Zuckerberg is guilty of breaking democracy.</p><p>Make no mistake, the concerns about the power and control of social media are more terrifying than ever.</p><p>&amp; If you're not terrified about Facebook, you haven't been paying attention,&amp; Carole Cadwalladr, the British journalist who broke the Cambridge Analytica scandal, wrote in The Observer last month.</p><p>&amp; We have already been through the equivalent of a social media pandemic - an unstoppable contagion that has sickened our information space, infected our public discourse, silently and invisibly subverted our electoral systems.</p><p>&amp; It's no longer about if this will happen all over again. Of course it will. It hasn't stopped. The question is whether our political systems, society, democracy, will survive - can survive - the age of Facebook.&amp; She points out that Facebook is &amp; the vector that has brought this infection across the globe. Algorithmically amplified 'free speech' with no consequences. Lies spread at speed. Hate freely expressed, freely shared. Ethnic hatred, white supremacy, resurgent Nazism all spreading invisibly, by stealth beyond the naked eye.&amp; Though Facebook quite rightly earns Cadwalladr's ire, the rest aren't necessarily any better. YouTube, owned by Google, is the cesspool of the internet. People who still believe the Earth is flat have a platform on the video-sharing site, given the number of conspiracy videos there. These are the same people who seem to believe the moon landings were fake and 5G causes the coronavirus.</p><p>Twitter is rife with toxicity and cancel culture too.</p><p>Warnings have been coming for years about the dominance of these big tech firms. Last year, for example, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes said: &amp; It is time to break up Facebook.&amp; Prominent tech figures such as SpaceX's Elon Musk and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton were part of a #DeleteFacebook trend, and the UK government called the company &amp; digital gangsters&amp; Various competition authorities in the EU have fined Facebook and Google multiple times for infringements, and the big US tech firms have come under fire for the billion-euro tax breaks they get from Ireland for basing their European headquarters there. Having been told to pay up, the tech giants appealed against the decision in a European court, and had it overturned.</p><p>That's another fight that's not going away.</p><p>The EU's data privacy law, the general data protection regulation which came into effect in May 2018, has fines for infringements of up to 4% of annual global revenue - as much as $1.6bn in the case of Facebook. It's no wonder Facebook moved regulation of two-thirds of its users from Ireland to California before the regulation's implementation.</p><p>EU competition authorities have also announced an investigation into Google's $2.1bn purchase of fitness tracking company Fitbit.</p><p>Google's dominance in search and Android means it has effectively controlled these markets for decades. It's another feature to unpack.</p><p>As Zuckerberg said after Cambridge Analytica's abuse of the personal data of 87-million people: &amp; I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform.&amp; He may well soon discover that he will be held accountable. Stay tuned.</p><p>Caption</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-FMfmFM1308ftCont1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K9-5291-DYT4-K17X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

There is a lot of water to flow under the bridge before that happens and America really has to think about, does it want to cripple its technology companies when its in a battle with China?\" Mr Douglass told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.</p><p>Mr Douglass oversees $100 billion of investments for Magellan, including stakes in Facebook and Google.</p><p>Tensions between western governments and China have escalated in recent months over matters including the imposition of national security laws in Hong Kong and the rejection of its flagship telecommunications provider Huawei from 5G networks around the world. Earlier this month US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was looking at banning Chinese social media app TikTok over data and national security concerns.</p><p>But there has also been a groundswell of support for greater regulation of the tech giants inside America and in other western countries including Australia.</p><p>Major US political figures including former Democratic Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for dominant tech firms to be broken up to boost competition. Australian competition regulator Rod Sims this week launched fresh legal action against Google over the way it collects user data and has spoken forcefully about anti-competitive behaviour by digital giants.</p><p>\"I don't think [politicians] can break them up under current anti-trust law. They'll need a change to anti-trust law. Getting anything through [Congress] pre-elections is very unlikely and then it will depend on who runs the White House, who runs the Senate...and America has to decide what is in its best interests,\" Mr Douglass said.</p><p>The chief executives of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all fronting a US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee this week.</p><p>The hearing coincides with the release of the four tech giants' second quarter earnings, which will be made public in the next two days and will give investors an indicator of the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic on these businesses.</p><p>Locally Google and Facebook are waiting on the release of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's draft code of conduct, which will seek to make the tech giants pay news publishers for their content.</p><p>Mr Douglass said that while regulation around privacy and content was inevitable, he did not think more regulation would hurt big tech company share prices.</p><p>\"I think in the end we will get more regulation around privacy issues and some of those content issues...that's inevitable. But the tech companies want better ground rules set for them, they are not resisting that. It's just the both side of politics can't agree on the direction the regulation should be at the moment,\" Mr Douglass said.</p><p>\"Do I think we'll get more regulation over time? Yes. Is it going to be a fundamental blow on the tech companies? I doubt it. Will it have any consequences? Yes it will, but it will also lead to more clarity. We still have large investments in Alphabet and Facebook and we think the risks are priced into the stocks.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520307326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-9X41-JBJ7-N0YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

There is a lot of water to flow under the bridge before that happens and America really has to think about, does it want to cripple its technology companies when its in a battle with China?\" Mr Douglass told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.</p><p>Mr Douglass oversees $100 billion of investments for Magellan, including stakes in Facebook and Google.</p><p>Tensions between western governments and China have escalated in recent months over matters including the imposition of national security laws in Hong Kong and the rejection of its flagship telecommunications provider Huawei from 5G networks around the world. Earlier this month US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was looking at banning Chinese social media app TikTok over data and national security concerns.</p><p>But there has also been a groundswell of support for greater regulation of the tech giants inside America and in other western countries including Australia.</p><p>Major US political figures including former Democratic Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for dominant tech firms to be broken up to boost competition. Australian competition regulator Rod Sims this week launched fresh legal action against Google over the way it collects user data and has spoken forcefully about anti-competitive behaviour by digital giants.</p><p>\"I don't think [politicians] can break them up under current anti-trust law. They'll need a change to anti-trust law. Getting anything through [Congress] pre-elections is very unlikely and then it will depend on who runs the White House, who runs the Senate...and America has to decide what is in its best interests,\" Mr Douglass said.</p><p>The chief executives of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all fronting a US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee this week.</p><p>The hearing coincides with the release of the four tech giants' second quarter earnings, which will be made public in the next two days and will give investors an indicator of the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic on these businesses.</p><p>Locally Google and Facebook are waiting on the release of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's draft code of conduct, which will seek to make the tech giants pay news publishers for their content.</p><p>Mr Douglass said that while regulation around privacy and content was inevitable, he did not think more regulation would hurt big tech company share prices.</p><p>\"I think in the end we will get more regulation around privacy issues and some of those content issues...that's inevitable. But the tech companies want better ground rules set for them, they are not resisting that. It's just the both side of politics can't agree on the direction the regulation should be at the moment,\" Mr Douglass said.</p><p>\"Do I think we'll get more regulation over time? Yes. Is it going to be a fundamental blow on the tech companies? I doubt it. Will it have any consequences? Yes it will, but it will also lead to more clarity. We still have large investments in Alphabet and Facebook and we think the risks are priced into the stocks.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520307326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-97K1-JBJ7-N4RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
