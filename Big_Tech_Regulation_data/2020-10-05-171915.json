The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds. Apple is using its suite of accessibility tools already built into its iOS devices such as, voice-over, high contrast and large text in conjunction with much more old school assistive tech. It says go here, go here, go here. And that is where it is. They have created braille and tactile maps for each level of the app so blind children can navigate the whole screen area with their hands. There's clearly still a role for tactile maps and for images, and diagrams. Yeah, I think it is a healthy kind of dynamic mix of old and new and perhaps some experimentation as well.

The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds. Apple is using its suite of accessibility tools already built into its iOS devices such as, voice-over, high contrast and large text in conjunction with much more old school assistive tech. It says go here, go here, go here. And that is where it is. They have created braille and tactile maps for each level of the app so blind children can navigate the whole screen area with their hands. There's clearly still a role for tactile maps and for images, and diagrams. Yeah, I think it is a healthy kind of dynamic mix of old and new and perhaps some experimentation as well.

The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds. Apple is using its suite of accessibility tools already built into its iOS devices such as, voice-over, high contrast and large text in conjunction with much more old school assistive tech. It says go here, go here, go here. And that is where it is. They have created braille and tactile maps for each level of the app so blind children can navigate the whole screen area with their hands. There's clearly still a role for tactile maps and for images, and diagrams. Yeah, I think it is a healthy kind of dynamic mix of old and new and perhaps some experimentation as well.

In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery.

The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds. Apple is using its suite of accessibility tools already built into its iOS devices such as, voice-over, high contrast and large text in conjunction with much more old school assistive tech. It says go here, go here, go here. And that is where it is. They have created braille and tactile maps for each level of the app so blind children can navigate the whole screen area with their hands.

Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds. Apple is using its suite of accessibility tools already built into its iOS devices such as, voice-over, high contrast and large text in conjunction with much more old school assistive tech. It says go here, go here, go here. And that is where it is. They have created braille and tactile maps for each level of the app so blind children can navigate the whole screen area with their hands. There's clearly still a role for tactile maps and for images, and diagrams. Yeah, I think it is a healthy kind of dynamic mix of old and new and perhaps some experimentation as well.

In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also. </p><p>This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds. Apple is using its suite of accessibility tools already built into its iOS devices such as, voice-over, high contrast and large text in conjunction with much more old school assistive tech. It says go here, go here, go here. And that is where it is. They have created braille and tactile maps for each level of the app so blind children can navigate the whole screen area with their hands. There's clearly still a role for tactile maps and for images, and diagrams.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-12d619502412413d8207936be50560e4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPP-0N21-DY08-34W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

An absolute storm in certain corners of the Internet, it is seen by 70 tech leaders including the creator of the world wide web, saying this could be end of the Internet as we know it but it seems to have made little political splash. Articles 13 and 11 which put much more duty on websites to police copyright. Article 13 says they've got to check all the time that they are not letting their users upload copyright material. </p><p>You'd think that was simple enough. This will not affect the likes of Facebook and Google because they have got the power to do this, they got the resources to do this. The theory is, from those objecting, this will put huge pressure on tiny websites which could face big fines if users put a bit of video up. Geoff Taylor is Chief Executive of the British Phonographic Industry, the music business trade body here in the UK - as well as the Brit Awards. Welcome. Give this your take on this move in Europe. I assume this is necessary? And overdue. We had these outdated regulations from the 1990s to govern the incident -- the Internet meaning there is a lack of clarity which has undermined the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create what it's used by big tech platforms. The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos. That's less than half from vinyl records. Clarifies the law. If you exploit other creative content, you need to exploit that. It's not just how the industry is training. People sharing and re- sharing video with something with a bit of music. But in turn leads to the music artist gaining popularity, publicity, and that leads to more revenue. We are all in favour of users being able to share music videos. All you want is the services negotiate a fair deal. Apple, Spotify, they negotiated arm's-length and we think all services should have the same regime, have a level playing field, and we want to be able to sign the next Stormzy or Dua Lipa. You can understand Paul McCartney backing this move, he's got the resources to pursue those who are not paying up the royalties or copyright but for the very small artist is very unknown, who hasn't really got that legal help all the money to try and pursue this anyway. We are concerned about the impact on small creatives, creating content, but what is important, this is about the platform, making sure Google and Facebook... When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better. They give are coming in and getting up so early. Let's move on. Global growth is under threat from a trade war between the world's top economies. That's the warning from the World Trade Organisation in a new report that says that between the middle of October last year and the middle of May this year, G20 economies applied 39 new trade-restrictive measures - things like taxes on imports. That's twice as many as the previous year. The WTO says the restrictions affected more than $74 billion of trade - one and a half times as much as the previous year. Roberto Azavedo, Director General of the WTO, The economic impact on the global economy Bill -- will be one of contraction or a slowing down,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-427ebcbc89d840dfbbe617b4caeeea33</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SR1-S7X1-JBH6-C2X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

We had these outdated regulations from the 1990s to govern the incident -- the Internet meaning there is a lack of clarity which has undermined the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create what it's used by big tech platforms. The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos.

We are concerned about the impact on small creatives, creating content, but what is important, this is about the platform, making sure Google and Facebook... When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better.

Give this your take on this necessary? And overdue. We had these outdated regulations from the 1990s to govern the incident -- the Internet meaning there is a lack of clarity which has undermined the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create what it's used by big tech platforms. The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos. That's less than half from vinyl records. Clarifies the law. If you exploit other creative content, you need to exploit that. It's not just how the industry is training. People sharing and re- sharing video with something with a bit of music. But in turn leads to the music artist gaining popularity, publicity, and that leads to more revenue. We are all in favour of users being able to share music videos. All you want is the services negotiate a fair deal. Apple, Spotify, they negotiated arm's-length and we think all services should have the same regime, have a level playing field, and we want to be able to sign the next Stormzy or Dua Lipa. You can understand Paul McCartney backing this move, he's got the resources to pursue those who are not paying up the royalties or copyright but for the very small artist is very unknown, who hasn't really got that legal help all the money to try and pursue this anyway. We are concerned about the impact on small creatives, creating content, but what is important, this is about the platform, making sure Google and Facebook... When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better. They give are coming in and getting up so early. Let's move on.

Apple, Spotify, they negotiated arm's-length and we think all services should have the same regime, have a level playing field, and we want to be able to sign the next Stormzy or Dua Lipa. You can understand Paul McCartney backing this move, he's got the resources to pursue those who are not paying up the royalties or copyright but for the very small artist is very unknown, who hasn't really got that legal help all the money to try and pursue this anyway.

They give are coming in and getting up so early. Let's move on. Global growth is under threat from a trade war between the world's top economies. That's the warning from the World Trade Organisation in a new report that says that between the middle of October last year and the middle of May this year, G20 economies applied 39 new trade-restrictive measures - things like taxes on imports.

An absolute storm in certain corners of the Internet, it is seen by 70 tech leaders including the creator of the world wide web, saying this could be end of the Internet as we know it but it seems to have made little political splash.

There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos. That's less than half from vinyl records. Clarifies the law. If you exploit other creative content, you need to exploit that. It's not just how the industry is training.

An absolute storm in certain corners of the Internet, it is seen by 70 tech leaders including the creator of the world wide web, saying this could be end of the Internet as we know it but it seems to have made little political splash. Articles 13 and 11 which put much more duty on websites to police copyright. Article 13 says they've got to check all the time that they are not letting their users upload copyright material. </p><p>You'd think that was simple enough. This will not affect the likes of Facebook and Google because they have got the power to do this, they got the resources to do this. The theory is, from those objecting, this will put huge pressure on tiny websites which could face big fines if users put a bit of video up. Geoff Taylor is Chief Executive of the British Phonographic Industry, the music business trade body here in the UK - as well as the Brit Awards. Welcome. Give this your take on this move in Europe. I assume this is necessary? And overdue. We had these outdated regulations from the 1990s to govern the incident -- the Internet meaning there is a lack of clarity which has undermined the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create what it's used by big tech platforms. The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos. That's less than half from vinyl records. Clarifies the law. If you exploit other creative content, you need to exploit that. It's not just how the industry is training. People sharing and re- sharing video with something with a bit of music. But in turn leads to the music artist gaining popularity, publicity, and that leads to more revenue. We are all in favour of users being able to share music videos. All you want is the services negotiate a fair deal. Apple, Spotify, they negotiated arm's-length and we think all services should have the same regime, have a level playing field, and we want to be able to sign the next Stormzy or Dua Lipa. You can understand Paul McCartney backing this move, he's got the resources to pursue those who are not paying up the royalties or copyright but for the very small artist is very unknown, who hasn't really got that legal help all the money to try and pursue this anyway. We are concerned about the impact on small creatives, creating content, but what is important, this is about the platform, making sure Google and Facebook... When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better. They give are coming in and getting up so early. Let's move on. Global growth is under threat from a trade war between the world's top economies. That's the warning from the World Trade Organisation in a new report that says that between the middle of October last year and the middle of May this year, G20 economies applied 39 new trade-restrictive measures - things like taxes on imports. That's twice as many as the previous year. affected more than $74 billion The WTO says the restrictions as much as the previous year. of trade - one and a half times General of the WTO, Roberto Azavedo, Director The economic impact on the global economy Bill -- will be one of contraction or a slowing down, depending on how big it is.

We had these outdated regulations from the 1990s to govern the incident -- the Internet meaning there is a lack of clarity which has undermined the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create what it's used by big tech platforms. The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos.

We are concerned about the impact on small creatives, creating content, but what is important, this is about the platform, making sure Google and Facebook... When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better.

Give this your take on this necessary? And overdue. We had these outdated regulations from the 1990s to govern the incident -- the Internet meaning there is a lack of clarity which has undermined the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create what it's used by big tech platforms. The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos. That's less than half from vinyl records. Clarifies the law. If you exploit other creative content, you need to exploit that. It's not just how the industry is training. People sharing and re- sharing video with something with a bit of music. But in turn leads to the music artist gaining popularity, publicity, and that leads to more revenue. We are all in favour of users being able to share music videos. All you want is the services negotiate a fair deal. Apple, Spotify, they negotiated arm's-length and we think all services should have the same regime, have a level playing field, and we want to be able to sign the next Stormzy or Dua Lipa. You can understand Paul McCartney backing this move, he's got the resources to pursue those who are not paying up the royalties or copyright but for the very small artist is very unknown, who hasn't really got that legal help all the money to try and pursue this anyway. We are concerned about the impact on small creatives, creating content, but what is important, this is about the platform, making sure Google and Facebook... When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better. They give are coming in and getting up so early. Let's move on.

Apple, Spotify, they negotiated arm's-length and we think all services should have the same regime, have a level playing field, and we want to be able to sign the next Stormzy or Dua Lipa.

When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better. They give are coming in and getting up so early. Let's move on. Global growth is under threat from a trade war between the world's top economies. That's the warning from the World Trade Organisation in a new report that says that between the middle of October last year and the middle of May this year, G20 economies applied 39 new trade-restrictive measures - things like taxes on imports. That's twice as many as the previous year. The WTO says the restrictions affected more than $74 billion as much as the previous year. of trade - one and a half times Roberto Azavedo, Director General of the WTO, economy Bill -- will be one of The economic impact on the global contraction or a slowing down, depending on how big it is.

An absolute storm in certain corners of the Internet, it is seen by 70 tech leaders including the creator of the world wide web, saying this could be end of the Internet as we know it but it seems to have made little political splash.

There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos. That's less than half from vinyl records. Clarifies the law. If you exploit other creative content, you need to exploit that. It's not just how the industry is training.

An absolute storm in certain corners of the Internet, it is seen by 70 tech leaders including the creator of the world wide web, saying this could be end of the Internet as we know it but it seems to have made little political splash. Articles 13 and 11 which put much more duty on websites to police copyright. Article 13 says they've got to check all the time that they are not letting their users upload copyright material. </p><p>You'd think that was simple enough. This will not affect the likes of Facebook and Google because they have got the power to do this, they got the resources to do this. The theory is, from those objecting, this will put huge pressure on tiny websites which could face big fines if users put a bit of video up.

Give this your take on this necessary? And overdue. We had these outdated regulations from the 1990s to govern the incident -- the Internet meaning there is a lack of clarity which has undermined the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create what it's used by big tech platforms. The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos. That's less than half from vinyl records. Clarifies the law. If you exploit other creative content, you need to exploit that. It's not just how the industry is training. People sharing and re- sharing video with something with a bit of music. But in turn leads to the music artist gaining popularity, publicity, and that leads to more revenue. We are all in favour of users being able to share music videos. All you want is the services negotiate a fair deal. Apple, Spotify, they negotiated arm's-length and we think all services should have the same regime, have a level playing field, and we want to be able to sign the next Stormzy or Dua Lipa. You can understand Paul McCartney backing this move, he's got the resources to pursue those who are not paying up the royalties or copyright but for the very small artist is very unknown, who hasn't really got that legal help all the money to try and pursue this anyway. We are concerned about the impact on small creatives, creating content, but what is important, this is about the platform, making sure Google and Facebook... When you try to pursue this platform, pursue YouTube, if you're a small player, you will not have the time or resources to do it. We are saying there needs to be a bit more responsibility shown by the platforms. Creating a fairer, more double playing field in creators and technology will do better. They give are coming in and getting up so early. Let's move on.

Nice to see you, James. Hello. That's what it's going to be like later, the likes of <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg, </nameText></person>Jack Dorsey and others having to answer quite difficult questions on the mid-term elections not far off at all, give us your thoughts on the day ahead. </p><p>There's a real moment were no longer these big tech and social media platforms are brushing these things off. There's an admission these things have to change and that started about two years ago when, as you said, a number of fake accounts were cold and there were new tools and people brought to the table to ensure this doesn't happen again. The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Amazon is relentless in the sense it Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's and step up its battle fast-growing e-commerce market with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-9a87703e43f5497aa7fa9d79f431caf4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides.

There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's fast-growing e-commerce market and step up its battle with Walmart's Flipkart. I'm joined now by my colleague BBC business correspondent Sameer Hashmi.

Nice to see you, James. Hello. That's what it's going to be like later, the likes of Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and others having to answer quite difficult questions on the mid-term elections not far off at all, give us your thoughts on the day ahead. </p><p>There's a real moment were no longer these big tech and social media platforms are brushing these things off. There's an admission these things have to change and that started about two years ago when, as you said, a number of fake accounts were cold and there were new tools and people brought to the table to ensure this doesn't happen again. The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's fast-growing e-commerce market and step up its battle with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-8c399f9ae7f8487392424cf5fad3c846</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now.

The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's fast-growing e-commerce market and step up its battle with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-064d37a7cd67411e913e4ddf41a37c50</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Nice to see you, James. Hello. That's what it's going to be like later, the likes of Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and others having to answer quite difficult questions on the mid-term elections not far off at all, give us your thoughts on the day ahead. </p><p>There's a real moment were no longer these big tech and social media platforms are brushing these things off. There's an admission these things have to change and that started about two years ago when, as you said, a number of fake accounts were cold and there were new tools and people brought to the table to ensure this doesn't happen again. The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's fast-growing e-commerce market and step up its battle with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-abc4e729fe634cfa9d9482ed59785ed1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that.

There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's fast-growing e-commerce market and step up its battle with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-bf5df1bc22c7417493f6263fda112812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's fast-growing e-commerce market and step up its battle with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-4f21586b0a3041149520cbaa528d2ee1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app for Android smartphones in a bid to make deeper inroads into India's fast-growing e-commerce market and step up its battle with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-2d05ff0fb94e4077adc96fa268c16f28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

James Erskine is the director of the marketing firm Social Circle. Nice to see you, James. Hello. That's what it's going to be like later, the likes of Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and others having to answer quite difficult questions on the mid-term elections not far off at all, give us your thoughts on the day ahead. </p><p>There's a real moment were no longer these big tech and social media platforms are brushing these things off. There's an admission these things have to change and that started about two years ago when, as you said, a number of fake accounts were cold and there were new tools and people brought to the table to ensure this doesn't happen again. The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, Facebook and others before US politicians. Let's discuss Amazon. Amazon has done it. The e-commerce giant become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of a $1 trillion. It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. For more on the story, Kim Gittleson reports from New York. The $1 trillion milestone is all them or a mark of all because for the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company that allows you to host a website using its cloud compute in software. All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems Amazon is relentless in the sense it wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge.

That's what it's going to be like Nice to see you, James. Hello. later, the likes of Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and others having to answer quite difficult questions on the mid-term elections not far off at all, give us your thoughts on the day ahead. </p><p>There's a real moment were no longer these big tech and social media platforms are brushing these things off. There's an admission these things have to change and that started about two years ago when, as you said, a number of fake accounts were cold and there were new tools and people brought to the table to ensure this doesn't happen again. The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content. There's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation. And then, as far as burglary is different platforms go, and can they be stopped, if you can micro- target, and you can, there's always an opportunity to mobilise a small section which will then start that kind of social wave on various different social platforms. James, thank you for now. There's so much more to unpack and discussed but we haven't got the time at the moment, we will have to move on but we'll carry on the conversation and we will tell you on BBC how the day has gone for the likes of Twitter, politicians. Facebook and others before US Amazon has done it. Let's discuss Amazon. the second US-listed firm The e-commerce giant become of a $1 trillion. to have a market value of $2,050.50 in morning trade It's shares rose nearly 2% to a high before slipping back. milestone in early August. Apple reached the same Kim Gittleson reports from New York. For more on the story, them or a mark of all because for The $1 trillion milestone is all the nearly two decades that Amazon has spent as a public company, it generally reported losses or negligible profits -- is all the more remarkable. As of this week, Jeff Bezos's strategy seems to have paid off. For Amazon, frankly the future seems quite bright, that's because even more so than the other trillion dollar company, Apple, of course, Amazon's business is geared towards the future of how we will live both online and off-line. Even though the company generates a significant amount of e-commerce sales, nearly 50% of every dollar that Americans spend online goes to Amazon, when it comes to e-commerce, it's only 10% of overall retail spending here in the United States, and that's something analysts say will certainly grow in the future. Also, Amazon's Web services business is continuing to generate record profits. That's the bit of a company using its cloud compute in software. that allows you to host a website All of this combined means that when you think about the best word to describe Amazon's surging share price, well, it's probably the name Jeff Bezos first thought he would name the company, Relentless. Amazon is relentless in the sense it Absolutely. Kim Gittleson. It seems wants to make sure it keeps its global competitive edge. Today, it launched a Hindi version of its mobile website and app to make deeper inroads into India's for Android smartphones in a bid and step up its battle fast-growing e-commerce market with Walmart's Flipkart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-7e8bed46f70e40329f22277392f65a11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

You have Liam Fox overseas at the same time, not that long ago there was a suggestion they were laying foundations for future tours. She might meet some expectations here. There is a big European summit in October and she might stitch this still together in October and she does that, I think will all breathe a big sigh of relief economically. </p><p>It is a bit late, but at least she is getting on with these conversations. A word on the dancing is yellow fantastic. You love that? Politicians dancing, politicians holding animals, fantastic. Kissing babies. Is in babies, we all for it. Loving it. The front page of the Arab News, the pressure on the sun Rohani, the president of Iran. -- Hassan. This is something we have touched on actually quite often on this programme, the difficulties that Iran is facing and a lot of it is to do with President Trump pulling out of the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions. A lot of countries that want to note that agreement and trade with Iran, how difficult it is for them to do so. I must admit that until I read this piece this afternoon I was not aware that Rouhani, who of course had done a significant level of negotiation with Trump... With Barack Obama. With Barack Obama, or beg your pardon, Rouhani is now getting a significant amount of pushback in the Iranian parliament. If they do not like the answers, they send, they refer to the Iranian judiciary. That is probably the start of the and for Rouhani, so I think everyone needs to keep their eyes on this. Already, the economic Minister and the Labour Minister have gone in the last three or four weeks. It is partly a result of the Trump sanctions and again if you are Trump, you might be saying this is working. Well, Trump might want to be careful what he wishes for you because you might end up with an even more hardline Iranian leader to replace a relatively moderate one. Indeed, absolutely. Let's now move on to limbo, many discussing the warning from President Trump directed at Google, and then he broadened out to Facebook and Twitter, saying be careful. He also mentioned the word regulation. Give us your take on what he has to say. We not surprised to hear what he has to say, there is bias, there is bias in the media in general is something he has been talking about since before the election. This is classic Trump, it is what you call dead cat bounce and, at a great here at Paul Manafort, the overhit it Michael Cohen, to look at your potential impeachment, look over there, look at the fake news, look at media. -- don't look over there at Michael Cohen. I had a Google today and yes, CNN comes up, Wall Street Journal comes up, the New York Times comes up, the hated New York Times, to use the White House's words, however the reason they come up is because they are some of the best rated news websites in the world. His point was Breitbart News should be on there, Fox News should be on there. It is an argument I do not think it stands up to much. It is a diversion. It is a political diversion, but the real question is what it leads to, could it lead to regulation of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, given what we have learned about run-up to the 2016 presidential election? This is the thing about Trump, his desire to create a diversionary tactic, some of these big tech companies could be facing regulation. Whether or not a new Congress be on the November passes any of this, let's wait and see. Let's talk about the French President Emmanuel Macron has a lovely big majority in the French parliament and was swept into power, et cetera. But it would seem things are getting quite tricky for him now, his high-profile environment Minister has quit. Yeah, so this is his Energy Minister, Nicolas Hulot.
