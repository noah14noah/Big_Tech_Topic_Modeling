other's minds when you debate but it's a slow and difficult process where online calls we just tend to clash quickly with each angry and divisive I think I want a do you you you do have a listen to the is with this is debatable use want to say the most important thing we can do is to keep the net open amid what what do you mean a beautifully Europe what do you mean by the closing of the club but the clues nets the and why should they wish to avoid the closing of the net is this the title of my book and what I mean by the closing of that is narrowing of the Prism by which we receive our information our culture and our knowledge and to the point where we would end up with some kind of chilling effect of censorship and the concern is that there are now these vast automated systems out there which not only can monitor us in a way that's just been described but can also monitor every time you upload something that has is represents an interference with your rights to freedom of expression and is a really important reason why we ought to keep the internet opened you want to have regulations to ensure that openness judgment absolutely regulations to safeguard I mean I you think what can we do when we're talking about Jamie in the second part of your book you talk about how the internet is killing democracy how we might save me very quickly what are your suggestions for salvation we are here we have a monarch of purging of legislation to deal with some of these issues like fake news engine Yeah Yeah we are matching the odds are in favour of more regulation doesn't sound very exciting but I think that is partly because people feel like the things on subjects somehow turn to to Democratic control they'll reject it outright and I'm really worried that we're going through a massive tech backlash will throw all the good stuff about to clearly we need to update some of our laws mean our election law is out of date the way that Michael targeted adverts should be should also be monitored by the electoral Commission in the same way that this were the big television adverts are are MP's obviously have to get up to speed to be computer scientists can't think of anything worse but they do need to understand a little bit about how the tech work but also each of us we are we are building the big tech monopolies through the things we click and we share we other ones allowing ourselves to be distracted permanently we have to make a conscious effort to regain our attention switch the phone off sometimes make choices about the things we put out there online because we are creating the internet we have do you feel we need a refugee we need to do something no remedy these things I think of her as a public bad thing I think we should I personally don't think that that that that the data can do good but frankly and with that of treating Facebook and Amazon a bit like which the oil companies and the sooner we have their smaller and producing less of the pollution they are producing better anti-trust done in the past it is any sign of the American government getting developing a renewed excitement for antitrust all over again because they've been gradually losing the last 40 years but Nevertheless there are things that states can do and we've seen in Europe for I do think we've er immediately these companies are ever going to become accountable can make them accountable on national governments big enough to deal with these international companies Monaco I think this is going to be dealt with on an international level and I've been involved with some of those discussions are one of the issues is that antitrust and competition law doesn't actually work in this context mainly because you're not doing about with markets you're dealing with things like censorship and surveillance and the government's preferred route which is self-regulation also doesn't work because this is about outsourcing public duty to private actors who were do things under their own terms and conditions so therefore what the criteria they are using who's making the decision what jurisdiction they make a U-turn we don't know Not what she wanted some kind of regulation in the public interest I kept and we have to stop Monica Houghton and world Davis and think about it Thank you Thank you all very much Margot last word on contempt for democracy to

money continue the next thing the next big tech atom is an improving Europe the home Michael Dell lead economist Barbour ABI thank you for coming on was sort of effort that has involved in a big home improvement are reported Jade underwent to meet Christine Harrison in Stockport she blogs about her DIY renovation 5th not perfect but it's really if we paid for plasters that done worse job can tell you very proud of the throne and never will plaster ceiling again ever cos that was ridiculously hard working after the plan 1st layer of plaster was almost in tears of my with Laiki you thought had looked for a way to go and then all of this flu thing so that's never gonna happen again think it's important you limits when we 1st moved in it was a sheer raining into the spectrum and was a big hole in the ceiling which is why the ceiling is now still slightly wavy earnest been repaired and the Rossoneri had that in order to get of flats feeling we would have had to completely replaced it so it was never going to be perfect anyway what was that like living in a house moving into a house that rain was pouring into just 6 appearances specially and that was clear that the more that really was in the West of it very the world's 1st winter in a house so so cold we go down into the kitchen in the mornings we could see up press he was miserable laughter Wow we will attack if we put out 22 lights in the living room they give us about an extra degree of warmth we've got a clearer than think it really was a III imagine the scene from Titanic and not too far off of we realised very quickly that top priority has to be sorting out he'd think they'll go through to the kitchen dining and living for faith if the two rooms that we knocked through into one so the big brave and we never really used to use the dining room as a separate row but Ashley how we spend less time in here now who's who is the brainchild around all the home improvement as it is a self resit their husband Yan is more responsible for tearing things down and doing all the heavy lifting and I had to tend to be responsible for putting things back together at the it sounds like the perfect combination and we do have a fair share of ups and downs on renovating special when things don't go quite to plan that overall it's always worth it when you finish a project and to stand back no idea that it really makes all that mess and had quit without it's been sick she said what would you say that complete cos of everything and I've only spent about 40000 pounds altogether the deathly improved equity that was always the plant was certainly agree we've done our research before we bought in the area when you were at the house as the going for it so we knew we had a certain amount of money we could spend them with definitely be on the safe side Christine Harrison talking to Jay younger so when is it worth it S Kirsty allsop presenter of Channel Four's love is listed by she was filming in Bath think the problem is when the fridge you need to them man how hard it is to move house at the moment we should be in a position where we can decide to renovate or move and there's inequality to that choice but the present at the moment because what is happening is that the system in which we buy and sell houses has essentially broken Dappy all think she should avoid them improvements that and never worth the time effort and money Yes I was I think the kitchen the kitchen and know there are lots of very talented kitchen designers And if you are thinking of staying in the property for a long time that could be a personal investment something you want to invest in but in terms of resale don't spend a fortune on the kitchen and bathroom by something plain that looks nice and has universal appeal but Christine Harrison we spoke to she's tackling a big renovation with her partner and doing all the work themselves what should you consider if you want to do that what you need to consider is getting a relationship with the local district surveyor so that during the course of the work he understands football he or she understands what you're doing and knows that you have the experience to do this work because of thing you can't do is do a lot of work and get the district surveyor to come round and assume that everything gets under the paint is as it should be so that's very important thing we had someone recently on the show who did an amazing innovation job he went off and it plus 3 courses of Coventry's courses and he did every single thing himself but he always said that she to what he and his wife did was that relationship with the guy who has to take you off because you need the buildings regulations certificate to sell on Yes absolutely to sell Yes the everything is very important is that you don't start something you can't finish last week Oh it's a couple of houses where projects have been started and then they decided to put on the market would say for Nations

a brave approach because Yes it could have a much more speedy effect but you could also get an awful lot of false alarms a lot of people left in limbo not quite knowing what they should do and perhaps ending up not trusting the happen that's why other countries have been taking a rather different route a different route that in many cases involve Google and Apple yes or a lot of these countries choosing a decent rise route we've worked all of them depending on a new platform developed by Google and Apple which will make Bluetooth work better and that's another problem the UK had to get around you really need permission as it were from Apple and Google heard of to make the Bluetooth work effectively so that is why they have chosen their it causes is raised questions about whether Apple and Google should affect the Effectively act as a gatekeeper on health policy on our choices between privacy and potential health effectiveness if we are to rely on these different tracing apps then it would become a week going into a world where in order to travel we the different tracing apps will need to be compatible with each other so that people feel Yes they'll come to the UK because they will be happy to use the app that is in operation here or vice versa that is definitely one of the conundrums that a lot of people looking at work how will they work cross-border how many of the apps work cross-border I think the bigger question which is yet to be sorted out a tall is whether any of these apps will really work will they really be affected but the consensus is coming around the fact that old fashion manual contact tracing and testing a will be vital and the technology may help but there is really just me and an adjunct to that Rory Caton-Jones Thank you very much when I spoke to Margaret investing I asked if she was concerned about the involvement of big tech and Ovid tracing apps in all our lives Yes I am and I find that is it's even more urgent now to say well if you are a giant if you're a gatekeeper their dues and their doubts because you play this role all for any other business and for almost every consumer so of course there are things that we have to regulate while at the same time of course enabling all the innovation we want to see in in the digital markets that we are all about to give up so much privacy to some of these big tech companies and to technology with the the tracing apps that we expect to rely on in the years ahead will you be downloading tracing that when money is available that very much depends on how it's made it because I would not accept that there is a choice between health and precaution and taking care of others and and privacy because these apps can be constructed in ways that allow us as a great degree of privacy data being stored for instance on on my phone that is not my localisation that can be followed his Bluetooth technology and of course they did is it is voluntary and that not more data is exchange an absolutely necessary because this is the only way I will trust it the UK of course has gone down the route of having a centralised version does give you cause for concerns perhaps over privacy I am told it is doable I think we would have a preference for a decentralised model but I am till they do this to football to have a centralised model but that of the mainstream in Europe is towards decentralised model where the data is on my phone and not being transferred to some central location and the important thing is then to have have a protocol and have a docking station both with an Android phone and iOS operating system because we if you follow that protocol then also when you travel and you meet someone in another country with another app the two apps can can talk together so to speak and that of course is very important because cross border traffic for people to work in another country for 4 people to be able to to move about that of course is of the essence there were very integrated part of quality of life and at the moment are you concerned that those cross-border solutions and not being developed and we might find a situation where people do want to come here because they see it as a government that but it has been a little slow how I am I must say because if</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

reports that comment on that alongside free speech there are the financial futures of some of the biggest companies on earth fake news is particularly effective when targeted targeting takes data and data is dollars data and dollars other heart of big Tex business model of the threat of regulation and political control over the data that we said happily hand over has seen billions driven from the shares of big tech in recent days the furious response to reports of a massive data breach at Facebook has led to consumer pressure to Emily Bell Columbia University in new York the hashtag delete Facebook pressure definitely and impact on how companies think about addressing what might appear to be public relations problems but if then not adequately addressed they can very quickly turn into problems for the core of the business whatever consumers companies and governments may try to do about the disinformation for some the genie is out of the bottle and trying to ram it back in again is an impossibility instead argues Emily Bell ways must be found to help individuals navigate their way around a new and often wild world the issue with fake news is that it's what I would call a tree in the raid problem we can spend a lot of time trying to chop it down the routes are extremely deepen it is very difficult to remove completely the better strategies are really understanding that it's their learning how to drive around it Reagan McDonnell is head of the EU public policy for the Mozilla Foundation which produces the internet browser Firefox when asked whether the tech industry had been naive about her pad about its power from that the tech industry perspective I think we were been above of all days of the internet where it seemed like the in the opener in particular was just can't sing force for good and what we've seen in the past 6 months but but year or two or 3 years is this different shade of the internet where there are issues around enough hate beach and all sorts of issues like fake news and and disinformation I think there's definitely been a realisation that there is a great deal of responsibility but it's just about figuring out how they deal with that you are part of the figuring out process moment you lean towards the idea that the industry can police itself or do you think it needs help from governmental bodies believes that there is now a place both for government and for tech companies sort of self regulation but the key is that you need a balance both Sen when you're addressing a particular problem the most important thing is to understand what the problem you're trying to solve and then evaluate one of the best ways to tackle that issue and the kindness of fake news We don't believe there is such a silver bullet Unfortunately to to fix this problem whether through legislation or Are hand cut corporation is not the fundamental problem and it's always going to be a generalisation after that kind of phrase but isn't your core problem that your business model incentivises further and further and further engagement and it does so in many many cases pride promoting the kinds of ideas thoughts pictures that's grabs people and will not let them go and the very nature of what you do is encouraging the problems you yourself are trying to sort out it Yes we do think that if you look holistically at some of these issues of prisons what drives though via reality disinformation business final the internet really does in a lot of ways can facilitate incentivise the spread and this type of this type of information that is certainly an issue to tackle there might not be perfect long for a quote unquote fake news and in fact were where action risking the the risk is very high when we think about regulating this type of issue because remember that this content is not actually illegal so we don't want to run into a space where we have the Ministry of truth where the government decides and tells people what is true for the issue I

what has been going on in this country there is no doubt there is no denying that Zimbabwe is a deeply wounded and traumatised nation and some others about when that we have been speaking to saying that they are ready for change they want to move forward they want to fix the country a country that is way more Gabby himself is not long and in power Nomsa Maseko in Harare Thank you very much your time and your thoughts we used to talk about too big to fail but that was so last decade so big banks with big tech we now worry they're just too big for their boots this week Apple became the world's first trillion-dollar company with the retail better Moss Amazon provoked howls of pain from what's left of the high street here in the UK has revealed even lower tax payments on its increased profits and Facebook found itself in a familiar position the defensive over the Sisyphean task of policing a world of content they have brought task of miraculous connectivity and ease but the big tech companies running up hard against governments ever more uneasy at their size and power is it time to break them up Kenneth Rogoff is Professor of public policy at Harvard University was formerly chief economist at the international monetary fund Eileen Burbidge is a partner at passion capital in the chair of tech nation partly government-funded instead supporting tech entrepreneurs in the UK welcome to you both Thank careful highly let me start with you you're not a fan of breaking up these big companies you prefer to regulate is that any points you see that these companies could become too big or is simply in your mind no such thing as too big I know I certainly think there is a point where they could likely get to be too big it's possible I actually appreciate that as possible maybe one or two might be there or at the cusp now and simply not a fan of jumping to the conclusion or a sort of defensive play to break them up now I don't feel that there's than enough study are enough work with them in collaboration about what's happening and I think that's too much of a knee-jerk reaction and I do think modernising are regular Tory framework and maybe even start tax framework is the right approach first with the sequencing issue Kenneth too early to start calling them to bid well I I broadly agree with Eileen about we don't want to rush to break them up mindlessly or just say something is too big because it seems big on the other hand there are points of regulation that are kind of urgent first of all they shouldn't be allowed to buy competitors the way Facebook by InstagramGoogle which has a mapping programme but the Israeli mapping program Waze and you can go I would also say that where they have a towering monopolies over data and there are real problems here we've seen them with Facebook but it really applies to everyone and I think they need to make their use of data much more transparent and public I think that would go a long way towards Barking movement towards regulation but I think doesn't turn said put his finger on these two desperate of pinch points in these enormously profitable cunt companies their data monopoly that restricts market entry and their vast piles of cash some of them now operators venture capital companies themselves unsure you know if that means they can simply by up competitive as possible investors absolutely I do think there are two points to keep Diana probably as as Kenneth was saying the most pressing I think that the point about the data is absolutely spot on but I would say if it's not them It's going to be somebody else which is why now I I would argue is the best time to work with them to figure out how do we regulate for data used for data collection for data privacy and for consumer rights just by breaking the mud which I take is not tell us suggestion right now breaking them up when actually answer that question and it would just actually kick the can down the road

last night to go shopping but she had to go home and eventually I turned up an hour and 45 minutes later than it should have done so had not made arrangements tonight because I can't allow what will happen latest announcement is this just the trains delayed this no timescale on it now that's a bit worrying that normally is a further sign of doom every night so Hadley a timeout here even guess when you might get home changed our I think it's 17 44 claim due at 17 32 now but the a fight to see whether there is any space for the chain whether I get to see whether have to stand in stress positions further rest of the journey no no hope the seat standing now 24 I've peoples standing in this carriage and taken my ticket is 11 \u00a3 60 every day I do get a monthly season ticket which equates to 190 \u00a3 90 a month this year has been horrendous on the trains cancellations long delays Overcrowding I do feel that it's a third rate service but having to pay premium prices and really really disappointed that after all this time and the knowledge that the pressure is on they still can't fulfil their timetable Jenny McLoughlin Northern rail has apologised and says that these current delays caused by Lees on the line and damp weather and they are making improvements to that the regulator the office of rail and road has just finished an inquiry into what went wrong when the new tyre timetable came in last may and it makes a number of recommendations Dan Brown is the head of policy and strategy one of the recommendations is the interests of passengers should always be a central consideration in future why have they been in the past with us right now earn passengers been hugely down this year by the by the rail industry our inquiries being investigating the causes of the major disruption that occurred in may and we found major problems with the way that the infrastructure projects on which the timetable change relied were planned and executed problems with the way the timetable itself was developed and problems with the way that the train operators provide advice and support to passengers when they went wrong there was nobody thinking about the passengers in all this what we found was that decisions were made very late in the day Nash the problems that occurred in the underlying infrastructure schemes were known about about a year in advance but the decision decisions were delayed and delayed gain in a way that meant that the disruption that eventually affected passengers became inevitable and unavoidable why do you think they were delayed like that where everyone with everyone think you know hopefully will turn out all right near and that that is part of it in it because that's what we call optimism bias does seem to be a cultural factor of these big schemes there is also reluctance when these projects are being developed by a team who are developing them to escalate bad news up the chain until failure really becomes inevitable so our recommendations are looking</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

think we keep part of this is in the Anglo-Saxon countries like the UK in the us this is very strong attachment to private home ownership actually in other countries like Germany about a third of people rent and house prices haven't changed for the last 50 years so a few bubbles at the moment so we also need to think more broadly about the political economy in our countries and whether private home ownership is always the best way to have a house and you say Rana that the businesses that are left borrowing money and not necessarily doing it to create new product streams or invest in new operations they are doing it for for other reasons although its rights Apple which is the most profitable company on the planet has been involved in the capital markets AP ball had about 10% of America's liquid corporate wealth and they hold a lot of that in offshore tax havens Day issue at the same time even though they have others cash on hand the issue tremendous amount of debt on the US public markets in order to pay back shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividend payments now that just in the riches that up 12% of the population owns 80% of those assets it doesn't really make the majority of people more prosperous and the same time you have this kind of Kaka ask situation in which the richest company in the world that don't actually need any operating capital has more involvement in the capital markets than ever before so I would have to conclude from that though that <person><nameText>Adam Smith </nameText></person>has ideas about what the financial system was supposed to do which is help the high Street are really not the case anymore and Josh following us Interestingly drawn <person><nameText>Adam Smith </nameText></person>into it Peron because I think actually the the classical political economists like Smith Ricardo John Stuart Mill a very clear sense of pushing back against this kind of financialisation process they distinguish between two different types of profit as productive profit contributes to wealth but then there's economic rents where essentially is unearned income that you're getting for example from simply owning some land where there's lots of investment going in by the state of the public sector and they wanted to tax those sorts of rents and today we see a massive explosion of economic rent in the financial sector in the land economy also these platforms capitalists in the big tech companies Yes and is there a political problem Rana with politicians trying to shrink the size of the financial sector is that is that something is ever going to be the top of the agenda politicians either side of the Atlantic Orwell is a great point I mean I think the situation the US is arguably even worse because we allowed so much political lobbying and the amount of money the poor in Washington from wall Street are just stunning and in fact they rivalled only by the tech sector and has just point out these tech platform firms are themselves becoming an Apple lists extracting round accelerate and in the case the US Congress has largely barred out by these large political lobbying groups the in many cases they even buy up the academics and experts that inform the public about these topics sell it is a deeply entrenched problem you know it's taken 4 years to get here I think it's gonna take a long time to get to a place do you think Josh that our political system is kind of addicted to financialisation after all after the 2008 crash we saw corporate tax receipts fall off a cliff and government have to go into this round of borrowing and cutting in order to make the books balanced think politicians the government can actually take on financialisation rather the risks of doing so too big for the I think the dependency has developed between governments and the financial sector partially around this conception that that we have a limited amount of spending power worries about the budget deficit and the austerity narrative in reality the way you get sustainable economic growth is by investing directing finance and public spending into innovation into those areas of the economy that will create long-term growth for that you need a specific kind of financing a patient finance sometimes you need more risky versions of finance and actually the public sector for example state investment banks tend to be better at creating a kind of finance and the private sector which is much better coming in at once it's clear the profits to be made sort of venture capital models say in the UK we don't have a state investment bank were quite unusual economy and not having that and with that Brexit meaning that the EU funding might be leaving there's some interesting debates happening about maybe creating one in the UK how we get here in your view what happened to our economy to lead to the point where so much of it is financial I think the key turning point was the mid 19 70s and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates way had essentially restricted capital flowing across borders and that allowed regulate As central banks that have control over finance and where it flowed in the</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

mauling before March 31st away we're gonna get hours days weeks months years more of this game is all over good know of course we've got much more legal wrangling to come I'm sure but I just meant in terms of bananas and tonic water and what we can and can't call on Melton Mowbray pies and things like that but El on the Telegraph's story the that the Barnier leaves May facing us Brexit humiliation what really stood out for me was this quote in the first paragraph this last night after a total breakdown of trust between London and Brussels and obviously assistant if relations have not been great for several months now but he now Barnier taken to Twitter and then Steven Buckley the Brexit Secretary sort of hitting back on Twitter tweets might get quite nasty I mean Yeah well I mean Barclays when nasty but when you look at what Herman Van Rompuy said the other day these quotes that are circulating now about the Brits the UK will re-join with their backs against the wall and knifed their throats you know it's getting really really nasty and its kind of the glove so often pay and we've known that relations are grey ever since the whole kind of comment about that 7 there'll be a 7th circle of hell for people whatever whatever but really it seems as though there's little pretence left and it seems as though those talks during the week were a real failure and the net there's no pretence that they are not pretending that things nice and I will of the public are so bored with a smile or so frustrated that they're not taken a lot of what's actually happening and what the play's could be in just a few days time Peter I think it's quite right I mean it's the media coverage style reflects I think the same newspaper of flogging a dead horse led display trying to eke out a few more lines miss story and the fact there is such a contrast between these stories enmity papers just over headlines again May's Brexit humiliation the Telegraph may rejecting Barney's olive branch in the eyes of chaise no one really knows what to make clear I kind of feel because we have this deadline of March of fares 31st and the media are tired of the public a very bored and I think the politicians really feel like their games towards the end of the marathon this is all premature but essentially we're doing the post match analysis while the match still being played and I think until we get to March 31st we won't really know what had the 29th 20 like him beating is a deal then month may war be hailed an historic figure with support Brexit not sure by the credibility the Tories and bubbly and outs dignified departure is no deal we have economic chaos and chaos in the house of Commons and she may will be forced Hours long as the 12 minutes lock up a leadership election and is completed say back he sought a bit premature I think we have two months and just see what the results are I disagree I think this is quite term this is quite seismic I think this is the moment when really it's slightly carnage it feels like open warfare to me this is not gonna give any ground and we've got this big parliamentary vote coming up on Tuesday and Brussels saying no we're not changing now offering what they offered well according to Stephen Barclay offering basically the deal offered me a year ago and he's saying this to us this is a non-starter people are saying this is absolutely this is the moment when the deal is dead the one Tory Brexiteers said the deal is dead as things stand so what happens next this is quite an important moment but we've had a lot of Tory quotes like that week after week for you know well every year I mean we go away and see what happens the day on Tuesday let's move on from pays Daily Telegraph against social media firms to be buying a statutory duty of care backed by Toft Sanctis to Aspell aside to Emma Yeah I really do I know I've spoken to about 4C I made a documentary about 5 years ago about and while eating disorders and self-harm and all of a really terrible terribly damaging and dangerous online websites there are just all over social media InstagramFacebook etc etc anyway this is a white paper which is apparently being circulated by Sajid Javid and I think Jeremy Wright the culture secretary and amongst Cabinet ministers search for consultation the moment and it's actually quite strong measures to crack down on the big tech giants with possible fines possible prosecutions but even possibly being banned from having access to eat to the UK unless or you know what if they fail to protect children and other vulnerable users this is gonna cover not only</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

bang bang and truly scrumptious tea on the Thames aboard her Majesty the Queen's rowbarge and you could be Hampton court Palace this year's Grand final two and then go to bbc.co.uk /500 works end of the second of February 500 words around the world and across the UK on digital and online I'm Richard Foster and we're up all night at the start of the day President Trump arrived in Davos by the end of it he'd been promised a visit to the UK but not a state visit It's thought the difference is he ever going to enjoy that banquet at Buckingham Palace case the Catholic has decided not to appear at the Oscars in March is after allegations were made against him by two female crew members but as they settled out of court already why should he go almost two million undocumented migrants could be an easier path to US citizenship unsurprisingly the white house wants something in return to find out more about that I will speak to the man who got a new kidney all thanks to a man he met and Disney first time the Theresa and Trump show has been taking centre stage at the world economic Forum in Davos the Prime Minister made a speech to the forum calling on big tech companies to do more to get rid of illegal and extremist material she also said investors should use their influence to ensure issues are taken seriously shareholders should care about these social impacts because the business model of the company is not sustainable if it does not command public support and consent and they can use their influence to ensure these issues are taken seriously for example earlier this month a group of shareholders demanded that Facebook and Twitter disclose more information about sexual harrassment fake News hate speech and other forms of abuse that take place on the company's platforms so investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered and I urge Them to do so well as Theresa may gave a speech Donald Trump arrived in Davos for the first time as President of the United States in a tweet before he left Washington Mr. Trump said he would tell the world how great America is doing after the two leaders met for talks President Trump dismissed what he called false rumours of a rift saying he and Mrs may like each other a lot he also said he expects to see a tremendous increase in trade between the UK and the US job of foreign Downing Street says officials have now been asked to finalise the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year earlier I spoke to Ryan Heath whose senior Europe correspondent from Politico has been following events is always an interesting environment It's a little bit like lost Vegas for politics and policy everything is a little bit shallow but very bright and glamorous and Theresa may was a bit of a hostage to fortune she happened to be making her speech just when Donald Trump was arriving so it was let's be honest a little bit of an empty Hall when she was speaking but some of that paid off because she gets very kind compliments from Donald Trump after a stage she gave a speech to the forum in a cheese but how she actually regarded in in in the leader moment I think people feel a little bit sorry for her they don't think she is the cause of Brexit which is disliked fact here in Davos but also at the same time he doesn't deliver speeches that really resonate with this audience last year she really flopped because it was right in the wake of Brexit and she didn't really do anything to reassure people that she was listening to this kind of elite group here in Davos and this year she came with a very different message was interesting it was about how the power of tech but the fact that the British government wanted to regulate the there was a very interesting concept but I think it's a little bit flat people were expecting her to lay out a bit more of a global vision of where Britain was going to be after Brexit ago in a very narrow I think with a few people disappointed after that of course she and President Trump did manage to have a few chats themselves and it all seemed to get a little a little more promising that absolutely well

a really good job that it on a hate like AppleFacebook and Twitter have said that they would be at the meeting are other companies mentioned were you to Google Dropbox and Microsoft but they haven't confirmed yet undergo the meeting in San Francisco Bay area and they will have official told conferencing in from Washington on one topic of discussion is how tech firms can make it harder for terrorists to have leverage the power of the internet to spread the message and used again recruit and motivate them to to report violence and the other topic is how they're going to on how it other same companies can help others create publish and every fight different content of to the content that which have undercut the Islamic state's on my efforts on but they won't touch on this I think is

they were asking tech companies or tech companies are beefing up the crypt encryption so that you can prefer protect their privacy so they're not that killed in Iraq and Fatah that but put on other things it will see often attacked their concessions would be granted Andrew thanks very much US and the EU from USA today running through some stories that are making the papers any United States and we will stay in the United States the us <person><nameText>president Obama </nameText></person>has been explaining his proposed changes to gun control legislation to public audience in the state of Virginia in the last hour or two it was Obama is trying to make the case for tightening gun control rules while fighting claims by opponents of those kind of regulations that he's trying to take away people's 2nd amendment rights speaking at a town Hall event for CNN George Mason University in Fairfax he reiterated the importance of strengthening background checks on those who buy guns so anyone to make it quotes a little harder to get a gun correspondent Peter bowes has been following the debate and a little harder is perhaps the operative phrase that's not something that had been easy for <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>to achieve in recent years as it all right and that the problem for him is the moment getting legislation through a Republican Congress that that's really what holds some of the measures that he wants to get through using the conventional measures methods and what he's had to do is use his executive authority's to a century propose these changes to venture get them made law and that were people divided a lot of Americans and as a poll in the last 24 hours shown a lot of people are to support what he's doing in terms of my new Shiite determined to get to try to clamp down on gun sellers at gun shows not having the appropriate licence and not conducting background checks people like that kind of think they're a little and easy that he's had to use his executive authority to do that but he's been explaining that he's been talking about this this town Hall style meeting he has been reiterating the main message that he wants to see more gun sellers those people who are essentially make a profit from selling guns to be licensed and to carry out the proper background checks and he reiterated right to the top this programme he said he respects the 2nd amendment that the right to bear arms but he says that he wants to take all steps that simply sensible in terms of gun safety not he acknowledges to eliminate gun violence that's never going to happen all gun violence but he said to to lessen this and he's taken a number of questions from people with an opposing view was one woman for example Kimberley cordon she's a supporter of the National rifle Association she was raped just under 10 years ago was a graphic account and an attack on this woman and she talked about her belief that she should be allowed to carry a gun for protection the president's response to that was there is nothing that we have proposed he said that would make it harder for you to purchase a firearm so we will see how this goes down we will talk to people in America just a 2nd Peter thanks so much as a correspondent Peter bowes has been following the debate well rebecca's in the brand as the Washington Post's politics editor who has been

have you both with us I thought you see we could start off on a day when the eyes of the nation a good focus on Washington DC because what's happening up on Capitol Hill we can actually talk about everything else that has been happening in Washington to make it really more as their rather sleepy place on the Potomac quits it it seems to have been and I I I wonder Jeremy well let's start with you that was certainly my perception until very few years ago you know sure it was the seat of government should work the white house was there but was mainly filled with you no law abiding civil servants getting on with the job of keeping America have running and and and and that was that Yeah I think I was here in the mid-90s for the first time for for the BBC in the same office I'm I'm sitting now and I think Washington has changed hugely it was it was very much an 88 one one lens town it was a very narrow it was it felt small and it feels very cosmopolitan now you see it in everyday life in the restaurant in the social life the music the food itself it feels a lot younger than it was he mentioned just base of an Amazonian they are bringing their new headquarters to Washington DC as world with with no new influx of sort of young technology people it feels like a very different City to me and a lot of cities have gentrified have changed but Washington feels like it's really moved a long way in the last 10 or 20 years Rupert Europe but here in the middle of that the media world is does it feel anything like the media Cup Of all new Yorkers it stars actually I think the difference sensibility about the way Washington places itself that kind of the case for her part of it everybody alluded to the idea now there's this huge influx of people like AmazonApple and Microsoft simply because they need to be closer to the folks in power their paranoid about no antitrust and and self-regulation and things like that so that's changing but it is a different kind of thing I think the one thing I noticed having been in new York for sometime was third the news system here is it is it is rather more sober and Syria some maybe it's just the idea that you're close to the corridors of power but it has an air of gravitas about anyone who's been to Washington DC will just simply take a look at the buildings and and not be kind of knocked out by them because they are they're fantastic landscape to look upon you get a bit of other members but Jeremy Wright there is clearly a trajectory here I think that's likely to accelerate simply because of this Nexus between streaming in tech and and those in positions of power was a little bit about tech commits and its new importance truly in Washington Jeremy you would know a thing or two about that how do you see tech trying to influence what goes on Yeah no I think is a great question I used to live in the other Washington in Seattle and obviously was a very sort of tech dominated City at least in the latter years and I I I absolutely feel but that is happening it is a real clash of cultures happening here because hardly a week goes by when you don't have one of the big tech figures giving evidence or all sort of appearing before a committee or congressional committee here so it away there are the battleground has moved as theirs there's a battle being fought here in Washington DC about the future of technology Washington DC has is catching up to the the import whether it's around taxation anti-trust been a political sort of political persuasion and of course it it's got a lot of catching up to do because you're having seen some of the hearings and politically there's not a lot hasn't traditionally lot of technical knowledge here and also sits on the West coast and there's a lot of catching up going on in DC to try and understand changing currents and changing technology is an and and how Washington DC to reassert itself reassert its its influence and its power on the future some fairly major major things I think it's fascinating to watch it play out and you see this as a real clash of cultures and different languages being spoken by the technologies that have come to DCM near the traditional politicians and bureaucrats and to me a lot of it in the geography Washington and think about the fact that up for Massachusetts Avenue got all the embassies are there and

studio for the big TV moment of the weekend was this of the stars of Strictly come dancing Saturday night at the couple's choice Nikkei what she decided to do with those stars be Frank we shall hear a light plane on fire anybody but the evidence I've seen so far that there may be evidence of the car like like Brent first back tomorrow from 6 first for news and the best lives this is BBC 5 live more importantly runner for is with us talking about big tech which just to be clear if you work in big tech she does not considered to be evil Less of down be evil now you and you are wrong the we know you well not exactly but there are things happening that are arm insidious mean look you can't talk about big tech and not talk about Cambridge Analytica but that's just part of it and I was talking to the team earlier on saying that unit we're talking about private companies here but Edward Snowden's revelations about the state Yes Benteke and using data Yeah Yeah for sure the is interesting I was actually in China when the snow in the story broke and I with what they could see what the fuss was all about well he is very fluent a bit it was interesting because I had I was meeting with the PLO general who a woman Interestingly and I was talking to her about at that point companies complaining western multinationals complaining about their intellectual property indeed being stall and when their in China and she said you know there's no separation here between the state and corporations and we would assume that there's the same kind of data espionage going on in the us which of course there was armed and that's that and it does underscore this this worries some new world that we are and like Nah we're data is the most important story of value global anyone other interesting stats my book that 80% corporate value now lives in the 10% of companies that have the most data intellectual property and statecraft about data war fear is about data foreign policy is gonna be about who can ring fencing controlled data cell its horn the world and one of the things I'm trying to do in the book is to create a clear and helpfully readable narrative to tell people how we are we are we are in the last 20 years and how we might be able to put some safeguards in place to make sure that we're going to a good place and do you believe that the direction travelling terms of reform in terms of legislation has is an unstoppable force because my my feeling is that it isn't and the push back is it is deep rooted Yes Yes 100% I think I think we're gonna see in the next couple of years probably first coming out of Brussels It's a major anti-trust case but there's a push in the us as well armed and reason is that business itself feels threatened by the biggest tech players you look at it and I'm coming in and buying whole Foods and then suddenly they're on the entire grocery market or Google decided that they want to get into checking accounts and then suddenly what's gonna happen in our financial players or online financial players can be disrupted that could happen within months so that's one . but I think also the fact that we are beginning to realise we are imminent deal is the new oil a day and a lot of are transactions these days are done not in dollars but indeed we think that these products are free but actually their mining data from us and that's how they are and that's how we're paying for and sell should some of that value be kept in public data banks which is one thing I suggested the us state of California which Interestingly as the home of some of these companies is also the most headline on regulation in fact in some ways more had then the Europe is looking at a sovereign wealth fund for data that these companies have to put some value whether mining for free from us back into a bank that would help with things like healthcare education and infrastructure pensions will I am was on the show so there and talking about the inner-city schools he's working Yeah because the understanding was that technology would affect jobs for people who have not fared so well for the education system live in socially economically deprived areas but actually Interestingly you say that it may not be those jobs it may not be the ones you Regard as manual Labour that mean the first to go rate and if you think about what can be done by Safa what can be done by robots It's things like accounting the legal profession radiology and it could be that</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

you so I think people are learning how to deal with social media develop earns Lisi what do you think cheques should be then because we can't really go forward thinking that this doesn't need some kind of self-regulation we or certainly some kind of self awareness because the technology we're playing catch-up with the technology Yes sure obviously we're gonna have social media and the world got to move on not everything's going to stay the same real shouldn't for smartphones away but I think the most important thing is to ask where the responsibility lies and it is that most big tech companies debts the most part I know exactly what they're doing Facebook always conducting surveys you know there's been a lot of News about how these people's information and things are actively designed to be addictive It's not just a chance that everything's addicted it is designed in such a way that as as humans away be biologically work it is feeding need to go any more and so I think it definitely needs to be some regulation we're looking London sent an interesting take on like to know Lydia Lucy what you think about this I hope this has caused friction my relationship my girlfriend always on her phone and everything is a photo opportunity I'm 31 and she's 27 is not much of an age difference but Phil come right on the cusp of being from a different generation ago most of the time like your last call it really mind me up we go out to dinner I try not to show how much it annoys me because when I do she just doesn't get high I think it's such a bad manners perhaps just properly old-fashioned 31 years old is not like you like super older anything and the risk of this conversation is of course of its kind of all people such as myself interrogate frightful young people who have lost the art of conversation and Exeter Exeter on a course that's not true but clearly there are enough people saying that there are mental health issues and there is this kind of problem of people spending more and more time staring at the screen said Lacey was your initial reaction to Luke's tax I just think it's normal as it's a basic human need to want to be acknowledged that the person you're with everybody needs connection and it is going to change the way we live in a way that we feel if we are not connecting with people and and if he'd look at communication for the most part and its body language and the tone of voice and speed voice so when you're actually talking to someone face to face for example only 7% of the communication is what you say so there's a whole lot more to communication just pictures and words it's it's how we interact together that as a human being Things face-to-face so obviously if yourselves are not connecting review then that's pretty frustrating so I guess it's just saying if he does not want his girlfriend said I have a phone and dinner table then maybe that could just be all she could have a time when when she does then and then eat it they get what they want he writes Lucy to say that is well within his rights to tell his girlfriend police when we are together dinar he could ask his girlfriend because his girlfriend he was small cares about him she wants to spend time with men so maybe she just doesn't realise that when she looks at her saying he takes that is she is one of diva me she'd rather be heard saying That's why I'm enough that she wants to sit here and eat snails me began I think it's just all part of a new farmers know any I think we need to learn when to switch from when I am my boyfriend actually guilty of being on the phone modern made for a time and producer out here and do an Ma in a jokey way I mean it is a jokey way but there is something behind it right which is yes and usually watching them and I can just see the flash this screen next to me but I think if we go out we have a mutual respect and understanding that 3 players have you found out for it read to do other things for the table you can't you can't expect somebody can never go on the phone but I think just there are times when it is just of any new modern world you get their body Yeah and the problems may come from the higher I have an iPhone but only for calls texts and emails no TwitterFacebook or Instagram as Joan Bethnal green soaring even internet use just whether the art of conversation has gone a kiss my wife my heart I know she's addicted to phone my life will be worth living if I told her to have a break argue my name just in case there's still good fines are smart as

complacent about the fact that Turner potentially there could be more of them 8 minutes past 3 Google has been hit with another massive fine from EU regulators this time for 1.3 billion \u00a3 5 live money Danni Hewson is here Danny that's quite a fine it is quite a fine but would you believe it is the smallest of the 3 fines that the EU has placed upon Google and all told it's almost 8 billion quid's worth of fines that the EU hit Google wave but in when you think about the fact that their pre-tax profits last year were 23 billion \u00a3 for the Google owner Alphabet it puts into some kind of perspective I guess is interesting because this is all about advertising and what the EU have said is that Google blocked rival online search advertisers and restricted third party rivals from displaying surge adds It's all to do with AdSense and it is quite complicated so let's talk to Isabel ash Hamilton the tech reporter for business insider UK higher is about Ivor just explain exactly what it is that adds a sense darts so accident is a very specific part of the Google's advertising business and when their website right exam board website or News website in beds a Google search bar in their sights that he had senses absence brings up the advert based wasn't entitled to adapt search by the posted a general massive Google search so what the EU has said is that they prevented other online advertisers from basically getting there and to to these websites because of their dominance Yeah so it goes back a long way actually gain to 2006 when the US found that Google started including exclusivity clauses and it is not to say it phased out in 2009 in favour of premium placement clauses which would mean that these sites have to put Google's adverts placed rivals analyse China's position and along with that they seem to have written in a clause which meant that the site had to get written permission from Google if they want to make any changes to these rival adverts for example the colour and font size and that's what the commissioner has taken issue with said there had been a lot of changes made by Google we've had a statement from their global affairs head Kent Walker saying we always agreed that healthy thriving markets in everyone's interests with already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns that the Commission had concerns over numerous things from the shopping service and and also from the way that apps were placed on the Android phone and Google has been making changes Yes we can has been getting some court to appeal both through is fine that is still ongoing but just yesterday actually Google and I can walk himself announced that Google is making some changes see the Android platform they're going to give users more choices talk browse they want to use a banned and it's quite interesting that it's the EU is doing this rather than the United States because my great burst again the EU Commission and she has been pretty vibrant said set coming after Google Yes she's got a bit of a reputation of being anti us she denies she continued She says she treats any business coming into the EU and breaking antitrust laws the same in the US there are rumblings about levelling more antitrust cases against the big tech giants and Elizabeth Warren has made a massive point of her her campaign to become the Democratic candidate done Donald Trump has made some noises but he hasn't said anything specific he said that so these companies for example GoogleAmazonFacebook could be very reality just them is a book I ask you a question about how much this will hurt their bottom line However affect the share price an 8 billion \u00a3 sounds a lot of money to anyone except perhaps when you look at the kind of profits that Google owner Alphabet makes sure and so Yeah a total of 8 billion \u00a3 business recent fine is the smallest of 33 companies 17 18 by a fair margin it's about 1.3% of their 2018 turnover so undoubtedly they will be able to pick themselves up and move on but it's still a hair-shirt staying right so what does it not clear share price is it not investor confidence in the company I think I think given but given they are able to move</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

in their pay packet there are also looking at that date it took and April for some of their areas and so that will be extra cash in people's pockets to potentially go out and spend and keep the economy going at a time across the public sector this this does come off the back of 10 years of pay freezes or very low pay rises Yes and and certainly you know there's an annual pay reviews it goes and this time I think the government has said he needed taking all except he obviously lost the front line workers certainly deserved Besson's so great News course across the country I don't think anybody could argue that the from my work is absolutely deserve a pay rise but playing devil's advocate a bit government departments are not getting extra funding to pay for these rises the government faces the biggest deficit in its finances in peace time some people might argue this is not the time for public sector pay rose I think as I said in terms of it actually acting as a stimulus to the economy it will be quite effective doing that and said we see that within the US where he did continue to borrow but it actually given that flow to the economy and that has certainly kept things moving when people maybe a bit more hesitant they want to keep consumer confidence higher and let that spending happen Lewis Thank you stay with us we've got lots more to talk about in the show now it unless you had your head in the sand the last few months you have come across some form of fake news for conspiracy theories about the Korean virus pandemic in fact according to a report by a committee of MPs social media companies allowed online misinformation spread virulently the digital culture media and sport committee wants to see the big tech companies regulated to stop this happening again the BBC's specialist disinformation and social media report is Marianna spring she has been looking into this for us Marianna good morning good morning tell us what this report sets say their report effectively concludes that the spread like wildfire of everything from misleading cures and medical myths to conspiracy theories suggest 5 she is falsely linked to the virus or at that rate versus created by bill gates as a way of vaccinating and surveying everyone making his money at all false claims and the report suggests that the reason that those claims were able to spread on social media was the car As there is a lack of regulation lack of law essentially meaning that the government has more control over misinformation being spread on social media because at the moment we are reliant on social media sites themselves to self-regulate and as the chair of the DCMS committee explained to me Julian Knight and that's just not an effective method going forwards what really concerns our committee is the fact that this is a familiar story but what we've seen has been brought to a real right are but at the same time we've seen over areas such as Cambridge Analytica and date her Facebook and iOS to big potential election interference globally into processes across the world skirts and yet here we are all in the middle of Twenty20 and yet we still see correct massive architect was still relying on social media couldn't consciences that we are EU were rightly as point out that relying solely on social media companies to regulate themselves is a difficult thing to do and something that other countries don't do it to quite the extent the weed it and said the report goes on to recommend that the government publishes a draft version of the legislation the Online Harms bill which was taped would be implemented quicker then perhaps we think might be there are suggestions that might not come into force until as far away as 2024 and what that will do is ensure that social media companies are are obliged to honour a duty of care they have two people say that harmful misinformation is not allowed to spread in quite the same way but there are also concerns that actually we've learned a lot from the crane avert a pandemic and that in itself will need to be updated to reflect that because the extent to which conspiracy theories or misinformation that don't cause direct immediate harm that is very worrying me huge and perhaps more indirect harm for instance there's medical myths stop people seeking help or the vaccine conspiracy theories we're seeing spread those kinds of forms misinformation will also need to be addressed in this bail according to the report do we know what specifically they want social media</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

good what about you very good thanks any were talking about Rio runs this morning because Trinity Mirror the company that owns one of the biggest newspapers here the Daily Mirror is rebranding to with the name reach so is there any big 3 runs that brings my view in Singapore a hot night in Singapore but usually changing the law of course I mean still a gap to the millennials so one of south-east Asia's largest telecommunications company said Singapore telecoms basically change the font of its log all just given a different law minute more pleasing to the day so that's one brand major brand that and I've noticed over the past couple of years has changed its look to adapt to the current the times are changing the funding can be as simple as that I can't recall review shortly before we do our top story this morning the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica has announced it is closing down in a statement the company said it had been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and been vilified for activities that it has a legal and widely accepted it also said the media coverage of the scandal has basically driven away virtually all because companies customers and suppliers and they say it now means it is no longer able to continue operating you remember that the firm Cambridge Analytica was at the centre of this recent Facebook primacy scandal weather data around 87 million Facebook users were potentially harvested by up then passed on to Cambridge Analytica what Damian Collins MP chair of the digital culture media and sport select committee said yesterday the closure of Cambridge Analytica won't stop investigations into the scandal there are ongoing investigations into the concerns that have been raised I think a lot of things whistleblowers to come forward with about the work these companies were doing the relationship they have with other companies have been borne out by documents and evidence and produced against them and their the ethical concerns raised by the undercover investigations into these companies as well the reason these companies and then become unviable if that is indeed the reason closing is because they are unable to defend themselves explain very serious allegations made against them for a walk we have to make sure narrative because the clue is in the company's down if individuals committed offences they cannot escape punishment an investigation Damian Collins the chair of the digital culture media and sport select committee said that they will still investigate individuals even if the company does not exist the reason just talking about the company for a minute that the statements that was pretty sure it wasn't Yeah I think so I'm just really for say Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous and unfounded accusations has been vilified for activities that are not any legal but also widely accepted standard components of online advertising I'm not sure how the 80 odd million people who had their data used as and were even what the people signed up to the original personality profile question would agree with that legal possibly but morally I think a lot of these people be pretty unhappy and then he says despite Cambridge Analytica is unwavering confidence this employees acted ethically and lawfully the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers say it's not Cambridge Analytica sport It's the media's fault and as a result determine is no longer viable to continue operating the business no apology is from them at all really quite a punchy state a fair to say that come out swinging and superego question about all this is whether tighter regulation is coming down the road and it seems that that is an inevitable consequence of this and other stories we've seen about people's data but actually in terms of those big tech giants is its regulation coming down the track and absolutely I am here to talk about Cambridge Cambridge Analytica and which is an immediate casualty but the real elephant in the room is on Facebook and the La Likes of them any inevitably the have to accept curbs on the use of data and data that they are able to share with developers you may recall that Facebook I dodged a bullet recently Zuckerberg had testified before Congress in the US he seems to have gone through without too much damage the also had a stellar results were announced recently but if you look at their prospects over the medium term and you know their earnings prospects of very much tied to where they are and how they can how they can survive this this onslaught of regulation which we think will be inevitable and an imam regulation sorry guys but that regulation could take time if you think of the financial crisis it took years for the regulation to stop coming in but if the scandals large enough the political will to do something we will be there although it can take a long time for a regulation catch up with what companies are doing and I would very much draw a parallel Lewis between a what financial companies went through</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

companies who have pulled out the chief executives and I am told by people in the industry there is still a presence by the same fans at the event's history not hard to understand why Saudi Arabia the world's largest oil exporters is also the biggest economy in the Arab world and I'm sure a lot of companies are looking at events over the last week or so and thinking to themselves not only what price they will pay for it go to this of them what it will cost me if I don't go Micah is that something that businesses is just want to take the sting out of it by pulling their chief executive but they still want a relationship with Saudi Arabia is what will be going on I think it is weighing up a pragmatism and bought it with kind of commercial benefits not depends for business or even for a country where one sits on on the side of the divide nice you don't trample seared and commercial benefits are more important than their day for a single journalist where is a company like a country like Germany has said that it's stopping import by exporting weapons to the Saudi Arabia and encourage other countries to do so I think in a world where it in your image and what you stand for AEG important It's important to take a stand interested what we will talk more about the relationship between big business and big government later in the programme as well as they thought on that take

maybe that is exactly Alice stories driver Niki because we eat it in terms of stats It's the highest concentration of fast food outlets Norma almost a decade the number of takeaways per head when you look at its 34% higher increased from 2010's to 2008's even walk down the high street and see the number they knew this is a huge amount stripped bare stripped the charity shops that there's nothing left somewhat streets stories can be coverage across the BBC website today let us know how you get your takeaways if you get and how often just like Calista as know what they are do you go to the store you order online 85 though 5 aides now will be talking to the digital Minister Margot James and she told us on wake up to money that the technology industry in the UK will continue to need access to global talent after Brexit whatever deal is agreed choose speaking alongside this new report has been published by the UK tech industry shows relative levels of success and that 6 different cities across the UK have now produced is a good bit of jargon for Mickey unicorns businesses worth more than a billion dollars another chance Mark James the word came up a lot and she told us though success can only continue if companies get access the staff they need with the industry growing like this we cannot source the skills and talent but the tech sector needs at the rate it is growing from within the domestic population and therefore we have to have easy access on a global market for talent really which is what the tech industry is all about and the tech industry he might be growing into the workforce and value but lots of concerns maybe from the industry well whoops concerns from others maybe those on high Street that some multinationals aren't paying their way when it comes to tax the budget next Monday a lot of talk about how can we stop tech companies shifting profits around the world potentially avoiding paying tax in the place where they actually make their money Philip Hammond strength to take action the UK before a global deal is done but Margot James Tommy is not something she is aware that is worrying tech businesses they very rarely raise it with me I very rarely I'm a little sad don't think any tech companies ever raise tax me possibly because they are not playing enough I am not because On that but I know that it's not something I am that her but engaged with me about perhaps engaged cherish Treasury ministers donor that's interesting Mickey the maybe talk a big tech companies more worried about getting hold of the right talent and pain few percent more in tax lives it is always the case in a year we go on banging on about this this tax situation with a lot of the tech companies but it is not for the tech companies for of of governments and how they handle this tax affairs in the rules and regulations the government and they should get that sorted out they will keep using these borders to offset tax we have had lots more

perhaps the holes on the high Street could be filled by tattoo removal parlours and turning from Warrington says a third with tattoos rubbish think your look like when you are 50 pushing the ground children in prams keep messages coming in a 5 way debate I'm almost 50 I'm not pushing grandchildren yet no meeting with a very welcome how flee not too close to 50 you can also get in touch on social media using the hashtag wake up to money we've been through the papers this morning the one we didn't touch on was the front page of the business section on the Telegraph that was Jack Dorsey one of Silicon Valley's best known tycoons he says is absolutely willing to support small British businesses that are struggling to survive an onslaught from online competition from the likes of Amazon he believes that financial payments technology could help save small businesses in an era when consumers are increasingly turning away from cash must admit I can't remember the last time I had a folding money in my wallet one businesses at the forefront of payment systems is checkout.com which last month secured investment valuing it a 1.5 billion \u00a3 the London-based company provides secure digital payment systems and works with companies like Deliveroo and Samsung and DM pools that is the founder and CEO and joins us this morning good morning I am the morning then it didn't warrant and Luis so Jack Dorsey is suggesting that these payments systems could save the high Street can they make much of an impact I think for us it's all about international payments new have been UK company selling all around the world she's looking more at that I guess in financial inclusion of small businesses and know-how them except that digital payments I think it's a slightly different value proposition but clearly you know anything is a net positive when it comes to helping businesses animal could very competitive market you've obviously got Jack Dorsey's square and how do you compete how do you stand out are value proposition really comes out of the legacy you know helping people sign hard-to-reach countries and there is a lot more interest European from Pakistan to Egypt to Australia some of them raising some of the harder the way we do this is that we offer is unified platform which basically up a business at local businesses multiple revenue centres all around the world to sell through that single platform as opposed to doing multiple providers DCI into this and ended the fact that no deep rich status streams helps them optimise everything with their club and it is true enterprise solutions a bit different from two actresses doing anything no we complement each other data on small businesses we deal with large businesses and Leno make everything progressed get the annual Swiss national when you've worked a and set up businesses in California as well Switzerland big financial industry Smith's California big tech industry so why did you decide to set your business up here in the UK and London scything him in the UK always had a forward-thinking regulator think yes you has been pretty amazing creating a landscape that fosters innovation I think it's this was really the first decision the second one engineering talent everyone says it's hard to higher that is definitely true that the quality of the engineers in London is pretty incredible we have a bit of wind we have to be honest this everyone still trying to come to the UK in the good engineers he hadn't eastern Europe and central Asia there's a huge no influx of engineers and anything that starts in general was just like a very positive and there's a lot of energy in the Walkinshaw addiction and see for yourself I think there's it is fundamentally a landscape that is seen Prosperous and in good for the tech companies and the results that we should break now all these articles about all these unicorns a chance but others burn is basically the result of a strategy that has proven to work it is interesting talking about that the skills shortage saying engineers are still wanting to come to London it was a big push yesterday talking about the North South divide in the need for the Northern powerhouse do you see that you know when people wanting to come to the UK they are looking at the South is that's why you're southern based I think it is not for still position has as many engineers as possible Moyes is what we're looking for some of course we're trying get it in the UK something like 160 positions open in London allowed but then there's like offices in Berlin Paris enough tech companies We'll have a common problems which is nice the engineers the better but I think we have to recognise that the UK has a very strong talent all and I think

wage workers are not in manufacturing so this is one reason why people all impact on the Labour market and the economy is relatively small one sector that we talk to regularly on our programme is the the childcare sector clearly for the number of bosses we speak to running businesses in that area is not an easy area to make money that is what do you say to an area like that where you are told by the government there are certain regulations we need to provide a certain amount of childcare a certain level of service and you are not able to make that work and now you're gonna hear of more wage increases you're gonna have to abide by it's very important to keep in mind that 4 sectors where the funding is coming from the public sector any we need a mandate has to be met with in increase public expenditure obviously otherwise that could have dealt eateries impact either on jobs for and quality of care so what are the recommendations in my review is if the government is considering a higher a substantially higher national living wage particular attention be keen to the necessary public financing needed to offset the cost increase in those sectors this is our in Dubai we hear from a Professor of economics who at University of Massachusetts who advised that government or the former chancellor placed on the minimum wage Lewis some of that stuff you know it that you don't hear that in the party conference speeches d'you hear with putting up the minimum wage but there are consequences consequences to inflation consequences to the unemployment rate and what has been interesting since the financial crisis is we've seen these big falls in unemployment in if you look at the percentage of the population that is currently now working its record highs It's never been this these high and yet you really were only now starting to get a little bit of wage growth this is the thing that sort of confused not just in the UK It's all well the world It's confused people that we really haven't seen that the wage growth the you would expect over the last 10 years James Fowlie is still with us what do you make of of what we've just heard this sort of conundrum about the wages really have gone up Labour really hasn't been awarded for at least a decade and well I think that's right and I think actually when danger of looking at this backwards I think the reason that employment is so strong and this is just in the UK this is a real threat the G10 is because workers are cheap as we look back for decades really threat the G10 wage inflation is extremely low what that meant is delegates for decades when we see productivity which is just up ahead when we see productivity gain and that basically create wealth the majority is going to the owners of capital for the owners of the businesses although the Pentagon has accepted workers and not getting in their slice of the pie of a slice of the pie that workers have been getting ready for that last few decades has been shrinking and and as a consequence we come to this issue about the banks become to this issue I think with populous me and save businesses take on Trump make America great again maybe harking back To a decade in an era when a blue collar worker could afford to support a family in a house on one income that isn't the case anymore to have issues with income inequality we've got issues with all sorts of social reasons said the increase in the minimum wage Yes on the margin it might create some issues for some businesses but as a trench workers just haven't been seen wage rises and that has meant Yes says more people in employment because for lots of different firms perhaps cheaper to get more workers in the into investing in capital said the upside is lots of employment but the downside is we have been getting less the size of the party in Brazil boss of we transfer a big tech company 0 people would associate with big tech companies with paying higher wages to a very highly skilled and trained people that how does the world of minimum wage and and lower earners affect what you're doing you have two seperate Silicon Valley thing from from the rest of Silicon Valley being an anomaly where there are 11000 billionaires in San Francisco allowing its it's a complete bubble that you can't relate to a company like us which is based in Amsterdam and we are an employer 175 people and thereabouts the thing I would say about tech and in the minimum wage is one element I think working conditions are calm and contracts are super important to consider in this conversation to if you look at a company like Uber and what we got very excited about in the gig</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

public sources not something that I've created this always think with credit scores like it's not what information you handed over to other people handed over without a Tue there are various regulations which are coming in to control this but this will take some time and in a way you might even say into for her Equifax actually broken the into met him on as much as they vie to let go of all of that to authentication information that everybody relies on so what information has gone could not complete information then forget includes addresses example and how would a criminal make use of it if they got a partial data about me how they make use of that well as other public bits of information coming leave we have probably got things like LinkedIn pagers people probably postings on new on on Facebook was probably enough to compile a quite reasonable . a dossier mean one of the big issues is going to people over the years have been for example encouraged to make small touring to run their own business like so there are public registers of a pier people's business interests which gives their figures home address the directors for example so they might know some people will be less at risk and others but it's another piece in the data did the jigsaw that allows people to take advantage just finally there's some big changes coming in in the UK in terms of what was called general data protection regulation it had French GDP are increasingly where companies will see who have breached see significantly more liability going put put upon them it is that I don't have an effect on how companies acting in the UK use it is having an effect with some organisations who unfortunately are jumping around and being worried about the finds what is actually quite an interesting

aware of and and price earnings ratios historic highs so it really doesn't address system earnings rising price of a property compared to people what people earn to pay for it exactly that and then that is a party high pain we need more supply and actually over overtime be we need that ratio to come down and backed Is is not helped by this in fact quite the opposite in fact the in the FT has got that headline help-to-buy funding boost adds a billion pounds to share prices or of housebuilders to suggest quite a lot of the benefit is going to the housebuilding sector which are enormously

Facebook hiring a 1000 staff to check their advertising now these big tech names of really driven the US stock market to its record highs in the numbers are startling was starting to see maybe not so much anymore Yes faltering slightly and a number of challenges coming up for them to deal with growth is is still very strong so there's no immediate issue there of the digital advertising is still growing and inert in high double digits but you'd you have these of the rising number of challenges one is obvious that the Russian investigation for Facebook in particular but you also have more

Airways here changed the conversation did think Yes I do think it's a game changer this find is so large say if we look at it and I find that happy and over the last year or side the big one famous or infamous example would be Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal and they were fined 500000 \u00a3 said this is a really big step change said more than 183 million \u00a3 and that's because of the new regulation and those days for little letters GDPR they came in last year in may 2018 and under That's regulation and the information commissioner can put in place fines of up to 4% of global turnover so obviously for the Companies like British Airways and actually the fine could be higher I understand that 183 million is about one and a half percent of global turnover so where would get see some big fines and it's not just the UK because this is EU regulations so we've seen the French data protection regulator fined Google 15 million EURO so we are just at the beginning just the cusp but potentially some large fines than any big pan-European company is will have to think very carefully about what they're doing without take Yes I think so and and I think information commissioner probably wanted to send quite a signal by putting forward that a very large figure yesterday GDP are really sick knowing it's a bit of a change in our approach to personal data a bit of a change in philosophy of the approach behind it say yesterday the information commissioner said people's personal data is just that it's personal the idea behind GDP are is that we all should a be a little bit more in control of our personal data we should understand what data sharing who was sharing with what they are what they aren't allowed to do with its and a think this fine signals that it is not just about the individual we will hear a lot about how to be safe online and keep your passwords secure all that sorted saying I think this fine signals that the information commissioner expects companies to take personal data breaches and takes cybersecurity very very seriously and mores stud Yeah I just finally I just wonder if this seems to be in the process first for everybody when this was announced shocked a lot of people say part of the process is British Airways now are appealing or plan to pay off cannot succeed it is interesting isn't it something that they have already made a number of points about all the things they've done right so sad that they reported this breaches in a very promptly which is something the companies now have a duty to do if they become aware of the breach should sit on it so we think this happens and June 28 team around that period and and British resorted to the information commissioner in in September said I will be arguing we did all the right things we reported this prompt way frankly the statement from the information Commissioner's office is pretty strongly saying British Airways security wasn't good enough and and Yes they've cooperated since so since they brought this issue to its be intact attention of the information commissioner how but the signal is really companies aren't doing enough and they need to do more It's this doesn't just apply to the big tech companies Facebook and Google's it doesn't matter if you're an airliner supermarkets or what you are but when I saw the company might have to take personal data seriously Mori Meadows Thank you for joining us this morning from the research centre for business and society at Coventry University Duncan says consumers British Airways risk split 185 million among

David Rath with this morning heard for him already at each founding shareholder of we transfer boss of the big company that trousers transfer billion files month 50 billion customers users is a document sharing site also author of the trust manifesto we transfer was business formed in 2009 based in Amsterdam large office in California as well of course a big tech company will have a presence there surely and Damien just looking at all the world of tech right now and data I guess we should should kick-off it we will probably end up talking A look at the big companies have data issues that have you happen to have you had that moment when you woke up one morning and realised with a lot of people's data and we haven't been as tight with it as we should think is something we've always been conscious with I mean with as I said we've been around 10 years I think we've always been very conscious of the hardest things you can you can get from customers trust the easiest thing to lose is it is trust and it's literally gone overnight to is not something we've never really skirted around and certainly in the Netherlands we've worked very hard to make sure we've had a really good dialogue with all of our customers we were pretty simple service rights we don't have signed up with allow customers to basically use our service and and of News a fairly and I have to say that over the 10 years we've been incredibly successful and just allowing facilitating people get on with their work and that was the mission was basically a lot of big tech was about trying to tickle closed loop to get on the site and then basically be distracted and and prevent you from match doing the work is important team and and ambition was always keep people in their flow which is the hardest to state to be in a match to remain in but you had a breach we did have a bridge and quite recently we had unfortunately some in this idea of a trust where we have a relatively simple service there are always people out there they will find a way around it will find some method of using the service for them for their own will mean for their own means somebody's servicing quite easily put in an email address and Senate to other people they did that we are pretty fast enough of I am would be around 10 years we transfer billion files month this happened Licia the course of a couple of days and we shut down we went through all the right procedures and notified everybody now particularly in the European Union and GDPR has been very forthright and setting out rules and regulations to how we have to conduct ourselves how we have to let everybody know we're changing our terms and conditions and what we're doing a good thing is a very good thing I think it's a tough thing for a lot of tech companies have managed to be able to be quite self-sufficient and do their own thing It's a big change because they really have to go back and inform people as to what they do on a day-to-day basis we've always had a very lean data policy this week with an ash have to make a lot of changes to bring ourselves in line with and these new GDP regulations I think it's a really good we will see a lot

venture capital firms the why why he decided not to go the flotation route as many tech companies do you could be a billionaire is an interesting time for IPO I think that the recent period of Snapchat Lyft Uber and the fellow peer of of we work I think it will change the way that that the consumer looks at the IPO market I'm sure we'll see less tech company's IPO thing because we work and that will be a lot lot more criticism of what is a good business and we work clearly was not a good business means that the valuation is ridiculous when you look at a company like Amazon which is a very good businessman doesn't make much money but it does make a lot of money you're in you're in their offices Damian Sadia the and m maybe not good business for the point of putting money in get a

terms of guarantees that another issue like what has happened and what what has changed so far in the way Facebookmanagers data so what actually in real life has changed since Isil came out so one of the its most contentious points about and all returned this app which originally leaks people's information from Facebookwas the way it could access not only your information as a Facebook user but also your friends information Facebookhas taken the cost of any ability for apps to get a secondary friend information that change some years ago It's also become much stricter about what data developers have access to it what's very difficult for face because they cannot retroactively police apps which may have sort of abuse debts It's much more open platform policies in the past but going forward has become much stricter say helpfully there wouldn't be any new ups the much but it's possible there is a backlog of apps that may have leaked data and that is still leaking data all have leaked data have leaked data I think it will have changed now they won't be able to do that now I think they're under the new policy on Facebookstunner Tate also have cut off our back and technology says much harder for new upset dissidents have the same sort of impact as the Cambridge Analytica scandal there's an interesting development overnight US group of them activists have announced a campaign to break up Facebookbecause what many people perhaps Dave is that Facebookalso owns Instagram and WhatsApp achieved huge social media platforms as well is part of the problem here and one of the reasons that Facebookjust gets so much criticism is too big too powerful Yes definitely pots question applies to a lot of the big tech companies such as Google as well Alienate the these companies of dictate our lives in many ways the use of lets you log onto a computer It's very hard to get away from any one of these major tech companies including Facebooksay I definitely think people wake up to the fact that actually they in these companies have become something of a utility and actually because essay Newent and said a fast-moving regulators have not caught up in terms of coming up with legislation to keep consumers safe OK thanks alot China should go there from UK business insider Thank you very much We'll keep an eye on that hearing of Mark Zuckerberg in the European Parliament a bit later on now this morning we've been asking you about flexible working this is the right to ask for your hours be varied you can perhaps work from home on some days as well out of that text on this this morning Neil in Milton Keynes says he works for the police in support services he's been able to change his hours by getting an earlier and leaving just before the normal finishing time he's in the same hours but over a 9 day fortnight this means he can avoid all the rush hour traffic which is clearly a good thing another message here I'm lucky enough to work the technology industry which embraces flexible working communications and reliable video meetings mean he's able to work effectively at home but we have that David in Bath he says sounds good but how can I use it in retail shop which opened 96 well we need a minimum staff to survive we are talking about this because a report out this morning says that a third flexible workers feel like they have less status because of their working patterns Karen Mattison is the joint chief executive of Timewise which carried out this research morning Karen good morning the joint chief executive Steve jobs steady I effectively job-sharing efforts writes that that's the ultimate flexible working it is it worked fantastically for us over the last 10 years or so we don't do we both do for days so effectively the business get a lot more but we have some flexibility for ourselves as well and the split role effectively which works really well for us at your data your research days that one in 4 of those that work flexibly think it stop them getting promoted I'm sort of surprised it's only one in 4 anecdotally for female friends of mine who work for the workplace because they have children I would say most of them think it stop their career in its tracks Yes I think that's true and that's something that time we've been working on for a long time I think the assumption has traditionally been if you're working just part time or flexibly that you're also not ambitious and want to progress I think traditionally weeks we've had the assumption that big jobs successful jobs the jobs the top can only be done in a kind of full-time traditional working pattern but we know that that's changed dramatically but I think the story has to reached the top of business as well really can you could run Barkley is a good on a part time basis surely well it's really really interesting there are CEO is working on a four-day week we run a powerlist every it

world to imagine start and grow 8 tech digital business helping fuel that growth we've all heard of them eBay which announced that there are now over 1000 British eBay millionaires in the UK up 300 in the year alone up 300000 people a made over million on eBay Khan this is unfair of me was like percentage of what businesses say they've got on what sort of things said and it's a real makes everything from me no carpets and clothes and cars It's quite incredible I can tell you However though the greatest monument eBay UK millionaires per capita a concentrated in Manchester Birmingham and West Yorkshire there we go I'm from Essex the of eBay's had its share of negative headlines from how Much tax it pays to how it polices its site earlier I caught up with the company's UK chief executive Rob petrol he told me his company is helping others make money service around 200000 businesses in the UK from tiny tiny small enterprises to peak be going concerns most businesses are growing on eBay and most businesses are some of the right they are not necessarily household brands you would recognise or are see these real genuine going concern I think this time last year there were about 600 businesses on the platform on eBay any UK that turned over a million \u00a3 a year there are now over a 1000 I need these are the two retailers stay employed people they create products they manufacture think the EU or like Facebook and Twitter have huge amounts of data coming on to your site how do you make sure the you please everything that's on there and you protect the consumer will always take things so there is a lot about the technology it deploys are constantly in order to enforce a horse a policy's this teams of people whose sister that and manually check all of those we have policies in place to protect consumers there's an eBay guaranteed when they shop the platform we continue to support them we live with that take the whole time to protect consumers our job frankly is to connect them today's businesses the business we start off talking about who are creating Nou exciting businesses new products to market and in the middle of that will continue to protect that she was now time to make sure they are people shopped on eBay with confidence of eBay as Brandis is incredibly popular one of the things which she did have a bit of a knock was the whole issue which many of the big tech companies face which is the issue of tax and the amount of tax you pay where I currently with that we continue to work with HMRC we pay out attacks with its regulations which been beeping work apart with Hm RC petite do so to make sure we paid very little tax in the UK for a business that delivered shore of people who would perhaps say that maybe what you taking compared with the tax they are paying doesn't seem to quite square how do you answer them worse you have to understand is how value is created a tech platform but again a sailor less for the regulator to decide we comply with regulations we continue to work very close HMRC were very transparent about our business model how that works and make it into work with us and I will happily response to any changes they continue bring forward two hours eBay's UK chief executive Rob petrol there Thank down 5 or 6 owners though tech because Microsoft has developed a specially adapted controller for the Xbox it means people with limited mobility can compete on a more equal basis someone who can tell us more is George Dow chairman of Worthing FC is part of the team the trial the console hire George Yeah Ma long time and space and you've got the ultimate Fifa gaming Avenue being chairman of a football club but when you had your accident a new left paralysed the did you think you would you carry on gaming League season the Xbox I certainly tried to like seeing Optimax then just wasn't possible for a long time so I was typing game you'd be something I could could still do a I am finding it very difficult for us to play we just stand control are the was I can hold the controller of or press the buzzer and their two small but Yeah it is hard to start your best need to tell a different and this you can tolerate this is what it is today it really I got when I first met was not a charity called especially taxing It made gaining excess form with some very clever people are adapting control
