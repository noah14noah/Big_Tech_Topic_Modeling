We`ll tell you why its stock plunged  almost 50 percent.  </p><p>  GHARIB: I`m Susie Gharib.  </p><p>  YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine.  Paul Kangas is off tonight.  This is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3.</p><p>  GHARIB: Good evening everyone.   Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson  today took aim at an avalanche of home foreclosures expected over the next  year.  Speaking at a housing conference in Washington, Paulson pressed the  mortgage lending industry to come up with a process to help struggling  borrowers stay in their homes.  As Stephanie Dhue reports, the Treasury  secretary thinks regulators and lenders can agree on a plan this week.  </p><p>  STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Losing  patience with rising foreclosures, Treasury Secretary Paulson is urging  lenders to set standards to quickly reprocess troubled loans.  But he  acknowledged the current industry effort, called Hope Now, isn`t a complete  solution.  </p><p>   HENRY PAULSON, TREASURY SECRETARY:  Nothing is worse than doing  nothing.  The Hope Now effort to streamline refinancings and modifications  is a positive step, but it is not a silver bullet.  </p><p>  DHUE: The modification plan focuses on borrowers who have been making  payments, but who will no longer be able to afford their mortgages once the  interest rates reset.  But analysts say mortgage workouts will only have a  modest impact on rising foreclosures and falling home prices.  </p><p>   FREDERICK CANNON, MANAGING DIR., KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS: It`s a  pretty narrow segment of people who can really be helped by these loan  modifications and the issues that we face in housing today in terms of the  impact of lower home prices and the impact on mortgages and mortgage  lending generally are going to be with us for quite some time.  </p><p>  DHUE: Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozillo says his firm will modify 75,000  sub-prime loans by the end of the year.  That`s about 10 percent of the  sub-prime loans on its books. He wants the government to do more to jump  start the market for mortgage-backed securities.  </p><p>   ANGELO MOZILLO, CEO, COUNTRYWIDE:  Holders of those securities who got  screwed are going to say, I`m not going to do this again.  Something is  going to have to happen to give them confidence to go back and take in  mortgage-backed securities.  </p><p>  DHUE: Mozillo called on regulators to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  purchase more loans in greater amounts.  But homebuilder Robert Toll  suggests regulators need to reassert themselves in the mortgage market.  </p><p>   ROBERT TOLL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, TOLL BROTHERS:  If you`re going to have  the secondary market back mortgages, you`re going to have to make those  mortgages more sound.  You can`t wish for the market to reassert itself.  You can`t wish, respectfully, for the providers to worry about their  reputation.  </p><p>  DHUE: Many economists now expect home prices to continue to decline  for the next year and until home prices reach a bottom, they say the market  for mortgage-backed securities will also struggle to find its footing.   Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.  </p><p>  YASTINE: Stock investors struggled to find their footing today in this  first day of December trading.  Winter months are typically good ones on  Wall Street.  But as Suzanne Pratt reports, there are a number of reasons  why this December could mean rough going for the stock market.  </p><p>  SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After a fairly  naughty November, stock investors are hoping for a nice December.  But some  market pros are concerned that Santa will skip Wall Street this year.   Standard &amp; Poor`s market strategist Alec Young believes volatility will  replace the typical year end run-up in stock prices, known as the Santa  Claus rally. </p><p>   ALEC YOUNG, MARKET STRATEGIST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Santa Claus rally  kind of implies that the market makes steady gains throughout the month of  December.  We don`t really see that.  We continue to see some choppiness.   But considering how bad things were a few weeks ago, I think a lot of  investors would be happy with a market that trades sideways for a little  while.  </p><p>  PRATT: Young believes investors will hold back because of worries  about the credit crunch and a recession in the U.S. economy.  </p><p>   YOUNG: Anything that we get from the government in terms of economic  data that reinforces the idea that the economy is weakening would be bad  for stocks.   Any news on the retailing front that the consumer is ready to pack it in  after years of continuing to spend, that that`s finally over, that would be  bad news for stocks.  </p><p>  PRATT: Others, however, believe a December rally is still a  possibility.  A look at past history certainly helps to make that case.   According to the \"Stock Traders Almanac,\" since 1950, December has been the  second best month of the year on Wall Street with the S&amp;P 500 gaining on  average 1.7 percent.  November has been the kindest month, returning  slightly more.  Russell Investment Group`s Stephen Wood says the December  11th Fed meeting, at which a cut in interest rates is widely expected,  could give stocks an added boost.  </p><p>   STEPHEN WOOD, PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENT GROUP:  Is it  going to be 25 basis points or 50 basis points? And equity markets are  going to like that.  So either way, equity markets are going to like it,  even though it`s inflationary.  So I think what you`re going to see is the  market`s moving now ahead of the Fed`s cut.  </p><p>  PRATT: In the last four decades, there have only been a handful of  years without a Santa Claus rally.  But it is interesting to note when  Santa has failed to show up, his absence sometimes precedes a bear market.   Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>  YASTINE: Traders may have to wait another day or two for Santa`s  arrival, because it sure wasn`t here today.  The Dow jumped about 30 points  through the morning session, reaching the 13,400 mark by midday.  But then  General Electric fell hard on an analyst downgrade.  Same for the NASDAQ,  where Research in Motion and some of the other big tech stocks dropped  sharply, Research in Motion on a downgrade.  The result: lower prices  across the board and the Dow settling out the day down 57.15 to 13,314.57  and the NASDAQ off 23.83 to 2637.13.  The S&amp;P 500 sliding 8.75 to 1472.42.   In the bond market, the 10-year note falling 27/32 to 103 9/32 and the  yield now down to 3.85 percent </p><p>  GHARIB: November was a turkey of a month for General Motors, the  nation`s biggest auto maker, but its rivals managed to hold their own.   Sales at GM fell 11 percent last month to 261,000 vehicles.  That drop came  despite solid gains in two key new models -- the newly redesigned Chevy  Malibu and the Cadillac CTS.  Ford Motor notched a slight sales gain, up  0.4 percent to 182,000 cars and trucks.  Even rival Toyota had a difficult  November, as consumers struggled with rising fuel prices and sliding home  values.  Its sales rose only 0.3 percent.  Chrysler sales fell 2 percent to  161,000 cars and trucks.  As Diane Eastabrook reports, U.S. auto companies  and dealers are looking ahead to next year with uncertainty.  </p><p>  DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Chevrolet  dealer Mark Scarpelli says he`s had a hard time keeping the new Chevy  Malibu in stock since it rolled into showrooms last month.  </p><p>  MARK SCARPELLI, CHEVROLET DEALER:  It`s General Motors anticipation  that they are going to sell 200,000 of these in 2008.  At the rate in which  we are all selling them I think they have underestimated the demand.  I  think it`s going to be a wonderful seller for them.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  If Scarpelli is right, the Malibu could be one of the few  bright spots for the U.S. auto industry next year.  Global Insight predicts  U.S. auto companies will sell about a half a million fewer vehicles next  year than this year.  Auto analyst George Magliano says rising mortgage  rates from sub-prime loans are primarily to blame.  </p><p>  GEORGE MAGLIANO, AUTO ANALYST, GLOBAL INSIGHT:  You see more and  more problems emanating out of sub-prime and more and more problems that  number one are going to cause money to be taken out of the consumers`  pocket.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK: Magliano says how auto companies respond to a more  challenging U.S. economy will determine how profitable they will be.   Incentives could be more prevalent.  General Motors for example recently  rolled out zero percent financing on remaining 2007 models and analysts  think it could be extended to poor performing 2008 models.  Magliano also  believes auto makers will tweak production plans more often next year based  on monthly sales numbers.  </p><p>   MAGLIANO: You have to restrict the flow of cars and trucks going into  the dealerships in order to keep the pricing at a reasonable level and in  order to hope to sell what you`re producing.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  While Scarpelli admits the auto industry faces some  potholes, he remains optimistic.  He thinks new union contracts and massive  restructurings will help the industry better navigate in a tougher economy.  </p><p>  SCARPELLI:  I think they are poised pretty well to be able to be much  more adaptable than they had been three years ago.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK: Industry watchers say the holiday shopping season could be  a good indicator as to how vehicle sales perform next year.  They think if  consumers opt to buy big ticket items this holiday shopping season, they  might opt to buy cars and light trucks next year.  Diane Eastabrook,  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>  GHARIB: AT&amp;T is hanging up its pay phone business.  The company  announced today that after 129 years, it`s getting out of the pay phone  business.  It`s a sign of the times as more people are using cell phones.   AT&amp;T said there were more than 2.5 million pay phones in the U.S. in 1998.   That number has fallen to a million phones this year while wireless users  have quadrupled in the past decade.  But Jeff, public telephones aren`t  completely disappearing. AT&amp;T is selling its pay phone operations to  independent contractors.  </p><p>  YASTINE: Some of those new pay phones are offering users high-tech  features that allow them to surf the Internet and check email for about  $0.25 a minute.  </p><p>  So now let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.  </p><p>  And General Electric (GE) topping our list tonight, dropping $1.36.  Citigroup lowering its profit forecast and price target for GE.  The  analyst sees pressure on GE`s consumer finance unit and a tougher  marketplace for sales at GE`s health care division. And earlier today, NBC  Universal said it would start buying two hour blocks of programming from  outside producers of prime time documentaries because the programming costs  a lot less than scripted programs or even network reality shows.</p><p>       There`s Citigroup (C) giving back $0.24.</p><p>       Invesco ADR (IVZ) rising $0.98, the company moving to simplify its  corporate structure. It will eliminate its dual listing on the London Stock  Exchange.</p><p>Countrywide Financial (CFC) also easing back $0.14.</p><p>       And then Ford Motor Co (F) dropping $0.26 and as you heard, the auto  maker posting a modest November sales gain. Analysts were expecting a  decline.</p><p>  Pfizer (PFE) off $0.21.</p><p>       EMC Corp (EMC) dropping $0.23.</p><p>       ExxonMobil (XOM) off $0.31.</p><p>       Motorola (MOT) losing $0.54.</p><p>       And then Bank of America (BAC) dropping $0.66.</p><p>   General Motors (GM) falling $1.22. As mentioned a moment ago, a  disappointing 11 percent drop in auto sales. GM also not offering as many  sales incentives to prospective car buyers compared to Ford or Chrysler.</p><p>  And while we`re on the subject of autos, Lehman Brothers will a  cautious note on auto parts suppliers with many anticipating large  production cutbacks at the auto makers next year.  American Axle &amp; Mfg  (AXL), Johnson Controls (JCI), Tenneco (TEN) all being cut back themselves  in terms of their stock prices.</p><p>  IBM (IBM) gaining $0.65. The company boosting its stock buyback  program by up to $1 billion.</p><p>  And the big loser of the day, Verifone Holdings (PAY) nose diving $2.   Accounting errors mean Verifone will have to postpone announcing its fourth  quarter and full year results.</p><p>  Nokia (NOK) rising $0.93. The Finnish phone giant says it`s gaining  market share in India. That`s the second largest cell phone market globally  behind China.</p><p>  And then Fannie Mae (FNM) down $2.17.  Goldman Sachs cutting its  earnings targets on a belief the write downs for the fourth quarter will be  equally as large as those in the third quarter. </p><p>  MBIA (MBI) falling $2.63.  Analysts at Bank of America taking a knife  to earnings estimates there due to a drop in new production and earned  premiums.</p><p>  On the NASDAQ, Apple (AAPL) dropping $3.36.  Klausner Technologies  filing $365 million patent infringement lawsuit against the iPhone maker.</p><p>       Research in Motion (RIMM) sliding over $9.  Morgan Keegan downgrading  the shares of the Blackberry maker on valuation, thinking the stock`s  gotten a little ahead of itself.</p><p>       Google (GOOG) off nearly $11.50.</p><p>       Microsoft (MSFT) down $0.68.</p><p>       Baidu.com (BIDU), it never seems to go down.  It rose $3.29 today.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) falling $0.45.</p><p>       Intel (INTC) though gaining $0.17.</p><p>       Dell (DELL) off $0.60.</p><p>       First Solar (FSLR) down nearly $8.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM) dropping $0.82.</p><p>   Activision (ATVI) jumping nearly $3. How do you say guitar hero in  French?   The maker of the hugely popular Guitar Hero video game being  bought by France`s Vivendi for $27.50 a share, $1.7 billion.  The new  company combines Vivendi`s own video game unit and it`ll be called  Activision Blizzard.</p><p>UAP Holding Co (UAPH) soaring more than $8.  The seller of seeds,  fertilizer, farm chemicals, being bought by Agrium for $39 a share, about  $2.6 billion.</p><p>  And Merrill Lynch boosting its price target on some several fertilizer  companies because of that hook up. Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF), Mosaic  Co (MOS) and Potash (POT) all sprouting nicely higher.</p><p>   Another buyout deal, Cohesant Technologies (COHT) being bought by a  Minneapolis firm, Graco for $35 million or $9 a share in cash. Graco will  keep just one division, GlasCraft, and spin off all the rest of Cohesant`s  unit. That stock rising $3 or nearly $3 today.</p><p>  Those are our stocks in the news tonight.  Susie.</p><p>  GHARIB: Well, Jeff, the U.S. economy is not the only one taking a hit  from sub-prime loan losses.  The mortgage woes are also hurting Japanese  banks and insurance companies.  While the problems in Japan aren`t on par  with the carnage seen in the U.S. and Europe, the situation is hardly  cheering.  As Lucy Craft reports, sub-prime fallout is just one of many  headwinds buffeting the world`s second biggest economy.  </p><p>  LUCY CRAFT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The good news --  at least if the latest figures released by Japanese financial institutions  accurately reflect the extent of their losses -- is that Japan may have  escaped the worst of the sub-prime debacle.  The total damage so far comes  to $11 billion spread across 10 banking groups, says KBS Securities banking  expert Kristine Li.  </p><p>   KRISTINE LI, BANKING ANALYST, KBS SECURITIES TOKYO:  I still think the  direct exposure of the Japanese banks is still quite small, (INAUDIBLE)  this $11 billion exposure.  It`s probably less than 1 percent of their  total loans and this is much smaller than their global competitors, like  U.S. banks, European banks, even Chinese banks.  </p><p>  CRAFT: The bad news is that sub-prime exposure could be the least of  Japanese banks` problems nowadays.  Much of the reason Japanese financial  sector profits are stagnant right now, foreign experts charge, is self- inflicted damage -- Japanese policy makers shooting themselves in the foot.   Take a hastily enacted new law aimed at shielding consumers that has ended  up squashing investment.  Robert Feldman is an economist with Morgan  Stanley.  </p><p>   ROBERT FELDMAN, SR ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY JAPAN:   If you want to  say, buy a foreign investment fund here, there is a huge amount of red tape  that is wrapped around your application.  For that, you have to go through  the application every time. It`s a very long, complicated explanation  process.  And so the purchases of those instruments have fallen very  sharply.  Capital outflows have slowed and the yen is stronger.  </p><p>  CRAFT: Another poorly executed new law, intended to make buildings  earthquake-safe, has sent construction into a tailspin.  KBS Securities`  Kristine Li says new housing starts have been slashed almost in half, year  on year.  </p><p>   LI:  Mortgage growth had been strong until recently, but we had a new  construction code and new housing starts collapsed and this certainly hurt  mortgage growth.  We`re looking for some big decline in the second half.  </p><p>  CRAFT: Japan`s policy missteps, compounded with the specter of a  slowing American market on which Japan so heavily depends for selling its  exports, could bring down the curtain at last on Japan`s record, six-year- long growth streak, says Jesper Koll, head of Tantallon Research Japan.  </p><p>   JESPER KOLL, PRESIDENT, TANTALLON RESEARCH JAPAN:  Unfortunately the  risk of a recession in Japan is now very high.  We`ve got domestic demand  that is being derailed by some policy tightening by the politicians.  On  top of that, we now have the hit to exports that is coming from the  slowdown in the United States economy.  So unfortunately, zero growth in  2008 is a good working assumption for Japan.  </p><p>  CRAFT: Foreign investors have been the biggest players in the Tokyo  stock market, but many are writing off Japan nowadays to focus on other  parts of Asia.  With an array of risks aside from the sub-prime crisis  hanging over the Japanese economy, the Tokyo stock market is bracing for a  bearish 2008.  Lucy Craft, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Tokyo.  </p><p>  YASTINE: Tomorrow, from housing to hiring to corporate profits, we`ll  get the economic outlook from the Business Roundtable.  </p><p>  GHARIB: Federal prosecutors may call Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren  Buffett as a witness in the criminal trial of former officers of  Berkshire`s general reinsurance unit.  Prosecutors filed court papers today  listing Buffett as a government witness, as jury selection got underway.   Four former General Re officers were indicted last year in an alleged  scheme to help American International Group inflate its books.  </p><p>  YASTINE: Jeweler Tiffany and Company is taking a fourth quarter charge  of $20 million as part of a new deal with Swatch.  In an SEC filing,  Tiffany said the charge is tied to discontinuing some of its existing watch  collections.  Under the new partnership, Swatch will develop and distribute  Tiffany watches.  Swatch will own the new entity and Tiffany will share in  its profit.  </p><p>  GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator says maybe a recession wouldn`t be so  bad.  He`s Bernard Baumohl, director of the Economic Outlook Group.  </p><p>  BERNARD BAUMOHL, DIRECTOR, ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP: Here`s a question  that may bring cries of heresy, is a recession bad for the economy? Many  forecasters see such a downturn in 2008.  But would a recession further  devastate an economy already reeling from a failing housing market and a  damaged financial sector? Or is it just the right medicine this economy  needs to cure its ills and hasten a healthy recovery? </p><p>  I believe a recession may actually be beneficial this time and here`s  why.  Recessions are a natural and vital part of a business cycle.  After  all, consumers and business leaders sometimes make mistakes and  occasionally these mistakes are big enough to bring on a recession.  </p><p>  One drag on the economy today is the housing sector, which is  suffering a slow bleed.  The drip-by-drip fall in home prices and tougher  refinancing rules only deepen the housing debacle.  A recession however  would permit interest rates to fall more aggressively and this can lure  homebuyers back much sooner.  Moreover, financial institutions burdened by  sub-prime assets may write them off more quickly under the cover of  recession and thus improve their balance sheets.  </p><p>  Of course, recessions are not painless.  Some lenders and hedge funds  may go under.  But the economy now looks like a train wreck moving in slow  motion.  A recession could purge the country of its real estate excesses  and bad debt more rapidly and allow the economy to emerge from this mess  faster and much sounder.  I`m Bernard Baumohl.  </p><p>  YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, a weak start to the week on  Wall Street.  The Dow dropping 57 points. The NASDAQ lost 23.

The  world`s oldest surviving Rolls-Royce drove into the record books today  becoming the most expensive vintage car ever auctioned.  The price tag,  more than $7 million.  The 1904 two-seater was the fourth car ever produced  by Charles Royce -- excuse me, Charles Rolls and Frederick Royce.  The car  was expected to sell for about $2 million but interest from around the  world accelerated the price of the bids and the buyer is a British  collector.  And Susie, believe it or not, the car is still drivable and has  a top speed of 40 miles per hour.  </p><p>  GHARIB: Forty miles, take me on a ride in that classy vehicle.  </p><p>  YASTINE: You can`t have too many cars going that far these days.   That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 3.  We want to remind  you this is the time of year your public television station seeks your  support.  </p><p>  GHARIB: Support that makes programs like NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT  possible.  </p><p>  YASTINE: Thanks for joining us and again, don`t forget to support your  public television station.

I'm Susie Gharib. Tom is off tonight. The nation's mood improves. Consumer sentiment hits a three-month high and that's despite rising gas prices. But tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest is predicting a major sell- off for stocks. He's Frank Cochrane of Investment Timing Consultants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we head to Houston for an update on efforts to get oil production back on track in the Gulf of Mexico. That and more tonight on NBR.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Americans are feeling a little bit better about the U.S. economy. The latest survey of consumer sentiment improved unexpectedly in August. The overall sentiment index compiled by Thomson-Reuters and the University of Michigan ticked up to 73.6. This is its highest level since May. Consumer sentiment is almost 20 points higher than it was a year ago and economist Drew Matus says he knows what's behind that optimism.</p><p>DREW MATUS, SR. U.S. ECONOMIST, UBS: I think the main reason consumers might be feeling more positive is the fact that initial claims have been going down so fewer and fewer consumers are filing for unemployment insurance. So they may still be having trouble finding work if they're unemployed, but for people who have a job, they're less worried that they're going to lose it.</p><p>GHARIB: Another report today confirmed that optimism. The Conference Board's leading economic indicators improved more than expected in July. It's a key gauge of how the economy is expected to do for the next three to six months. All that led to modest gains on Wall Street. The Dow rose 25 points. The NASDAQ added 14 and the S&amp;P inched up two points. For the week, the major averages closed on the upside for the sixth week in a row. Today's gains in stock prices came in spite of very low trading volume, both at the NASDAQ and here at the big board. Summer doldrums are a big factor of course. But the drop in trading volume goes way beyond seasonal factors. Suzanne Pratt has that story.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mid August on Wall Street and it's really no surprise that trading volume at the New York Stock Exchange is so light. After all, it seems nearly everyone is on vacation. But, even after accounting for all the hedge fund guys and traders enjoying the Hamptons, volume is anemic. Sure, tourists are plentiful outside the exchange, but inside on the floor, it's downright dull. No matter how you measure it, August volume is well below the buying and selling we've seen in previous Augusts. Wall Street veteran Teddy Weisberg says it's nothing new.</p><p>TEDDY WEISBERG, TRADER, SEAPORT SECURITIES: It seems unusually light. But, I would remind the viewers that the volume really has been light almost since this rally began going back to February or March of 2009. There has been a lack of participation I think on the part of the public. We see in at Seaport on a daily basis.</p><p>PRATT: And, it's no wonder the retail public is out of the stock market. From a Ponzi scheme masterminded by Bernie Madoff to Facebook's failed public offering, average investors feel they can't possibly win.</p><p>WEISBERG: I think folks are just nervous and scared. It's not a matter of not wanting to spend the money or not having the money. I think they've just simply have adopted this bunker mentality.</p><p>PRATT: Still, even with all the investor anxiety, stocks have had a decent summer. Since its low in early June, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10 percent. So why give a hoot about low volume? Sure, with fewer customers, traders make less money. But, low volume can also mean more volatility, which can be dangerous.</p><p>WAYNE KAUFMAN, MKT. STRATEGIST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL: What it does is it does create the possibility of exaggerated moves to the downside. The market can drop precipitously. The average retail guy doesn't want to live through that anymore.</p><p>PRATT: The exact same thing can be said for spikes higher. Give the market some positive news and we could certainly see an exaggerated rally. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on the program, from low trading volumes to political uncertainty, \"Market Monitor\" guest Frank Cochrane explains why he's bearish on stocks now.</p><p>Oil prices hit a three-month high of $96 a barrel today and gas prices are up nearly $0.30 in the past month alone. Today a White House spokesperson confirmed that a release from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve is quote, an option that is on the table, adding that the Obama administration continues to monitor the global oil market and will share its findings with other world powers. But oil traders doubt the U.S. will release emergency reserves.</p><p>JOHN WOODS, PRES., JJ WOODS &amp; ASSOCIATES: It was almost like a carrot that the Obama administration was going to say, all right, we might do this. So, let's say you get towards November and the race is tight, you release it. But I mean that's not going to affect that market immediately. Really what we're looking at is what's happening between Iran and Israel. That's our focal point right now.</p><p>GHARIB: With tensions escalating in the Middle East, there's renewed emphasis on growing U.S. oil supplies. It's been more than two years since an explosion on BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig caused millions of barrels of crude to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Andrew Schneider of KUHF, Houston public radio, reports on the drilling industry's efforts to get Gulf production back on track.</p><p>ANDREW SCHNEIDER, KUHF CORRESPONDENT: These drilling rigs behind me are undergoing repair, waiting for the orders that will send them back out into the Gulf of Mexico. Those orders are only now returning to the levels they saw before the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p><p>The April 20th Macondo blowout back in 2010 triggered the biggest oil spill ever in U.S. waters. The Obama administration imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling that lasted more than four months. Even after the moratorium ended, permits were hard to come by. That hurt drilling everywhere in the Gulf, shallow water as well as deep. Jim Noe is the senior vice president and general counsel for Hercules Offshore (NASDAQ:HERO).</p><p>JIM NOE, SR. VP &amp; GEN. COUNSEL, HERCULES OFFSHORE: What used to take about 50 days from the initial time you submitted an application is now well over 200 days to get permits back. So there's still some challenges.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Those delays made many companies reluctant to move back into the Gulf. Michelle Foss is chief energy economist at the University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology.</p><p>MICHELLE FOSS, CHIEF ENERGY ECON., BUREAU/ECONOMIC GEOLOGY, UNIV. OF TEXAS/AUSTIN: Time is money, so anything that happens that lengthens the amount of time that it takes to get projects done increases the cost and that cost gets translated directly into the market.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: But Ian McPherson of investment bank Simmons &amp; Company says, when it comes to attracting drilling, the Gulf still has a lot in its favor. He says within two to three years, more than 40 rigs will be operating in the Gulf, well above pre-Macondo levels.</p><p>IAN MCPHERSON, DIR. OF RESEARCH, SIMMONS &amp; COMPANY: When you compare it to Brazil or a lot of these African markets, which have great geology unto themselves, but they don't necessarily have the infrastructure or the human capital access or frankly the fiscal or regulatory stability that the U.S. has. So, no, life is not as easy here as it used to be, but on a relative basis globally, it's still an attractive place to business.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: One sign that oil companies are growing more optimistic about drilling in the central Gulf: a successful auction of oil and gas leases. In June, the Interior Department held its first lease sale since the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Bids totaled a much better than expected $1.7 billion. Andrew Schneider, NBR, Houston.</p><p>GHARIB: Nine out of every 10 new mortgages now come from Federal agencies or the Federally controlled mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. To make sure Fannie and Freddie can keep those loans flowing, the government is changing the terms of the deal it struck when it took control of the two mortgage giants. As Darren Gersh explains, the move is designed to reassure nervous markets.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal government has pumped in $190 billion to keep Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac afloat. But that money came with a price, a 10 percent dividend payment. The only problem is, Fannie and Freddie have been borrowing from the Treasury to pay the Treasury back.</p><p>KAREN PETROU, MNG. DIR., FEDERAL FINANCIAL ANALYTICS: Each year, they have to come up with $19 billion in dividends, which, when you're not making much money, is hard to do. So they have been borrowing money to pay the dividends to borrow the money to pay the dividends.</p><p>GERSH: To end that spiral, instead of a dividend, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will now simply give the Treasury everything they earn. The move is timely, because at the end of the year, the mortgage giants' unlimited backstop from the Treasury will expire. Next year, they'll have to make do with a credit line of $210 billion.</p><p>PETROU: They still have a $210 billion backstop. But they're huge. Their total obligations are about $5.5 trillion. And in that scale, it's not as much as it seems and it's certainly a lot less than unlimited.</p><p>GERSH: The Treasury is also pushing the mortgage giants to get smaller, faster by winding down their massive investment portfolios by 15 percent a year. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: The former head of failed brokerage firm PFG Best pleaded not guilty to lying to regulators. Russell Wasendorf, Sr. is</p><p>facing 31 fraud counts for allegedly cooking his firm's books and defrauding investors for two decades. The plea today came despite the suicide note that Wasendorf left with a detailed confession when he attempted suicide on July 9. He's scheduled for trial in late October. If convicted, he could spend up to 150 years in prison.</p><p>Liberty Media is getting serious about taking over Sirius XM radio. CEO John Malone is asking the Federal Communications Commission for approval to take over the satellite radio company by boosting its stake to more than 50 percent. Earlier this week, Liberty disclosed that it recently upped its stake in Sirius to 48 percent. If the regulator approves, Liberty could take over in less than 60 days and would have the power to replace management at Sirius.</p><p>On Wall Street today, a small but positive finish on this slow summer Friday. The Dow, the NASDAQ and S&amp;P all rose. And for people keeping score, the S&amp;P 500 just missed closing above its four-year high by a single point. Technology, industrials and retail -- three economically sensitive sectors --were winners in today's session and for the week.</p><p>Let's start with tech darling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which hit a fresh all-time high. Investors are getting more excited about the possibility of a new iPhone-5 and a new mini-iPad in September. Brokerage firm Jefferies hiked its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to $900. And today Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed above $648 a share.</p><p>More skepticism today about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The stock lost another 4 percent, falling to $19. That's half of the initial public offering price. Investors are still concerned about Facebook's ability to boost revenue and make money from mobile customers. Today's decline comes on top of heavy selling yesterday after the expiration of that so-called lock-up period that we told you about.</p><p>Another big tech decliner, Marvell Technology. The chip maker's second quarter profits came in lower than expected. It also guided down estimates for the third quarter, blaming slower growth in its mobile phone chips business in China. The shares fell 14 percent to $10.54. The stock is down almost 40 percent in the last six months. Marvell wasn't the only tech company feeling pain today. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) also got slammed, down as much as 10 percent, but it recovered some ground closing at $4.75 a share. Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) cut its price target on the shares to $3.</p><p>Lots of big movers in the retail sector today. Women's apparel retailer Ann Inc. beat Wall Street forecasts for the eighth quarter in a row, as sales soared at its Ann Taylor and Loft Stores. The company is also seeing more full-price purchases. Shares jumped 20 percent to just under $34. That's the highest level in nearly five years, as the company nudged up its full year sales forecast.</p><p>Gap (NYSE:GPS) was also a winner, because it also raised its full year profit guidance. That good news came on top of a gain of nearly 30 percent in second quarter earnings, helped by good fashion picks and lean inventories. Investors are optimistic the retailer is on a comeback, after struggling for years to reclaim its fashion status. The shares closed up almost 5 percent.</p><p>A very different situation at Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO) which posted a 98 percent drop in second quarter earnings. It also issued a third quarter profit forecast that was below Wall Street expectations and that's due to soft back-to-school sales. The stock fell 11 percent.</p><p>Now on to a pair of sporting good chains moving in opposite directions. Both reported better than expected second quarter earnings. Athletic footwear chain Footlocker (NYSE:FL) also reported higher sales, so its shares rose nearly 2 percent. Hibbett Sports (NASDAQ:HIBB) fell 4 percent as revenues missed Wall Street's target.</p><p>But that decline was nothing compared to the huge drop in shares of oilfield services firm Ion Geophysical (NYSE:IO). The shares plunged 11 percent after a Federal jury ruled against in a patent suit. Ion has been ordered to pay nearly $106 million to a Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) subsidiary. That stock closed down $0.20.</p><p>And, finally, a story for all you peanut butter and jelly lovers. Shares of JM Smucker -- maker of its namesake jelly and Jiff peanut butter -- jumped 5 percent today to nearly $83 a share. The company reported better than expected earnings and forecast strong growth for the rest of the year, as price cuts helped to win back customers who traded down to cheaper brands.</p><p>Another strong day of gains for the most active ETFs, except for the Ishares emerging markets. And that's tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Despite the recent market gains, our \"Market Monitor\" tonight is calling for a major stock market correction. He's Frank Cochrane, president of Investment Timing Consultants. Frank, why are you so bearish?</p><p>FRANK COCHRANE, PRES., INVESTMENT TIMING CONSULTANTS: Well first of all, the rally that we've seen over the last six weeks or so, the sirens (ph) of central banking with Bernanke and so on, have really done a marvelous job in giving a great levitation activist to this market which I think is totally unfounded. If you look at the employment picture which is 8.3 percent, participation rate at 63 percent, today, for example, the BLS announced that 44 states had higher unemployment than the previous month in June.</p><p>These are not things that are a good foundation for the economy to do well. Economic statistics are, you know, one month up, one month down, but overall the trend I think is lower and if you look at the amount of money that the government and the Fed has thrown at this economy over the past four years, growth is really, really pathetic. We are $16 trillion in debt, $800 billion thrown in by the government. It's just -- that combined with the fact that the election's coming up, I think it will be something that will cause people to sit on their hands, wait, and then if I look at the technicals of the market, they're extremely weak as well. The participation, the advanced decline line, new highs, new lows, everything is contracting in this advance and, you know, the thing is, it's not something where longer term, I think -- I really think we've hit an apex here and the market will hit a wall. If we haven't already, we will certainly over the next week or two.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's talk a little bit about timing here. When do you think that this correction is going to happen and how serious? How deep is it going to be? How big a correction?</p><p>COCHRANE: I'm looking for something on the short term, as I mentioned, going into the election I think, maybe into the middle of November, so the next say, three months, starting at any time and I think anywhere from 15 to 20 percent is not out of the realm of possibilities.</p><p>GHARIB: That's pretty big. That's a pretty big correction.</p><p>COCHRANE: It will be huge. It will be fast. It will be furious and it will be scary, but we may hit a bottom some time and then grudgingly go up towards the end of the year into the spring. I think the next two, three, months could be very interesting for the bears.</p><p>GHARIB: This is going to be a very difficult time for investors if you are right and you're saying that investors should get out of stocks, get out of equities and put their money into 10-year Treasuries and also two-year notes. Tell us why.</p><p>COCHRANE: Well, the -- you know, the 10 year, first of all, has gone from a low on the 22nd of July to, say, 138 up to 181 today. This is a gift. I would buy into -- buy into that. That, coincidentally happened with Mario Draghi's comment, which respect, we'll throw anything at this market. We'll do whatever it takes to get things done at the ECB. So we saw lower rates then. I think that's good. As far as the two year, I would be very, very liquid going into this -- into the next few months. Money markets, two-year notes, 10-year notes, that type of thing and make a shopping list when this decline occurs. Capital preservation I think will be key.</p><p>GHARIB: You're also recommending an ETF, ticker symbol TEIX (ph). This is a way for investors to hedge against market volatility. Tell us why you like this ETF.</p><p>COCHRANE: The chart on that looks like Niagara Falls. In fact it almost looks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). This is a very low-price ETF and I think if the volatility picks up and we hit new lows today over the course of the short duration that I'm talking about, there should be some good percentage gains in that ETF. This is a short-term trade. This is not something to fall in love with and I would certainly use some type of ...</p><p>GHARIB: It's not a \"buy\" and \"hold.\"</p><p>COCHRANE: .10 or 50 percent. That's correct. And I would definitely be out of it by some time early to mid-November at the latest.</p><p>GHARIB: Any disclosures, Frank? Do you own this ETF?</p><p>COCHRANE: That particular one, no, not at this time. From time to time we do trade in and out of that.</p><p>GHARIB: All right, thanks a lot. We really appreciate your insights. Our \"Market Monitor tonight,\" Frank Cochrane. He's president of the Investment Timing Consultants.</p><p>While the clock is ticking for the fiscal cliff deadline, tonight's commentator says lawmakers will soon have a bigger worry. He's Russ Koesterich, Ishares investment strategist at Blackrock and author of \"The Ten Trillion Dollar Gamble.\"</p><p>RUSS KOESTERICH, GLOBAL CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, BLACKROCK ISHARES: . have resigned themselves to another year or two of sluggish growth. There's little to suggest that the market anticipates another one to two decades in the slow lane. Yet, this could be what the future holds. The problem is the Federal debt. If present conditions hold, publicly traded Federal debt will hit 90 percent of GDP by 2022 and exceed 109 percent, the previous all-time high, by 2026. History shows debt levels that high can reduce long-term economic growth rates by one third and the drag on growth can last two decades or more.</p><p>These realities will become clear during the next presidential term. If the next administration can't start making a dent in the nation's fiscal position, investors may need to reconsider the long-term argument for U.S. stocks or at least demand a bigger discount before committing new capital. From the fiscal cliff to the Federal government's long-term solvency, the markets are unlikely to permit endless procrastination. Ultimately, if the U.S. continues to stumble along with an indecisive government, Europe may no longer be the biggest problem child in the global economy. I'm Russ Koesterich.</p><p>GHARIB: Coming up all next week on NBR, we take a closer look at the fiscal cliff: what it all means for the nation's economy and you. We talk about fixing the debt with former Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles. We check in with doctors who worry their life-saving research could be on the line if the sequester isn't stopped. And then on Monday, we meet a small town defense contractor counting on lawmakers to keep its business strong.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, we end with a few thoughts on the big win in little rewards. Here's author and educator Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: I hate to admit it, but I'm now at that awkward age. It's the age where you read food before you eat food! Does it have enough of this? Does it have too much of that? I guess the days are gone when I could chase three pieces of pepperoni pizza with a bag of Krispy Kremes. As I think of the organizations I have worked for and the ones I now speak to, I do think there is a vitamin deficiency in many of our working people. I think they lack vitamin \"P\" -- the praise vitamin.</p><p>I was speaking at a conference and I posed this question: what's the number one thing you hear when you've done a good job? I looked expectantly across the room of 300 people and nobody offered an answer. Finally, one woman up front said: that's what we hear -- nothing! Though the room burst into nervous laughter, it wasn't because anybody thought that was funny. Author Michael Leboeuf (ph) says it's pretty simple: the things that get rewarded get repeated. We seem to know this with little children and then we seem to forget it when it comes to adults.</p><p>The best managers I've worked for have handled praise this way. It's precise, it's periodic and it's personal. It recognizes a specific act. It isn't given once and never again. It is directed specifically to one individual and helps that person see how their exact contribution is appreciated. Things feeling a little puny around your place of business? Maybe your people have a vitamin \"P\" deficiency. You can fix that. I'm Lou Heckler.</p><p>GHARIB: And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday, August 17.

I'm Susie Gharib.  Tom is off tonight.  The nation's mood improves.   Consumer sentiment hits a three-month high and that's despite rising gas  prices.  But tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest is predicting a major sell- off for stocks.  He's Frank Cochrane of Investment Timing Consultants.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  And we head to Houston for an update on efforts to get oil production  back on track in the Gulf of Mexico.  That and more tonight on NBR.  </p><p/><p>  Americans are feeling a little bit better about the U.S. economy.  The  latest survey of consumer sentiment improved unexpectedly in August.  The  overall sentiment index compiled by Thomson-Reuters and the University of  Michigan ticked up to 73.6.  This is its highest level since May.  Consumer  sentiment is almost 20 points higher than it was a year ago and economist  Drew Matus says he knows what's behind that optimism.  </p><p/><p>  DREW MATUS, SR. U.S. ECONOMIST, UBS:  I think the main reason  consumers might be feeling more positive is the fact that initial claims  have been going down so fewer and fewer consumers are filing for  unemployment insurance.  So they may still be having trouble finding work  if they're unemployed, but for people who have a job, they're less worried  that they're going to lose it.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Another report today confirmed that optimism.  The Conference  Board's leading economic indicators improved more than expected in July.   It's a key gauge of how the economy is expected to do for the next three to  six months.  All that led to modest gains on Wall Street.  The Dow rose 25  points.  The NASDAQ added 14 and the S&amp;P inched up two points.  For the  week, the major averages closed on the upside for the sixth week in a row.   Today's gains in stock prices came in spite of very low trading volume,  both at the NASDAQ and here at the big board.  Summer doldrums are a big  factor of course.  But the drop in trading volume goes way beyond seasonal  factors.  Suzanne Pratt has that story.  </p><p/><p>  SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mid August on  Wall Street and it's really no surprise that trading volume at the New York  Stock Exchange is so light.  After all, it seems nearly everyone is on  vacation.  But, even after accounting for all the hedge fund guys and  traders enjoying the Hamptons, volume is anemic.  Sure, tourists are  plentiful outside the exchange, but inside on the floor, it's downright  dull.  No matter how you measure it, August volume is well below the buying  and selling we've seen in previous Augusts.  Wall Street veteran Teddy  Weisberg says it's nothing new.  </p><p/><p>  TEDDY WEISBERG, TRADER, SEAPORT SECURITIES:  It seems unusually light.   But, I would remind the viewers that the volume really has been light  almost since this rally began going back to February or March of 2009.   There has been a lack of participation I think on the part of the public.   We see in at Seaport on a daily basis.  </p><p/><p>  PRATT:  And, it's no wonder the retail public is out of the stock  market.  From a Ponzi scheme masterminded by Bernie Madoff to Facebook's  failed public offering, average investors feel they can't possibly win.  </p><p/><p>  WEISBERG:  I think folks are just nervous and scared.  It's not a  matter of not wanting to spend the money or not having the money.  I think  they've just simply have adopted this bunker mentality.  </p><p/><p>  PRATT:  Still, even with all the investor anxiety, stocks have had a  decent summer.  Since its low in early June, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10  percent.  So why give a hoot about low volume?  Sure, with fewer customers,  traders make less money.  But, low volume can also mean more volatility,  which can be dangerous.  </p><p/><p>  WAYNE KAUFMAN, MKT. STRATEGIST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL:  What it does  is it does create the possibility of exaggerated moves to the downside.   The market can drop precipitously.  The average retail guy doesn't want to  live through that anymore.  </p><p/><p>  PRATT:  The exact same thing can be said for spikes higher.  Give the  market some positive news and we could certainly see an exaggerated rally.   Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Still ahead on the program, from low trading volumes to  political uncertainty, \"Market Monitor\" guest Frank Cochrane explains why  he's bearish on stocks now.  </p><p/><p>  Oil prices hit a three-month high of $96 a barrel today and gas prices  are up nearly $0.30 in the past month alone.  Today a White House  spokesperson confirmed that a release from the U.S. strategic petroleum  reserve is quote, an option that is on the table, adding that the Obama  administration continues to monitor the global oil market and will share  its findings with other world powers.  But oil traders doubt the U.S. will  release emergency reserves.  </p><p/><p>  JOHN WOODS, PRES., JJ WOODS &amp; ASSOCIATES:  It was almost like a carrot  that the Obama administration was going to say, all right, we might do  this.  So, let's say you get towards November and the race is tight, you  release it.  But I mean that's not going to affect that market immediately.  Really what we're looking at is what's happening between Iran and Israel.   That's our focal point right now.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  With tensions escalating in the Middle East, there's renewed  emphasis on growing U.S. oil supplies.  It's been more than two years since  an explosion on BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig caused millions of  barrels of crude to spill into the Gulf of Mexico.  Andrew Schneider of  KUHF, Houston public radio, reports on the drilling industry's efforts to  get Gulf production back on track.  </p><p/><p>  ANDREW SCHNEIDER, KUHF CORRESPONDENT:  These drilling rigs behind me  are undergoing repair, waiting for the orders that will send them back out  into the Gulf of Mexico.  Those orders are only now returning to the levels  they saw before the Deepwater Horizon disaster.  </p><p/><p>  The April 20th Macondo blowout back in 2010 triggered the biggest oil  spill ever in U.S. waters.  The Obama administration imposed a moratorium  on deepwater drilling that lasted more than four months.  Even after the  moratorium ended, permits were hard to come by.  That hurt drilling  everywhere in the Gulf, shallow water as well as deep.  Jim Noe is the  senior vice president and general counsel for Hercules Offshore  (NASDAQ:HERO).  </p><p/><p>  JIM NOE, SR. VP &amp; GEN. COUNSEL, HERCULES OFFSHORE:  What used to take  about 50 days from the initial time you submitted an application is now  well over 200 days to get permits back.  So there's still some challenges.  </p><p/><p>  SCHNEIDER:   Those delays made many companies reluctant to move back  into the Gulf.  Michelle Foss is chief energy economist at the University  of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology.  </p><p/><p>  MICHELLE FOSS, CHIEF ENERGY ECON., BUREAU/ECONOMIC GEOLOGY, UNIV. OF  TEXAS/AUSTIN:  Time is money, so anything that happens that lengthens the  amount of time that it takes to get projects done increases the cost and  that cost gets translated directly into the market.  </p><p/><p>  SCHNEIDER:  But Ian McPherson of investment bank Simmons &amp; Company  says, when it comes to attracting drilling, the Gulf still has a lot in its  favor.  He says within two to three years, more than 40 rigs will be  operating in the Gulf, well above pre-Macondo levels.  </p><p/><p>  IAN MCPHERSON, DIR. OF RESEARCH, SIMMONS &amp; COMPANY:  When you compare  it to Brazil or a lot of these African markets, which have great geology  unto themselves, but they don't necessarily have the infrastructure or the  human capital access or frankly the fiscal or regulatory stability that the  U.S. has.  So, no, life is not as easy here as it used to be, but on a  relative basis globally, it's still an attractive place to business.  </p><p/><p>  SCHNEIDER:  One sign that oil companies are growing more optimistic  about drilling in the central Gulf:  a successful auction of oil and gas  leases.  In June, the Interior Department held its first lease sale since  the Deepwater Horizon explosion.  Bids totaled a much better than expected  $1.7 billion.  Andrew Schneider, NBR, Houston.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB: Nine out of every 10 new mortgages now come from Federal  agencies or the Federally controlled mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac.  To make sure Fannie and Freddie can keep those loans flowing, the  government is changing the terms of the deal it struck when it took control  of the two mortgage giants.  As Darren Gersh explains, the move is designed  to reassure nervous markets.  </p><p/><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal  government has pumped in $190 billion to keep Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  afloat.  But that money came with a price, a 10 percent dividend payment.   The only problem is, Fannie and Freddie have been borrowing from the  Treasury to pay the Treasury back.  </p><p/><p>  KAREN PETROU, MNG. DIR., FEDERAL FINANCIAL ANALYTICS:  Each year, they  have to come up with $19 billion in dividends, which, when you're not  making much money, is hard to do.  So they have been borrowing money to pay  the dividends to borrow the money to pay the dividends.  </p><p/><p>  GERSH:  To end that spiral, instead of a dividend, Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac will now simply give the Treasury everything they earn.  The  move is timely, because at the end of the year, the mortgage giants'  unlimited backstop from the Treasury will expire.  Next year, they'll have  to make do with a credit line of $210 billion.  </p><p/><p>  PETROU:  They still have a $210 billion backstop.  But they're huge.   Their total obligations are about $5.5 trillion.  And in that scale, it's  not as much as it seems and it's certainly a lot less than unlimited.  </p><p/><p>  GERSH:  The Treasury is also pushing the mortgage giants to get  smaller, faster by winding down their massive investment portfolios by 15  percent a year.  Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  The former head of failed brokerage firm PFG Best pleaded not  guilty to lying to regulators.  Russell Wasendorf, Sr. is </p><p/><p> facing 31 fraud counts for allegedly cooking his firm's books and  defrauding investors for two decades.  The plea today came despite the  suicide note that Wasendorf left with a detailed confession when he  attempted suicide on July 9.  He's scheduled for trial in late October.  If  convicted, he could spend up to 150 years in prison.  </p><p/><p>  Liberty Media is getting serious about taking over Sirius XM radio.   CEO John Malone is asking the Federal Communications Commission for  approval to take over the satellite radio company by boosting its stake to  more than 50 percent.  Earlier this week, Liberty disclosed that it  recently upped its stake in Sirius to 48 percent.  If the regulator  approves, Liberty could take over in less than 60 days and would have the  power to replace management at Sirius.  </p><p/><p>  On Wall Street today, a small but positive finish on this slow summer  Friday.  The Dow, the NASDAQ and S&amp;P all rose.  And for people keeping  score, the S&amp;P 500 just missed closing above its four-year high by a single  point.  Technology, industrials and retail -- three economically sensitive  sectors --were winners in today's session and for the week.  </p><p/><p>  Let's start with tech darling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which hit a fresh  all-time high.  Investors are getting more excited about the possibility of  a new iPhone-5 and a new mini-iPad in September.  Brokerage firm Jefferies  hiked its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to $900.  And today  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed above $648 a share.  </p><p/><p>  More skepticism today about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  The stock lost  another 4 percent, falling to $19.  That's half of the initial public  offering price.  Investors are still concerned about Facebook's ability to  boost revenue and make money from mobile customers.  Today's decline comes  on top of heavy selling yesterday after the expiration of that so-called  lock-up period that we told you about.  </p><p/><p>  Another big tech decliner, Marvell Technology.  The chip maker's  second quarter profits came in lower than expected.  It also guided down  estimates for the third quarter, blaming slower growth in its mobile phone  chips business in China.  The shares fell 14 percent to $10.54.  The stock  is down almost 40 percent in the last six months.  Marvell wasn't the only  tech company feeling pain today.  Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) also got slammed,  down as much as 10 percent, but it recovered some ground closing at $4.75 a  share.  Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) cut its price target on the shares to  $3.  </p><p/><p>  Lots of big movers in the retail sector today.  Women's apparel  retailer Ann Inc. beat Wall Street forecasts for the eighth quarter in a  row, as sales soared at its Ann Taylor and Loft Stores.  The company is  also seeing more full-price purchases.  Shares jumped 20 percent to just  under $34.  That's the highest level in nearly five years, as the company  nudged up its full year sales forecast.  </p><p/><p>  Gap (NYSE:GPS) was also a winner, because it also raised its full year  profit guidance.  That good news came on top of a gain of nearly 30 percent  in second quarter earnings, helped by good fashion picks and lean  inventories.  Investors are optimistic the retailer is on a comeback, after  struggling for years to reclaim its fashion status.  The shares closed up  almost 5 percent.  </p><p/><p>  A very different situation at Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO) which posted a 98  percent drop in second quarter earnings.  It also issued a third quarter  profit forecast that was below Wall Street expectations and that's due to  soft back-to-school sales.  The stock fell 11 percent.  </p><p/><p>  Now on to a pair of sporting good chains moving in opposite  directions.  Both reported better than expected second quarter earnings.   Athletic footwear chain Footlocker (NYSE:FL) also reported higher sales, so  its shares rose nearly 2 percent.  Hibbett Sports (NASDAQ:HIBB) fell 4  percent as revenues missed Wall Street's target.  </p><p/><p>  But that decline was nothing compared to the huge drop in shares of  oilfield services firm Ion Geophysical (NYSE:IO).  The shares plunged 11  percent after a Federal jury ruled against in a patent suit.  Ion has been  ordered to pay nearly $106 million to a Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) subsidiary.   That stock closed down $0.20.  </p><p/><p>  And, finally, a story for all you peanut butter and jelly lovers.   Shares of JM Smucker -- maker of its namesake jelly and Jiff peanut butter  -- jumped 5 percent today to nearly $83 a share.  The company reported  better than expected earnings and forecast strong growth for the rest of  the year, as price cuts helped to win back customers who traded down to  cheaper brands.  </p><p/><p>  Another strong day of gains for the most active ETFs, except for the  Ishares emerging markets.  And that's tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p/><p>  Despite the recent market gains, our \"Market Monitor\" tonight is  calling for a major stock market correction.  He's Frank Cochrane,  president of Investment Timing Consultants.   Frank, why are you so  bearish?  </p><p/><p>  FRANK COCHRANE, PRES., INVESTMENT TIMING CONSULTANTS:  Well first of  all, the rally that we've seen over the last six weeks or so, the sirens  (ph) of central banking with Bernanke and so on, have really done a  marvelous job in giving a great levitation activist to this market which I  think is totally unfounded.  If you look at the employment picture which is  8.3 percent, participation rate at 63 percent, today, for example, the BLS  announced that 44 states had higher unemployment than the previous month in  June.  </p><p/><p>  These are not things that are a good foundation for the economy to do  well.  Economic statistics are, you know, one month up, one month down, but  overall the trend I think is lower and if you look at the amount of money  that the government and the Fed has thrown at this economy over the past  four years, growth is really, really pathetic.  We are $16 trillion in  debt, $800 billion thrown in by the government.  It's just -- that combined  with the fact that the election's coming up, I think it will be something  that will cause people to sit on their hands, wait, and then if I look at  the technicals of the market, they're extremely weak as well.  The  participation, the advanced decline line, new highs, new lows, everything  is contracting in this advance and, you know, the thing is, it's not  something where longer term, I think -- I really think we've hit an apex  here and the market will hit a wall.  If we haven't already, we will  certainly over the next week or two.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Let's talk a little bit about timing here.  When do you think  that this correction is going to happen and how serious?  How deep is it  going to be?  How big a correction?  </p><p/><p>  COCHRANE:  I'm looking for something on the short term, as I  mentioned, going into the election I think, maybe into the middle of  November, so the next say, three months, starting at any time and I think  anywhere from 15 to 20 percent is not out of the realm of possibilities.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  That's pretty big. That's a pretty big correction.  </p><p/><p>  COCHRANE:  It will be huge.  It will be fast. It will be furious and  it will be scary, but we may hit a bottom some time and then grudgingly go  up towards the end of the year into the spring.  I think the next two,  three, months could be very interesting for the bears.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  This is going to be a very difficult time for investors if  you are right and you're saying that investors should get out of stocks,  get out of equities and put their money into 10-year Treasuries and also  two-year notes.  Tell us why.  </p><p/><p>  COCHRANE:  Well, the -- you know, the 10 year, first of all, has gone  from a low on the 22nd of July to, say, 138 up to 181 today.  This is a  gift.  I would buy into -- buy into that.  That, coincidentally happened  with Mario Draghi's comment, which respect, we'll throw anything at this  market. We'll do whatever it takes to get things done at the ECB.  So we  saw lower rates then.  I think that's good.  As far as the two year, I  would be very, very liquid going into this -- into the next few months.   Money markets, two-year notes, 10-year notes, that type of thing and make a  shopping list when this decline occurs.  Capital preservation I think will  be key.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  You're also recommending an ETF, ticker symbol TEIX (ph).   This is a way for investors to hedge against market volatility.  Tell us  why you like this ETF.  </p><p/><p>  COCHRANE:  The chart on that looks like Niagara Falls.  In fact it  almost looks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  This is a very low-price ETF and I  think if the volatility picks up and we hit new lows today over the course  of the short duration that I'm talking about, there should be some good  percentage gains in that ETF.  This is a short-term trade.  This is not  something to fall in love with and I would certainly use some type of ...  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  It's not a \"buy\" and \"hold.\"  </p><p/><p>  COCHRANE:   .10 or 50 percent.  That's correct.  And I would  definitely be out of it by some time early to mid-November at the latest.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Any disclosures, Frank?  Do you own this ETF?  </p><p/><p>  COCHRANE:  That particular one, no, not at this time.  From time to  time we do trade in and out of that.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  All right, thanks a lot.  We really appreciate your insights.   Our \"Market Monitor tonight,\" Frank Cochrane.  He's president of the  Investment Timing Consultants.  </p><p/><p>  While the clock is ticking for the fiscal cliff deadline, tonight's  commentator says lawmakers will soon have a bigger worry.  He's Russ  Koesterich, Ishares investment strategist at Blackrock and author of \"The  Ten Trillion Dollar Gamble.\" </p><p/><p>  RUSS KOESTERICH, GLOBAL CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, BLACKROCK ISHARES:   . have resigned themselves to another year or two of sluggish growth.   There's little to suggest that the market anticipates another one to two  decades in the slow lane.  Yet, this could be what the future holds.  The  problem is the Federal debt.  If present conditions hold, publicly traded  Federal debt will hit 90 percent of GDP by 2022 and exceed 109 percent, the  previous all-time high, by 2026.  History shows debt levels that high can  reduce long-term economic growth rates by one third and the drag on growth  can last two decades or more.  </p><p/><p>  These realities will become clear during the next presidential term.   If the next administration can't start making a dent in the nation's fiscal  position, investors may need to reconsider the long-term argument for U.S.   stocks or at least demand a bigger discount before committing new capital.   From the fiscal cliff to the Federal government's long-term solvency, the  markets are unlikely to permit endless procrastination.  Ultimately, if the  U.S. continues to stumble along with an indecisive government, Europe may  no longer be the biggest problem child in the global economy.  I'm Russ  Koesterich.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Coming up all next week on NBR, we take a closer look at the  fiscal cliff:  what it all means for the nation's economy and you.  We talk  about fixing the debt with former Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles.   We check in with doctors who worry their life-saving research could be on  the line if the sequester isn't stopped.  And then on Monday, we meet a  small town defense contractor counting on lawmakers to keep its business  strong.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  And finally, we end with a few thoughts on the big win in  little rewards.  Here's author and educator Lou Heckler.  </p><p/><p>  LOU HECKLER:  I hate to admit it, but I'm now at that awkward age.   It's the age where you read food before you eat food! Does it have enough  of this?  Does it have too much of that?  I guess the days are gone when I  could chase three pieces of pepperoni pizza with a bag of Krispy Kremes.   As I think of the organizations I have worked for and the ones I now speak  to, I do think there is a vitamin deficiency in many of our working people.   I think they lack vitamin \"P\" -- the praise vitamin.  </p><p/><p>  I was speaking at a conference and I posed this question:  what's the  number one thing you hear when you've done a good job?  I looked  expectantly across the room of 300 people and nobody offered an answer.   Finally, one woman up front said:  that's what we hear -- nothing! Though  the room burst into nervous laughter, it wasn't because anybody thought  that was funny.  Author Michael Leboeuf (ph) says it's pretty simple:  the  things that get rewarded get repeated.  We seem to know this with little  children and then we seem to forget it when it comes to adults.  </p><p/><p>  The best managers I've worked for have handled praise this way.  It's  precise, it's periodic and it's personal.  It recognizes a specific act.   It isn't given once and never again.  It is directed specifically to one  individual and helps that person see how their exact contribution is  appreciated.  Things feeling a little puny around your place of business?   Maybe your people have a vitamin \"P\" deficiency.  You can fix that.  I'm  Lou Heckler.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday, August  17.  We want to remind you this is the time of year your public television  station seeks your support.  I'm Susie Gharib.

But, traders say  there's no stopping prices at the pump. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANTHONY GRISANTI, PRESIDENT, GRZ ENERGY:  I think wholesale wise,  you're going to see $5 gas in a lot of areas of the country, especially the  coasts. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  And this man is a big  investor in Berkshire Hathaway stock.  We took his pulse after Warren  Buffett released his annual letter to shareholders.  It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT for Monday, February 27. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:   Good evening, everyone.  A pullback in oil prices today  after days of spurting higher. There are still worries about Iran and  supply disruptions, but Tom, those were overshadowed by concerns that the  world economy is slowing. </p><p>HUDSON:   At least for today Susie, the risk of higher prices still a  concern though over the weekend at a meeting of the world finance  ministers. Get you updated on today's trading in New York, crude oil  futures lost $1.21 to close at $108.56 per barrel. Still, U.S. oil prices  are up 10 percent this year. </p><p>GHARIB:   Those high prices have pushed energy stocks up as well.   And, as Suzanne Pratt reports, there could still be time for investors to  take advantage of the big move higher in big oil stocks. </p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   No matter  where you pump, gas prices have been heading higher. And, that's bad news  for consumers and perhaps the whole economy and its fragile recovery.  But,  it's been good news for big oil companies or super majors and their  shareholders. So far this year, a closely watched energy sector ETF is up  10 percent moving almost in lock step with the rise in oil and gas prices.  The question is whether oil stocks have more room to run. The answer  depends on what happens here at the pump. Many factors affect oil company  profits, including costs and environmental disasters.  But, a big rise in  prices plays the biggest role. One energy expert says what's most important  is that crude oil prices remain close to or above $100 a barrel. </p><p>ELIECER PALACIOS, ENERGY SECTOR SPECIALIST, MAXIM GROUP:  A deep water  well costs about $50 a barrel, $75 depending where you are. So, if you can  sell your oil at $100 plus, it's very positive for any of these companies. </p><p>PRATT:   So, where are oil prices headed next?   Energy trader Anthony  Grisanti says that's easy:   higher. </p><p>ANTHONY GRISANTI, PRESIDENT, GRZ ENERGY:  Number one you have the  threat from Iran that's being held over this market and number two, as far  as refineries closing, you've had three of them close on the east coast.   You've had a couple go down on the west coast.  You've had some in Europe  being shut down and these are shutdowns that are going to be permanent. </p><p>PRATT:   Others aren't so certain energy prices will continue to climb  north.  They believe geopolitical tensions will be less of a support for  the market and then there's the demand concern. Higher prices at the pump  usually means people buy less gas, which in turn pushes prices lower.  Still, others say one more reason to consider buying big oil shares these  days is their dividends.  On average they pay about 3 to 4 percent and  those payouts come no matter what happens to oil prices. Suzanne Pratt,  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>HUDSON:   A potential new source for imported oil into the U.S. is  trying again.  Back in January, the Obama administration blocked Trans- Canada's Keystone XL pipeline over environmental concerns.  But the company  today said it will start building the southern leg of that pipeline,  running from the Cushing, Oklahoma oil storage hub to refineries on Texas'  Gulf coast. The $2.3 billion project is smaller.  It should be up and  running by the end of next year.  And since it does not cross international  borders, it won't be subject to a full-blown Federal environmental review. </p><p>GHARIB:   Meanwhile, the trial to decide who should pay for the  nation's worst oil spill was delayed today.  The one-week delay allows BP  time to continue negotiations with the plaintiffs' steering committee.   That committee represents condominium owners, fishermen, hotel and  restaurant operators and others who say their livelihoods were damaged by  the Deepwater horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill.  Still, BP says  there's no guarantee a deal can be reached. </p><p>HUDSON:   All this energy talk in the background, blue chip stocks  once again tested the 13,000 mark on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.   Once again, the Dow failed to close above that level. Here's how the day  played out for the major indices, the Dow plunging over 100 points actually  at the open and then coming back to life on a report that pending home  sales showed a jump in the number of sales contracts signed last month.   Still, the Dow did end the day down slightly as you saw, down about a point  and a half, the NASDAQ rose two, the S&amp;P 500 was up about same amount. </p><p>After the closing bell, Greece was officially rated to be in default  of its IOUs.  S&amp;P cut Greece's long-term credit rating to selective  default.  Earlier this month, S&amp;P warned it would make the downgrade if  Greece was going to force its lenders to swap their IOUs for new ones,  accepting less money.  Greece is doing just that and now the selective  default rating brings up questions if payments on bond insurance and  derivatives will be triggered.  Still ahead, tonight's \"Word on the Street\"  -- cloud.  James Rogers of thestreet.com has three cloud computing stock  picks looking for bright days. </p><p>GHARIB:   A lot of talk today about Warren Buffett and succession  plans at Berkshire Hathaway where he is chairman and CEO.  He gave some  clues over the weekend when he released his annual letter to shareholders.  Here are the highlights.  On the topic of succession, Buffett said one  individual has been chosen, but he didn't identify the person.  Buffett,  who is 81 years old and his business partner Charlie Munger, 88, have no  plans to step down.  But Buffett did say the transfer of responsibility  will be seamless when the time comes. </p><p>Buffett also reported that Berkshire's fourth quarter profits fell 30  percent and 2011 earnings down 21 percent. But the company's cash rose to  $37 billion. On housing, Buffett said the market remains in a quote  depression of its own and he was dead wrong predicting it would recover by  now.  On the topic of investing, stocks will outperform gold and bonds. And  even though investors believe bonds are safe, Buffett says they are quote  among the most dangerous of assets. </p><p>I turned to Glenn Tongue for some reaction and analysis. He's  managing partner at T2 Partners, where Berkshire Hathaway is its top  holding. We began by talking about Buffett's succession plan. </p><p>GLENN TONGUE, MANAGING PARTNER, T2 PARTNERS:  I think it's likely that  Mr. Buffett running the company for another five years. However, if the  unexpected happens and he's not running the business tomorrow, it's very  comforting knowing that there's someone in line to run the business. </p><p>GHARIB:   But Glenn, why doesn't Warren Buffett just name his  successor?    Why the mystery?</p><p>TONGUE:  I don't see why naming the individual today is a benefit to  the company, to the shareholders.  People that work with Berkshire  Hathaway, companies that sell their businesses to Warren Buffett and  Berkshire Hathaway want to be dealing with him.  They don't want to be  dealing with the next in line. They don't want to be thinking about those  issues.  When Mr. Buffett is no longer running the company, then someone  else will step into that role. </p><p>GHARIB:   Let's talk about Berkshire Hathaway the company, how is it  doing?</p><p>TONGUE:  Fantastically well.  The five most important operating  businesses operated at record levels this year.  He stated in the letter  that they're going to be generating $10 billion in profits next year, just  an enormously profitable business. </p><p>GHARIB:   So quarterly profits were down 30 percent for the year,  2011, also down. </p><p>TONGUE:  If you look at each and every one of the operating  businesses, whether it's the utilities or the railroads or (INAUDIBLE)  manufacturing businesses, they were all up year over year.  They were all  up quarter over quarter in terms of operations.  So the underlying  businesses are doing terrifically well.  There's some accounting  conventions that are required, certain write offs and write downs, that  made the earnings go down, but the cash flow of the company certainly went  up and the operating performance has never been stronger. </p><p>GHARIB:   But what Berkshire stock?  The A shares have been trading at  around $120,000 for two years now. What do you think? </p><p>TONGUE:  We value Berkshire stock and we think it's worth about  $180,000 per share. We were buying Berkshire stock today very aggressively  in the marketplace. It's got the most powerful balance sheet of any company  in America and it's got earnings power that is growing very, very rapidly. </p><p>GHARIB:   Would you be that optimistic if tomorrow Warren Buffett were  no longer running the company?   </p><p>TONGUE:  When we value Berkshire Hathaway, there's no element of the  Warren Buffett premium that we throw into our valuation. We think if Mr.  Buffett left the company, that people would still drink Coca-Cola tomorrow.   The trains would still be running the next day and people would be ensuring  themselves through Geico. So we value those elements of the business. </p><p>GHARIB:   What's your reaction to what Warren Buffett said about bonds  as the most dangerous of assets? Do you agree with that?   </p><p>TONGUE:  Yes I agree with it.  If you look at the interest rate that  we're getting on bonds today, it's very, very low and if interest rates --  prevailing interest rates go up, the principal amount of the bonds will go  down over time, so you're going to lose purchasing power by investing in  bonds today. </p><p>GHARIB:   So Berkshire's cash is now up to $37 billion.  Is it time to  pay a dividend, even though Buffett is not a fan of them?   </p><p>TONGUE:  I don't think so. I think Warren Buffett can find better  deals with the cash than the shareholders can with the dividends. He finds  very unique opportunities like investing in preferred stock in Bank of  America. It's a fantastic deal that was available only to Berkshire  Hathaway and only to Warren Buffett.</p><p>GHARIB:   Glenn, thank you so much, really enjoyed talking with you. </p><p>TONGUE:  Thank you Susie.  I enjoyed it too.</p><p>HUDSON:   Warren Buffett also today said that he would buy millions  of single family homes if he could.  2,500 of them went on sale under a new  Federal pilot program. The idea is to sell Fannie Mae-owned homes to  private investors who want to use them as rental properties. As Darren  Gersh reports, these homes may go fast. </p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   Warren Buffett  is not alone. Money-making ideas love company and large investors and  private equity types already have hundreds of millions, maybe billions of  dollars on hand to buy up foreclosed homes and rent them out. At Carrington  Holding, Rick Sharga says the company is ready to buy 30,000 to 40,000  homes. </p><p>RICK SHARGA, EXEC. VP, CARRINGTON HOLDING CO.: I think we all agree  with Warren Buffett. If we could buy millions of homes, we'd be doing that  right now. There is a lot of capital that's very interested in  participating in a program like this. </p><p>GERSH:   Like this, meaning a pilot program announced by Federal  regulators who took charge of the troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac when the companies were placed under government control.  The  Federal Housing Finance Agency today announced a test sale of 2,500 homes  around the country. Focusing on cities from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and  much of Florida, places where housing fell hard.  But this is a tiny  fraction of the 700,000 or so foreclosed homes now on the books of  financial institutions.  And here's the problem:   Warren Buffett wanna- be's say they can't find enough homes to buy now.  Some banks may be  holding off on selling, believing they can get a higher price.  Others may  not be carrying foreclosed homes on their books at realistic market prices.  </p><p>SHARGA:  And that could cause a lender or somebody else holding these  properties to have to do a significant write down at the point that they  execute the sale. </p><p>GERSH:  As investors prepare to become big landlords, economist Dean  Baker hopes regulators will be more creative.  He'd like to see renters  offered a chance to become old-fashioned American homesteaders. </p><p>DEAN BAKER, CO-DIR., CNTR. FOR ECONOMIC &amp; POLICY RSCH.: The basic idea  is that you have someone come in and pay some nominal amount to buy it  initially and then if they stay there and fix it up and pay their taxes,  live in the place for five years, then it's theirs. </p><p>GERSH:  With private equity lining up to buy rental properties,  critics worry the industry that caused the housing crisis is now preparing  to profit from the destruction.  But investors argue the bad actors have  gone out of business. </p><p>SHARGA:  It's a popular sentiment that the same folks who got us into  this mess are now going to profit on the way back.  Fortunately, it's not  true. </p><p>GERSH:   While Warren Buffett dreams of buying millions of homes, big  investors have more modest hopes. They figure the market for big investors  and private equity is about 200,000 foreclosed homes over the next two  years.  Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. </p><p>GHARIB:   More housing headaches for bank of America.  The giant bank  was hit with a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development today. It's charged with discriminating against disabled  homebuyers. The agency says B of A put unnecessary and burdensome  requirements on disabled borrowers.  In two separate states, borrowers  complained saying they had to show medical records to prove their  disabilities and detail their Social Security income. Bank of America says  the cases came down to inconsistencies between Federal Housing  Administration lending standards and conventional underwriting standards.   And that it followed with stricter Federal standards which require more  detail. </p><p>With fees rising and customer service falling, more Americans ditched  big banks last year and moved their money to small banks and credit unions.   JD Power and Associates surveyed 5,000 people who shopped for a new bank or  bank account over the past year.  Its defection rate for large, regional  and midsize banks averaged as high as 11 percent last year, up sharply from  2010. Meanwhile smaller banks and credit unions lost less than 1 percent of  their customers.  That was far better than the near 9 percent defection  rate those small shops saw a year ago.  And Tom, surprisingly, bank stocks,  big and small led the market higher today. </p><p>HUDSON:   A lot of folks are putting their money into those bank  stocks today, even though we got that news on how the customers have been  behaving over the past year or so.  Susie, let's go ahead and take a look  at what was going on with tonight's \"Market Focus.\"   Overall a mixed  finished for the major stock indices on this Monday.  The Dow Industrials  as we mentioned earlier unable to stick above that 13,000 level.  Stocks  were able to bounce back though from the early session selling you can see  on the left hand side of the chart, thanks to some encouraging signs in the  housing market.  Those pending home sales were up. We'll talk more about  those in a second.  The Dow did dip into the closing bell though, ending  with that small loss. </p><p>It was a trio of financial stocks though that were the best  performers inside the Dow.  JPMorgan and Bank of America each gaining two  percent. American Express rallying more than 1.5 percent in the session.   In the broad market, financials, yes were the strongest, no doubt about it,  but the gains though pretty tame, under 1 percent.  Financial discretionary  sector was the second best today and even that was up only 0.3 of 1 percent  gain, a muted gain for the day. </p><p>The jump in pending home sales -- purchases really helped spark some  buying in home-related areas of the entire stock market.  Pending contracts  on those existing homes jumped 2 percent in January, up to their highest  level in almost two years, bullishness there in real estate. That news on  helped push up shares of Whirlpool to a seven-month high, jumping almost 7  percent. Volume was strong today trading in Whirlpool. </p><p>Paint maker Sherwin Williams also moving higher, up to a new high as  a matter of fact with a 2 percent rally. Shares are up more than 26 percent  in just the past year. Speaking of homes, home supplies retailer Lowe's  turned in earnings a nickel better than estimates. Similar to Home Depot's  quarter that we saw last week, Lowe's benefited from mild winter weather  allowing customers to start on those home improvement projects early.   Shares of Lowe's saw heavier than usual volume, but were up less than 1  percent. </p><p>Focus shifted after the close to online travel company priceline.com  and the name your own price website continues to see some pretty big growth  numbers. Check it out.  Wall Street was expecting a big jump in earnings  already from a year ago. Priceline did not disappoint. Results were more  than $0.30 stronger than estimates. Both international and domestic travel  bookings were better than expected. Priceline shares saw little movement  during the regular session, but watch these tomorrow.  They shot up more  than 6 percent in after hour's action to over $628 per share. If that holds  tomorrow, it would be more than a decade high for PCLN. </p><p>A big bankruptcy in Japan may mean one less global maker of a  commonly used memory chip for computers and that had shares of Micron  jumping today here in the U.S.  MU, the ticker symbol, jumped almost 7  percent to an eight-month high.  El-Pida (ph) Memory in Japan filed for  bankruptcy under the weight of some big loans coming due. Micron is the  last U.S. space maker of what are called DRAM, dynamic random access memory  chips. </p><p>While the overall energy sector cooled a bit today as we mentioned,  we did see some buying in a giant oil driller as well as a master limited  partnership based in nat gas. Driller Transocean rallied 5 percent.  It  reported a loss last quarter related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill,  indicating a possible settlement in that case may be coming.  Cheniere  Energy Partners meantime, the master limited partnership focused on  liquefied natural gas jumped to a new 52-week high, up 12 percent.  Private  equity firm Blackstone is investing $2 billion to help the firm build a  liquefied nat gas plant in Louisiana. </p><p>A lot of the commodity market focus has been on energy lately, who  can blame them.  But today soybeans really took the lead.  Beans in the  teens, you heard that phrase,  the old saying at the Chicago Board of Trade  and we're there for the first time since last fall at least for the May  futures contract.  Beans jumping above $13 a bushel for the first time in  five months. The market thinks that the South American harvest will be  disappointing, while global demand for beans continues growing. And that is  tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB:   And record help for the nation's farmers in the form of crop  insurance. U.S. farmers received $10 billion in crop insurance payments  last year and with 5 percent of 2011 claims outstanding, that number could  go higher. Drought in the great plains, spring flooding along the  Mississippi River and crop-damaging freezes in the south pushed claims  higher. The last record was in 2008.  That's when payouts topped $8.5  billion. </p><p>HUDSON:   The forecast for technology is cloudy like cloud computing.  The movement to on-demand software and data storage continues to pick up in  a big way. That brings us to tonight's \"Word on the Street\" -- cloud.   James Rogers back with us now, technology editor at thestreet.com.  James,  Mr. Editor, nice to see you, congratulations on the new gig. </p><p>JAMES ROGERS, TECHNOLOGY EDITOR, THESTREET.COM:  Thank you very much. </p><p>HUDSON:   So tell us how cloud computing is different and how it's  changing?   </p><p>ROGERS:   Well, you know cloud computing has been one of the big  textbook words of recent years and it's a trend that's really picking up.  It's becoming a mainstream technology. What is it?   Basically there's  different forms of cloud.  Cloud could be a business that say, accessing  servers and storage capacity from a hosting company like Rackspace or it  could be a business that's using specialized software services, someone  like salesforce.com where all of these areas are growing. </p><p>HUDSON:   You mentioned two companies there, but first, EMC. This is  kind of the granddaddy in the space, data storage and hardware.  Share  prices had a sharp rally in the past six weeks or so.  What could fuel it  higher? </p><p>ROGERS:   EMC provides a lot of the core infrastructure that's needed  for these cloud service providers, could be things as you say like basic  storage hardware or virtualization software from EMC is very, very popular,  VMWare subsidiary. It's got a lot of weapons in its arsenal, a lot of other  things, data security, disaster recovery, data analytics and I think  because of this bigger picture, it's really in the sweet spot for the  cloud. Cloud and demands for cloud services helped push EMC to record  quarterly results recently, kind of continuing a consistent run of (ph)  results from this firm.  I think that EMC is actually one of tech's best  performers. It may not be the sexiest stock out there, but I think that  there's a lot more upside potential for investors here, particularly with  the push towards the cloud. </p><p>HUDSON:  EMC is kind of the soup to nuts, the old school cloud play  here, 90 seconds left and I want to get to the other two.  Software side,  salesforce.com, CRM the ticker symbol.  It's had a heck of a quarter, has  already said it's got a record order on its books in this current quarter.  How can it move higher?   </p><p>ROGERS:   I have salesforce down as one of the big tech rebound stocks  for 2012 and I think it's really starting to live up to that billing. This  is a company that is really one of the first cloud trail blazers, and if  you look at its resources, what we're seeing is that salesforce is actually  clinching more and more large enterprise deals, also its social enterprise  strategy seems to be taking off.   Now we're concerned about this company's  growth potential last year, but I think that maybe  we're seeing a bit  overblown.  There's a lot more growth to this firm. </p><p>HUDSON:   Finally, 30 seconds on Rackspace, RAX the ticker symbol.  This is really seen as the pure play in cloud. And the stock price kind of  reflects that as the excitement has picked up in the last several weeks. </p><p>ROGERS:   This is another company that's come out strong results and  like a lot of its competitors like AT&amp;T, Rackspace focuses solely on the  cloud, really impressive reputation for customer support and also I spoke  to some of the executives there recently and they were telling me that  they've got a lot of new products planned for this year. And also on the  financial side of the company, there's a great price to earnings ratio so I  think that there's a lot of upside to have there. </p><p>HUDSON:   A little bit of valuation play there in technology.  Can you  or do you own any of these stocks, James? </p><p>ROGERS:   No, none whatsoever. </p><p>HUDSON:   You can read James' article at the street.com.  You can find  a link on our website as well.  It's our guest this evening, James Rogers  with the street.com. </p><p>ROGERS:   Thank you, Tom. </p><p>GHARIB:   As the nation gears up for primaries in Michigan and Arizona  tomorrow, tonight's commentator says there's something she'd really like to  see during this presidential race. She's Maya Macguineas, president of the  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. </p><p>MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRES., CMTE. FOR A RESPONSIBLE FED. BUDGET:  It's  campaign season and with campaigns come lots of promises. Last week, we  released a report looking at how the Republican candidates campaign  proposals would affect the country's bottom line and we have also analyzed  the president's budget. Suffice it to say, we are on track for a whole lot  of red ink. </p><p>So here's my proposal. Once we get to the general election, we  should have a debate focusing solely on fixing the budget. Each candidate  would be required to put forth a plan to save $5 trillion over a decade  with the full set of details. And it would give us, the voters, a chance to  see what it really takes to create a responsible budget. We'd see what it  takes if we don't raise any taxes at all or cut them further as all the  Republicans have proposed; and we see how much it would take in tax  increases to cover all the new spending the president has proposed while  also bringing down the deficit. Better yet, we might see what a more  realistic proposal would look like. Maybe the candidates wouldn't show up,  maybe they would try to use funny numbers. But maybe, just maybe it would  jumpstart the long overdue national discussion about what it will really  take to fix the budget. I'm Maya Macguineas. </p><p>GHARIB:   And finally tonight, from insider trading to Ponzi scheme,  FBI investigations into financial crimes last year led to billions in  court-ordered restitution. The Feds say they won more than 3,000 financial  crime convictions last year, securing $12 billion in court ordered payouts.  In some cases, the government itself was the victim through Medicare fraud.   And the FBI leaned on Gordon Gekko himself or the actor who played him in  the \"Wall Street\" movies to help fight financial crime.  Michael Douglas  stars in a new public service announcement warning investors about deals  that are too good to be true. </p><p>HUDSON:   Here's what we're watching for tomorrow. We've got some new  data coming out, the latest numbers on durable goods orders. We'll see if  that washing machine or couch that you purchased in January is adding to  the economy.  We'll also get the latest on home prices, the S&amp;P Case  Shiller home price index for December.  Then, when it comes to the economy,  it's the economy and politics this fall, no doubt about it and we will take  a look at campaign promises versus political realities. </p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday evening. Thanks for  joining us.  It's February 27th.  I'm Tom Hudson.  Have a great night  Susie. </p><p>GHARIB:   Tom, hope you have a wonderful evening.  I'm Susie Gharib.   Thanks for watching everyone.  Hope to see all of you again tomorrow night. </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I`m Susie Gharib. The unemployment rate drops to a four year low as U.S. businesses add 146,000 jobs in November. We look behind the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Good evening. I`m Tom Hudson. We meet the CEOs of three small businesses hiring right now. What they do and why they`re looking for help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And House Speaker Boehner accuses <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>of wasting another week in the fiscal cliff negotiations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more coming up on a Friday night edition here on NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: The job market is proving to be surprisingly resilient. American employers hired 146,000 workers in November, much more than expected. And the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent. That`s the lowest level since December of 2008. As Erika Miller reports, that wasn`t the only surprise in today`s report.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Almost no one on Wall Street saw this good news coming. There was every reason to think hiring would be weak last month. After all, many parts of the east coast are still recovering from devastation caused by super storm Sandy.</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN: I think the most likely explanation here is that Sandy`s impact was significant but was so short- lived that it didn`t extend to the sample period of the employment report which was the week that covered November 12.</p><p>MILLER: Hiring was also supposed to be weak due to worries about the fiscal cliff. With $600 billion in tax hikes and government spending cuts set to start next year, why aren`t more firms postponing hiring decisions?</p><p>JULIA CORONADO, CHIEF N. AMERICA ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS: What we`re hearing from businesses is that it is really hard to actually pull back hiring right now, because they`ve already fired so many workers, gotten so lean that it`s really difficult.</p><p>MILLER: But not all the surprises in the report were good. At 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level since December 2008. But that was mostly due to people giving up their search for work. And there`s another disappointing trend, weak wage growth.</p><p>KASMAN: What we are not seeing is strong income generation. The slowing in wage gains -- the weak bargaining power of labor comes across in this report.</p><p>MILLER: So although the labor market is not getting worse, it`s not getting a lot better, either. And there are plenty of risks that could cause businesses to cancel projects, and hiring plans.</p><p>CORONADO: Clearly one of the biggest risks is that we don`t see a deal on the fiscal cliff or that they drag it out over a number of months and that that really erodes confidence.</p><p>MILLER: Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve is trying to do all it can to help the economy. The central bank is widely expected to announce an extension of its bond buying program when it meets next week. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: With the fiscal cliff about three weeks away tonight, Washington has not made much progress to avoid it. At least that was the assessment today from one of those directly involved in the talks, House Speaker John Boehner. The top Republican accused <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>of quote, slow walking the economy to the edge of the cliff. He repeated his call for the president to send to Congress a plan that can pass both houses. Tax rates are still the major sticking point. The president wants to raise them for America`s highest earners; House Republicans strongly oppose.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER: Instead of reforming the tax code and cutting spending, the president wants to raise tax rates. But even if the president got the tax rate hike that he wanted, understand that we would continue to see trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see. Washington`s got a spending problem, not a revenue problem.</p><p>HUDSON: Congress and the president now have about 24 days to reach a deal before the fiscal cliff`s tax hikes and spending cuts take effect.</p><p>GHARIB: Mark Zandi says bad things will happen to the economy pretty fast if lawmakers don`t settle the fiscal cliff issue. He`s chief economist of Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. So Mark, falling off the fiscal cliff means bad things. How bad?</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ANALYTICS: It could be quite bad, Susie. I don`t think it`s cataclysmic if we get into January and we haven`t settled this, but if House makers haven`t nailed this down by early February, I think stock investors, bond investors will start to get very, very nervous, start selling, risky businesses pull back and by the end of February when we start approaching the ceiling for the debt limit, I think we`ll be back in recession. It will be a fairly severe recession. So policy makers have a few weeks but not much more than that. They have to get this together.</p><p>GHARIB: Some people are saying that today`s jobs report is very encouraging and that you can look at this as a way that maybe the economy can handle some tough belt tightening because things are looking a little bit better. How do you think the various parties, Republican and Democrats will handle this jobs report in their fiscal cliff negotiations?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, you know, you`re right. Some folks look at this and say the economy`s strong enough. It should be able to digest big tax increases, spending cuts. Others look at it and say look we still have a very high unemployment rate, a long way to go to get back to full employment. The economy can`t tolerate big tax increases and spending cuts. Like most political debates, the reality is in between. We do need to address our fiscal problem so we do need to go through some spending cuts and we also need some tax revenue increases. But we have to phase it in over time, otherwise the economy will choke on that. We can`t have too much restraint too quickly. So we have to phase this in, smooth it in to make it palpable for the economy.</p><p>GHARIB: But until that happens, there is a lot of anxiety in the labor market. The big fear for many individuals and for investors is that companies are going to start laying off workers. We saw this week that Citigroup (NYSE:C) announced 11,000 job cuts. Is this the beginning of a trend, Mark?</p><p>ZANDI: No, Susie, I don`t think so. I think if Washington can reasonably address the fiscal issues and I`m still confident that they will ultimately get it together. There will be a fair amount of brinkmanship but at the end of the day, they`ll get it together. If they`re able to do that when we get into next spring, I do think we`re going to be in much better shape. Businesses are going to get their groove back. Certainly investors are going to be very happy about that. By this time next year, I think we should see a much better job market because the housing market, which is already starting to turn should be in full swing. So no, I don`t think businesses are going to pull back. The only reason they would is if Washington completely botches this. At this point I don`t think that`s going to happen.</p><p>GHARIB: How do you think the Federal Reserve is going to read and factor in today`s jobs report? They`re meeting on Tuesday as you know. Do you think it`s going to trigger any new response from the Fed?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, as you know the Fed`s on high alert. They`ve got their foot to the accelerator. They`re now using open-ended quantitative easing, buying long-term bonds and they`re going to up the ante I think at the next meeting in the coming week. Operation Twist ends and they`re going to start rolling that into this quantitative even process. So a lot of bond purchases. I think they`re going to continue to do that until unemployment is moving definitively lower and is much lower than it is today. And most importantly, they`re going to wait and see how these things go in Washington. They`re very nervous that policy makers aren`t going to get this right. So as long as Washington`s dithering I think the Fed`s going to be on high alert.</p><p>GHARIB: Absolutely. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has been talking about this for a while now. Thanks a lot Mark, great talking about you. We`ve been speaking with Mark Zandi, Moody`s Analytics.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead tonight, slow job growth does not discourage tonight`s \"Market Monitor.\" Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott tells us why.</p><p>The slow job growth we saw in November, growth but slow, didn`t lead to a lot of consumer cheer as December began. The Reuters-University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey fell early this month to its lowest level we`ve seen since August. So you add all this up here, the Dow Industrials rose 81 points, the NASDAQ was down 11 with some further losses in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, the S&amp;P 500 up four points. A mixed week for the major indices, the Dow Industrials, which does not include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), gained 1 percent for the week. With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the NASDAQ fell 1.1 percent. And the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.01 of 1 percent gain since last Friday.</p><p>GHARIB: One hundred of the small businesses behind the job growth that we`re seeing were honored last night in Washington with the \"Inc\" magazine`s \"hire power\" awards. The businesses span the country and cross an array of sectors. Sylvia Hall met with three of the winners to talk about their businesses and the one thing that they have in common: success.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: They work in different states and in completely different fields. But together, these CEOs have added more than 1,500 jobs to the nation`s economy over the past three years. This is Mike Derheim, who heads a Minnesota tech firm; Sharon Virts Mozer, whose Virginia-based company runs administration for the Federal government and Karl Schledwitz of Memphis, who`s turned jerky and hot dogs into opportunity. (INAUDIBLE) seems to be kind of a mature business. How do you find growth there?</p><p>KARL SCHLEDWITZ, CEO, MONOGRAM FOOD SOLUTIONS: The actual space is growing. There are meat snacks, beef jerky really started growing with the Atkins diet craze and it`s probably quadrupled in the last two years. We`ve been able to grow by buying under utilized manufacturing facilities and centralizing the back office and putting robust sales operation together filling up the plants. And that creates employment and creates more profitability. It`s no different than an office building or a shopping center. If it`s half empty, it doesn`t do very well cash flow wise, but you take that same exact building and fill it up and it cash flows.</p><p>HALL: You work with the Federal government. Again, not exactly what one would consider a growth market. How have you been able to find growth?</p><p>SHARON VIRTS MOZER, PRESIDENT, FCI FEDERAL: We found that the demand is going up just based on how the economy`s going and the fact that people want to be here in the U.S. We`ve also found growth through our process and our process takes what I call collaborative work forces and puts them through a methodology in a training program that allows them to accomplish great things.</p><p>HALL: Tell me just a little bit about this process.</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: We hire typically high school graduates. And we bring them in and we assess their skills and their training and what they have to offer. We put them through a training program to train them towards a particular task or a particular set of tasks.</p><p>HALL: One hundred nerds in 100 days. Where did you get to the point where you were on this nerd drive? How did you get here and how is the drive going?</p><p>MIKE DERHEIM, CEO, THE NERDERY: We started in November with our 100 nerds and 100 days program and just modeled actually very closely after a PBS telethon member drive. And the deal is that if you were known to us and you get an interview we send you a hundred bucks. If we end up hiring the person we send you another 400 bucks and we`re trying to get to a hundred nerds in as many days. As of right now, I think now we`ve had about 900 applications submitted and we`ve hired 19 people.</p><p>HALL: What`s the challenge for you specifically in hiring the people?</p><p>DERHEIM: The last I checked the unemployment rate for people in IT, for people that I`m looking for was something like half of the national average. So above all there just aren`t enough people who are out there looking for jobs.</p><p>HALL: I just wanted to open it up and ask if hiring is a challenge --</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: (INAUDIBLE) associated with it and as a result credit issues come up. So finding folks that have the right attitude with good credit particularly since we have a market or a set of work force that often times they are suffering in a poor economy and they do need those jobs but they have credit issues. That`s our biggest challenge but for the most part, we have no problems in recruiting this particular market with unemployment as high as it`s been.</p><p>DERHEIM: I wish we had that problem. We`re exactly the opposite. We`re struggling all the time to figure out new ways to get more applications in the door. Just a different worker I guess but it`s different.</p><p>HALL: I wanted to go around and ask this about your growth prospects for the next year.</p><p>SCHLEDWITZ: We hope to have more acquisitions this year and continue to add to the plants that we`re operating in. So I don`t, without an acquisition, it would be 10-15 percent growth.</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: We`re looking to grow by at least 500 if not 600 jobs by the end of 2013.</p><p>DERHEIM: We are planning 25 percent a year revenue growth for 2013. So we`re definitely planning continuing to grow aggressively and organically.</p><p>HALL: Thank you all so much and congratulations on your awards.</p><p>GHARIB: Calling it a robust investment in the region, the White House today said <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>would ask Congress for more than $60 billion in aid for states impacted by hurricane Sandy. Still that was less than the $82 billion the states wanted for rebuilding. Millions of homeowners and businesses that were in the path of hurricane Sandy are now waiting for checks as the long rebuilding effort begins. Ruben Ramirez spent a day with an insurance claim adjuster touring one of the hardest hit areas.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s the calm after the storm, empty streets, houses ripped from foundations, boats sandwiched between homes, remnants of the famous Jersey shore boardwalk.</p><p>KARL NEW, CLAIMS ADJUSTER, AMERICAN MODERN: What makes this storm different was the large amounts of sand that it brought with it. So the sand and the surge itself, it moved houses just like Katrina did, but it just the sand is bad.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Karl New is one of about 30 claims adjusters American Modern Insurance dispatched to New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. For the barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, it was north of the eye of the storm but think of it like a windmill spinning counter-clockwise.</p><p>NEW: Seaside was hit with a 37-foot wall wave so that`s a pretty big wall that was coming in so you`re talking water that`s higher than that building. that`s crashing in here and causing this much - and the force. It`s bringing sand. It`s bringing all that water in.</p><p>RAMIREZ: It took a month before insurance adjusters were allowed on the island to assess the damage. New inspected this property earlier this week.</p><p>NEW: The \"L\" shape all the way up top, everything is sagging down from the weight of the sand that was pushing it and the water that was pushing it out. It pushed somebody`s shed completely right into his house. He got 5 1/2 feet of water in his house so everything on the first floor needs to be completely gutted and taken out.</p><p>RAMIREZ: John Marchetti`s house sits just two doors down closer to the beach.</p><p>JOHN MARCHETTI, HOMEOWNER: I do have flood insurance (INAUDIBLE) and flood. Obviously everything that you see here is from the bottom. It`s from the flood.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Marchetti`s insurer, NJM will take a loss of more than $300 million from Sandy, four times what it paid out from Irene last year. It`s the largest loss in the company`s history. Industry estimates put the total amount of damage from super storm Sandy at $50 billion. Insurance companies are expected to pick up about $10-$20 billion of that putting super storm Sandy at the top of the list and ahead of hurricanes Ivan, Ike and Irene. Monday we will look at why rebuilding from Sandy is so expensive thanks to where she came ashore. Ruben Ramirez, Seaside Heights, New Jersey.</p><p>GHARIB: Back here on Wall Street, Tom, some interesting revolutions from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) today saying that it got a Wells notice, is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But behind it is a very interesting debate going on. The reason for the investigation is that the CEO Reid Hastings had posted some information on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page about developments at the company and the SEC said you didn`t disclose this properly. It should have been a press release. It should have been a filing with the SEC and it raises whole new questions about social media and fair disclosure.</p><p>HUDSON: This is all about how technology is changing and regulations have such a hard time Susie keeping up with it. We`ve see it with high frequency trading for instance and now we`re seeing with how companies disseminate information using social media getting it out arguably to more people faster than what a traditional press release or SEC filing. So we`ll have to see how this one plays out. That stock by the way Susie didn`t move much today on the notice although we did have plenty of other movement. Let`s get going with our \"Market Focus\" here. As we saw the influence of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that it can have on the broad market really continue today with the major indices closing mix. The jobs data helped the S&amp;P 500 start in the green but the early gains disappeared as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares sank. The index climbed into positive in the afternoon and was able to finish up a 0.03 of a percent. Trading volume slowed, 605 million on the big board, 1.6 billion shares on the NASDAQ.</p><p>The materials and financials sectors gained 0.08 of a percent. The energy sector up 0.07 of a percent. Technology was the big drag, thanks once again to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AAPL. Over the past week here it is, gone from almost $600 per share down to $533. That`s down about 9 percent. Looking at it longer term in the last year, the sell-off with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) now about $8 above that mid-November low. Several theories behind the stock drop: profit taking, disappointment over no special dividend and more fundamental concerns about Apple`s business growth.</p><p>Two other big tech stocks under pressure. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling 1 percent, just pennies tonight above its low for the year. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems falling 0.07 of 1 percent. The firm repeated today its previous earnings growth forecast.</p><p>Big banks, they were on the upswing though with further improvement in the job market, and ahead of next week`s Federal Reserve meeting with expectations building for the possibility of more economic help. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) jumped 2.6 percent, its highest price since early November. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added another 1.8 percent. That`s an 18-month high for shares of B of A.</p><p>A big global energy deal one step closer to reality tonight. Late today Canada OK`d the buyout of Nexen (NYSE:NXY) Energy by Chinese energy giant C-NOOC. It`s a $15.3 billion deal, representing another foreign expansion by a Chinese energy company. Canada`s ministry of industry said C-NOOC agreed to quote, free market principles. The buyout offer for Nexen (NYSE:NXY) came back in July. In today`s regular session, the stock was heavily traded falling 6.6 percent. But after the Canadian OK, they jumped more than 14.5 percent in extended hours trading, around $27 per share. U.S. and British regulators still have to approve the deal.</p><p>Two years ago Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered $6 billion to buy daily deal website Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) before it went public. Groupon`s market value is half that tonight. Bloomberg reports there`s new take-over speculation. By whom we don`t know. The stock though jumped 23 percent. Volume doubled. Some of the buying could also be from traders who sold short the stock to profit as it was falling.</p><p>Four of the top five most actively traded exchange-traded products were higher. The lone hold-out the NASDAQ 100 tracking fund, which does include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after all. The fund was down 0.06 of 1 percent today. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Job growth is one reason tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" thinks the economy will pick up speed next year and so will stocks. Mark Luschini back with us, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. Always great to see you Mark. So the job market that we saw today improving in the last month but still slow. Do you think it`s going to pick up the pace of that improvement next year and why?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Well we do, Tom. The fact of the matter is we`ve been seeing steady if unspectacular job growth for the better part of 2012, job growth averaging roughly 150,000 or so a month. We think on the back of an up tick on several factors here that we`re looking forward to improve in 2013, we could see a modicum of an up tick in job growth.</p><p>HUDSON: Among those other improvements you see consumers paying down debt as beneficial to the economy. Doesn`t that lead to less demand, less consumer spending?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We think it`s bringing up their balance sheet.</p><p>HUDSON: Which is a good thing.</p><p>LUSCHINI: It is a good thing. All this (ph) leads to a much healthier foundation upon which consumption can be built which is all important in the economy.</p><p>HUDSON: Where are we in that de-leveraging cycle do you think, closer to the end?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I think it`s advanced. I think it`s probably a 2015-16 phenomena before we get trend but nonetheless, well off the peak in 2006.</p><p>HUDSON: Businesses meantime are not necessarily de-leveraging. They don`t necessarily have to. They have a lot of cash out there but they`re not spending it. You think they`re going to less loose some of that cash. We`ve heard so much uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and companies holding back. How are those two related?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I think the fiscal cliff ultimately is going to be rendered into a fiscal slow. Between now and then the uncertainty is really paralyzing CEOs and companies from big to small. You can see it in the core capital goods orders which have basically fallen off in the last two quarters indicative of holding that business investment and hiring back which we think will change once we have some certainty brought into that equation.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally housing which has shown remarkable stability here, an uptick in several markets but there`s talk about limiting mortgage deductions with the fiscal cliff negotiations sometime next year. Couldn`t that impact the recovery?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It could. Obviously it might be relegated to more affluent households in terms of the ability to do a deduction either in full or part. But at the end of the day there`s still a large swath of household formation that is occurring that`s going to drive I think perspective homeowners into the market regardless.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s get to the pics here. You do like housing stocks with the home builders ETF. What do you anticipate? They`ve had a nice run already.</p><p>LUSCHINI: They`ve been terrific.</p><p>HUDSON: Put new money to work?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We turned bullish about a year ago and they`ve doubled or better and yes we would. They may be subject to profit taking but nonetheless we still think we`re in the early innings of the house recovery.</p><p>HUDSON: You also like technology. Is this a play on your business investment expectations for next year?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It is, if business wallets open up we expect the destination for some of that money to go towards more productivity enhancing tools and they`ve been under investing in technology now for several years.</p><p>HUDSON: What about that transition from the PC to tablets and smart phones? Does that concern you at all about traditional technology terms firms?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It does a little bit. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is intriguing and then really the sweet spot of that. The fact of the matter is though it`s an interesting company that is trying to make itself into more of a tablet or a smart phone oriented company. In the meantime they get paid an enormous dividend yield to wait.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking of which, I know you like dividend stocks. The last time we spoke to you July 6, you liked Conoco Phillips and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Both of them in terms of just the stock price appreciation up by single digits percentage terms. You still like them.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Very much so. Battleship companies good places to be in, in health care and energy and again a very handsome coupon (ph) which is think is going to matter to total return.</p><p>HUDSON: Do you own everything that we mentioned tonight?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We do.</p><p>HUDSON: Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Mark Luschini. He`s with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Thanks Tom.</p><p>GHARIB: And it`s often said that in life, it`s not the destination that counts, but the journey. This week Lou`s been thinking about journeys and their not so straight lines. Here`s author and educator, Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: How many of you are now doing what you thought you`d be doing when you first went to work? I`ll guess maybe about 25 percent. I was reminded of this recently when I spoke to a group of dentists about leadership. We talked about how they got into dentistry because they liked working with their hands, they liked helping people. And now? Now, they also negotiate building leases and manage staffs and cope with shrinking reimbursements and the soft economy. My first job as a manager involved leading 17 people in a television news department.</p><p>One day, one of my old college friends surprised me by asking: how does it feel to be out of the news business? I only later realized he meant that all of us who have the privilege of leading others soon realize that leading is our job. That once-straight line we visualized where our skills were needed has zigs and zags in it. The skills we now need to learn and hone and practice have changed. It`s a wonderful honor to be at the top of an organization, but that old concept of straight to the top, that`s not how it is. Not by a long shot. I`m Lou Heckler.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, we want to let all of you know that we`ve posted an extended version of our conversation with NBR founding anchor Paul Kangas from yesterday. It`s on the web at nbr.com and have a great weekend everyone and Tom, it was great seeing you yesterday as well.</p><p>HUDSON: Great to have you in south Florida Susie with Paul as well, a lot more viewer questions on that extended video at nbr.com. Have a great weekend and we`ll see you back here nest week.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Susie Gharib.  The unemployment rate drops to a four year low as U.S.   businesses add 146,000 jobs in November.  We look behind the numbers.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Good evening.  I'm Tom  Hudson.  We meet the CEOs of three small businesses hiring right now.  What  they do and why they're looking for help.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  And House Speaker Boehner accuses President Obama of wasting  another week in the fiscal cliff negotiations.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  That and more coming up on a Friday night edition here on  NBR. </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  The job market is proving to be surprisingly resilient.   American employers hired 146,000 workers in November, much more than  expected.  And the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent.  That's the  lowest level since December of 2008.  As Erika Miller reports, that wasn't  the only surprise in today's report.  </p><p/><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Almost no one on  Wall Street saw this good news coming.  There was every reason to think  hiring would be weak last month.  After all, many parts of the east coast  are still recovering from devastation caused by super storm Sandy.  </p><p/><p>  BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN:  I think the most likely  explanation here is that Sandy's impact was significant but was so short- lived that it didn't extend to the sample period of the employment report  which was the week that covered November 12.  </p><p/><p>  MILLER:  Hiring was also supposed to be weak due to worries about the  fiscal cliff.  With $600 billion in tax hikes and government spending cuts  set to start next year, why aren't more firms postponing hiring decisions?  </p><p/><p>  JULIA CORONADO, CHIEF N. AMERICA ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS:  What we're  hearing from businesses is that it is really hard to actually pull back  hiring right now, because they've already fired so many workers, gotten so  lean that it's really difficult.  </p><p/><p>  MILLER:  But not all the surprises in the report were good.  At 7.7  percent, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level since December 2008.   But that was mostly due to people giving up their search for work.  And  there's another disappointing trend, weak wage growth.  </p><p/><p>  KASMAN:  What we are not seeing is strong income generation.  The  slowing in wage gains -- the weak bargaining power of labor comes across in  this report. </p><p/><p>  MILLER:  So although the labor market is not getting worse, it's not  getting a lot better, either.  And there are plenty of risks that could  cause businesses to cancel projects, and hiring plans.  </p><p/><p>  CORONADO:  Clearly one of the biggest risks is that we don't see a  deal on the fiscal cliff or that they drag it out over a number of months  and that that really erodes confidence.  </p><p/><p>  MILLER:  Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve is trying to do  all it can to help the economy.  The central bank is widely expected to  announce an extension of its bond buying program when it meets next week.   Erika Miller, NBR, New York.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  With the fiscal cliff about three weeks away tonight,  Washington has not made much progress to avoid it.  At least that was the  assessment today from one of those directly involved in the talks, House  Speaker John Boehner.  The top Republican accused President Obama of quote,  slow walking the economy to the edge of the cliff.  He repeated his call  for the president to send to Congress a plan that can pass both houses.   Tax rates are still the major sticking point.  The president wants to raise  them for America's highest earners; House Republicans strongly oppose. </p><p/><p>  REP. JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER:  Instead of reforming the tax code  and cutting spending, the president wants to raise tax rates.  But even if  the president got the tax rate hike that he wanted, understand that we  would continue to see trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can  see.  Washington's got a spending problem, not a revenue problem.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Congress and the president now have about 24 days to reach a  deal before the fiscal cliff's tax hikes and spending cuts take effect.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Mark Zandi says bad things will happen to the economy pretty  fast if lawmakers don't settle the fiscal cliff issue.  He's chief  economist of Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.  So Mark, falling off the fiscal  cliff means bad things.  How bad?  </p><p/><p>  MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  It could be quite  bad, Susie.  I don't think it's cataclysmic if we get into January and we  haven't settled this, but if House makers haven't nailed this down by early  February, I think stock investors, bond investors will start to get very,  very nervous, start selling, risky businesses pull back and by the end of  February when we start approaching the ceiling for the debt limit, I think  we'll be back in recession.  It will be a fairly severe recession.  So  policy makers have a few weeks but not much more than that.  They have to  get this together.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Some people are saying that today's jobs report is very  encouraging and that you can look at this as a way that maybe the economy  can handle some tough belt tightening because things are looking a little  bit better.  How do you think the various parties, Republican and Democrats  will handle this jobs report in their fiscal cliff negotiations?  </p><p/><p>  ZANDI:  Well, you know, you're right.  Some folks look at this and say  the economy's strong enough.  It should be able to digest big tax  increases, spending cuts.  Others look at it and say look we still have a  very high unemployment rate, a long way to go to get back to full  employment.  The economy can't tolerate big tax increases and spending  cuts.  Like most political debates, the reality is in between.  We do need  to address our fiscal problem so we do need to go through some spending  cuts and we also need some tax revenue increases.  But we have to phase it  in over time, otherwise the economy will choke on that.  We can't have too  much restraint too quickly.  So we have to phase this in, smooth it in to  make it palpable for the economy.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  But until that happens, there is a lot of anxiety in the  labor market.  The big fear for many individuals and for investors is that  companies are going to start laying off workers.  We saw this week that  Citigroup (NYSE:C) announced 11,000 job cuts.  Is this the beginning of a  trend, Mark?  </p><p/><p>  ZANDI:  No, Susie, I don't think so.  I think if Washington can  reasonably address the fiscal issues and I'm still confident that they will  ultimately get it together.  There will be a fair amount of brinkmanship  but at the end of the day, they'll get it together.  If they're able to do  that when we get into next spring, I do think we're going to be in much  better shape.  Businesses are going to get their groove back.  Certainly  investors are going to be very happy about that.  By this time next year, I  think we should see a much better job market because the housing market,  which is already starting to turn should be in full swing.  So no, I don't  think businesses are going to pull back.  The only reason they would is if  Washington completely botches this.  At this point I don't think that's  going to happen.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  How do you think the Federal Reserve is going to read and  factor in today's jobs report?  They're meeting on Tuesday as you know.  Do  you think it's going to trigger any new response from the Fed?  </p><p/><p>  ZANDI:  Well, as you know the Fed's on high alert.  They've got their  foot to the accelerator.  They're now using open-ended quantitative easing,  buying long-term bonds and they're going to up the ante I think at the next  meeting in the coming week.  Operation Twist ends and they're going to  start rolling that into this quantitative even process.  So a lot of bond  purchases.  I think they're going to continue to do that until unemployment  is moving definitively lower and is much lower than it is today.  And most  importantly, they're going to wait and see how these things go in  Washington.  They're very nervous that policy makers aren't going to get  this right.  So as long as Washington's dithering I think the Fed's going  to be on high alert.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Absolutely.  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has been talking about  this for a while now.  Thanks a lot Mark, great talking about you.  We've  been speaking with Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics. </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Still ahead tonight, slow job growth does not discourage  tonight's \"Market Monitor.\" Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott tells  us why.  </p><p/><p>  The slow job growth we saw in November, growth but slow, didn't lead  to a lot of consumer cheer as December began.  The Reuters-University of  Michigan consumer sentiment survey fell early this month to its lowest  level we've seen since August.  So you add all this up here, the Dow  Industrials rose 81 points, the NASDAQ was down 11 with some further losses  in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, the S&amp;P 500 up four points.  A mixed week for  the major indices, the Dow Industrials, which does not include Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), gained 1 percent for the week.  With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  the NASDAQ fell 1.1 percent.  And the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.01 of 1 percent  gain since last Friday.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  One hundred of the small businesses behind the job growth  that we're seeing were honored last night in Washington with the \"Inc\"  magazine's \"hire power\" awards.  The businesses span the country and cross  an array of sectors.  Sylvia Hall met with three of the winners to talk  about their businesses and the one thing that they have in common:   success.  </p><p/><p>  SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  They work in  different states and in completely different fields.  But together, these  CEOs have added more than 1,500 jobs to the nation's economy over the past  three years.  This is Mike Derheim, who heads a Minnesota tech firm; Sharon  Virts Mozer, whose Virginia-based company runs administration for the  Federal government and Karl Schledwitz of Memphis, who's turned jerky and  hot dogs into opportunity.  (INAUDIBLE) seems to be kind of a mature  business.  How do you find growth there?  </p><p/><p>  KARL SCHLEDWITZ, CEO, MONOGRAM FOOD SOLUTIONS:  The actual space is  growing.  There are meat snacks, beef jerky really started growing with the  Atkins diet craze and it's probably quadrupled in the last two years.   We've been able to grow by buying under utilized manufacturing facilities  and centralizing the back office and putting robust sales operation  together filling up the plants.  And that creates employment and creates  more profitability.  It's no different than an office building or a  shopping center.  If it's half empty, it doesn't do very well cash flow  wise, but you take that same exact building and fill it up and it cash  flows.  </p><p/><p>  HALL:  You work with the Federal government.  Again, not exactly what  one would consider a growth market.  How have you been able to find growth?  </p><p/><p>  SHARON VIRTS MOZER, PRESIDENT, FCI FEDERAL:  We found that the demand  is going up just based on how the economy's going and the fact that people  want to be here in the U.S.  We've also found growth through our process  and our process takes what I call collaborative work forces and puts them  through a methodology in a training program that allows them to accomplish  great things.  </p><p/><p>  HALL:  Tell me just a little bit about this process.  </p><p/><p>  VIRTS MOZER: We hire typically high school graduates.  And we bring  them in and we assess their skills and their training and what they have to  offer.  We put them through a training program to train them towards a  particular task or a particular set of tasks.  </p><p/><p>  HALL:  One hundred nerds in 100 days.  Where did you get to the point  where you were on this nerd drive?  How did you get here and how is the  drive going?  </p><p/><p>  MIKE DERHEIM, CEO, THE NERDERY:  We started in November with our 100  nerds and 100 days program and just modeled actually very closely after a  PBS telethon member drive.  And the deal is that if you were known to us  and you get an interview we send you a hundred bucks.  If we end up hiring  the person we send you another 400 bucks and we're trying to get to a  hundred nerds in as many days.  As of right now, I think now we've had  about 900 applications submitted and we've hired 19 people.   </p><p/><p>  HALL:  What's the challenge for you specifically in hiring the people?  </p><p/><p>  DERHEIM:  The last I checked the unemployment rate for people in IT,  for people that I'm looking for was something like half of the national  average.  So above all there just aren't enough people who are out there  looking for jobs.  </p><p/><p>  HALL:  I just wanted to open it up and ask if hiring is a challenge -- </p><p/><p>  VIRTS MOZER:  (INAUDIBLE) associated with it and as a result credit  issues come up.  So finding folks that have the right attitude with good  credit particularly since we have a market or a set of work force that  often times they are suffering in a poor economy and they do need those  jobs but they have credit issues.  That's our biggest challenge but for the  most part, we have no problems in recruiting this particular market with  unemployment as high as it's been.  </p><p/><p>  DERHEIM:  I wish we had that problem.  We're exactly the opposite.   We're struggling all the time to figure out new ways to get more  applications in the door.  Just a different worker I guess but it's  different.  </p><p/><p>  HALL:  I wanted to go around and ask this about your growth prospects  for the next year.  </p><p/><p>  SCHLEDWITZ:  We hope to have more acquisitions this year and continue  to add to the plants that we're operating in.  So I don't, without an  acquisition, it would be 10-15 percent growth.  </p><p/><p>  VIRTS MOZER:  We're looking to grow by at least 500 if not 600 jobs by  the end of 2013.  </p><p/><p>  DERHEIM:  We are planning 25 percent a year revenue growth for 2013.   So we're definitely planning continuing to grow aggressively and  organically.  </p><p/><p>  HALL:  Thank you all so much and congratulations on your awards.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Calling it a robust investment in the region, the White House  today said President Obama would ask Congress for more than $60 billion in  aid for states impacted by hurricane Sandy.  Still that was less than the  $82 billion the states wanted for rebuilding.  Millions of homeowners and  businesses that were in the path of hurricane Sandy are now waiting for  checks as the long rebuilding effort begins.  Ruben Ramirez spent a day  with an insurance claim adjuster touring one of the hardest hit areas.  </p><p/><p>  RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's the calm  after the storm, empty streets, houses ripped from foundations, boats  sandwiched between homes, remnants of the famous Jersey shore boardwalk.  </p><p/><p>  KARL NEW, CLAIMS ADJUSTER, AMERICAN MODERN:  What makes this storm  different was the large amounts of sand that it brought with it.  So the  sand and the surge itself, it moved houses just like Katrina did, but it  just the sand is bad.  </p><p/><p>  RAMIREZ:  Karl New is one of about 30 claims adjusters American Modern  Insurance dispatched to New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.  For the  barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, it was north of the eye of the  storm but think of it like a windmill spinning counter-clockwise.  </p><p/><p>  NEW:  Seaside was hit with a 37-foot wall wave so that's a pretty big  wall that was coming in so you're talking water that's higher than that  building.  that's crashing in here and causing this much - and the force.   It's bringing sand.  It's bringing all that water in.  </p><p/><p>  RAMIREZ:  It took a month before insurance adjusters were allowed on  the island to assess the damage.  New inspected this property earlier this  week.</p><p/><p>  NEW:  The \"L\" shape all the way up top, everything is sagging down  from the weight of the sand that was pushing it and the water that was  pushing it out.  It pushed somebody's shed completely right into his house.   He got 5 1/2 feet of water in his house so everything on the first floor  needs to be completely gutted and taken out.  </p><p/><p>  RAMIREZ:  John Marchetti's house sits just two doors down closer to  the beach.  </p><p/><p>  JOHN MARCHETTI, HOMEOWNER:  I do have flood insurance (INAUDIBLE) and  flood.  Obviously everything that you see here is from the bottom. It's  from the flood.  </p><p/><p>  RAMIREZ:  Marchetti's insurer, NJM will take a loss of more than $300  million from Sandy, four times what it paid out from Irene last year.  It's  the largest loss in the company's history.  Industry estimates put the  total amount of damage from super storm Sandy at $50 billion.  Insurance  companies are expected to pick up about $10-$20 billion of that putting  super storm Sandy at the top of the list and ahead of hurricanes Ivan, Ike  and Irene.  Monday we will look at why rebuilding from Sandy is so  expensive thanks to where she came ashore.  Ruben Ramirez, Seaside Heights,  New Jersey.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  Back here on Wall Street, Tom, some interesting revolutions  from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) today saying that it got a Wells notice, is  being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  But behind  it is a very interesting debate going on.  The reason for the investigation  is that the CEO Reid Hastings had posted some information on his Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) page about developments at the company and the SEC said you  didn't disclose this properly. It should have been a press release.  It  should have been a filing with the SEC and it raises whole new questions  about social media and fair disclosure.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  This is all about how technology is changing and regulations  have such a hard time Susie keeping up with it.  We've see it with high  frequency trading for instance and now we're seeing with how companies  disseminate information using social media getting it out arguably to more  people faster than what a traditional press release or SEC filing.  So  we'll have to see how this one plays out.  That stock by the way Susie  didn't move much today on the notice although we did have plenty of other  movement.  Let's get going with our \"Market Focus\" here.  As we saw the  influence of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that it can have on the broad market  really continue today with the major indices closing mix.  The jobs data  helped the S&amp;P 500 start in the green but the early gains disappeared as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares sank.  The index climbed into positive in the  afternoon and was able to finish up a 0.03 of a percent.  Trading volume  slowed, 605 million on the big board, 1.6 billion shares on the NASDAQ.  </p><p/><p>  The materials and financials sectors gained 0.08 of a percent.  The  energy sector up 0.07 of a percent.  Technology was the big drag, thanks  once again to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AAPL.  Over the past week here it is,  gone from almost $600 per share down to $533.  That's down about 9 percent.   Looking at it longer term in the last year, the sell-off with Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) now about $8 above that mid-November low.  Several theories  behind the stock drop:  profit taking, disappointment over no special  dividend and more fundamental concerns about Apple's business growth.  </p><p/><p>  Two other big tech stocks under pressure.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  falling 1 percent, just pennies tonight above its low for the year.  Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems falling 0.07 of 1 percent.  The firm repeated today  its previous earnings growth forecast.  </p><p/><p>Big banks, they were on the upswing though with further improvement in  the job market, and ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting with  expectations building for the possibility of more economic help.  JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) jumped 2.6 percent, its highest price since early November.   Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added another 1.8 percent.  That's an 18-month  high for shares of B of A.  </p><p/><p>  A big global energy deal one step closer to reality tonight.  Late  today Canada OK'd the buyout of Nexen (NYSE:NXY) Energy by Chinese energy  giant C-NOOC.  It's a $15.3 billion deal, representing another foreign  expansion by a Chinese energy company.  Canada's ministry of industry said  C-NOOC agreed to quote, free market principles.  The buyout offer for Nexen  (NYSE:NXY) came back in July.  In today's regular session, the stock was  heavily traded falling 6.6 percent.  But after the Canadian OK, they jumped  more than 14.5 percent in extended hours trading, around $27 per share.   U.S. and British regulators still have to approve the deal.  </p><p/><p>  Two years ago Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered $6 billion to buy daily  deal website Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) before it went public.  Groupon's market  value is half that tonight.  Bloomberg reports there's new take-over  speculation.  By whom we don't know.  The stock though jumped 23 percent.   Volume doubled.  Some of the buying could also be from traders who sold  short the stock to profit as it was falling.  </p><p/><p>  Four of the top five most actively traded exchange-traded products  were higher.  The lone hold-out the NASDAQ 100 tracking fund, which does  include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after all.  The fund was down 0.06 of 1 percent  today.  And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p/><p>  Job growth is one reason tonight's \"Market Monitor\" thinks the economy  will pick up speed next year and so will stocks.  Mark Luschini back with  us, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.  Always great  to see you Mark. So the job market that we saw today improving in the last  month but still slow.  Do you think it's going to pick up the pace of that  improvement next year and why?  </p><p/><p>  MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT:    Well we do, Tom.  The fact of the matter is we've been seeing steady if  unspectacular job growth for the better part of 2012, job growth averaging  roughly 150,000 or so a month.  We think on the back of an up tick on  several factors here that we're looking forward to improve in 2013, we  could see a modicum of an up tick in job growth.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Among those other improvements you see consumers paying down  debt as beneficial to the economy.  Doesn't that lead to less demand, less  consumer spending?  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   We think it's bringing up their balance sheet.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Which is a good thing.  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   It is a good thing.  All this (ph) leads to a much  healthier foundation upon which consumption can be built which is all  important in the economy.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Where are we in that de-leveraging cycle do you think, closer  to the end?  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   I think it's advanced.  I think it's probably a 2015-16  phenomena before we get trend but nonetheless, well off the peak in 2006.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Businesses meantime are not necessarily de-leveraging. They  don't necessarily have to.  They have a lot of cash out there but they're  not spending it.  You think they're going to less loose some of that cash.   We've heard so much uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and companies  holding back.  How are those two related?  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   I think the fiscal cliff ultimately is going to be  rendered into a fiscal slow.  Between now and then the uncertainty is  really paralyzing CEOs and companies from big to small.  You can see it in  the core capital goods orders which have basically fallen off in the last  two quarters indicative of holding that business investment and hiring back  which we think will change once we have some certainty brought into that  equation.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Finally housing which has shown remarkable stability here, an  uptick in several markets but there's talk about limiting mortgage  deductions with the fiscal cliff negotiations sometime next year.  Couldn't  that impact the recovery?  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   It could.  Obviously it might be relegated to more  affluent households in terms of the ability to do a deduction either in  full or part.  But at the end of the day there's still a large swath of  household formation that is occurring that's going to drive I think  perspective homeowners into the market regardless.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Let's get to the pics here.  You do like housing stocks with  the home builders ETF.  What do you anticipate?  They've had a nice run  already.  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   They've been terrific.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Put new money to work?  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   We turned bullish about a year ago and they've doubled or  better and yes we would.  They may be subject to profit taking but  nonetheless we still think we're in the early innings of the house  recovery.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  You also like technology.  Is this a play on your business  investment expectations for next year?  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   It is, if business wallets open up we expect the  destination for some of that money to go towards more productivity  enhancing tools and they've been under investing in technology now for  several years.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  What about that transition from the PC to tablets and smart  phones?  Does that concern you at all about traditional technology terms  firms?  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   It does a little bit.  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is intriguing  and then really the sweet spot of that.  The fact of the matter is though  it's an interesting company that is trying to make itself into more of a  tablet or a smart phone oriented company.  In the meantime they get paid an  enormous dividend yield to wait.</p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Speaking of which, I know you like dividend stocks.  The last  time we spoke to you July 6, you liked Conoco Phillips and Johnson &amp;  Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).  Both of them in terms of just the stock price  appreciation up by single digits percentage terms.  You still like them.  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:   Very much so.  Battleship companies good places to be in,  in health care and energy and again a very handsome coupon (ph) which is  think is going to matter to total return.  </p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Do you own everything that we mentioned tonight?</p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:  We do.</p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Mark Luschini.  He's with  Janney Montgomery Scott.  </p><p/><p>  LUSCHINI:  Thanks Tom.</p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  And it's often said that in life, it's not the destination  that counts, but the journey.  This week Lou's been thinking about journeys  and their not so straight lines.  Here's author and educator, Lou Heckler.  </p><p/><p>  LOU HECKLER:  How many of you are now doing what you thought you'd be  doing when you first went to work?  I'll guess maybe about 25 percent.  I  was reminded of this recently when I spoke to a group of dentists about  leadership.  We talked about how they got into dentistry because they liked  working with their hands, they liked helping people.  And now?  Now, they  also negotiate building leases and manage staffs and cope with shrinking  reimbursements and the soft economy.  My first job as a manager involved  leading 17 people in a television news department.  </p><p/><p>   One day, one of my old college friends surprised me by asking:  how  does it feel to be out of the news business?  I only later realized he  meant that all of us who have the privilege of leading others soon realize  that leading is our job.  That once-straight line we visualized where our  skills were needed has zigs and zags in it.  The skills we now need to  learn and hone and practice have changed.  It's a wonderful honor to be at  the top of an organization, but that old concept of straight to the top,  that's not how it is.  Not by a long shot.  I'm Lou Heckler.  </p><p/><p>  GHARIB:  And finally, we want to let all of you know that we've posted  an extended version of our conversation with NBR founding anchor Paul  Kangas from yesterday.  It's on the web at nbr.com and have a great weekend  everyone and Tom, it was great seeing you yesterday as well.</p><p/><p>  HUDSON:  Great to have you in south Florida Susie with Paul as well, a  lot more viewer questions on that extended video at nbr.com.  Have a great  weekend and we'll see you back here nest week.  </p><p/><p> END</p><p/><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

But, traders say there`s no stopping prices at the pump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANTHONY GRISANTI, PRESIDENT, GRZ ENERGY: I think wholesale wise, you`re going to see $5 gas in a lot of areas of the country, especially the coasts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And this man is a big investor in Berkshire Hathaway stock. We took his pulse after Warren Buffett released his annual letter to shareholders. It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February 27.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. A pullback in oil prices today after days of spurting higher. There are still worries about Iran and supply disruptions, but Tom, those were overshadowed by concerns that the world economy is slowing.</p><p>HUDSON: At least for today Susie, the risk of higher prices still a concern though over the weekend at a meeting of the world finance ministers. Get you updated on today`s trading in New York, crude oil futures lost $1.21 to close at $108.56 per barrel. Still, U.S. oil prices are up 10 percent this year.</p><p>GHARIB: Those high prices have pushed energy stocks up as well. And, as Suzanne Pratt reports, there could still be time for investors to take advantage of the big move higher in big oil stocks.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: No matter where you pump, gas prices have been heading higher. And, that`s bad news for consumers and perhaps the whole economy and its fragile recovery. But, it`s been good news for big oil companies or super majors and their shareholders. So far this year, a closely watched energy sector ETF is up 10 percent moving almost in lock step with the rise in oil and gas prices. The question is whether oil stocks have more room to run. The answer depends on what happens here at the pump. Many factors affect oil company profits, including costs and environmental disasters. But, a big rise in prices plays the biggest role. One energy expert says what`s most important is that crude oil prices remain close to or above $100 a barrel.</p><p>ELIECER PALACIOS, ENERGY SECTOR SPECIALIST, MAXIM GROUP: A deep water well costs about $50 a barrel, $75 depending where you are. So, if you can sell your oil at $100 plus, it`s very positive for any of these companies.</p><p>PRATT: So, where are oil prices headed next? Energy trader Anthony Grisanti says that`s easy: higher.</p><p>ANTHONY GRISANTI, PRESIDENT, GRZ ENERGY: Number one you have the threat from Iran that`s being held over this market and number two, as far as refineries closing, you`ve had three of them close on the east coast. You`ve had a couple go down on the west coast. You`ve had some in Europe being shut down and these are shutdowns that are going to be permanent.</p><p>PRATT: Others aren`t so certain energy prices will continue to climb north. They believe geopolitical tensions will be less of a support for the market and then there`s the demand concern. Higher prices at the pump usually means people buy less gas, which in turn pushes prices lower. Still, others say one more reason to consider buying big oil shares these days is their dividends. On average they pay about 3 to 4 percent and those payouts come no matter what happens to oil prices. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: A potential new source for imported oil into the U.S. is trying again. Back in January, the Obama administration blocked Trans- Canada`s Keystone XL pipeline over environmental concerns. But the company today said it will start building the southern leg of that pipeline, running from the Cushing, Oklahoma oil storage hub to refineries on Texas` Gulf coast. The $2.3 billion project is smaller. It should be up and running by the end of next year. And since it does not cross international borders, it won`t be subject to a full-blown Federal environmental review.</p><p>GHARIB: Meanwhile, the trial to decide who should pay for the nation`s worst oil spill was delayed today. The one-week delay allows BP time to continue negotiations with the plaintiffs` steering committee. That committee represents condominium owners, fishermen, hotel and restaurant operators and others who say their livelihoods were damaged by the Deepwater horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill. Still, BP says there`s no guarantee a deal can be reached.</p><p>HUDSON: All this energy talk in the background, blue chip stocks once again tested the 13,000 mark on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Once again, the Dow failed to close above that level. Here`s how the day played out for the major indices, the Dow plunging over 100 points actually at the open and then coming back to life on a report that pending home sales showed a jump in the number of sales contracts signed last month. Still, the Dow did end the day down slightly as you saw, down about a point and a half, the NASDAQ rose two, the S&amp;P 500 was up about same amount.</p><p>After the closing bell, Greece was officially rated to be in default of its IOUs. S&amp;P cut Greece`s long-term credit rating to selective default. Earlier this month, S&amp;P warned it would make the downgrade if Greece was going to force its lenders to swap their IOUs for new ones, accepting less money. Greece is doing just that and now the selective default rating brings up questions if payments on bond insurance and derivatives will be triggered. Still ahead, tonight`s \"Word on the Street\" -- cloud. James Rogers of thestreet.com has three cloud computing stock picks looking for bright days.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of talk today about Warren Buffett and succession plans at Berkshire Hathaway where he is chairman and CEO. He gave some clues over the weekend when he released his annual letter to shareholders. Here are the highlights. On the topic of succession, Buffett said one individual has been chosen, but he didn`t identify the person. Buffett, who is 81 years old and his business partner Charlie Munger, 88, have no plans to step down. But Buffett did say the transfer of responsibility will be seamless when the time comes.</p><p>Buffett also reported that Berkshire`s fourth quarter profits fell 30 percent and 2011 earnings down 21 percent. But the company`s cash rose to $37 billion. On housing, Buffett said the market remains in a quote depression of its own and he was dead wrong predicting it would recover by now. On the topic of investing, stocks will outperform gold and bonds. And even though investors believe bonds are safe, Buffett says they are quote among the most dangerous of assets.</p><p>I turned to Glenn Tongue for some reaction and analysis. He`s managing partner at T2 Partners, where Berkshire Hathaway is its top holding. We began by talking about Buffett`s succession plan.</p><p>GLENN TONGUE, MANAGING PARTNER, T2 PARTNERS: I think it`s likely that Mr. Buffett running the company for another five years. However, if the unexpected happens and he`s not running the business tomorrow, it`s very comforting knowing that there`s someone in line to run the business.</p><p>GHARIB: But Glenn, why doesn`t Warren Buffett just name his successor? Why the mystery?</p><p>TONGUE: I don`t see why naming the individual today is a benefit to the company, to the shareholders. People that work with Berkshire Hathaway, companies that sell their businesses to Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway want to be dealing with him. They don`t want to be dealing with the next in line. They don`t want to be thinking about those issues. When Mr. Buffett is no longer running the company, then someone else will step into that role.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk about Berkshire Hathaway the company, how is it doing?</p><p>TONGUE: Fantastically well. The five most important operating businesses operated at record levels this year. He stated in the letter that they`re going to be generating $10 billion in profits next year, just an enormously profitable business.</p><p>GHARIB: So quarterly profits were down 30 percent for the year, 2011, also down.</p><p>TONGUE: If you look at each and every one of the operating businesses, whether it`s the utilities or the railroads or (INAUDIBLE) manufacturing businesses, they were all up year over year. They were all up quarter over quarter in terms of operations. So the underlying businesses are doing terrifically well. There`s some accounting conventions that are required, certain write offs and write downs, that made the earnings go down, but the cash flow of the company certainly went up and the operating performance has never been stronger.</p><p>GHARIB: But what Berkshire stock? The A shares have been trading at around $120,000 for two years now. What do you think?</p><p>TONGUE: We value Berkshire stock and we think it`s worth about $180,000 per share. We were buying Berkshire stock today very aggressively in the marketplace. It`s got the most powerful balance sheet of any company in America and it`s got earnings power that is growing very, very rapidly.</p><p>GHARIB: Would you be that optimistic if tomorrow Warren Buffett were no longer running the company?</p><p>TONGUE: When we value Berkshire Hathaway, there`s no element of the Warren Buffett premium that we throw into our valuation. We think if Mr. Buffett left the company, that people would still drink Coca-Cola tomorrow. The trains would still be running the next day and people would be ensuring themselves through Geico. So we value those elements of the business.</p><p>GHARIB: What`s your reaction to what Warren Buffett said about bonds as the most dangerous of assets? Do you agree with that?</p><p>TONGUE: Yes I agree with it. If you look at the interest rate that we`re getting on bonds today, it`s very, very low and if interest rates -- prevailing interest rates go up, the principal amount of the bonds will go down over time, so you`re going to lose purchasing power by investing in bonds today.</p><p>GHARIB: So Berkshire`s cash is now up to $37 billion. Is it time to pay a dividend, even though Buffett is not a fan of them?</p><p>TONGUE: I don`t think so. I think Warren Buffett can find better deals with the cash than the shareholders can with the dividends. He finds very unique opportunities like investing in preferred stock in Bank of America. It`s a fantastic deal that was available only to Berkshire Hathaway and only to Warren Buffett.</p><p>GHARIB: Glenn, thank you so much, really enjoyed talking with you.</p><p>TONGUE: Thank you Susie. I enjoyed it too.</p><p>HUDSON: Warren Buffett also today said that he would buy millions of single family homes if he could. 2,500 of them went on sale under a new Federal pilot program. The idea is to sell Fannie Mae-owned homes to private investors who want to use them as rental properties. As Darren Gersh reports, these homes may go fast.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Warren Buffett is not alone. Money-making ideas love company and large investors and private equity types already have hundreds of millions, maybe billions of dollars on hand to buy up foreclosed homes and rent them out. At Carrington Holding, Rick Sharga says the company is ready to buy 30,000 to 40,000 homes.</p><p>RICK SHARGA, EXEC. VP, CARRINGTON HOLDING CO.: I think we all agree with Warren Buffett. If we could buy millions of homes, we`d be doing that right now. There is a lot of capital that`s very interested in participating in a program like this.</p><p>GERSH: Like this, meaning a pilot program announced by Federal regulators who took charge of the troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when the companies were placed under government control. The Federal Housing Finance Agency today announced a test sale of 2,500 homes around the country. Focusing on cities from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and much of Florida, places where housing fell hard. But this is a tiny fraction of the 700,000 or so foreclosed homes now on the books of financial institutions. And here`s the problem: Warren Buffett wanna- be`s say they can`t find enough homes to buy now. Some banks may be holding off on selling, believing they can get a higher price. Others may not be carrying foreclosed homes on their books at realistic market prices.</p><p>SHARGA: And that could cause a lender or somebody else holding these properties to have to do a significant write down at the point that they execute the sale.</p><p>GERSH: As investors prepare to become big landlords, economist Dean Baker hopes regulators will be more creative. He`d like to see renters offered a chance to become old-fashioned American homesteaders.</p><p>DEAN BAKER, CO-DIR., CNTR. FOR ECONOMIC &amp; POLICY RSCH.: The basic idea is that you have someone come in and pay some nominal amount to buy it initially and then if they stay there and fix it up and pay their taxes, live in the place for five years, then it`s theirs.</p><p>GERSH: With private equity lining up to buy rental properties, critics worry the industry that caused the housing crisis is now preparing to profit from the destruction. But investors argue the bad actors have gone out of business.</p><p>SHARGA: It`s a popular sentiment that the same folks who got us into this mess are now going to profit on the way back. Fortunately, it`s not true.</p><p>GERSH: While Warren Buffett dreams of buying millions of homes, big investors have more modest hopes. They figure the market for big investors and private equity is about 200,000 foreclosed homes over the next two years. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: More housing headaches for bank of America. The giant bank was hit with a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today. It`s charged with discriminating against disabled homebuyers. The agency says B of A put unnecessary and burdensome requirements on disabled borrowers. In two separate states, borrowers complained saying they had to show medical records to prove their disabilities and detail their Social Security income. Bank of America says the cases came down to inconsistencies between Federal Housing Administration lending standards and conventional underwriting standards. And that it followed with stricter Federal standards which require more detail.</p><p>With fees rising and customer service falling, more Americans ditched big banks last year and moved their money to small banks and credit unions. JD Power and Associates surveyed 5,000 people who shopped for a new bank or bank account over the past year. Its defection rate for large, regional and midsize banks averaged as high as 11 percent last year, up sharply from 2010. Meanwhile smaller banks and credit unions lost less than 1 percent of their customers. That was far better than the near 9 percent defection rate those small shops saw a year ago. And Tom, surprisingly, bank stocks, big and small led the market higher today.</p><p>HUDSON: A lot of folks are putting their money into those bank stocks today, even though we got that news on how the customers have been behaving over the past year or so. Susie, let`s go ahead and take a look at what was going on with tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" Overall a mixed finished for the major stock indices on this Monday. The Dow Industrials as we mentioned earlier unable to stick above that 13,000 level. Stocks were able to bounce back though from the early session selling you can see on the left hand side of the chart, thanks to some encouraging signs in the housing market. Those pending home sales were up. We`ll talk more about those in a second. The Dow did dip into the closing bell though, ending with that small loss.</p><p>It was a trio of financial stocks though that were the best performers inside the Dow. JPMorgan and Bank of America each gaining two percent. American Express rallying more than 1.5 percent in the session. In the broad market, financials, yes were the strongest, no doubt about it, but the gains though pretty tame, under 1 percent. Financial discretionary sector was the second best today and even that was up only 0.3 of 1 percent gain, a muted gain for the day.</p><p>The jump in pending home sales -- purchases really helped spark some buying in home-related areas of the entire stock market. Pending contracts on those existing homes jumped 2 percent in January, up to their highest level in almost two years, bullishness there in real estate. That news on helped push up shares of Whirlpool to a seven-month high, jumping almost 7 percent. Volume was strong today trading in Whirlpool.</p><p>Paint maker Sherwin Williams also moving higher, up to a new high as a matter of fact with a 2 percent rally. Shares are up more than 26 percent in just the past year. Speaking of homes, home supplies retailer Lowe`s turned in earnings a nickel better than estimates. Similar to Home Depot`s quarter that we saw last week, Lowe`s benefited from mild winter weather allowing customers to start on those home improvement projects early. Shares of Lowe`s saw heavier than usual volume, but were up less than 1 percent.</p><p>Focus shifted after the close to online travel company priceline.com and the name your own price website continues to see some pretty big growth numbers. Check it out. Wall Street was expecting a big jump in earnings already from a year ago. Priceline did not disappoint. Results were more than $0.30 stronger than estimates. Both international and domestic travel bookings were better than expected. Priceline shares saw little movement during the regular session, but watch these tomorrow. They shot up more than 6 percent in after hour`s action to over $628 per share. If that holds tomorrow, it would be more than a decade high for PCLN.</p><p>A big bankruptcy in Japan may mean one less global maker of a commonly used memory chip for computers and that had shares of Micron jumping today here in the U.S. MU, the ticker symbol, jumped almost 7 percent to an eight-month high. El-Pida (ph) Memory in Japan filed for bankruptcy under the weight of some big loans coming due. Micron is the last U.S. space maker of what are called DRAM, dynamic random access memory chips.</p><p>While the overall energy sector cooled a bit today as we mentioned, we did see some buying in a giant oil driller as well as a master limited partnership based in nat gas. Driller Transocean rallied 5 percent. It reported a loss last quarter related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, indicating a possible settlement in that case may be coming. Cheniere Energy Partners meantime, the master limited partnership focused on liquefied natural gas jumped to a new 52-week high, up 12 percent. Private equity firm Blackstone is investing $2 billion to help the firm build a liquefied nat gas plant in Louisiana.</p><p>A lot of the commodity market focus has been on energy lately, who can blame them. But today soybeans really took the lead. Beans in the teens, you heard that phrase, the old saying at the Chicago Board of Trade and we`re there for the first time since last fall at least for the May futures contract. Beans jumping above $13 a bushel for the first time in five months. The market thinks that the South American harvest will be disappointing, while global demand for beans continues growing. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: And record help for the nation`s farmers in the form of crop insurance. U.S. farmers received $10 billion in crop insurance payments last year and with 5 percent of 2011 claims outstanding, that number could go higher. Drought in the great plains, spring flooding along the Mississippi River and crop-damaging freezes in the south pushed claims higher. The last record was in 2008. That`s when payouts topped $8.5 billion.</p><p>HUDSON: The forecast for technology is cloudy like cloud computing. The movement to on-demand software and data storage continues to pick up in a big way. That brings us to tonight`s \"Word on the Street\" -- cloud. James Rogers back with us now, technology editor at thestreet.com. James, Mr. Editor, nice to see you, congratulations on the new gig.</p><p>JAMES ROGERS, TECHNOLOGY EDITOR, THESTREET.COM: Thank you very much.</p><p>HUDSON: So tell us how cloud computing is different and how it`s changing?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, you know cloud computing has been one of the big textbook words of recent years and it`s a trend that`s really picking up. It`s becoming a mainstream technology. What is it? Basically there`s different forms of cloud. Cloud could be a business that say, accessing servers and storage capacity from a hosting company like Rackspace or it could be a business that`s using specialized software services, someone like salesforce.com where all of these areas are growing.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned two companies there, but first, EMC. This is kind of the granddaddy in the space, data storage and hardware. Share prices had a sharp rally in the past six weeks or so. What could fuel it higher?</p><p>ROGERS: EMC provides a lot of the core infrastructure that`s needed for these cloud service providers, could be things as you say like basic storage hardware or virtualization software from EMC is very, very popular, VMWare subsidiary. It`s got a lot of weapons in its arsenal, a lot of other things, data security, disaster recovery, data analytics and I think because of this bigger picture, it`s really in the sweet spot for the cloud. Cloud and demands for cloud services helped push EMC to record quarterly results recently, kind of continuing a consistent run of (ph) results from this firm. I think that EMC is actually one of tech`s best performers. It may not be the sexiest stock out there, but I think that there`s a lot more upside potential for investors here, particularly with the push towards the cloud.</p><p>HUDSON: EMC is kind of the soup to nuts, the old school cloud play here, 90 seconds left and I want to get to the other two. Software side, salesforce.com, CRM the ticker symbol. It`s had a heck of a quarter, has already said it`s got a record order on its books in this current quarter. How can it move higher?</p><p>ROGERS: I have salesforce down as one of the big tech rebound stocks for 2012 and I think it`s really starting to live up to that billing. This is a company that is really one of the first cloud trail blazers, and if you look at its resources, what we`re seeing is that salesforce is actually clinching more and more large enterprise deals, also its social enterprise strategy seems to be taking off. Now we`re concerned about this company`s growth potential last year, but I think that maybe we`re seeing a bit overblown. There`s a lot more growth to this firm.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally, 30 seconds on Rackspace, RAX the ticker symbol. This is really seen as the pure play in cloud. And the stock price kind of reflects that as the excitement has picked up in the last several weeks.</p><p>ROGERS: This is another company that`s come out strong results and like a lot of its competitors like AT&amp;T, Rackspace focuses solely on the cloud, really impressive reputation for customer support and also I spoke to some of the executives there recently and they were telling me that they`ve got a lot of new products planned for this year. And also on the financial side of the company, there`s a great price to earnings ratio so I think that there`s a lot of upside to have there.</p><p>HUDSON: A little bit of valuation play there in technology. Can you or do you own any of these stocks, James?</p><p>ROGERS: No, none whatsoever.</p><p>HUDSON: You can read James` article at the street.com. You can find a link on our website as well. It`s our guest this evening, James Rogers with the street.com.</p><p>ROGERS: Thank you, Tom.</p><p>GHARIB: As the nation gears up for primaries in Michigan and Arizona tomorrow, tonight`s commentator says there`s something she`d really like to see during this presidential race. She`s Maya Macguineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p><p>MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRES., CMTE. FOR A RESPONSIBLE FED. BUDGET: It`s campaign season and with campaigns come lots of promises. Last week, we released a report looking at how the Republican candidates campaign proposals would affect the country`s bottom line and we have also analyzed the president`s budget. Suffice it to say, we are on track for a whole lot of red ink.</p><p>So here`s my proposal. Once we get to the general election, we should have a debate focusing solely on fixing the budget. Each candidate would be required to put forth a plan to save $5 trillion over a decade with the full set of details. And it would give us, the voters, a chance to see what it really takes to create a responsible budget. We`d see what it takes if we don`t raise any taxes at all or cut them further as all the Republicans have proposed; and we see how much it would take in tax increases to cover all the new spending the president has proposed while also bringing down the deficit. Better yet, we might see what a more realistic proposal would look like. Maybe the candidates wouldn`t show up, maybe they would try to use funny numbers. But maybe, just maybe it would jumpstart the long overdue national discussion about what it will really take to fix the budget. I`m Maya Macguineas.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, from insider trading to Ponzi scheme, FBI investigations into financial crimes last year led to billions in court-ordered restitution. The Feds say they won more than 3,000 financial crime convictions last year, securing $12 billion in court ordered payouts. In some cases, the government itself was the victim through Medicare fraud. And the FBI leaned on Gordon Gekko himself or the actor who played him in the \"Wall Street\" movies to help fight financial crime. Michael Douglas stars in a new public service announcement warning investors about deals that are too good to be true.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow. We`ve got some new data coming out, the latest numbers on durable goods orders. We`ll see if that washing machine or couch that you purchased in January is adding to the economy. We`ll also get the latest on home prices, the S&amp;P Case Shiller home price index for December. Then, when it comes to the economy, it`s the economy and politics this fall, no doubt about it and we will take a look at campaign promises versus political realities.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday evening. Thanks for joining us. It`s February 27th. I`m Tom Hudson. Have a great night Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, hope you have a wonderful evening. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching everyone. Hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 17. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight.  Some cautious signs  of relief by investors around the world today.  There's a rescue plan in  the works for Greece. Jittery financial markets stabilized somewhat after  Germany agreed to a compromise deal to resolve the economic problems in  Greece.  U.S. stocks took that news and finished mixed today.  The Dow  Industrials was able to gain 42 points; the S&amp;P slipped more than seven,  rather the NASDAQ slipped more than seven.  The S&amp;P 500 gained almost four.  </p><p>  Now here's how things looked for what was a rough week for investors.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added almost 1.5 percent.  That snapped a  six-week losing streak.  The NASDAQ though didn't fare as well, falling 1  percent for the week.  The S&amp;P turned positive this week, ending a six-week  slide, adding just a fraction.  Despite today's market rebound of sorts in  America, investors are still worried about Greece.  As Suzanne Pratt  reports, Americans will be following the Greek drama closely for weeks to  come. </p><p>  SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Recently Greece  has gone from being viewed as a fabulous tourist spot to a thorn in the  side of U.S. stock investors. The question now is whether Greece and its  financial woes will dictate the direction of the American stock market for  the immediate future. NYSE trader Jonathan Corpina says it absolutely will  because investors hate uncertainty and Greece's financial outlook is far  from certain. </p><p>  JONATHAN CORPINA:  Until we have some stability, any information about  a plan or some sort of recovery that's put in place coming out of Europe  and Greece at that point then investors will feel much more confident to  get back in the market. Looking into today, markets are positive this  morning and leading into the afternoon due to the fact that the headlines  are coming our of Greece. </p><p>  PRATT: Market strategist Rick Bensignor agrees positive news out of  Greece is just as important for U.S. investors as negative. </p><p>  RICK BENSIGNOR, MARKET STRATEGIST:  If by chance something good out  over the weekend, a good headline or something like that, it wouldn't  surprise me if the S&amp;P was up 20, 25 points on Monday, the Dow up a couple  hundred points. Good news could easily turn the psychology very quickly. </p><p>  PRATT:  Still others say the issue right now for the U.S. stock market  is that it's in a bit of an information void. Reporting season for  corporate profits is still nearly a month away and lately there's been  little major U.S. economic data for investors to chew on. As a result,  every twist and turn across the pond with Greece and its weaker neighbors  gets extra special attention on U.S. trading floors.  And experts say  investors should expect Greece and its debt troubles to remain in the  headlines for some time. </p><p>  BENSIGNOR:  You can't fix it for good over the weekend. It's too big a  problem with too far reaching circumstances. And, it's not just Greece.  Greece is just the one in the headlines the most these days. But, there's a  likelihood that this stuff spreads to Ireland, Spain and Portugal. </p><p>  PRATT:   One thing many market pros agree on is if Greece defaults on  its government debt, it will mean big trouble for U.S. stocks. In fact,  some estimate major market averages could quickly lose as much as 15  percent. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>  HUDSON:  While Greece's debt woes are grabbing headlines tonight,  Italy's problems may be heating up. Late today, Moody's investor service  put Italy on review for possible downgrade.  Moody's is worried the country  won't be able to cut spending enough to reduce its debt.   </p><p>  Back here in the U.S. meantime, watch for slower economic growth.  That's what the International Monetary Fund predicts. The global lending  agency today said it thinks the U.S. economy will grow 2.5 percent this  year, 2.7 percent next year. Both are down from a previous estimate issued  just two months ago. The IMF's Jose Vinals says the U.S. and Eurozone  nations are playing with fire, unless they take steps to cut their budget  deficits immediately. </p><p>  JOSE VINALS, FINANCIAL COUNSELLOR, IMF:  Well, I think that the  biggest threat to global financial stability is that governments in various  countries may not have enough political resolve to take the important  measures which are needed to deal with the legacy of the crisis.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Vinals thinks that the global economy has gained ground  despite slowing recently.  He sees it accelerating in the second half of  the year. </p><p>  SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Let's check now at the  stories in tonight's NBR news wheel.   With jobs still scarce and gas  prices still high, consumers are feeling down. A new survey on consumer  sentiment from Reuters University of Michigan shows a drop in confidence.   The consumer sentiment index fell to 71.8.  Economists had expected a  higher, more positive number.  And more evidence today of just how grim the  job market is. The Labor Department says last month that the unemployment  rate fell in fewer than half of the nation's states. May's jobless rate was  down in 24 states, up in 13 and unchanged in 13, showing job growth has  stalled across much of the country. </p><p>  And still ahead on the program tonight, tonight's \"Market Monitor\"  takes on financial stocks.  Bernie Schaeffer tells us if he thinks the  year's worst performing stock sector is ready for a rebound.  He's chairman  of Schaeffer's Investment Research. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Exports have been a bright spot for the U.S. economy this  year, helping boost growth and create American jobs.  But new trade deals  with Panama, Colombia and South Korea have been stalled in Congress for  months on Capitol Hill. That standoff may end soon. Washington bureau chief  Darren Gersh spoke with U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk. Kirk also is  the former major of Dallas, Texas.  Darren began by asking why it's been so  hard to pass these trade agreements. </p><p>  AMB. RON KIRK, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, because you're in  Washington. And everything is, you know, everything is hard in this town.  But the reason that we took the time to look at Korea and Panama and  Colombia, not just from the standpoint of what does it take to pass them,  but look at them in the broader context, that what 95 percent of the  world's consumers somewhere other than the United States, part of our  success in the future is going to be linked to our ability to take more of  what we make, manufacture, innovate, create here in the U.S. and share it  with the world. And so within that, you've got to have a trade policy that  not only speaks to those that say hey, pass these agreements, get going, we  need the market access. But you've also got to have a trade policy that  reflects those that say we want to make sure our trade reflects our core  values, particularly how you ought to treat workers, not just here but also  around the world.  And that passing the agreements with trade adjustment  assistance gives us the best chance to have a balanced approach. </p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Right, but  Republicans argue that trade adjustment assistance which helps workers who  lose their jobs because of trade, they don't want it. They say that it's  not an effective program. They want to pass these agreements without it.  Why is that such a priority for the administration? </p><p>  KIRK:  Well, Democrats on the other hand say trade has become a primer  for shipping our jobs overseas.  And the trades, you know, the unfair trade  deals are the reason we've seen manufacturing and they don't want the trade  deals. Well, the reality and part of our challenge in this administration,  what President Obama tasks me to do is say we've got to find common ground.  There's no way we're going to disadvantage American exporters and  manufacturers by saying we're going to put us on less favorable terms in  these markets that other countries are getting. But at the same time, we  can't dismiss the concerns of those that have said honestly that a lot of  Americans, through no fault of their own, that happen to work for an  industry that may have been displaced by trade, they typically are 46 years  old, Anglo and the sole breadwinner of their family and they have good  skills. And if we can get them the training, the coaching that they need,  they can become reemployed. We not only save their job, we keep those  families intact. And in many cases we keep those communities intact. </p><p>  GERSH:  But really what this comes down to is how are you going to do?   How are you going to get this done because many of our biggest trade  programs are on hold right now, have expired. How are you going to get this  done and when? </p><p>  KIRK:  All along we have made a point.  Our goal was not just to pass  a trade agreement. We're trying to build a new paradigm and a new rationale  to the American public that is increasingly skeptical about trade, about  how we can do trade in a different way. And for us there has to be that  holistic approach that you combine new market access through trade  agreements with strong enforcement, which we've done at USTR and we reflect  our core values as represented by our commitment to trade adjustment  assistance. That's how you get it done. And we're closer than I think most  people think we are. </p><p>  GERSH:  The president has set a goal of doubling exports, but  everybody else in the world has set a goal of expanding exports.  Everybody  can't export their way out of their problems. How is it going to work? </p><p>  KIRK: We can, it is work. And the one good thing is you know the  president laid out that marker two years ago and remarkably we're well on  pace to meeting that. One of the things helping to drive our economic  recovery is the reality that exports and only 13 percent of our GDP are  contributing almost as much to our economic recovery as consumer spending. </p><p>  GERSH:  Well, U.S. trade representative and Mavericks fan Ron Kirk,  thank you very much for your time. </p><p>  KIRK:  Huge Mavericks fan.  Thank you.</p><p>  GHARIB: And a U-turn today for one of the nation's most powerful  lobbies.  AARP, which represents millions of older Americans said it is  open to modest cuts in Social Security benefits for future recipients. The  group has been a leading opponent of cutting benefits. But AARP now says it  wants to limit any changes in benefits, while making sure the system  remains solvent. </p><p>  Well, Tom, it was a choppy week to be an understatement. And now  investors have a weekend to think things over and start all over again on  Monday. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Start all over again and of course always looking to Europe  over the weekend, really, for the clues that we're going to see on Monday.  But it was quite a day today here, Susie. Let's go ahead and roll with  tonight's \"Market Focus.\"  We had a mixed finish for the major indices for  the second day in a row. Investors still trying to balance the threat of  European government debt against the consistency of lower energy prices  that we've seen over the past several sessions. Let's start by updating  where the S&amp;P 500 is in relation back to its March low. There's that March  low that we had back in the spring. This remains an area of key technical  support and so far, it is holding as we can see with the fractional rise  we've got with in the S&amp;P index.  It bounced off that level.  The market  has held above that March low, so far optimistic. </p><p>  The slide in oil prices meantime, here's what the last 90 sessions in  the front month crude oil contract in New York looked like. Crude here  falling today another 2 percent. This is the lowest price that we've seen  since February.  Energy prices -- that may help the broad market lower  prices, but it hurt energy stocks. Drilling company Nabors falling almost 4  percent. Oil producer Hess (NYSE: HES) dropping 1.5 percent. That's a new  2011 low for Hess (NYSE: HES). And equipment company National Oilwell Varco  shed just over 1 percent. These were the leading energy stock losers today  in that sector. </p><p>  Technology stocks also weak and check out Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) here.  Continues to see money coming out of its share price, sinking another 3  percent today. This is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)'s lowest price that we've seen  in many months since September of last year.  An analyst at investment  banking firm Raymond James reports that paid online search spending is  slowing down for the industry.  Clearly that's taken a chunk out of Google  (NASDAQ: GOOG).  Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)'s smartphone operating system  Android is part of the challenge for Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)'s  Blackberry.  RIMM shares just got crushed today, very active trading.  Look  at this, 21.5 percent lower, losing more than a fifth of its value. This is  just the past 30 sessions where you see the trend lower and then just  falling off a shelf today. Volume exploding because of that sour outlook  that we told you about last night. Let's pull out to the past five years,  showing this recent drop really in context and here it is over the past  several months with RIMM, now in fact below the March of '09 low.  Remember  this is the low for the broader market. We're seeing prices here in RIMM 27  3/4. We haven't seen that since the fall of 2006.  Now we do have an  analysis of Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)'s chart on our website.  Go  to NBR on pbs.org.</p><p>  A couple of other big tech stocks that are in the Dow Industrial  index. Cisco dropping another half percent, just pennies above its most  recent 52-week low. The company has struggled with disappointing guidance  trying to restructure. Cisco is the worst Dow stock this year.  Since  January, we've got it down 25 percent. </p><p>  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) meantime the best Dow stock today with a 1.2  percent rally.  It's also though negative for the year as it continues to  trend lower for tech. The worst stock sector this year, financials, not  today though.  Real estate service firm CB Richard Ellis jumping more than  4.5 percent.  Tennessee-based bank First Horizon gaining almost 4 percent.  And Zion bank out of Utah up about 3.5 percent, helping out the financials.  According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" PNC Financial meantime is the  winner in the bidding war for the U.S. retail operation of Royal Bank of  Canada.  No confirmation.  Here's PNC shares trending lower here, along  with the rest of the financial sector, slipping almost 3 percent.  Heavy  volume, this is the lowest price of PNC since December. </p><p>  The \"Journal\" also reports securities regulators are considering civil  charges against credit rating agencies. Moody's shares dropping 5 percent  on this news.  Parent company of Standard &amp; Poor's, McGraw-Hill falling 3.6  percent.  </p><p>  We saw a trio of new stocks going public this week, get you updated  here, a couple of high profile issues. Bankrate.com sold its stock at $15  today for the first time, rising a tad. Internet radio provider Pandora  Media started at $16.  It's below that IPO price tonight. And oil and nat  gas services company Compressco Partners began at $20 and it slipped from  there.  That is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>  GHARIB: Former Washington Mutual CEO Kerry Killinger and other top  Wamu executives are in talks with the FDIC to settle a nearly $1 billion  lawsuit filed against them. Killinger has until to the end of this month to  respond to the FDIC's complaint against him. Regulators allege Wamu  executives took extreme risks with the bank's mortgage portfolio, which led  to the largest bank failure in U.S. history. </p><p>  Meanwhile, another former bank executive is headed to prison for eight  years. Catherine Kissick (ph) used to head a mortgage division at the now-  defunct Colonial Bank. She learned her punishment today. Prosecutors say  Kissick's role in a $3 billion fraud scheme led to Colonial's demise, as  well as to Taylor Bean and Whitaker -- one of the nation's largest private  mortgage companies. Taylor Bean's former chairman and owner Lee Farkas (ph)  is due to be sentenced later this month. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Here's what we're watching for next week. Our scheduled  Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Alan Lancz.  He's editor of the \"Lancz  Letter.\"  The Federal Reserve will be back in the spotlight.  It begins a  two-day meeting on Tuesday next week. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a  news conference on Wednesday.  Monday on the program, creating jobs during  challenging economic times. We talk to state leaders about what the role of  government should be. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Food prices will likely head higher over the next decade.  That's what the United Nations and the Organization for Economic  Corporation and Development are predicting.  The reason - rising  commodities prices and demand. The groups fear that higher food prices will  hurt the world's poor who already spend as much as 80 percent of their  income on food. </p><p>  HUDSON:  The fight against Medicare and Medicaid fraud goes high tech  next month. That's when the Federal government begins using new software  aimed at flagging would-be criminals before they get a check from Uncle  Sam.  Medicare has awarded a $77 million contract for the new system to  defense giant Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) and a group of companies.  They'll use technology that's similar to that of banking and  telecommunication companies to spot fraud. </p><p>Greece, jobs, housing. There is no shortage of worries for investors  and that may be one reason to get more optimistic.  So says tonight's  \"Market Monitor.\"  Bernie Schaeffer back with us, chairman of Schaeffer's  Investment Research, publisher of the \"Option Advisor Market Letter.\"   Always nice to see you Bernie. Welcome back. </p><p>  BERNIE SCHAEFFER, CHMN., SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH: Thank you,  Tom. </p><p>  HUDSON:  It was January when you were here last and you said that the  market was in a disbelief rally. Investors just didn't believe that stock  prices deserved to move higher. We're in essentially the same place in the  market today than we were back in January. What about the market rally? </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:  Still in disbelief. Got another magazine cover from \"Time\"  recently, June 20th dated, talking about what economic recovery question  mark, still no major end close equity mutual funds. Something interesting  right here and now is the market is at a point, all the major averages are  flat for the year. Very often you find that when you reach a benchmark like  that, just as we did in March, it is time for a rally. People look to come  in at points like that. </p><p>  HUDSON:  One of the places that has fueled this move back to flat is  the financial space. The financial stocks are always seen as market  leading. It's clearly led the market lower over the past six weeks. It's  the worst performing sector so far this year. Are you saying, if the market  can move higher from here, that bank stocks will as well? </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:   I think the bank stocks are an interesting short. And an  interesting put by, simply because you mentioned that people were looking  at the bank stocks and people were quite bullish on the bank stocks.  Analysts are still extremely bullish.  There are big fund planners in there  if the sector had not been able to get out of its own way. </p><p>  HUDSON: So you are bearish on banks? </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:   I bearish. This is the slope of hope that sectors decline  on until you get the capitulation stage. So I think there is still a good  short trade shaping up in the banking sector even though I'm bullish on the  overall market. </p><p>  HUDSON:  You are using options here to play the downside that you  expect in banks looking at the XLF, ticker symbol for the I shares,  financial select. Here is the options trade, buy January 2012 at the money  puts, the option to sell, a bearish call. It profits if this exchange- traded fund falls. It has clearly fallen a lot already. And you are  expecting it to what move into the single digits, perhaps? </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:   That would be a home run on this option trade but you  know, even if you got a 25 percent decline, that would be a very nice gain.  And it's a good hedge for a sector that you might be bullish on. </p><p>  HUDSON:  So noted. You do like consumers and at least consumer stocks,  specifically retail stocks. Here is the S&amp;P retail exchange-traded fund,  the XRT.  You are looking at again January 2012 calls, a bullish call, an  option to buy this exchange-traded fund. If the XRT moves up at the  rallies, this option rallies in price as well. What's fueling retail? </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:   What's fueling the retail stocks is kind of the opposite  of what the banking and financial stocks are having trouble with. The  actual price action has been strong. Despite the fact that Wall Street is  very skeptical on these stocks and so what that means is, this is the wall  of worry that bullish sectors and markets climb. It means that sideline  money is being drawn in reluctantly but steadily into sectors like  retailers whose price action and earnings is positively surprising and  potentially out of sectors like financial where the results are negatively  surprising and the expectations are high. </p><p>  HUDSON: That is your set-up for the next six months. Six months ago  when you were here you had a couple of options plays. Let's look how these  have turned out. You were essentially bullish on the I shares Russell 2000  exchange- traded fund, August at the money calls. The option price though  is down 43 percent as the exchange-traded fund essentially has gone  nowhere. So time decay is what option traders call this. Do you still like  this? </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:   Yes. And time decay versus leverage is the conundrum of  making money in buying options. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Meantime this one was a big strikeout. You lost all your  money with the June at the money calls for the iPath S&amp;P 500, VIX exchange- traded note.  Essentially you were looking for volatility as a hedge which  has actually gone down in the last six months even though it has ticked up  here lately in the past few weeks. </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:   Right. And I would rather hedge sector to sector as we  are talking about today.</p><p>  HUDSON: So noted.  What about disclosures for these options? </p><p>  SCHAEFFER:  I don't have positions in the XLF or XRT exchange-traded  fund. </p><p>  HUDSON: We're going to catch up in six months. Nice to see you again.</p><p>  SCHAEFFER:   Great, pleasure.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Bernie Schaeffer, Schaeffer Investment Research. </p><p>  GHARIB: And finally tonight, the author who got kids and parents  reading together has something new, but it's not a book. Harry Potter  author JK Rowling will soon unveil her latest venture and all we know so  far is that it's called Pottermore and it won't be a book. The site has few  details, but links to a countdown clock marking the days and hours until  the launch Tom and media watchers are speculating that the big announcement  will be about some sort of online \"Harry Potter\" experience, perfect thing  for you to do with your two boys. </p><p>  HUDSON:  I tell you. We're not quite there yet for the Harry Potter  books but we will be in just a short few years, Susie. That is NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday night, June 17.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great weekend, you as well Susie. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Same to you Tom and a happy Father's Day to you and all the  other fathers in our audience.  I'm Susie Gharib.  Hope to see all of you  again next week. </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Susie Gharib. Only 80,000 people got jobs in June, way below estimates. But the news isn't all bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: I'm Tom Hudson. Employment is the issue this election season. Tonight we'll hear what the presidential candidates say about today's job numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And it's infected thousands of computers already. Are you ready for Monday's web attack?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more coming up tonight right here on NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: Another lousy jobs report today. American businesses were hiring in June, but not a whole lot, Tom and stocks sold off on the news.</p><p>HUDSON: A lackluster report here Susie, this is three straight months now of weak hiring, showing the U.S. economy obviously still struggling. U.S. employers added just 80,000 jobs. That's certainly less than the 100,000 jobs expected. The unemployment rate meantime unchanged, 8.2 percent. That's stuck pretty much in the same level for most of this year. Investors clearly hoping for some stronger job growth, pushing down stocks in reaction to the disappointment. At the bell, the Dow was down 124 points. The NASDAQ fell almost 39, the S&amp;P was off nearly 13. So between the weak jobs data and European worries, caution remains the business plan for many companies.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: CEOs might continue to play things fairly close to the vest. We know they're holding elevated cash levels and they're going to therefore potentially defer business investment and hiring which once again feeds back into maintaining a slow pace of economic growth in the U.S. going forward. So we need animal spirits to be rekindled here through greater certainty about what the future looks like than what we have today.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark Luschini is tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest. We'll talk more with him later in the program. But first tonight, Suzanne Pratt takes a deeper look at today's employment report.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When the economy creates 80,000 new jobs in one month, it's good enough to keep us from slipping into another recession, but not good enough to chip away at that pesky unemployment rate. In the first quarter of this year, employers added an average of 225,000 jobs. But in the second quarter, the average downshifted to a disappointing 75,000. Some economists credit warm winter weather for the early boost in hiring, saying it robbed jobs from the spring. But no matter how you slice it, the economy is slowing and businesses are afraid to commit to new workers.</p><p>CONRAD DEQUADROS, SR. ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS: The debt crisis in Europe has the potential to dip the U.S. economy back into recession, although that's unlikely, it's probably a concern for businesses. And secondly we have a lot of uncertainty related to tax policy and fiscal issues this year.</p><p>PRATT: Today's weak data sparked new debate about what more the Federal Reserve can do to help. To some, a new round of bond buying, known as QE3, looks like a strong possibility.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE WEALTH MGMT.: It has to put quantitative easing on the table and it has to be a viable option for the Federal Reserve. Did this report basically tell us that the economy has completely falling off the cliff, not really. But it's certainly telling us that we're not making much progress.</p><p>PRATT: Still, not all of the June labor snapshot was doom and gloom. Average hourly wages gained $0.06 and so did the amount of time spent on the job by one tenth of an hour or six minutes. Both suggest support for consumer spending, particularly as lower gas prices puts more money into peoples' wallets.</p><p>DEQUADROS: This is sort of the strongest income increase that we've seen or implied income increase from the employment report since February. And then on top of that, it's an increase that's in real terms because we have prices that are falling.</p><p>PRATT: Against this backdrop, there is some optimism about the labor market in the second half of this year. Many expect a pickup in job growth, but not enough to bring the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Our next guest sees a silver lining in today's gloomy jobs numbers. He's Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Mark, it's hard to be positive these days . What is it that you're seeing in the labor market that gives you some hope?</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well Susie, let me say that was a disappointing number and the reporter was right. If we stay at 80K, unemployment will rise and that an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, that will be very uncomfortable. So we need to see better numbers and I think we will. I think American businesses are in good shape. They've reduced their cost structures, their profit margin are as wide as they've ever been. They're as profitable as they have ever been. Their balance sheets are very strong. They've reduced debt. So in my mind, it's not a question can American businesses invest and hire more? It's a matter of confidence. They're still very very nervous and that's the missing ingredient here is those animal spirits that the other economists were talking about.</p><p>GHARIB: At the beginning of this year, businesses were hiring at a very rapid clip, 200,000 people plus a month but not any more now and that's just worrying a lot of people. When do you see the hiring picking up and what's going to motivate and drive companies to do more hiring?</p><p>ZANDI: You make a good point and just to reinforce it, we were creating 250,000 jobs per month back in December, January, February. The last three months we've been creating less than 100,000 per month. Both overstate the case. We weren't going nearly as strongly earlier in the year and we're not as weak currently. The reality is somewhere in between and I think that will become more evident as we make our way through the summer and into the fall months. I really don't think businesses are going to fully engage and really let loose and begin to hire in a more aggressive way until we nail down our fiscal situation. We've got a number of significant fiscal issues we have to solve after the presidential election and also not until we get more clarity with respect to what's happening in Europe. Europe is still a very serious threat to our economy and I think that's making people very nervous and businesses is forestalling more business hiring.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of CEO's and business people that I've been talking to are really spooked out by what's going on in Europe. You were just there. From the people you talked to while you were in Europe, what was your sense of their seriousness about an action plan and a timetable to fix their situation and get the economy growing over there?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, you know, it's a bit discouraging because there's just no consensus with respect to how it's going to play out. You talk to one person and you get one story and another person a totally different one. I was encouraged by the fact that in general I think there was consensus with regard to what needs to get done. In fact, a few of those things actually got done at the end of last week when the EU ministers met and we got some action. I do think it's a process and I think this process is going to take place over the course of the next couple years. And so we're going to be facing several rounds if not more of financial market turmoil. That's going to be what's necessary to generate the political will to make the changes that they need to, but at the end of the day Susie, I think they will and once that become clear, that's when American businesses I think will get going and we'll see more hiring.</p><p>GHARIB: OK. We'll leave it there. Mark thank you so much for coming on the program. We appreciate it. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.</p><p>HUDSON: Election 2012 now, there's one thing investors and politicians have in common: they both watch closely the monthly jobs' report for clues about the future. And in this election season especially, the jobs data could determine the winner. Here's Darren Gersh in Washington.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Even the president did not seem particularly satisfied with today's jobs report. Mr. Obama said the employment numbers were moving in the right direction but quickly added --</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to get back to a time when middle class families and those working to get into the middle class have some basic security. That's our goal, so we've got to grow the economy even faster.</p><p>GERSH: Whether or not we are moving in the right direction fast enough is the critical question for the election. Political scientists believe most voters begin to make up their minds about the president's handling of the economy right now in the six months or so before casting their votes.</p><p>WILLIAM GALSTON, SR. FELLOW, BROOKINGS: So I would say after another two jobs reports, the summer reports, July and August reports, by Labor Day, I think a lot of people are going to have made up their minds.</p><p>GERSH: Republican challenger Mitt Romney urged voters not to wait that long. He blamed the poor jobs' report on high taxes and burdensome regulation.</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The president's policies have not gotten America working again and the president's going to have to stand up and take responsibility for it.</p><p>GERSH: There may still be some spillover in this jobs' report from strong hiring over the warm winter. If that's the case, job creation could bounce up a little in the coming months, perhaps averaging 150,000 jobs a month. But even that might not be enough good news to sway voters.</p><p>HEIDI SHEIRHOLZ, ECON., ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Obama or any other incumbent politician, they are really going to want to see stronger job growth between now and November. I don't necessarily think that we are going to see the numbers that will bring the unemployment rate down in a substantial way in the next few months.</p><p>GERSH: So Tom that means that the president will head into the election day with the unemployment rate still painfully high.</p><p>HUDSON: Darren, voters want to know what is the policy to get more Americans back to work faster? The president's been talking about patience not being satisfied and Governor Romney has been criticizing the president. So what are the policies to get more Americans back to work?</p><p>GERSH: Well today the president was looking backwards a little bit defending the auto bailout saying that it accounted for saving a lot of jobs in Ohio, a few swing states, a lot of auto workers there. President's also been pushing still for infrastructure spending. He says a lot of unemployed construction workers, need to get them back to work. He talked about support for state and local government which have been laying off a lot of people as you know. Governor Romney has been talking about the need to bring corporate taxes down. We have a high corporate tax rate he says, the highest in the world and also he's been talking about regulatory reform. So in some ways, a lot of these issues and positions should sound very familiar.</p><p>HUDSON: It seems like we've been having this discussion as they've been having the debate over the past 90 days as we've seen the job growth slow down. What's the catalyst here for action? Will here be any before November?</p><p>GERSH: I think we have seen this movie before and I wouldn't count on there being a different outcome in Congress.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking of which, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue from where you are tonight, what about that legislative agenda? Anything job related that we can anticipate here in the summer into the fall?</p><p>GERSH: I would absolutely anticipate that Republicans will come back and will try to get the president to move on the fiscal cliff issues, try to get him to agree to extend tax cuts so we can take it off the table. The president has absolutely said he will not do that. Also the rating agencies are watching this debate very closely to see whether Congress comes up with sustainable reforms. As you well know Tom, if Congress doesn't come up with that and isn't signed into law, we could be looking at another ratings downgrade for the United States.</p><p>HUDSON: Thank you for the reminder of that, at the intersection of jobs and politics tonight, it's Darren Gersh in Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Beware of malware Monday. This is a computer virus that could affect your access to the Internet starting this Monday. Tens of thousands of Americans could lose their Internet service. Ruben Ramirez reports.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Come Monday, computer users may find it impossible to reach the Internet. In November, the FBI cracked down on a ring of hackers that figured out how to redirect peoples' computers to websites that were different from what they typed into their search bar. Samara Lynn is a networking analyst at pcmag.com.</p><p>SAMARA LYNN, NETWORKING ANALYST, PCMAG: What these virus makers did was they redirected all these thousands of computers to this site and the more hits that go on this site the more revenue and the more advertising dollars are generated.</p><p>RAMIREZ: One concern: third parties getting a hold of private information.</p><p>LYNN: The biggest threat is you don't want your information if you're using a credit card for online shopping or doing any banking. You don't want to be redirected to a site that could potentially take that information.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Online giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have done a lot to warn people about the malicious software known as DNS changer. What's the easiest way to figure out if you're computer has been infected?</p><p>LYNN: There's a great website that will quickly tell you. It's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dns-ok.us\">www.dns-ok.us</url>. It's the DNS changer checkup and once you click on it, it will automatically check your DNS settings. If you get DNS resolution equals green, you're fine.</p><p>RAMIREZ: If your screen gives you a red alert, scroll down and follow the link to the FBI website. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: More claims today that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) used anti- competitive tactics to delay the release of the generic version of Lipitor, its top-selling anti-cholesterol pill. Walgreens, Kroger (NYSE:KR) and three other major retail chains sued Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), saying it forced them to buy the more costly Lipitor, rather than a generic. Generic Lipitor entered the market last November, but these companies say it should have come to market about a year earlier. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) denies that and says while some patents on Lipitor expired in the year 2010, others stretched through last year allowing it to delay the launch of generics. The suits has a little impact on Pfizer's stock Tom. It lost $0.13 today to $22 and change, but there were other companies that had bigger losses in today's sell-off.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, there weren't many ports in the storm that we saw in the sell-off after that disappointing job data here Susie. Let's go ahead and roll with tonight's \"Market Focus\" taking a look at another month of lackluster job growth really souring the market tone this Friday, capping a week of disappointing economic data and stock price performance. Here's what the major stock indices did this week. The Dow Industrials on the week falling 0.8 of a percent. The NASDAQ eking out the smallest of gains, 0.1 of a percent higher. The S&amp;P 500 tonight 0.6 of a percent lower compared to one week ago.</p><p>Let's focus in on Friday's actions with the week's losses coming today as the S&amp;P 500 fell from the opening bell after that jobs data. Rising government bond yields in Spain also cast a shadow over worries that the market has still with Europe. The lowest level of the day for the S&amp;P hit about 90 minutes before the closing bell. Volume, it fell a little bit on the big board, down to 595 million shares, 1.4 billion plus shares moving on the NASDAQ.</p><p>All 10 major stock sectors were lower to end the week on the Friday. The tech sector suffered the worst losses, down 1.8 percent. The economically sensitive areas, industrials and materials falling more than 1 percent each.</p><p>Even big tech stocks provided no relief at all today. Those doing big business in Europe especially hit by the selling. Hewlett-Packard's 3.5 percent drop was the biggest among Dow Industrial components, taking it back below $20 per share. Big blue saw red. IBM falling 2 percent on heavier volume. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shedding 1.6 percent.</p><p>But it was software company Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) that really knocked down tech today. It warned second quarter results will miss earlier predictions thanks in part to weakness in Europe. INFA, the warning sending shares careening, down more than 27.5 percent. Volume huge, the stock falling to a new 52-week low. Other firms in the data services business were hurting with worries about spending on technology. Data storage firm Teradata (NYSE:TDC) shed 10.5 percent. Software maker Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) falling 7.6 percent. Data delivery firm F-5 Networks down almost 7 percent.</p><p>After the close tonight, Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced they will settle their patent infringement fight. Instead of fighting, the two will actually launch a new advertising partnership and expand their distribution deals. Before the news, there are the closing prices. Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! shares down a fraction, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closing up almost 1 percent.</p><p>Even though job growth in the U.S. has slowed to a crawl, that hasn't hurt the U.S. dollar, especially compared to the euro. The euro falling into a two-year low against the dollar, now $1.23 will buy you one euro. The European currency has been sinking over the continent's debt crisis. The result of the falling euro, U.S. businesses more price competitive overseas.</p><p>The dollar strength also helping push down commodity prices, especially oil and gold. Crude oil dropping more than 3.5 percent today, settling below $85 per barrel. How about gold back below $1,600 an ounce tonight. Emblematic of today's risk-averse market, bond prices dropping, bond prices rallying rather, pushing down interest rates. The yield on the 10-year government note 1.55 percent tonight, the lowest yield, the highest price since the beginning of June.</p><p>All five of our most actively traded ETFs lower. The emerging markets fund suffering the biggest drop, down 1.8 percent. That is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The last time we spoke to tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest, the U.S. economy was creating more than 200,000 jobs per month. Mark Luschini is the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott with us tonight from Pittsburgh. Mark, that was way back in January. How about that, job growth has slowed considerably. How does it change your investment outlook?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, : Seems like a long time ago, Tom. But it really hasn't done anything to change it. In fact it's probably reinforced it. We didn't know at the time that perhaps some of that increase in job growth that we had in the beginning of the year might have been pulled forward from now on the back of better than expected weather. But as a consequence, we still thought though that we would see still somewhat anemic growth in the United States, slowing growth in Europe, slowing growth in China and that led us to an opinion that we wanted to stay largely domestic with regard to our equity exposure and that's kind of leaning into larger cap high quality names and especially those that pay handsome dividend yields because in a low-growth world, income matters. And you certainly can't find much income being produced today by the traditional source of that which is of course fixed income investments.</p><p>HUDSON: And you've got some new picks that fit with that strategy, but I want to ask you, are you concerned that this trade is getting pretty crowded, a lot of folks looking for yields in dividends at this point.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Most definitely Tom. I mean granted some of the buying that's occurred in areas like real estate investment trusts, master (ph) limited partnerships are indicative of almost an indiscriminate search for income and that has pushed some of these traditional bastions of yield to I think somewhat elevated valuations and as a consequence, we need to be under weight or completely unexposed to some areas like real estate investment trusts, like for instance the utility sector and even be light in telecommunications as a consequence. But other sectors do still represent good value and good yields can be found there as well.</p><p>HUDSON: Energy is one of those and that's first up on your new pick, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), COP, cop, the ticker symbol on this one and dividend yield almost 5 percent. Energy prices have been very volatile as of late. Does this concern you at all especially as the dollar seems to want to strengthen?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Well certainly the pullback in oil prices has hurt the energy patch and as a consequence dragged down the baby with the bath water. But ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is becoming more profitable via shrinking disposing of assets that are non-core, maintain a very high as you mentioned dividend yield. Valuations are inexpensive and ultimately on the prospects of global growth continue to expand and almost inelastic demand for oil among the emerging market countries, we think that bodes well for the energy sector longer term. So secularly we like having exposure in that space and predominantly through names, like the quality of a ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).</p><p>HUDSON: Also looking at healthcare, a little defensive with Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). J&amp;J has been suffering certainly some quality control issues over the past several years, lots of high profile recalls but the stock has had a nice jump in the last six weeks or so. You see value here in the mid 60's, up 60's?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Most definitely. New CEO, so hopefully work in progress toward putting some of that if you will (INAUDIBLE) issues behind it starting with a good evaluation one of only four triple A rated companies in America, so obviously pristine balance sheet and a 3.6 percent or so dividend yield makes it appealing for both growth and income seekers alike.</p><p>HUDSON: You liked energy and drugs back when we last spoke with you at the first of the year, January 6th. Let's take a look at those previous picks with Chevron (NYSE:CVX), CVS (NYSE:CVS) down about 3 percent from then. The Swiss drug giant Novartis down 3 percent. You also like financials, XLF, that exchange-traded fund up about 8 percent. Do you still like these spaces?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We do like financial still among the other two as well, but have leaned more away from the big universal banks, the money centers into the regional banks. We think again somewhat steadier U.S. economic conditions coupled with what we think is a hardening of pricing in the housing market should lead to stabilization of regional bank balance sheets and so we would continue to be exposed to that space.</p><p>HUDSON: You own everything that we mentioned here tonight, Mark?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I do.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark Luschini, our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest. He's with Janney Montgomery Scott. Quick programming note here, long-time NBR \"Market Monitor\" Gary Motyl passed away recently. He was the chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton and we will miss his market insights here on NBR. You can find his last \"Market Monitor\" appearance on our website, nbr.com.</p><p>GHARIB: And next week on NBR, it's the start of earnings season. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) CEO Klaus Kleinfeld joins us on Monday. He'll talk about how the giant aluminum maker did in the second quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year.</p><p>And when it comes to customer service, sometimes you have to give customers more than what they ask for. This week Lou's been thinking about dandelions. Here's author and educator Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: My son is not a little boy any more. In fact he just turned 40. I was smiling the other day when I thought about a special moment when he was about the age his older daughter now is. He came into the house and handed my wife a bunch of dandelions he had picked in the back yard. These are so sweet, she beamed as he looked on with pride, but they look kind of smashed. I know, he responded immediately. I stomped on every one to make sure there were no bees.</p><p>As a business speaker and writer, I think all the time about what business is really about. I know it's about finding a need and filling it. But the older I get -- maybe I should say the more experienced I get -- I think it's really about stomping on dandelions. The people who do business with you, customers, clients, patients, whatever you call them, they're out there in the backyard of their lives and they also wonder which dandelions have bees on them. Your job -- my job -- is not just to make a sale or fill a need, it's to reassure. Yes, this is the right product or service for you. Yes, this will make you feel comfortable. Yes, this is the finest quality we can offer. Yes, you can trust us to treat you with hospitality and joy and grace. Look, most people can go to a number of places to get what we do. We need to give them a concrete reason to deal with us. I happen to think that stomping on dandelions is a darn good one. I'm Lou Heckler.</p><p>GHARIB: And yes you can trust us to have a lot of interesting news next week Tom. We have those earnings reports that we were talking about and also we're going to be kicking off a week long look at the second, the outlook for the second half of the year with lots of stock market analysis.</p><p>HUDSON: Always a lot happens every second half of the year, but this year especially you got the election. You got all the fiscal issues coming up and of course the Federal Reserve by the end of the year says operation twist may be over. Lots of concerns about what's going to happen over the next six months or so Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of uncertainty and we've got to get answers to that. But anyway in the meantime, have a great weekend everyone and I hope you do too, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: You as well Susie. That is NBR for this Friday night, July 6. Thanks for joining us here in the broadcast. We'll see you online at nbr.com and back here on Monday night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

But, traders say there's no stopping prices at the pump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANTHONY GRISANTI, PRESIDENT, GRZ ENERGY: I think wholesale wise, you're going to see $5 gas in a lot of areas of the country, especially the coasts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And this man is a big investor in Berkshire Hathaway stock. We took his pulse after Warren Buffett released his annual letter to shareholders. It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February 27.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. A pullback in oil prices today after days of spurting higher. There are still worries about Iran and supply disruptions, but Tom, those were overshadowed by concerns that the world economy is slowing.</p><p>HUDSON: At least for today Susie, the risk of higher prices still a concern though over the weekend at a meeting of the world finance ministers. Get you updated on today's trading in New York, crude oil futures lost $1.21 to close at $108.56 per barrel. Still, U.S. oil prices are up 10 percent this year.</p><p>GHARIB: Those high prices have pushed energy stocks up as well. And, as Suzanne Pratt reports, there could still be time for investors to take advantage of the big move higher in big oil stocks.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: No matter where you pump, gas prices have been heading higher. And, that's bad news for consumers and perhaps the whole economy and its fragile recovery. But, it's been good news for big oil companies or super majors and their shareholders. So far this year, a closely watched energy sector ETF is up 10 percent moving almost in lock step with the rise in oil and gas prices. The question is whether oil stocks have more room to run. The answer depends on what happens here at the pump. Many factors affect oil company profits, including costs and environmental disasters. But, a big rise in prices plays the biggest role. One energy expert says what's most important is that crude oil prices remain close to or above $100 a barrel.</p><p>ELIECER PALACIOS, ENERGY SECTOR SPECIALIST, MAXIM GROUP: A deep water well costs about $50 a barrel, $75 depending where you are. So, if you can sell your oil at $100 plus, it's very positive for any of these companies.</p><p>PRATT: So, where are oil prices headed next? Energy trader Anthony Grisanti says that's easy: higher.</p><p>ANTHONY GRISANTI, PRESIDENT, GRZ ENERGY: Number one you have the threat from Iran that's being held over this market and number two, as far as refineries closing, you've had three of them close on the east coast. You've had a couple go down on the west coast. You've had some in Europe being shut down and these are shutdowns that are going to be permanent.</p><p>PRATT: Others aren't so certain energy prices will continue to climb north. They believe geopolitical tensions will be less of a support for the market and then there's the demand concern. Higher prices at the pump usually means people buy less gas, which in turn pushes prices lower. Still, others say one more reason to consider buying big oil shares these days is their dividends. On average they pay about 3 to 4 percent and those payouts come no matter what happens to oil prices. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: A potential new source for imported oil into the U.S. is trying again. Back in January, the Obama administration blocked Trans- Canada's Keystone XL pipeline over environmental concerns. But the company today said it will start building the southern leg of that pipeline, running from the Cushing, Oklahoma oil storage hub to refineries on Texas' Gulf coast. The $2.3 billion project is smaller. It should be up and running by the end of next year. And since it does not cross international borders, it won't be subject to a full-blown Federal environmental review.</p><p>GHARIB: Meanwhile, the trial to decide who should pay for the nation's worst oil spill was delayed today. The one-week delay allows BP time to continue negotiations with the plaintiffs' steering committee. That committee represents condominium owners, fishermen, hotel and restaurant operators and others who say their livelihoods were damaged by the Deepwater horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill. Still, BP says there's no guarantee a deal can be reached.</p><p>HUDSON: All this energy talk in the background, blue chip stocks once again tested the 13,000 mark on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Once again, the Dow failed to close above that level. Here's how the day played out for the major indices, the Dow plunging over 100 points actually at the open and then coming back to life on a report that pending home sales showed a jump in the number of sales contracts signed last month. Still, the Dow did end the day down slightly as you saw, down about a point and a half, the NASDAQ rose two, the S&amp;P 500 was up about same amount.</p><p>After the closing bell, Greece was officially rated to be in default of its IOUs. S&amp;P cut Greece's long-term credit rating to selective default. Earlier this month, S&amp;P warned it would make the downgrade if Greece was going to force its lenders to swap their IOUs for new ones, accepting less money. Greece is doing just that and now the selective default rating brings up questions if payments on bond insurance and derivatives will be triggered. Still ahead, tonight's \"Word on the Street\" -- cloud. James Rogers of thestreet.com has three cloud computing stock picks looking for bright days.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of talk today about Warren Buffett and succession plans at Berkshire Hathaway where he is chairman and CEO. He gave some clues over the weekend when he released his annual letter to shareholders. Here are the highlights. On the topic of succession, Buffett said one individual has been chosen, but he didn't identify the person. Buffett, who is 81 years old and his business partner Charlie Munger, 88, have no plans to step down. But Buffett did say the transfer of responsibility will be seamless when the time comes.</p><p>Buffett also reported that Berkshire's fourth quarter profits fell 30 percent and 2011 earnings down 21 percent. But the company's cash rose to $37 billion. On housing, Buffett said the market remains in a quote depression of its own and he was dead wrong predicting it would recover by now. On the topic of investing, stocks will outperform gold and bonds. And even though investors believe bonds are safe, Buffett says they are quote among the most dangerous of assets.</p><p>I turned to Glenn Tongue for some reaction and analysis. He's managing partner at T2 Partners, where Berkshire Hathaway is its top holding. We began by talking about Buffett's succession plan.</p><p>GLENN TONGUE, MANAGING PARTNER, T2 PARTNERS: I think it's likely that Mr. Buffett running the company for another five years. However, if the unexpected happens and he's not running the business tomorrow, it's very comforting knowing that there's someone in line to run the business.</p><p>GHARIB: But Glenn, why doesn't Warren Buffett just name his successor? Why the mystery?</p><p>TONGUE: I don't see why naming the individual today is a benefit to the company, to the shareholders. People that work with Berkshire Hathaway, companies that sell their businesses to Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway want to be dealing with him. They don't want to be dealing with the next in line. They don't want to be thinking about those issues. When Mr. Buffett is no longer running the company, then someone else will step into that role.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's talk about Berkshire Hathaway the company, how is it doing?</p><p>TONGUE: Fantastically well. The five most important operating businesses operated at record levels this year. He stated in the letter that they're going to be generating $10 billion in profits next year, just an enormously profitable business.</p><p>GHARIB: So quarterly profits were down 30 percent for the year, 2011, also down.</p><p>TONGUE: If you look at each and every one of the operating businesses, whether it's the utilities or the railroads or (INAUDIBLE) manufacturing businesses, they were all up year over year. They were all up quarter over quarter in terms of operations. So the underlying businesses are doing terrifically well. There's some accounting conventions that are required, certain write offs and write downs, that made the earnings go down, but the cash flow of the company certainly went up and the operating performance has never been stronger.</p><p>GHARIB: But what Berkshire stock? The A shares have been trading at around $120,000 for two years now. What do you think?</p><p>TONGUE: We value Berkshire stock and we think it's worth about $180,000 per share. We were buying Berkshire stock today very aggressively in the marketplace. It's got the most powerful balance sheet of any company in America and it's got earnings power that is growing very, very rapidly.</p><p>GHARIB: Would you be that optimistic if tomorrow Warren Buffett were no longer running the company?</p><p>TONGUE: When we value Berkshire Hathaway, there's no element of the Warren Buffett premium that we throw into our valuation. We think if Mr. Buffett left the company, that people would still drink Coca-Cola tomorrow. The trains would still be running the next day and people would be ensuring themselves through Geico. So we value those elements of the business.</p><p>GHARIB: What's your reaction to what Warren Buffett said about bonds as the most dangerous of assets? Do you agree with that?</p><p>TONGUE: Yes I agree with it. If you look at the interest rate that we're getting on bonds today, it's very, very low and if interest rates -- prevailing interest rates go up, the principal amount of the bonds will go down over time, so you're going to lose purchasing power by investing in bonds today.</p><p>GHARIB: So Berkshire's cash is now up to $37 billion. Is it time to pay a dividend, even though Buffett is not a fan of them?</p><p>TONGUE: I don't think so. I think Warren Buffett can find better deals with the cash than the shareholders can with the dividends. He finds very unique opportunities like investing in preferred stock in Bank of America. It's a fantastic deal that was available only to Berkshire Hathaway and only to Warren Buffett.</p><p>GHARIB: Glenn, thank you so much, really enjoyed talking with you.</p><p>TONGUE: Thank you Susie. I enjoyed it too.</p><p>HUDSON: Warren Buffett also today said that he would buy millions of single family homes if he could. 2,500 of them went on sale under a new Federal pilot program. The idea is to sell Fannie Mae-owned homes to private investors who want to use them as rental properties. As Darren Gersh reports, these homes may go fast.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Warren Buffett is not alone. Money-making ideas love company and large investors and private equity types already have hundreds of millions, maybe billions of dollars on hand to buy up foreclosed homes and rent them out. At Carrington Holding, Rick Sharga says the company is ready to buy 30,000 to 40,000 homes.</p><p>RICK SHARGA, EXEC. VP, CARRINGTON HOLDING CO.: I think we all agree with Warren Buffett. If we could buy millions of homes, we'd be doing that right now. There is a lot of capital that's very interested in participating in a program like this.</p><p>GERSH: Like this, meaning a pilot program announced by Federal regulators who took charge of the troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when the companies were placed under government control. The Federal Housing Finance Agency today announced a test sale of 2,500 homes around the country. Focusing on cities from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and much of Florida, places where housing fell hard. But this is a tiny fraction of the 700,000 or so foreclosed homes now on the books of financial institutions. And here's the problem: Warren Buffett wanna- be's say they can't find enough homes to buy now. Some banks may be holding off on selling, believing they can get a higher price. Others may not be carrying foreclosed homes on their books at realistic market prices.</p><p>SHARGA: And that could cause a lender or somebody else holding these properties to have to do a significant write down at the point that they execute the sale.</p><p>GERSH: As investors prepare to become big landlords, economist Dean Baker hopes regulators will be more creative. He'd like to see renters offered a chance to become old-fashioned American homesteaders.</p><p>DEAN BAKER, CO-DIR., CNTR. FOR ECONOMIC &amp; POLICY RSCH.: The basic idea is that you have someone come in and pay some nominal amount to buy it initially and then if they stay there and fix it up and pay their taxes, live in the place for five years, then it's theirs.</p><p>GERSH: With private equity lining up to buy rental properties, critics worry the industry that caused the housing crisis is now preparing to profit from the destruction. But investors argue the bad actors have gone out of business.</p><p>SHARGA: It's a popular sentiment that the same folks who got us into this mess are now going to profit on the way back. Fortunately, it's not true.</p><p>GERSH: While Warren Buffett dreams of buying millions of homes, big investors have more modest hopes. They figure the market for big investors and private equity is about 200,000 foreclosed homes over the next two years. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: More housing headaches for bank of America. The giant bank was hit with a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today. It's charged with discriminating against disabled homebuyers. The agency says B of A put unnecessary and burdensome requirements on disabled borrowers. In two separate states, borrowers complained saying they had to show medical records to prove their disabilities and detail their Social Security income. Bank of America says the cases came down to inconsistencies between Federal Housing Administration lending standards and conventional underwriting standards. And that it followed with stricter Federal standards which require more detail.</p><p>With fees rising and customer service falling, more Americans ditched big banks last year and moved their money to small banks and credit unions. JD Power and Associates surveyed 5,000 people who shopped for a new bank or bank account over the past year. Its defection rate for large, regional and midsize banks averaged as high as 11 percent last year, up sharply from 2010. Meanwhile smaller banks and credit unions lost less than 1 percent of their customers. That was far better than the near 9 percent defection rate those small shops saw a year ago. And Tom, surprisingly, bank stocks, big and small led the market higher today.</p><p>HUDSON: A lot of folks are putting their money into those bank stocks today, even though we got that news on how the customers have been behaving over the past year or so. Susie, let's go ahead and take a look at what was going on with tonight's \"Market Focus.\" Overall a mixed finished for the major stock indices on this Monday. The Dow Industrials as we mentioned earlier unable to stick above that 13,000 level. Stocks were able to bounce back though from the early session selling you can see on the left hand side of the chart, thanks to some encouraging signs in the housing market. Those pending home sales were up. We'll talk more about those in a second. The Dow did dip into the closing bell though, ending with that small loss.</p><p>It was a trio of financial stocks though that were the best performers inside the Dow. JPMorgan and Bank of America each gaining two percent. American Express rallying more than 1.5 percent in the session. In the broad market, financials, yes were the strongest, no doubt about it, but the gains though pretty tame, under 1 percent. Financial discretionary sector was the second best today and even that was up only 0.3 of 1 percent gain, a muted gain for the day.</p><p>The jump in pending home sales -- purchases really helped spark some buying in home-related areas of the entire stock market. Pending contracts on those existing homes jumped 2 percent in January, up to their highest level in almost two years, bullishness there in real estate. That news on helped push up shares of Whirlpool to a seven-month high, jumping almost 7 percent. Volume was strong today trading in Whirlpool.</p><p>Paint maker Sherwin Williams also moving higher, up to a new high as a matter of fact with a 2 percent rally. Shares are up more than 26 percent in just the past year. Speaking of homes, home supplies retailer Lowe's turned in earnings a nickel better than estimates. Similar to Home Depot's quarter that we saw last week, Lowe's benefited from mild winter weather allowing customers to start on those home improvement projects early. Shares of Lowe's saw heavier than usual volume, but were up less than 1 percent.</p><p>Focus shifted after the close to online travel company priceline.com and the name your own price website continues to see some pretty big growth numbers. Check it out. Wall Street was expecting a big jump in earnings already from a year ago. Priceline did not disappoint. Results were more than $0.30 stronger than estimates. Both international and domestic travel bookings were better than expected. Priceline shares saw little movement during the regular session, but watch these tomorrow. They shot up more than 6 percent in after hour's action to over $628 per share. If that holds tomorrow, it would be more than a decade high for PCLN.</p><p>A big bankruptcy in Japan may mean one less global maker of a commonly used memory chip for computers and that had shares of Micron jumping today here in the U.S. MU, the ticker symbol, jumped almost 7 percent to an eight-month high. El-Pida (ph) Memory in Japan filed for bankruptcy under the weight of some big loans coming due. Micron is the last U.S. space maker of what are called DRAM, dynamic random access memory chips.</p><p>While the overall energy sector cooled a bit today as we mentioned, we did see some buying in a giant oil driller as well as a master limited partnership based in nat gas. Driller Transocean rallied 5 percent. It reported a loss last quarter related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, indicating a possible settlement in that case may be coming. Cheniere Energy Partners meantime, the master limited partnership focused on liquefied natural gas jumped to a new 52-week high, up 12 percent. Private equity firm Blackstone is investing $2 billion to help the firm build a liquefied nat gas plant in Louisiana.</p><p>A lot of the commodity market focus has been on energy lately, who can blame them. But today soybeans really took the lead. Beans in the teens, you heard that phrase, the old saying at the Chicago Board of Trade and we're there for the first time since last fall at least for the May futures contract. Beans jumping above $13 a bushel for the first time in five months. The market thinks that the South American harvest will be disappointing, while global demand for beans continues growing. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: And record help for the nation's farmers in the form of crop insurance. U.S. farmers received $10 billion in crop insurance payments last year and with 5 percent of 2011 claims outstanding, that number could go higher. Drought in the great plains, spring flooding along the Mississippi River and crop-damaging freezes in the south pushed claims higher. The last record was in 2008. That's when payouts topped $8.5 billion.</p><p>HUDSON: The forecast for technology is cloudy like cloud computing. The movement to on-demand software and data storage continues to pick up in a big way. That brings us to tonight's \"Word on the Street\" -- cloud. James Rogers back with us now, technology editor at thestreet.com. James, Mr. Editor, nice to see you, congratulations on the new gig.</p><p>JAMES ROGERS, TECHNOLOGY EDITOR, THESTREET.COM: Thank you very much.</p><p>HUDSON: So tell us how cloud computing is different and how it's changing?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, you know cloud computing has been one of the big textbook words of recent years and it's a trend that's really picking up. It's becoming a mainstream technology. What is it? Basically there's different forms of cloud. Cloud could be a business that say, accessing servers and storage capacity from a hosting company like Rackspace or it could be a business that's using specialized software services, someone like salesforce.com where all of these areas are growing.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned two companies there, but first, EMC. This is kind of the granddaddy in the space, data storage and hardware. Share prices had a sharp rally in the past six weeks or so. What could fuel it higher?</p><p>ROGERS: EMC provides a lot of the core infrastructure that's needed for these cloud service providers, could be things as you say like basic storage hardware or virtualization software from EMC is very, very popular, VMWare subsidiary. It's got a lot of weapons in its arsenal, a lot of other things, data security, disaster recovery, data analytics and I think because of this bigger picture, it's really in the sweet spot for the cloud. Cloud and demands for cloud services helped push EMC to record quarterly results recently, kind of continuing a consistent run of (ph) results from this firm. I think that EMC is actually one of tech's best performers. It may not be the sexiest stock out there, but I think that there's a lot more upside potential for investors here, particularly with the push towards the cloud.</p><p>HUDSON: EMC is kind of the soup to nuts, the old school cloud play here, 90 seconds left and I want to get to the other two. Software side, salesforce.com, CRM the ticker symbol. It's had a heck of a quarter, has already said it's got a record order on its books in this current quarter. How can it move higher?</p><p>ROGERS: I have salesforce down as one of the big tech rebound stocks for 2012 and I think it's really starting to live up to that billing. This is a company that is really one of the first cloud trail blazers, and if you look at its resources, what we're seeing is that salesforce is actually clinching more and more large enterprise deals, also its social enterprise strategy seems to be taking off. Now we're concerned about this company's growth potential last year, but I think that maybe we're seeing a bit overblown. There's a lot more growth to this firm.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally, 30 seconds on Rackspace, RAX the ticker symbol. This is really seen as the pure play in cloud. And the stock price kind of reflects that as the excitement has picked up in the last several weeks.</p><p>ROGERS: This is another company that's come out strong results and like a lot of its competitors like AT&amp;T, Rackspace focuses solely on the cloud, really impressive reputation for customer support and also I spoke to some of the executives there recently and they were telling me that they've got a lot of new products planned for this year. And also on the financial side of the company, there's a great price to earnings ratio so I think that there's a lot of upside to have there.</p><p>HUDSON: A little bit of valuation play there in technology. Can you or do you own any of these stocks, James?</p><p>ROGERS: No, none whatsoever.</p><p>HUDSON: You can read James' article at the street.com. You can find a link on our website as well. It's our guest this evening, James Rogers with the street.com.</p><p>ROGERS: Thank you, Tom.</p><p>GHARIB: As the nation gears up for primaries in Michigan and Arizona tomorrow, tonight's commentator says there's something she'd really like to see during this presidential race. She's Maya Macguineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p><p>MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRES., CMTE. FOR A RESPONSIBLE FED. BUDGET: It's campaign season and with campaigns come lots of promises. Last week, we released a report looking at how the Republican candidates campaign proposals would affect the country's bottom line and we have also analyzed the president's budget. Suffice it to say, we are on track for a whole lot of red ink.</p><p>So here's my proposal. Once we get to the general election, we should have a debate focusing solely on fixing the budget. Each candidate would be required to put forth a plan to save $5 trillion over a decade with the full set of details. And it would give us, the voters, a chance to see what it really takes to create a responsible budget. We'd see what it takes if we don't raise any taxes at all or cut them further as all the Republicans have proposed; and we see how much it would take in tax increases to cover all the new spending the president has proposed while also bringing down the deficit. Better yet, we might see what a more realistic proposal would look like. Maybe the candidates wouldn't show up, maybe they would try to use funny numbers. But maybe, just maybe it would jumpstart the long overdue national discussion about what it will really take to fix the budget. I'm Maya Macguineas.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, from insider trading to Ponzi scheme, FBI investigations into financial crimes last year led to billions in court-ordered restitution. The Feds say they won more than 3,000 financial crime convictions last year, securing $12 billion in court ordered payouts. In some cases, the government itself was the victim through Medicare fraud. And the FBI leaned on Gordon Gekko himself or the actor who played him in the \"Wall Street\" movies to help fight financial crime. Michael Douglas stars in a new public service announcement warning investors about deals that are too good to be true.</p><p>HUDSON: Here's what we're watching for tomorrow. We've got some new data coming out, the latest numbers on durable goods orders. We'll see if that washing machine or couch that you purchased in January is adding to the economy. We'll also get the latest on home prices, the S&amp;P Case Shiller home price index for December. Then, when it comes to the economy, it's the economy and politics this fall, no doubt about it and we will take a look at campaign promises versus political realities.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday evening. Thanks for joining us. It's February 27th. I'm Tom Hudson. Have a great night Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, hope you have a wonderful evening. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching everyone. Hope to see all of you again tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Susie Gharib. The unemployment rate drops to a four year low as U.S. businesses add 146,000 jobs in November. We look behind the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Tom Hudson. We meet the CEOs of three small businesses hiring right now. What they do and why they're looking for help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And House Speaker Boehner accuses <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>of wasting another week in the fiscal cliff negotiations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more coming up on a Friday night edition here on NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: The job market is proving to be surprisingly resilient. American employers hired 146,000 workers in November, much more than expected. And the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent. That's the lowest level since December of 2008. As Erika Miller reports, that wasn't the only surprise in today's report.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Almost no one on Wall Street saw this good news coming. There was every reason to think hiring would be weak last month. After all, many parts of the east coast are still recovering from devastation caused by super storm Sandy.</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN: I think the most likely explanation here is that Sandy's impact was significant but was so short- lived that it didn't extend to the sample period of the employment report which was the week that covered November 12.</p><p>MILLER: Hiring was also supposed to be weak due to worries about the fiscal cliff. With $600 billion in tax hikes and government spending cuts set to start next year, why aren't more firms postponing hiring decisions?</p><p>JULIA CORONADO, CHIEF N. AMERICA ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS: What we're hearing from businesses is that it is really hard to actually pull back hiring right now, because they've already fired so many workers, gotten so lean that it's really difficult.</p><p>MILLER: But not all the surprises in the report were good. At 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level since December 2008. But that was mostly due to people giving up their search for work. And there's another disappointing trend, weak wage growth.</p><p>KASMAN: What we are not seeing is strong income generation. The slowing in wage gains -- the weak bargaining power of labor comes across in this report.</p><p>MILLER: So although the labor market is not getting worse, it's not getting a lot better, either. And there are plenty of risks that could cause businesses to cancel projects, and hiring plans.</p><p>CORONADO: Clearly one of the biggest risks is that we don't see a deal on the fiscal cliff or that they drag it out over a number of months and that that really erodes confidence.</p><p>MILLER: Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve is trying to do all it can to help the economy. The central bank is widely expected to announce an extension of its bond buying program when it meets next week. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: With the fiscal cliff about three weeks away tonight, Washington has not made much progress to avoid it. At least that was the assessment today from one of those directly involved in the talks, House Speaker John Boehner. The top Republican accused <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>of quote, slow walking the economy to the edge of the cliff. He repeated his call for the president to send to Congress a plan that can pass both houses. Tax rates are still the major sticking point. The president wants to raise them for America's highest earners; House Republicans strongly oppose.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER: Instead of reforming the tax code and cutting spending, the president wants to raise tax rates. But even if the president got the tax rate hike that he wanted, understand that we would continue to see trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see. Washington's got a spending problem, not a revenue problem.</p><p>HUDSON: Congress and the president now have about 24 days to reach a deal before the fiscal cliff's tax hikes and spending cuts take effect.</p><p>GHARIB: Mark Zandi says bad things will happen to the economy pretty fast if lawmakers don't settle the fiscal cliff issue. He's chief economist of Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. So Mark, falling off the fiscal cliff means bad things. How bad?</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: It could be quite bad, Susie. I don't think it's cataclysmic if we get into January and we haven't settled this, but if House makers haven't nailed this down by early February, I think stock investors, bond investors will start to get very, very nervous, start selling, risky businesses pull back and by the end of February when we start approaching the ceiling for the debt limit, I think we'll be back in recession. It will be a fairly severe recession. So policy makers have a few weeks but not much more than that. They have to get this together.</p><p>GHARIB: Some people are saying that today's jobs report is very encouraging and that you can look at this as a way that maybe the economy can handle some tough belt tightening because things are looking a little bit better. How do you think the various parties, Republican and Democrats will handle this jobs report in their fiscal cliff negotiations?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, you know, you're right. Some folks look at this and say the economy's strong enough. It should be able to digest big tax increases, spending cuts. Others look at it and say look we still have a very high unemployment rate, a long way to go to get back to full employment. The economy can't tolerate big tax increases and spending cuts. Like most political debates, the reality is in between. We do need to address our fiscal problem so we do need to go through some spending cuts and we also need some tax revenue increases. But we have to phase it in over time, otherwise the economy will choke on that. We can't have too much restraint too quickly. So we have to phase this in, smooth it in to make it palpable for the economy.</p><p>GHARIB: But until that happens, there is a lot of anxiety in the labor market. The big fear for many individuals and for investors is that companies are going to start laying off workers. We saw this week that Citigroup (NYSE:C) announced 11,000 job cuts. Is this the beginning of a trend, Mark?</p><p>ZANDI: No, Susie, I don't think so. I think if Washington can reasonably address the fiscal issues and I'm still confident that they will ultimately get it together. There will be a fair amount of brinkmanship but at the end of the day, they'll get it together. If they're able to do that when we get into next spring, I do think we're going to be in much better shape. Businesses are going to get their groove back. Certainly investors are going to be very happy about that. By this time next year, I think we should see a much better job market because the housing market, which is already starting to turn should be in full swing. So no, I don't think businesses are going to pull back. The only reason they would is if Washington completely botches this. At this point I don't think that's going to happen.</p><p>GHARIB: How do you think the Federal Reserve is going to read and factor in today's jobs report? They're meeting on Tuesday as you know. Do you think it's going to trigger any new response from the Fed?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, as you know the Fed's on high alert. They've got their foot to the accelerator. They're now using open-ended quantitative easing, buying long-term bonds and they're going to up the ante I think at the next meeting in the coming week. Operation Twist ends and they're going to start rolling that into this quantitative even process. So a lot of bond purchases. I think they're going to continue to do that until unemployment is moving definitively lower and is much lower than it is today. And most importantly, they're going to wait and see how these things go in Washington. They're very nervous that policy makers aren't going to get this right. So as long as Washington's dithering I think the Fed's going to be on high alert.</p><p>GHARIB: Absolutely. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has been talking about this for a while now. Thanks a lot Mark, great talking about you. We've been speaking with Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead tonight, slow job growth does not discourage tonight's \"Market Monitor.\" Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott tells us why.</p><p>The slow job growth we saw in November, growth but slow, didn't lead to a lot of consumer cheer as December began. The Reuters-University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey fell early this month to its lowest level we've seen since August. So you add all this up here, the Dow Industrials rose 81 points, the NASDAQ was down 11 with some further losses in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, the S&amp;P 500 up four points. A mixed week for the major indices, the Dow Industrials, which does not include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), gained 1 percent for the week. With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the NASDAQ fell 1.1 percent. And the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.01 of 1 percent gain since last Friday.</p><p>GHARIB: One hundred of the small businesses behind the job growth that we're seeing were honored last night in Washington with the \"Inc\" magazine's \"hire power\" awards. The businesses span the country and cross an array of sectors. Sylvia Hall met with three of the winners to talk about their businesses and the one thing that they have in common: success.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: They work in different states and in completely different fields. But together, these CEOs have added more than 1,500 jobs to the nation's economy over the past three years. This is Mike Derheim, who heads a Minnesota tech firm; Sharon Virts Mozer, whose Virginia-based company runs administration for the Federal government and Karl Schledwitz of Memphis, who's turned jerky and hot dogs into opportunity. (INAUDIBLE) seems to be kind of a mature business. How do you find growth there?</p><p>KARL SCHLEDWITZ, CEO, MONOGRAM FOOD SOLUTIONS: The actual space is growing. There are meat snacks, beef jerky really started growing with the Atkins diet craze and it's probably quadrupled in the last two years. We've been able to grow by buying under utilized manufacturing facilities and centralizing the back office and putting robust sales operation together filling up the plants. And that creates employment and creates more profitability. It's no different than an office building or a shopping center. If it's half empty, it doesn't do very well cash flow wise, but you take that same exact building and fill it up and it cash flows.</p><p>HALL: You work with the Federal government. Again, not exactly what one would consider a growth market. How have you been able to find growth?</p><p>SHARON VIRTS MOZER, PRESIDENT, FCI FEDERAL: We found that the demand is going up just based on how the economy's going and the fact that people want to be here in the U.S. We've also found growth through our process and our process takes what I call collaborative work forces and puts them through a methodology in a training program that allows them to accomplish great things.</p><p>HALL: Tell me just a little bit about this process.</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: We hire typically high school graduates. And we bring them in and we assess their skills and their training and what they have to offer. We put them through a training program to train them towards a particular task or a particular set of tasks.</p><p>HALL: One hundred nerds in 100 days. Where did you get to the point where you were on this nerd drive? How did you get here and how is the drive going?</p><p>MIKE DERHEIM, CEO, THE NERDERY: We started in November with our 100 nerds and 100 days program and just modeled actually very closely after a PBS telethon member drive. And the deal is that if you were known to us and you get an interview we send you a hundred bucks. If we end up hiring the person we send you another 400 bucks and we're trying to get to a hundred nerds in as many days. As of right now, I think now we've had about 900 applications submitted and we've hired 19 people.</p><p>HALL: What's the challenge for you specifically in hiring the people?</p><p>DERHEIM: The last I checked the unemployment rate for people in IT, for people that I'm looking for was something like half of the national average. So above all there just aren't enough people who are out there looking for jobs.</p><p>HALL: I just wanted to open it up and ask if hiring is a challenge --</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: (INAUDIBLE) associated with it and as a result credit issues come up. So finding folks that have the right attitude with good credit particularly since we have a market or a set of work force that often times they are suffering in a poor economy and they do need those jobs but they have credit issues. That's our biggest challenge but for the most part, we have no problems in recruiting this particular market with unemployment as high as it's been.</p><p>DERHEIM: I wish we had that problem. We're exactly the opposite. We're struggling all the time to figure out new ways to get more applications in the door. Just a different worker I guess but it's different.</p><p>HALL: I wanted to go around and ask this about your growth prospects for the next year.</p><p>SCHLEDWITZ: We hope to have more acquisitions this year and continue to add to the plants that we're operating in. So I don't, without an acquisition, it would be 10-15 percent growth.</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: We're looking to grow by at least 500 if not 600 jobs by the end of 2013.</p><p>DERHEIM: We are planning 25 percent a year revenue growth for 2013. So we're definitely planning continuing to grow aggressively and organically.</p><p>HALL: Thank you all so much and congratulations on your awards.</p><p>GHARIB: Calling it a robust investment in the region, the White House today said <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>would ask Congress for more than $60 billion in aid for states impacted by hurricane Sandy. Still that was less than the $82 billion the states wanted for rebuilding. Millions of homeowners and businesses that were in the path of hurricane Sandy are now waiting for checks as the long rebuilding effort begins. Ruben Ramirez spent a day with an insurance claim adjuster touring one of the hardest hit areas.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It's the calm after the storm, empty streets, houses ripped from foundations, boats sandwiched between homes, remnants of the famous Jersey shore boardwalk.</p><p>KARL NEW, CLAIMS ADJUSTER, AMERICAN MODERN: What makes this storm different was the large amounts of sand that it brought with it. So the sand and the surge itself, it moved houses just like Katrina did, but it just the sand is bad.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Karl New is one of about 30 claims adjusters American Modern Insurance dispatched to New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. For the barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, it was north of the eye of the storm but think of it like a windmill spinning counter-clockwise.</p><p>NEW: Seaside was hit with a 37-foot wall wave so that's a pretty big wall that was coming in so you're talking water that's higher than that building. that's crashing in here and causing this much - and the force. It's bringing sand. It's bringing all that water in.</p><p>RAMIREZ: It took a month before insurance adjusters were allowed on the island to assess the damage. New inspected this property earlier this week.</p><p>NEW: The \"L\" shape all the way up top, everything is sagging down from the weight of the sand that was pushing it and the water that was pushing it out. It pushed somebody's shed completely right into his house. He got 5 1/2 feet of water in his house so everything on the first floor needs to be completely gutted and taken out.</p><p>RAMIREZ: John Marchetti's house sits just two doors down closer to the beach.</p><p>JOHN MARCHETTI, HOMEOWNER: I do have flood insurance (INAUDIBLE) and flood. Obviously everything that you see here is from the bottom. It's from the flood.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Marchetti's insurer, NJM will take a loss of more than $300 million from Sandy, four times what it paid out from Irene last year. It's the largest loss in the company's history. Industry estimates put the total amount of damage from super storm Sandy at $50 billion. Insurance companies are expected to pick up about $10-$20 billion of that putting super storm Sandy at the top of the list and ahead of hurricanes Ivan, Ike and Irene. Monday we will look at why rebuilding from Sandy is so expensive thanks to where she came ashore. Ruben Ramirez, Seaside Heights, New Jersey.</p><p>GHARIB: Back here on Wall Street, Tom, some interesting revolutions from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) today saying that it got a Wells notice, is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But behind it is a very interesting debate going on. The reason for the investigation is that the CEO Reid Hastings had posted some information on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page about developments at the company and the SEC said you didn't disclose this properly. It should have been a press release. It should have been a filing with the SEC and it raises whole new questions about social media and fair disclosure.</p><p>HUDSON: This is all about how technology is changing and regulations have such a hard time Susie keeping up with it. We've see it with high frequency trading for instance and now we're seeing with how companies disseminate information using social media getting it out arguably to more people faster than what a traditional press release or SEC filing. So we'll have to see how this one plays out. That stock by the way Susie didn't move much today on the notice although we did have plenty of other movement. Let's get going with our \"Market Focus\" here. As we saw the influence of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that it can have on the broad market really continue today with the major indices closing mix. The jobs data helped the S&amp;P 500 start in the green but the early gains disappeared as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares sank. The index climbed into positive in the afternoon and was able to finish up a 0.03 of a percent. Trading volume slowed, 605 million on the big board, 1.6 billion shares on the NASDAQ.</p><p>The materials and financials sectors gained 0.08 of a percent. The energy sector up 0.07 of a percent. Technology was the big drag, thanks once again to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AAPL. Over the past week here it is, gone from almost $600 per share down to $533. That's down about 9 percent. Looking at it longer term in the last year, the sell-off with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) now about $8 above that mid-November low. Several theories behind the stock drop: profit taking, disappointment over no special dividend and more fundamental concerns about Apple's business growth.</p><p>Two other big tech stocks under pressure. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling 1 percent, just pennies tonight above its low for the year. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems falling 0.07 of 1 percent. The firm repeated today its previous earnings growth forecast.</p><p>Big banks, they were on the upswing though with further improvement in the job market, and ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting with expectations building for the possibility of more economic help. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) jumped 2.6 percent, its highest price since early November. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added another 1.8 percent. That's an 18-month high for shares of B of A.</p><p>A big global energy deal one step closer to reality tonight. Late today Canada OK'd the buyout of Nexen (NYSE:NXY) Energy by Chinese energy giant C-NOOC. It's a $15.3 billion deal, representing another foreign expansion by a Chinese energy company. Canada's ministry of industry said C-NOOC agreed to quote, free market principles. The buyout offer for Nexen (NYSE:NXY) came back in July. In today's regular session, the stock was heavily traded falling 6.6 percent. But after the Canadian OK, they jumped more than 14.5 percent in extended hours trading, around $27 per share. U.S. and British regulators still have to approve the deal.</p><p>Two years ago Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered $6 billion to buy daily deal website Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) before it went public. Groupon's market value is half that tonight. Bloomberg reports there's new take-over speculation. By whom we don't know. The stock though jumped 23 percent. Volume doubled. Some of the buying could also be from traders who sold short the stock to profit as it was falling.</p><p>Four of the top five most actively traded exchange-traded products were higher. The lone hold-out the NASDAQ 100 tracking fund, which does include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after all. The fund was down 0.06 of 1 percent today. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Job growth is one reason tonight's \"Market Monitor\" thinks the economy will pick up speed next year and so will stocks. Mark Luschini back with us, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. Always great to see you Mark. So the job market that we saw today improving in the last month but still slow. Do you think it's going to pick up the pace of that improvement next year and why?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Well we do, Tom. The fact of the matter is we've been seeing steady if unspectacular job growth for the better part of 2012, job growth averaging roughly 150,000 or so a month. We think on the back of an up tick on several factors here that we're looking forward to improve in 2013, we could see a modicum of an up tick in job growth.</p><p>HUDSON: Among those other improvements you see consumers paying down debt as beneficial to the economy. Doesn't that lead to less demand, less consumer spending?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We think it's bringing up their balance sheet.</p><p>HUDSON: Which is a good thing.</p><p>LUSCHINI: It is a good thing. All this (ph) leads to a much healthier foundation upon which consumption can be built which is all important in the economy.</p><p>HUDSON: Where are we in that de-leveraging cycle do you think, closer to the end?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I think it's advanced. I think it's probably a 2015-16 phenomena before we get trend but nonetheless, well off the peak in 2006.</p><p>HUDSON: Businesses meantime are not necessarily de-leveraging. They don't necessarily have to. They have a lot of cash out there but they're not spending it. You think they're going to less loose some of that cash. We've heard so much uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and companies holding back. How are those two related?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I think the fiscal cliff ultimately is going to be rendered into a fiscal slow. Between now and then the uncertainty is really paralyzing CEOs and companies from big to small. You can see it in the core capital goods orders which have basically fallen off in the last two quarters indicative of holding that business investment and hiring back which we think will change once we have some certainty brought into that equation.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally housing which has shown remarkable stability here, an uptick in several markets but there's talk about limiting mortgage deductions with the fiscal cliff negotiations sometime next year. Couldn't that impact the recovery?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It could. Obviously it might be relegated to more affluent households in terms of the ability to do a deduction either in full or part. But at the end of the day there's still a large swath of household formation that is occurring that's going to drive I think perspective homeowners into the market regardless.</p><p>HUDSON: Let's get to the pics here. You do like housing stocks with the home builders ETF. What do you anticipate? They've had a nice run already.</p><p>LUSCHINI: They've been terrific.</p><p>HUDSON: Put new money to work?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We turned bullish about a year ago and they've doubled or better and yes we would. They may be subject to profit taking but nonetheless we still think we're in the early innings of the house recovery.</p><p>HUDSON: You also like technology. Is this a play on your business investment expectations for next year?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It is, if business wallets open up we expect the destination for some of that money to go towards more productivity enhancing tools and they've been under investing in technology now for several years.</p><p>HUDSON: What about that transition from the PC to tablets and smart phones? Does that concern you at all about traditional technology terms firms?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It does a little bit. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is intriguing and then really the sweet spot of that. The fact of the matter is though it's an interesting company that is trying to make itself into more of a tablet or a smart phone oriented company. In the meantime they get paid an enormous dividend yield to wait.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking of which, I know you like dividend stocks. The last time we spoke to you July 6, you liked Conoco Phillips and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Both of them in terms of just the stock price appreciation up by single digits percentage terms. You still like them.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Very much so. Battleship companies good places to be in, in health care and energy and again a very handsome coupon (ph) which is think is going to matter to total return.</p><p>HUDSON: Do you own everything that we mentioned tonight?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We do.</p><p>HUDSON: Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Mark Luschini. He's with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Thanks Tom.</p><p>GHARIB: And it's often said that in life, it's not the destination that counts, but the journey. This week Lou's been thinking about journeys and their not so straight lines. Here's author and educator, Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: How many of you are now doing what you thought you'd be doing when you first went to work? I'll guess maybe about 25 percent. I was reminded of this recently when I spoke to a group of dentists about leadership. We talked about how they got into dentistry because they liked working with their hands, they liked helping people. And now? Now, they also negotiate building leases and manage staffs and cope with shrinking reimbursements and the soft economy. My first job as a manager involved leading 17 people in a television news department.</p><p>One day, one of my old college friends surprised me by asking: how does it feel to be out of the news business? I only later realized he meant that all of us who have the privilege of leading others soon realize that leading is our job. That once-straight line we visualized where our skills were needed has zigs and zags in it. The skills we now need to learn and hone and practice have changed. It's a wonderful honor to be at the top of an organization, but that old concept of straight to the top, that's not how it is. Not by a long shot. I'm Lou Heckler.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, we want to let all of you know that we've posted an extended version of our conversation with NBR founding anchor Paul Kangas from yesterday. It's on the web at nbr.com and have a great weekend everyone and Tom, it was great seeing you yesterday as well.</p><p>HUDSON: Great to have you in south Florida Susie with Paul as well, a lot more viewer questions on that extended video at nbr.com. Have a great weekend and we'll see you back here nest week.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I`m Susie Gharib. Only 80,000 people got jobs in June, way below estimates. But the news isn`t all bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: I`m Tom Hudson. Employment is the issue this election season. Tonight we`ll hear what the presidential candidates say about today`s job numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And it`s infected thousands of computers already. Are you ready for Monday`s web attack?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more coming up tonight right here on NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: Another lousy jobs report today. American businesses were hiring in June, but not a whole lot, Tom and stocks sold off on the news.</p><p>HUDSON: A lackluster report here Susie, this is three straight months now of weak hiring, showing the U.S. economy obviously still struggling. U.S. employers added just 80,000 jobs. That`s certainly less than the 100,000 jobs expected. The unemployment rate meantime unchanged, 8.2 percent. That`s stuck pretty much in the same level for most of this year. Investors clearly hoping for some stronger job growth, pushing down stocks in reaction to the disappointment. At the bell, the Dow was down 124 points. The NASDAQ fell almost 39, the S&amp;P was off nearly 13. So between the weak jobs data and European worries, caution remains the business plan for many companies.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: CEOs might continue to play things fairly close to the vest. We know they`re holding elevated cash levels and they`re going to therefore potentially defer business investment and hiring which once again feeds back into maintaining a slow pace of economic growth in the U.S. going forward. So we need animal spirits to be rekindled here through greater certainty about what the future looks like than what we have today.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark Luschini is tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" guest. We`ll talk more with him later in the program. But first tonight, Suzanne Pratt takes a deeper look at today`s employment report.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When the economy creates 80,000 new jobs in one month, it`s good enough to keep us from slipping into another recession, but not good enough to chip away at that pesky unemployment rate. In the first quarter of this year, employers added an average of 225,000 jobs. But in the second quarter, the average downshifted to a disappointing 75,000. Some economists credit warm winter weather for the early boost in hiring, saying it robbed jobs from the spring. But no matter how you slice it, the economy is slowing and businesses are afraid to commit to new workers.</p><p>CONRAD DEQUADROS, SR. ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS: The debt crisis in Europe has the potential to dip the U.S. economy back into recession, although that`s unlikely, it`s probably a concern for businesses. And secondly we have a lot of uncertainty related to tax policy and fiscal issues this year.</p><p>PRATT: Today`s weak data sparked new debate about what more the Federal Reserve can do to help. To some, a new round of bond buying, known as QE3, looks like a strong possibility.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE WEALTH MGMT.: It has to put quantitative easing on the table and it has to be a viable option for the Federal Reserve. Did this report basically tell us that the economy has completely falling off the cliff, not really. But it`s certainly telling us that we`re not making much progress.</p><p>PRATT: Still, not all of the June labor snapshot was doom and gloom. Average hourly wages gained $0.06 and so did the amount of time spent on the job by one tenth of an hour or six minutes. Both suggest support for consumer spending, particularly as lower gas prices puts more money into peoples` wallets.</p><p>DEQUADROS: This is sort of the strongest income increase that we`ve seen or implied income increase from the employment report since February. And then on top of that, it`s an increase that`s in real terms because we have prices that are falling.</p><p>PRATT: Against this backdrop, there is some optimism about the labor market in the second half of this year. Many expect a pickup in job growth, but not enough to bring the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Our next guest sees a silver lining in today`s gloomy jobs numbers. He`s Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Mark, it`s hard to be positive these days . What is it that you`re seeing in the labor market that gives you some hope?</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ANALYTICS: Well Susie, let me say that was a disappointing number and the reporter was right. If we stay at 80K, unemployment will rise and that an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, that will be very uncomfortable. So we need to see better numbers and I think we will. I think American businesses are in good shape. They`ve reduced their cost structures, their profit margin are as wide as they`ve ever been. They`re as profitable as they have ever been. Their balance sheets are very strong. They`ve reduced debt. So in my mind, it`s not a question can American businesses invest and hire more? It`s a matter of confidence. They`re still very very nervous and that`s the missing ingredient here is those animal spirits that the other economists were talking about.</p><p>GHARIB: At the beginning of this year, businesses were hiring at a very rapid clip, 200,000 people plus a month but not any more now and that`s just worrying a lot of people. When do you see the hiring picking up and what`s going to motivate and drive companies to do more hiring?</p><p>ZANDI: You make a good point and just to reinforce it, we were creating 250,000 jobs per month back in December, January, February. The last three months we`ve been creating less than 100,000 per month. Both overstate the case. We weren`t going nearly as strongly earlier in the year and we`re not as weak currently. The reality is somewhere in between and I think that will become more evident as we make our way through the summer and into the fall months. I really don`t think businesses are going to fully engage and really let loose and begin to hire in a more aggressive way until we nail down our fiscal situation. We`ve got a number of significant fiscal issues we have to solve after the presidential election and also not until we get more clarity with respect to what`s happening in Europe. Europe is still a very serious threat to our economy and I think that`s making people very nervous and businesses is forestalling more business hiring.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of CEO`s and business people that I`ve been talking to are really spooked out by what`s going on in Europe. You were just there. From the people you talked to while you were in Europe, what was your sense of their seriousness about an action plan and a timetable to fix their situation and get the economy growing over there?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, you know, it`s a bit discouraging because there`s just no consensus with respect to how it`s going to play out. You talk to one person and you get one story and another person a totally different one. I was encouraged by the fact that in general I think there was consensus with regard to what needs to get done. In fact, a few of those things actually got done at the end of last week when the EU ministers met and we got some action. I do think it`s a process and I think this process is going to take place over the course of the next couple years. And so we`re going to be facing several rounds if not more of financial market turmoil. That`s going to be what`s necessary to generate the political will to make the changes that they need to, but at the end of the day Susie, I think they will and once that become clear, that`s when American businesses I think will get going and we`ll see more hiring.</p><p>GHARIB: OK. We`ll leave it there. Mark thank you so much for coming on the program. We appreciate it. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.</p><p>HUDSON: Election 2012 now, there`s one thing investors and politicians have in common: they both watch closely the monthly jobs` report for clues about the future. And in this election season especially, the jobs data could determine the winner. Here`s Darren Gersh in Washington.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Even the president did not seem particularly satisfied with today`s jobs report. Mr. Obama said the employment numbers were moving in the right direction but quickly added --</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to get back to a time when middle class families and those working to get into the middle class have some basic security. That`s our goal, so we`ve got to grow the economy even faster.</p><p>GERSH: Whether or not we are moving in the right direction fast enough is the critical question for the election. Political scientists believe most voters begin to make up their minds about the president`s handling of the economy right now in the six months or so before casting their votes.</p><p>WILLIAM GALSTON, SR. FELLOW, BROOKINGS: So I would say after another two jobs reports, the summer reports, July and August reports, by Labor Day, I think a lot of people are going to have made up their minds.</p><p>GERSH: Republican challenger Mitt Romney urged voters not to wait that long. He blamed the poor jobs` report on high taxes and burdensome regulation.</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The president`s policies have not gotten America working again and the president`s going to have to stand up and take responsibility for it.</p><p>GERSH: There may still be some spillover in this jobs` report from strong hiring over the warm winter. If that`s the case, job creation could bounce up a little in the coming months, perhaps averaging 150,000 jobs a month. But even that might not be enough good news to sway voters.</p><p>HEIDI SHEIRHOLZ, ECON., ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Obama or any other incumbent politician, they are really going to want to see stronger job growth between now and November. I don`t necessarily think that we are going to see the numbers that will bring the unemployment rate down in a substantial way in the next few months.</p><p>GERSH: So Tom that means that the president will head into the election day with the unemployment rate still painfully high.</p><p>HUDSON: Darren, voters want to know what is the policy to get more Americans back to work faster? The president`s been talking about patience not being satisfied and Governor Romney has been criticizing the president. So what are the policies to get more Americans back to work?</p><p>GERSH: Well today the president was looking backwards a little bit defending the auto bailout saying that it accounted for saving a lot of jobs in Ohio, a few swing states, a lot of auto workers there. President`s also been pushing still for infrastructure spending. He says a lot of unemployed construction workers, need to get them back to work. He talked about support for state and local government which have been laying off a lot of people as you know. Governor Romney has been talking about the need to bring corporate taxes down. We have a high corporate tax rate he says, the highest in the world and also he`s been talking about regulatory reform. So in some ways, a lot of these issues and positions should sound very familiar.</p><p>HUDSON: It seems like we`ve been having this discussion as they`ve been having the debate over the past 90 days as we`ve seen the job growth slow down. What`s the catalyst here for action? Will here be any before November?</p><p>GERSH: I think we have seen this movie before and I wouldn`t count on there being a different outcome in Congress.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking of which, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue from where you are tonight, what about that legislative agenda? Anything job related that we can anticipate here in the summer into the fall?</p><p>GERSH: I would absolutely anticipate that Republicans will come back and will try to get the president to move on the fiscal cliff issues, try to get him to agree to extend tax cuts so we can take it off the table. The president has absolutely said he will not do that. Also the rating agencies are watching this debate very closely to see whether Congress comes up with sustainable reforms. As you well know Tom, if Congress doesn`t come up with that and isn`t signed into law, we could be looking at another ratings downgrade for the United States.</p><p>HUDSON: Thank you for the reminder of that, at the intersection of jobs and politics tonight, it`s Darren Gersh in Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Beware of malware Monday. This is a computer virus that could affect your access to the Internet starting this Monday. Tens of thousands of Americans could lose their Internet service. Ruben Ramirez reports.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Come Monday, computer users may find it impossible to reach the Internet. In November, the FBI cracked down on a ring of hackers that figured out how to redirect peoples` computers to websites that were different from what they typed into their search bar. Samara Lynn is a networking analyst at pcmag.com.</p><p>SAMARA LYNN, NETWORKING ANALYST, PCMAG: What these virus makers did was they redirected all these thousands of computers to this site and the more hits that go on this site the more revenue and the more advertising dollars are generated.</p><p>RAMIREZ: One concern: third parties getting a hold of private information.</p><p>LYNN: The biggest threat is you don`t want your information if you`re using a credit card for online shopping or doing any banking. You don`t want to be redirected to a site that could potentially take that information.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Online giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have done a lot to warn people about the malicious software known as DNS changer. What`s the easiest way to figure out if you`re computer has been infected?</p><p>LYNN: There`s a great website that will quickly tell you. It`s <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dns-ok.us\">www.dns-ok.us</url>. It`s the DNS changer checkup and once you click on it, it will automatically check your DNS settings. If you get DNS resolution equals green, you`re fine.</p><p>RAMIREZ: If your screen gives you a red alert, scroll down and follow the link to the FBI website. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: More claims today that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) used anti- competitive tactics to delay the release of the generic version of Lipitor, its top-selling anti-cholesterol pill. Walgreens, Kroger (NYSE:KR) and three other major retail chains sued Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), saying it forced them to buy the more costly Lipitor, rather than a generic. Generic Lipitor entered the market last November, but these companies say it should have come to market about a year earlier. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) denies that and says while some patents on Lipitor expired in the year 2010, others stretched through last year allowing it to delay the launch of generics. The suits has a little impact on Pfizer`s stock Tom. It lost $0.13 today to $22 and change, but there were other companies that had bigger losses in today`s sell-off.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, there weren`t many ports in the storm that we saw in the sell-off after that disappointing job data here Susie. Let`s go ahead and roll with tonight`s \"Market Focus\" taking a look at another month of lackluster job growth really souring the market tone this Friday, capping a week of disappointing economic data and stock price performance. Here`s what the major stock indices did this week. The Dow Industrials on the week falling 0.8 of a percent. The NASDAQ eking out the smallest of gains, 0.1 of a percent higher. The S&amp;P 500 tonight 0.6 of a percent lower compared to one week ago.</p><p>Let`s focus in on Friday`s actions with the week`s losses coming today as the S&amp;P 500 fell from the opening bell after that jobs data. Rising government bond yields in Spain also cast a shadow over worries that the market has still with Europe. The lowest level of the day for the S&amp;P hit about 90 minutes before the closing bell. Volume, it fell a little bit on the big board, down to 595 million shares, 1.4 billion plus shares moving on the NASDAQ.</p><p>All 10 major stock sectors were lower to end the week on the Friday. The tech sector suffered the worst losses, down 1.8 percent. The economically sensitive areas, industrials and materials falling more than 1 percent each.</p><p>Even big tech stocks provided no relief at all today. Those doing big business in Europe especially hit by the selling. Hewlett-Packard`s 3.5 percent drop was the biggest among Dow Industrial components, taking it back below $20 per share. Big blue saw red. IBM falling 2 percent on heavier volume. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shedding 1.6 percent.</p><p>But it was software company Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) that really knocked down tech today. It warned second quarter results will miss earlier predictions thanks in part to weakness in Europe. INFA, the warning sending shares careening, down more than 27.5 percent. Volume huge, the stock falling to a new 52-week low. Other firms in the data services business were hurting with worries about spending on technology. Data storage firm Teradata (NYSE:TDC) shed 10.5 percent. Software maker Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) falling 7.6 percent. Data delivery firm F-5 Networks down almost 7 percent.</p><p>After the close tonight, Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced they will settle their patent infringement fight. Instead of fighting, the two will actually launch a new advertising partnership and expand their distribution deals. Before the news, there are the closing prices. Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! shares down a fraction, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closing up almost 1 percent.</p><p>Even though job growth in the U.S. has slowed to a crawl, that hasn`t hurt the U.S. dollar, especially compared to the euro. The euro falling into a two-year low against the dollar, now $1.23 will buy you one euro. The European currency has been sinking over the continent`s debt crisis. The result of the falling euro, U.S. businesses more price competitive overseas.</p><p>The dollar strength also helping push down commodity prices, especially oil and gold. Crude oil dropping more than 3.5 percent today, settling below $85 per barrel. How about gold back below $1,600 an ounce tonight. Emblematic of today`s risk-averse market, bond prices dropping, bond prices rallying rather, pushing down interest rates. The yield on the 10-year government note 1.55 percent tonight, the lowest yield, the highest price since the beginning of June.</p><p>All five of our most actively traded ETFs lower. The emerging markets fund suffering the biggest drop, down 1.8 percent. That is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The last time we spoke to tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" guest, the U.S. economy was creating more than 200,000 jobs per month. Mark Luschini is the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott with us tonight from Pittsburgh. Mark, that was way back in January. How about that, job growth has slowed considerably. How does it change your investment outlook?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, : Seems like a long time ago, Tom. But it really hasn`t done anything to change it. In fact it`s probably reinforced it. We didn`t know at the time that perhaps some of that increase in job growth that we had in the beginning of the year might have been pulled forward from now on the back of better than expected weather. But as a consequence, we still thought though that we would see still somewhat anemic growth in the United States, slowing growth in Europe, slowing growth in China and that led us to an opinion that we wanted to stay largely domestic with regard to our equity exposure and that`s kind of leaning into larger cap high quality names and especially those that pay handsome dividend yields because in a low-growth world, income matters. And you certainly can`t find much income being produced today by the traditional source of that which is of course fixed income investments.</p><p>HUDSON: And you`ve got some new picks that fit with that strategy, but I want to ask you, are you concerned that this trade is getting pretty crowded, a lot of folks looking for yields in dividends at this point.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Most definitely Tom. I mean granted some of the buying that`s occurred in areas like real estate investment trusts, master (ph) limited partnerships are indicative of almost an indiscriminate search for income and that has pushed some of these traditional bastions of yield to I think somewhat elevated valuations and as a consequence, we need to be under weight or completely unexposed to some areas like real estate investment trusts, like for instance the utility sector and even be light in telecommunications as a consequence. But other sectors do still represent good value and good yields can be found there as well.</p><p>HUDSON: Energy is one of those and that`s first up on your new pick, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), COP, cop, the ticker symbol on this one and dividend yield almost 5 percent. Energy prices have been very volatile as of late. Does this concern you at all especially as the dollar seems to want to strengthen?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Well certainly the pullback in oil prices has hurt the energy patch and as a consequence dragged down the baby with the bath water. But ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is becoming more profitable via shrinking disposing of assets that are non-core, maintain a very high as you mentioned dividend yield. Valuations are inexpensive and ultimately on the prospects of global growth continue to expand and almost inelastic demand for oil among the emerging market countries, we think that bodes well for the energy sector longer term. So secularly we like having exposure in that space and predominantly through names, like the quality of a ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).</p><p>HUDSON: Also looking at healthcare, a little defensive with Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). J&amp;J has been suffering certainly some quality control issues over the past several years, lots of high profile recalls but the stock has had a nice jump in the last six weeks or so. You see value here in the mid 60`s, up 60`s?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Most definitely. New CEO, so hopefully work in progress toward putting some of that if you will (INAUDIBLE) issues behind it starting with a good evaluation one of only four triple A rated companies in America, so obviously pristine balance sheet and a 3.6 percent or so dividend yield makes it appealing for both growth and income seekers alike.</p><p>HUDSON: You liked energy and drugs back when we last spoke with you at the first of the year, January 6th. Let`s take a look at those previous picks with Chevron (NYSE:CVX), CVS (NYSE:CVS) down about 3 percent from then. The Swiss drug giant Novartis down 3 percent. You also like financials, XLF, that exchange-traded fund up about 8 percent. Do you still like these spaces?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We do like financial still among the other two as well, but have leaned more away from the big universal banks, the money centers into the regional banks. We think again somewhat steadier U.S. economic conditions coupled with what we think is a hardening of pricing in the housing market should lead to stabilization of regional bank balance sheets and so we would continue to be exposed to that space.</p><p>HUDSON: You own everything that we mentioned here tonight, Mark?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I do.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark Luschini, our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest. He`s with Janney Montgomery Scott. Quick programming note here, long-time NBR \"Market Monitor\" Gary Motyl passed away recently. He was the chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton and we will miss his market insights here on NBR. You can find his last \"Market Monitor\" appearance on our website, nbr.com.</p><p>GHARIB: And next week on NBR, it`s the start of earnings season. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) CEO Klaus Kleinfeld joins us on Monday. He`ll talk about how the giant aluminum maker did in the second quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year.</p><p>And when it comes to customer service, sometimes you have to give customers more than what they ask for. This week Lou`s been thinking about dandelions. Here`s author and educator Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: My son is not a little boy any more. In fact he just turned 40. I was smiling the other day when I thought about a special moment when he was about the age his older daughter now is. He came into the house and handed my wife a bunch of dandelions he had picked in the back yard. These are so sweet, she beamed as he looked on with pride, but they look kind of smashed. I know, he responded immediately. I stomped on every one to make sure there were no bees.</p><p>As a business speaker and writer, I think all the time about what business is really about. I know it`s about finding a need and filling it. But the older I get -- maybe I should say the more experienced I get -- I think it`s really about stomping on dandelions. The people who do business with you, customers, clients, patients, whatever you call them, they`re out there in the backyard of their lives and they also wonder which dandelions have bees on them. Your job -- my job -- is not just to make a sale or fill a need, it`s to reassure. Yes, this is the right product or service for you. Yes, this will make you feel comfortable. Yes, this is the finest quality we can offer. Yes, you can trust us to treat you with hospitality and joy and grace. Look, most people can go to a number of places to get what we do. We need to give them a concrete reason to deal with us. I happen to think that stomping on dandelions is a darn good one. I`m Lou Heckler.</p><p>GHARIB: And yes you can trust us to have a lot of interesting news next week Tom. We have those earnings reports that we were talking about and also we`re going to be kicking off a week long look at the second, the outlook for the second half of the year with lots of stock market analysis.</p><p>HUDSON: Always a lot happens every second half of the year, but this year especially you got the election. You got all the fiscal issues coming up and of course the Federal Reserve by the end of the year says operation twist may be over. Lots of concerns about what`s going to happen over the next six months or so Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of uncertainty and we`ve got to get answers to that. But anyway in the meantime, have a great weekend everyone and I hope you do too, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: You as well Susie. That is NBR for this Friday night, July 6. Thanks for joining us here in the broadcast. We`ll see you online at nbr.com and back here on Monday night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 17. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight.  Some cautious signs  of relief by investors around the world today.  There`s a rescue plan in  the works for Greece. Jittery financial markets stabilized somewhat after  Germany agreed to a compromise deal to resolve the economic problems in  Greece.  U.S. stocks took that news and finished mixed today.  The Dow  Industrials was able to gain 42 points; the S&amp;P slipped more than seven,  rather the NASDAQ slipped more than seven.  The S&amp;P 500 gained almost four.  </p><p>Now here`s how things looked for what was a rough week for investors.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added almost 1.5 percent.  That snapped a  six-week losing streak.  The NASDAQ though didn`t fare as well, falling 1  percent for the week.  The S&amp;P turned positive this week, ending a six-week  slide, adding just a fraction.  Despite today`s market rebound of sorts in  America, investors are still worried about Greece.  As Suzanne Pratt  reports, Americans will be following the Greek drama closely for weeks to  come. </p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Recently Greece  has gone from being viewed as a fabulous tourist spot to a thorn in the  side of U.S. stock investors. The question now is whether Greece and its  financial woes will dictate the direction of the American stock market for  the immediate future. NYSE trader Jonathan Corpina says it absolutely will  because investors hate uncertainty and Greece`s financial outlook is far  from certain. </p><p>JONATHAN CORPINA:  Until we have some stability, any information about  a plan or some sort of recovery that`s put in place coming out of Europe  and Greece at that point then investors will feel much more confident to  get back in the market. Looking into today, markets are positive this  morning and leading into the afternoon due to the fact that the headlines  are coming our of Greece. </p><p>PRATT: Market strategist Rick Bensignor agrees positive news out of  Greece is just as important for U.S. investors as negative. </p><p>RICK BENSIGNOR, MARKET STRATEGIST:  If by chance something good out  over the weekend, a good headline or something like that, it wouldn`t  surprise me if the S&amp;P was up 20, 25 points on Monday, the Dow up a couple  hundred points. Good news could easily turn the psychology very quickly. </p><p>PRATT:  Still others say the issue right now for the U.S. stock market  is that it`s in a bit of an information void. Reporting season for  corporate profits is still nearly a month away and lately there`s been  little major U.S. economic data for investors to chew on. As a result,  every twist and turn across the pond with Greece and its weaker neighbors  gets extra special attention on U.S. trading floors.  And experts say  investors should expect Greece and its debt troubles to remain in the  headlines for some time. </p><p>BENSIGNOR:  You can`t fix it for good over the weekend. It`s too big a  problem with too far reaching circumstances. And, it`s not just Greece.  Greece is just the one in the headlines the most these days. But, there`s a  likelihood that this stuff spreads to Ireland, Spain and Portugal. </p><p>PRATT:   One thing many market pros agree on is if Greece defaults on  its government debt, it will mean big trouble for U.S. stocks. In fact,  some estimate major market averages could quickly lose as much as 15  percent. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>HUDSON:  While Greece`s debt woes are grabbing headlines tonight,  Italy`s problems may be heating up. Late today, Moody`s investor service  put Italy on review for possible downgrade.  Moody`s is worried the country  won`t be able to cut spending enough to reduce its debt.   </p><p>Back here in the U.S. meantime, watch for slower economic growth.  That`s what the International Monetary Fund predicts. The global lending  agency today said it thinks the U.S. economy will grow 2.5 percent this  year, 2.7 percent next year. Both are down from a previous estimate issued  just two months ago. The IMF`s Jose Vinals says the U.S. and Eurozone  nations are playing with fire, unless they take steps to cut their budget  deficits immediately. </p><p>JOSE VINALS, FINANCIAL COUNSELLOR, IMF:  Well, I think that the  biggest threat to global financial stability is that governments in various  countries may not have enough political resolve to take the important  measures which are needed to deal with the legacy of the crisis.</p><p>HUDSON:  Vinals thinks that the global economy has gained ground  despite slowing recently.  He sees it accelerating in the second half of  the year. </p><p>SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Let`s check now at the  stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel.   With jobs still scarce and gas  prices still high, consumers are feeling down. A new survey on consumer  sentiment from Reuters University of Michigan shows a drop in confidence.   The consumer sentiment index fell to 71.8.  Economists had expected a  higher, more positive number.  And more evidence today of just how grim the  job market is. The Labor Department says last month that the unemployment  rate fell in fewer than half of the nation`s states. May`s jobless rate was  down in 24 states, up in 13 and unchanged in 13, showing job growth has  stalled across much of the country. </p><p>And still ahead on the program tonight, tonight`s \"Market Monitor\"  takes on financial stocks.  Bernie Schaeffer tells us if he thinks the  year`s worst performing stock sector is ready for a rebound.  He`s chairman  of Schaeffer`s Investment Research. </p><p>HUDSON:  Exports have been a bright spot for the U.S. economy this  year, helping boost growth and create American jobs.  But new trade deals  with Panama, Colombia and South Korea have been stalled in Congress for  months on Capitol Hill. That standoff may end soon. Washington bureau chief  Darren Gersh spoke with U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk. Kirk also is  the former major of Dallas, Texas.  Darren began by asking why it`s been so  hard to pass these trade agreements. </p><p>AMB. RON KIRK, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, because you`re in  Washington. And everything is, you know, everything is hard in this town.  But the reason that we took the time to look at Korea and Panama and  Colombia, not just from the standpoint of what does it take to pass them,  but look at them in the broader context, that what 95 percent of the  world`s consumers somewhere other than the United States, part of our  success in the future is going to be linked to our ability to take more of  what we make, manufacture, innovate, create here in the U.S. and share it  with the world. And so within that, you`ve got to have a trade policy that  not only speaks to those that say hey, pass these agreements, get going, we  need the market access. But you`ve also got to have a trade policy that  reflects those that say we want to make sure our trade reflects our core  values, particularly how you ought to treat workers, not just here but also  around the world.  And that passing the agreements with trade adjustment  assistance gives us the best chance to have a balanced approach. </p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Right, but  Republicans argue that trade adjustment assistance which helps workers who  lose their jobs because of trade, they don`t want it. They say that it`s  not an effective program. They want to pass these agreements without it.  Why is that such a priority for the administration? </p><p>KIRK:  Well, Democrats on the other hand say trade has become a primer  for shipping our jobs overseas.  And the trades, you know, the unfair trade  deals are the reason we`ve seen manufacturing and they don`t want the trade  deals. Well, the reality and part of our challenge in this administration,  what President Obama tasks me to do is say we`ve got to find common ground.  There`s no way we`re going to disadvantage American exporters and  manufacturers by saying we`re going to put us on less favorable terms in  these markets that other countries are getting. But at the same time, we  can`t dismiss the concerns of those that have said honestly that a lot of  Americans, through no fault of their own, that happen to work for an  industry that may have been displaced by trade, they typically are 46 years  old, Anglo and the sole breadwinner of their family and they have good  skills. And if we can get them the training, the coaching that they need,  they can become reemployed. We not only save their job, we keep those  families intact. And in many cases we keep those communities intact. </p><p>GERSH:  But really what this comes down to is how are you going to do?   How are you going to get this done because many of our biggest trade  programs are on hold right now, have expired. How are you going to get this  done and when? </p><p>KIRK:  All along we have made a point.  Our goal was not just to pass  a trade agreement. We`re trying to build a new paradigm and a new rationale  to the American public that is increasingly skeptical about trade, about  how we can do trade in a different way. And for us there has to be that  holistic approach that you combine new market access through trade  agreements with strong enforcement, which we`ve done at USTR and we reflect  our core values as represented by our commitment to trade adjustment  assistance. That`s how you get it done. And we`re closer than I think most  people think we are. </p><p>GERSH:  The president has set a goal of doubling exports, but  everybody else in the world has set a goal of expanding exports.  Everybody  can`t export their way out of their problems. How is it going to work? </p><p>KIRK: We can, it is work. And the one good thing is you know the  president laid out that marker two years ago and remarkably we`re well on  pace to meeting that. One of the things helping to drive our economic  recovery is the reality that exports and only 13 percent of our GDP are  contributing almost as much to our economic recovery as consumer spending. </p><p>GERSH:  Well, U.S. trade representative and Mavericks fan Ron Kirk,  thank you very much for your time. </p><p>KIRK:  Huge Mavericks fan.  Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And a U-turn today for one of the nation`s most powerful  lobbies.  AARP, which represents millions of older Americans said it is  open to modest cuts in Social Security benefits for future recipients. The  group has been a leading opponent of cutting benefits. But AARP now says it  wants to limit any changes in benefits, while making sure the system  remains solvent. </p><p>Well, Tom, it was a choppy week to be an understatement. And now  investors have a weekend to think things over and start all over again on  Monday. </p><p>HUDSON:  Start all over again and of course always looking to Europe  over the weekend, really, for the clues that we`re going to see on Monday.  But it was quite a day today here, Susie. Let`s go ahead and roll with  tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"  We had a mixed finish for the major indices for  the second day in a row. Investors still trying to balance the threat of  European government debt against the consistency of lower energy prices  that we`ve seen over the past several sessions. Let`s start by updating  where the S&amp;P 500 is in relation back to its March low. There`s that March  low that we had back in the spring. This remains an area of key technical  support and so far, it is holding as we can see with the fractional rise  we`ve got with in the S&amp;P index.  It bounced off that level.  The market  has held above that March low, so far optimistic. </p><p>The slide in oil prices meantime, here`s what the last 90 sessions in  the front month crude oil contract in New York looked like. Crude here  falling today another 2 percent. This is the lowest price that we`ve seen  since February.  Energy prices -- that may help the broad market lower  prices, but it hurt energy stocks. Drilling company Nabors falling almost 4  percent. Oil producer Hess (NYSE: HES) dropping 1.5 percent. That`s a new  2011 low for Hess (NYSE: HES). And equipment company National Oilwell Varco  shed just over 1 percent. These were the leading energy stock losers today  in that sector. </p><p>Technology stocks also weak and check out Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) here.  Continues to see money coming out of its share price, sinking another 3  percent today. This is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)`s lowest price that we`ve seen  in many months since September of last year.  An analyst at investment  banking firm Raymond James reports that paid online search spending is  slowing down for the industry.  Clearly that`s taken a chunk out of Google  (NASDAQ: GOOG).  Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)`s smartphone operating system  Android is part of the challenge for Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)`s  Blackberry.  RIMM shares just got crushed today, very active trading.  Look  at this, 21.5 percent lower, losing more than a fifth of its value. This is  just the past 30 sessions where you see the trend lower and then just  falling off a shelf today. Volume exploding because of that sour outlook  that we told you about last night. Let`s pull out to the past five years,  showing this recent drop really in context and here it is over the past  several months with RIMM, now in fact below the March of `09 low.  Remember  this is the low for the broader market. We`re seeing prices here in RIMM 27  3/4. We haven`t seen that since the fall of 2006.  Now we do have an  analysis of Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)`s chart on our website.  Go  to NBR on pbs.org.</p><p>A couple of other big tech stocks that are in the Dow Industrial  index. Cisco dropping another half percent, just pennies above its most  recent 52-week low. The company has struggled with disappointing guidance  trying to restructure. Cisco is the worst Dow stock this year.  Since  January, we`ve got it down 25 percent. </p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) meantime the best Dow stock today with a 1.2  percent rally.  It`s also though negative for the year as it continues to  trend lower for tech. The worst stock sector this year, financials, not  today though.  Real estate service firm CB Richard Ellis jumping more than  4.5 percent.  Tennessee-based bank First Horizon gaining almost 4 percent.  And Zion bank out of Utah up about 3.5 percent, helping out the financials.  According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" PNC Financial meantime is the  winner in the bidding war for the U.S. retail operation of Royal Bank of  Canada.  No confirmation.  Here`s PNC shares trending lower here, along  with the rest of the financial sector, slipping almost 3 percent.  Heavy  volume, this is the lowest price of PNC since December. </p><p>The \"Journal\" also reports securities regulators are considering civil  charges against credit rating agencies. Moody`s shares dropping 5 percent  on this news.  Parent company of Standard &amp; Poor`s, McGraw-Hill falling 3.6  percent.  </p><p>We saw a trio of new stocks going public this week, get you updated  here, a couple of high profile issues. Bankrate.com sold its stock at $15  today for the first time, rising a tad. Internet radio provider Pandora  Media started at $16.  It`s below that IPO price tonight. And oil and nat  gas services company Compressco Partners began at $20 and it slipped from  there.  That is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Former Washington Mutual CEO Kerry Killinger and other top  Wamu executives are in talks with the FDIC to settle a nearly $1 billion  lawsuit filed against them. Killinger has until to the end of this month to  respond to the FDIC`s complaint against him. Regulators allege Wamu  executives took extreme risks with the bank`s mortgage portfolio, which led  to the largest bank failure in U.S. history. </p><p>Meanwhile, another former bank executive is headed to prison for eight  years. Catherine Kissick (ph) used to head a mortgage division at the now-  defunct Colonial Bank. She learned her punishment today. Prosecutors say  Kissick`s role in a $3 billion fraud scheme led to Colonial`s demise, as  well as to Taylor Bean and Whitaker -- one of the nation`s largest private  mortgage companies. Taylor Bean`s former chairman and owner Lee Farkas (ph)  is due to be sentenced later this month. </p><p>HUDSON:  Here`s what we`re watching for next week. Our scheduled  Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Alan Lancz.  He`s editor of the \"Lancz  Letter.\"  The Federal Reserve will be back in the spotlight.  It begins a  two-day meeting on Tuesday next week. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a  news conference on Wednesday.  Monday on the program, creating jobs during  challenging economic times. We talk to state leaders about what the role of  government should be. </p><p>GHARIB:  Food prices will likely head higher over the next decade.  That`s what the United Nations and the Organization for Economic  Corporation and Development are predicting.  The reason - rising  commodities prices and demand. The groups fear that higher food prices will  hurt the world`s poor who already spend as much as 80 percent of their  income on food. </p><p>HUDSON:  The fight against Medicare and Medicaid fraud goes high tech  next month. That`s when the Federal government begins using new software  aimed at flagging would-be criminals before they get a check from Uncle  Sam.  Medicare has awarded a $77 million contract for the new system to  defense giant Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) and a group of companies.  They`ll use technology that`s similar to that of banking and  telecommunication companies to spot fraud. </p><p>Greece, jobs, housing. There is no shortage of worries for investors  and that may be one reason to get more optimistic.  So says tonight`s  \"Market Monitor.\"  Bernie Schaeffer back with us, chairman of Schaeffer`s  Investment Research, publisher of the \"Option Advisor Market Letter.\"   Always nice to see you Bernie. Welcome back. </p><p>BERNIE SCHAEFFER, CHMN., SCHAEFFER`S INVESTMENT RESEARCH: Thank you,  Tom. </p><p>HUDSON:  It was January when you were here last and you said that the  market was in a disbelief rally. Investors just didn`t believe that stock  prices deserved to move higher. We`re in essentially the same place in the  market today than we were back in January. What about the market rally? </p><p>SCHAEFFER:  Still in disbelief. Got another magazine cover from \"Time\"  recently, June 20th dated, talking about what economic recovery question  mark, still no major end close equity mutual funds. Something interesting  right here and now is the market is at a point, all the major averages are  flat for the year. Very often you find that when you reach a benchmark like  that, just as we did in March, it is time for a rally. People look to come  in at points like that. </p><p>HUDSON:  One of the places that has fueled this move back to flat is  the financial space. The financial stocks are always seen as market  leading. It`s clearly led the market lower over the past six weeks. It`s  the worst performing sector so far this year. Are you saying, if the market  can move higher from here, that bank stocks will as well? </p><p>SCHAEFFER:   I think the bank stocks are an interesting short. And an  interesting put by, simply because you mentioned that people were looking  at the bank stocks and people were quite bullish on the bank stocks.  Analysts are still extremely bullish.  There are big fund planners in there  if the sector had not been able to get out of its own way. </p><p>HUDSON: So you are bearish on banks? </p><p>SCHAEFFER:   I bearish. This is the slope of hope that sectors decline  on until you get the capitulation stage. So I think there is still a good  short trade shaping up in the banking sector even though I`m bullish on the  overall market. </p><p>HUDSON:  You are using options here to play the downside that you  expect in banks looking at the XLF, ticker symbol for the I shares,  financial select. Here is the options trade, buy January 2012 at the money  puts, the option to sell, a bearish call. It profits if this exchange- traded fund falls. It has clearly fallen a lot already. And you are  expecting it to what move into the single digits, perhaps? </p><p>SCHAEFFER:   That would be a home run on this option trade but you  know, even if you got a 25 percent decline, that would be a very nice gain.  And it`s a good hedge for a sector that you might be bullish on. </p><p>HUDSON:  So noted. You do like consumers and at least consumer stocks,  specifically retail stocks. Here is the S&amp;P retail exchange-traded fund,  the XRT.  You are looking at again January 2012 calls, a bullish call, an  option to buy this exchange-traded fund. If the XRT moves up at the  rallies, this option rallies in price as well. What`s fueling retail? </p><p>SCHAEFFER:   What`s fueling the retail stocks is kind of the opposite  of what the banking and financial stocks are having trouble with. The  actual price action has been strong. Despite the fact that Wall Street is  very skeptical on these stocks and so what that means is, this is the wall  of worry that bullish sectors and markets climb. It means that sideline  money is being drawn in reluctantly but steadily into sectors like  retailers whose price action and earnings is positively surprising and  potentially out of sectors like financial where the results are negatively  surprising and the expectations are high. </p><p>HUDSON: That is your set-up for the next six months. Six months ago  when you were here you had a couple of options plays. Let`s look how these  have turned out. You were essentially bullish on the I shares Russell 2000  exchange- traded fund, August at the money calls. The option price though  is down 43 percent as the exchange-traded fund essentially has gone  nowhere. So time decay is what option traders call this. Do you still like  this? </p><p>SCHAEFFER:   Yes. And time decay versus leverage is the conundrum of  making money in buying options. </p><p>HUDSON:  Meantime this one was a big strikeout. You lost all your  money with the June at the money calls for the iPath S&amp;P 500, VIX exchange- traded note.  Essentially you were looking for volatility as a hedge which  has actually gone down in the last six months even though it has ticked up  here lately in the past few weeks. </p><p>SCHAEFFER:   Right. And I would rather hedge sector to sector as we  are talking about today.</p><p>HUDSON: So noted.  What about disclosures for these options? </p><p>SCHAEFFER:  I don`t have positions in the XLF or XRT exchange-traded  fund. </p><p>HUDSON: We`re going to catch up in six months. Nice to see you again.</p><p>SCHAEFFER:   Great, pleasure.</p><p>HUDSON:  Bernie Schaeffer, Schaeffer Investment Research. </p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, the author who got kids and parents  reading together has something new, but it`s not a book. Harry Potter  author JK Rowling will soon unveil her latest venture and all we know so  far is that it`s called Pottermore and it won`t be a book. The site has few  details, but links to a countdown clock marking the days and hours until  the launch Tom and media watchers are speculating that the big announcement  will be about some sort of online \"Harry Potter\" experience, perfect thing  for you to do with your two boys. </p><p>HUDSON:  I tell you. We`re not quite there yet for the Harry Potter  books but we will be in just a short few years, Susie. That is NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday night, June 17.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great weekend, you as well Susie. </p><p>GHARIB:  Same to you Tom and a happy Father`s Day to you and all the  other fathers in our audience.  I`m Susie Gharib.  Hope to see all of you  again next week. </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Susie Gharib. Only 80,000 people got jobs in June, way below estimates. But the news isn't all bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: I'm Tom Hudson. Employment is the issue this election season. Tonight we'll hear what the presidential candidates say about today's job numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And it's infected thousands of computers already. Are you ready for Monday's web attack?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more coming up tonight right here on NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: Another lousy jobs report today. American businesses were hiring in June, but not a whole lot, Tom and stocks sold off on the news.</p><p>HUDSON: A lackluster report here Susie, this is three straight months now of weak hiring, showing the U.S. economy obviously still struggling. U.S. employers added just 80,000 jobs. That's certainly less than the 100,000 jobs expected. The unemployment rate meantime unchanged, 8.2 percent. That's stuck pretty much in the same level for most of this year. Investors clearly hoping for some stronger job growth, pushing down stocks in reaction to the disappointment. At the bell, the Dow was down 124 points. The NASDAQ fell almost 39, the S&amp;P was off nearly 13. So between the weak jobs data and European worries, caution remains the business plan for many companies.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: CEOs might continue to play things fairly close to the vest. We know they're holding elevated cash levels and they're going to therefore potentially defer business investment and hiring which once again feeds back into maintaining a slow pace of economic growth in the U.S. going forward. So we need animal spirits to be rekindled here through greater certainty about what the future looks like than what we have today.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark Luschini is tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest. We'll talk more with him later in the program. But first tonight, Suzanne Pratt takes a deeper look at today's employment report.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When the economy creates 80,000 new jobs in one month, it's good enough to keep us from slipping into another recession, but not good enough to chip away at that pesky unemployment rate. In the first quarter of this year, employers added an average of 225,000 jobs. But in the second quarter, the average downshifted to a disappointing 75,000. Some economists credit warm winter weather for the early boost in hiring, saying it robbed jobs from the spring. But no matter how you slice it, the economy is slowing and businesses are afraid to commit to new workers.</p><p>CONRAD DEQUADROS, SR. ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS: The debt crisis in Europe has the potential to dip the U.S. economy back into recession, although that's unlikely, it's probably a concern for businesses. And secondly we have a lot of uncertainty related to tax policy and fiscal issues this year.</p><p>PRATT: Today's weak data sparked new debate about what more the Federal Reserve can do to help. To some, a new round of bond buying, known as QE3, looks like a strong possibility.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE WEALTH MGMT.: It has to put quantitative easing on the table and it has to be a viable option for the Federal Reserve. Did this report basically tell us that the economy has completely falling off the cliff, not really. But it's certainly telling us that we're not making much progress.</p><p>PRATT: Still, not all of the June labor snapshot was doom and gloom. Average hourly wages gained $0.06 and so did the amount of time spent on the job by one tenth of an hour or six minutes. Both suggest support for consumer spending, particularly as lower gas prices puts more money into peoples' wallets.</p><p>DEQUADROS: This is sort of the strongest income increase that we've seen or implied income increase from the employment report since February. And then on top of that, it's an increase that's in real terms because we have prices that are falling.</p><p>PRATT: Against this backdrop, there is some optimism about the labor market in the second half of this year. Many expect a pickup in job growth, but not enough to bring the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Our next guest sees a silver lining in today's gloomy jobs numbers. He's Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Mark, it's hard to be positive these days . What is it that you're seeing in the labor market that gives you some hope?</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well Susie, let me say that was a disappointing number and the reporter was right. If we stay at 80K, unemployment will rise and that an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, that will be very uncomfortable. So we need to see better numbers and I think we will. I think American businesses are in good shape. They've reduced their cost structures, their profit margin are as wide as they've ever been. They're as profitable as they have ever been. Their balance sheets are very strong. They've reduced debt. So in my mind, it's not a question can American businesses invest and hire more? It's a matter of confidence. They're still very very nervous and that's the missing ingredient here is those animal spirits that the other economists were talking about.</p><p>GHARIB: At the beginning of this year, businesses were hiring at a very rapid clip, 200,000 people plus a month but not any more now and that's just worrying a lot of people. When do you see the hiring picking up and what's going to motivate and drive companies to do more hiring?</p><p>ZANDI: You make a good point and just to reinforce it, we were creating 250,000 jobs per month back in December, January, February. The last three months we've been creating less than 100,000 per month. Both overstate the case. We weren't going nearly as strongly earlier in the year and we're not as weak currently. The reality is somewhere in between and I think that will become more evident as we make our way through the summer and into the fall months. I really don't think businesses are going to fully engage and really let loose and begin to hire in a more aggressive way until we nail down our fiscal situation. We've got a number of significant fiscal issues we have to solve after the presidential election and also not until we get more clarity with respect to what's happening in Europe. Europe is still a very serious threat to our economy and I think that's making people very nervous and businesses is forestalling more business hiring.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of CEO's and business people that I've been talking to are really spooked out by what's going on in Europe. You were just there. From the people you talked to while you were in Europe, what was your sense of their seriousness about an action plan and a timetable to fix their situation and get the economy growing over there?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, you know, it's a bit discouraging because there's just no consensus with respect to how it's going to play out. You talk to one person and you get one story and another person a totally different one. I was encouraged by the fact that in general I think there was consensus with regard to what needs to get done. In fact, a few of those things actually got done at the end of last week when the EU ministers met and we got some action. I do think it's a process and I think this process is going to take place over the course of the next couple years. And so we're going to be facing several rounds if not more of financial market turmoil. That's going to be what's necessary to generate the political will to make the changes that they need to, but at the end of the day Susie, I think they will and once that become clear, that's when American businesses I think will get going and we'll see more hiring.</p><p>GHARIB: OK. We'll leave it there. Mark thank you so much for coming on the program. We appreciate it. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.</p><p>HUDSON: Election 2012 now, there's one thing investors and politicians have in common: they both watch closely the monthly jobs' report for clues about the future. And in this election season especially, the jobs data could determine the winner. Here's Darren Gersh in Washington.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Even the president did not seem particularly satisfied with today's jobs report. Mr. Obama said the employment numbers were moving in the right direction but quickly added --</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to get back to a time when middle class families and those working to get into the middle class have some basic security. That's our goal, so we've got to grow the economy even faster.</p><p>GERSH: Whether or not we are moving in the right direction fast enough is the critical question for the election. Political scientists believe most voters begin to make up their minds about the president's handling of the economy right now in the six months or so before casting their votes.</p><p>WILLIAM GALSTON, SR. FELLOW, BROOKINGS: So I would say after another two jobs reports, the summer reports, July and August reports, by Labor Day, I think a lot of people are going to have made up their minds.</p><p>GERSH: Republican challenger Mitt Romney urged voters not to wait that long. He blamed the poor jobs' report on high taxes and burdensome regulation.</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The president's policies have not gotten America working again and the president's going to have to stand up and take responsibility for it.</p><p>GERSH: There may still be some spillover in this jobs' report from strong hiring over the warm winter. If that's the case, job creation could bounce up a little in the coming months, perhaps averaging 150,000 jobs a month. But even that might not be enough good news to sway voters.</p><p>HEIDI SHEIRHOLZ, ECON., ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Obama or any other incumbent politician, they are really going to want to see stronger job growth between now and November. I don't necessarily think that we are going to see the numbers that will bring the unemployment rate down in a substantial way in the next few months.</p><p>GERSH: So Tom that means that the president will head into the election day with the unemployment rate still painfully high.</p><p>HUDSON: Darren, voters want to know what is the policy to get more Americans back to work faster? The president's been talking about patience not being satisfied and Governor Romney has been criticizing the president. So what are the policies to get more Americans back to work?</p><p>GERSH: Well today the president was looking backwards a little bit defending the auto bailout saying that it accounted for saving a lot of jobs in Ohio, a few swing states, a lot of auto workers there. President's also been pushing still for infrastructure spending. He says a lot of unemployed construction workers, need to get them back to work. He talked about support for state and local government which have been laying off a lot of people as you know. Governor Romney has been talking about the need to bring corporate taxes down. We have a high corporate tax rate he says, the highest in the world and also he's been talking about regulatory reform. So in some ways, a lot of these issues and positions should sound very familiar.</p><p>HUDSON: It seems like we've been having this discussion as they've been having the debate over the past 90 days as we've seen the job growth slow down. What's the catalyst here for action? Will here be any before November?</p><p>GERSH: I think we have seen this movie before and I wouldn't count on there being a different outcome in Congress.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking of which, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue from where you are tonight, what about that legislative agenda? Anything job related that we can anticipate here in the summer into the fall?</p><p>GERSH: I would absolutely anticipate that Republicans will come back and will try to get the president to move on the fiscal cliff issues, try to get him to agree to extend tax cuts so we can take it off the table. The president has absolutely said he will not do that. Also the rating agencies are watching this debate very closely to see whether Congress comes up with sustainable reforms. As you well know Tom, if Congress doesn't come up with that and isn't signed into law, we could be looking at another ratings downgrade for the United States.</p><p>HUDSON: Thank you for the reminder of that, at the intersection of jobs and politics tonight, it's Darren Gersh in Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Beware of malware Monday. This is a computer virus that could affect your access to the Internet starting this Monday. Tens of thousands of Americans could lose their Internet service. Ruben Ramirez reports.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Come Monday, computer users may find it impossible to reach the Internet. In November, the FBI cracked down on a ring of hackers that figured out how to redirect peoples' computers to websites that were different from what they typed into their search bar. Samara Lynn is a networking analyst at pcmag.com.</p><p>SAMARA LYNN, NETWORKING ANALYST, PCMAG: What these virus makers did was they redirected all these thousands of computers to this site and the more hits that go on this site the more revenue and the more advertising dollars are generated.</p><p>RAMIREZ: One concern: third parties getting a hold of private information.</p><p>LYNN: The biggest threat is you don't want your information if you're using a credit card for online shopping or doing any banking. You don't want to be redirected to a site that could potentially take that information.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Online giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have done a lot to warn people about the malicious software known as DNS changer. What's the easiest way to figure out if you're computer has been infected?</p><p>LYNN: There's a great website that will quickly tell you. It's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dns-ok.us\">www.dns-ok.us</url>. It's the DNS changer checkup and once you click on it, it will automatically check your DNS settings. If you get DNS resolution equals green, you're fine.</p><p>RAMIREZ: If your screen gives you a red alert, scroll down and follow the link to the FBI website. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: More claims today that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) used anti- competitive tactics to delay the release of the generic version of Lipitor, its top-selling anti-cholesterol pill. Walgreens, Kroger (NYSE:KR) and three other major retail chains sued Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), saying it forced them to buy the more costly Lipitor, rather than a generic. Generic Lipitor entered the market last November, but these companies say it should have come to market about a year earlier. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) denies that and says while some patents on Lipitor expired in the year 2010, others stretched through last year allowing it to delay the launch of generics. The suits has a little impact on Pfizer's stock Tom. It lost $0.13 today to $22 and change, but there were other companies that had bigger losses in today's sell-off.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes, there weren't many ports in the storm that we saw in the sell-off after that disappointing job data here Susie. Let's go ahead and roll with tonight's \"Market Focus\" taking a look at another month of lackluster job growth really souring the market tone this Friday, capping a week of disappointing economic data and stock price performance. Here's what the major stock indices did this week. The Dow Industrials on the week falling 0.8 of a percent. The NASDAQ eking out the smallest of gains, 0.1 of a percent higher. The S&amp;P 500 tonight 0.6 of a percent lower compared to one week ago.</p><p>Let's focus in on Friday's actions with the week's losses coming today as the S&amp;P 500 fell from the opening bell after that jobs data. Rising government bond yields in Spain also cast a shadow over worries that the market has still with Europe. The lowest level of the day for the S&amp;P hit about 90 minutes before the closing bell. Volume, it fell a little bit on the big board, down to 595 million shares, 1.4 billion plus shares moving on the NASDAQ.</p><p>All 10 major stock sectors were lower to end the week on the Friday. The tech sector suffered the worst losses, down 1.8 percent. The economically sensitive areas, industrials and materials falling more than 1 percent each.</p><p>Even big tech stocks provided no relief at all today. Those doing big business in Europe especially hit by the selling. Hewlett-Packard's 3.5 percent drop was the biggest among Dow Industrial components, taking it back below $20 per share. Big blue saw red. IBM falling 2 percent on heavier volume. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shedding 1.6 percent.</p><p>But it was software company Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) that really knocked down tech today. It warned second quarter results will miss earlier predictions thanks in part to weakness in Europe. INFA, the warning sending shares careening, down more than 27.5 percent. Volume huge, the stock falling to a new 52-week low. Other firms in the data services business were hurting with worries about spending on technology. Data storage firm Teradata (NYSE:TDC) shed 10.5 percent. Software maker Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) falling 7.6 percent. Data delivery firm F-5 Networks down almost 7 percent.</p><p>After the close tonight, Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced they will settle their patent infringement fight. Instead of fighting, the two will actually launch a new advertising partnership and expand their distribution deals. Before the news, there are the closing prices. Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! shares down a fraction, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closing up almost 1 percent.</p><p>Even though job growth in the U.S. has slowed to a crawl, that hasn't hurt the U.S. dollar, especially compared to the euro. The euro falling into a two-year low against the dollar, now $1.23 will buy you one euro. The European currency has been sinking over the continent's debt crisis. The result of the falling euro, U.S. businesses more price competitive overseas.</p><p>The dollar strength also helping push down commodity prices, especially oil and gold. Crude oil dropping more than 3.5 percent today, settling below $85 per barrel. How about gold back below $1,600 an ounce tonight. Emblematic of today's risk-averse market, bond prices dropping, bond prices rallying rather, pushing down interest rates. The yield on the 10-year government note 1.55 percent tonight, the lowest yield, the highest price since the beginning of June.</p><p>All five of our most actively traded ETFs lower. The emerging markets fund suffering the biggest drop, down 1.8 percent. That is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>The last time we spoke to tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest, the U.S. economy was creating more than 200,000 jobs per month. Mark Luschini is the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott with us tonight from Pittsburgh. Mark, that was way back in January. How about that, job growth has slowed considerably. How does it change your investment outlook?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, : Seems like a long time ago, Tom. But it really hasn't done anything to change it. In fact it's probably reinforced it. We didn't know at the time that perhaps some of that increase in job growth that we had in the beginning of the year might have been pulled forward from now on the back of better than expected weather. But as a consequence, we still thought though that we would see still somewhat anemic growth in the United States, slowing growth in Europe, slowing growth in China and that led us to an opinion that we wanted to stay largely domestic with regard to our equity exposure and that's kind of leaning into larger cap high quality names and especially those that pay handsome dividend yields because in a low-growth world, income matters. And you certainly can't find much income being produced today by the traditional source of that which is of course fixed income investments.</p><p>HUDSON: And you've got some new picks that fit with that strategy, but I want to ask you, are you concerned that this trade is getting pretty crowded, a lot of folks looking for yields in dividends at this point.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Most definitely Tom. I mean granted some of the buying that's occurred in areas like real estate investment trusts, master (ph) limited partnerships are indicative of almost an indiscriminate search for income and that has pushed some of these traditional bastions of yield to I think somewhat elevated valuations and as a consequence, we need to be under weight or completely unexposed to some areas like real estate investment trusts, like for instance the utility sector and even be light in telecommunications as a consequence. But other sectors do still represent good value and good yields can be found there as well.</p><p>HUDSON: Energy is one of those and that's first up on your new pick, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), COP, cop, the ticker symbol on this one and dividend yield almost 5 percent. Energy prices have been very volatile as of late. Does this concern you at all especially as the dollar seems to want to strengthen?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Well certainly the pullback in oil prices has hurt the energy patch and as a consequence dragged down the baby with the bath water. But ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is becoming more profitable via shrinking disposing of assets that are non-core, maintain a very high as you mentioned dividend yield. Valuations are inexpensive and ultimately on the prospects of global growth continue to expand and almost inelastic demand for oil among the emerging market countries, we think that bodes well for the energy sector longer term. So secularly we like having exposure in that space and predominantly through names, like the quality of a ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).</p><p>HUDSON: Also looking at healthcare, a little defensive with Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). J&amp;J has been suffering certainly some quality control issues over the past several years, lots of high profile recalls but the stock has had a nice jump in the last six weeks or so. You see value here in the mid 60's, up 60's?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Most definitely. New CEO, so hopefully work in progress toward putting some of that if you will (INAUDIBLE) issues behind it starting with a good evaluation one of only four triple A rated companies in America, so obviously pristine balance sheet and a 3.6 percent or so dividend yield makes it appealing for both growth and income seekers alike.</p><p>HUDSON: You liked energy and drugs back when we last spoke with you at the first of the year, January 6th. Let's take a look at those previous picks with Chevron (NYSE:CVX), CVS (NYSE:CVS) down about 3 percent from then. The Swiss drug giant Novartis down 3 percent. You also like financials, XLF, that exchange-traded fund up about 8 percent. Do you still like these spaces?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We do like financial still among the other two as well, but have leaned more away from the big universal banks, the money centers into the regional banks. We think again somewhat steadier U.S. economic conditions coupled with what we think is a hardening of pricing in the housing market should lead to stabilization of regional bank balance sheets and so we would continue to be exposed to that space.</p><p>HUDSON: You own everything that we mentioned here tonight, Mark?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I do.</p><p>HUDSON: Mark Luschini, our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest. He's with Janney Montgomery Scott. Quick programming note here, long-time NBR \"Market Monitor\" Gary Motyl passed away recently. He was the chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton and we will miss his market insights here on NBR. You can find his last \"Market Monitor\" appearance on our website, nbr.com.</p><p>GHARIB: And next week on NBR, it's the start of earnings season. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) CEO Klaus Kleinfeld joins us on Monday. He'll talk about how the giant aluminum maker did in the second quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year.</p><p>And when it comes to customer service, sometimes you have to give customers more than what they ask for. This week Lou's been thinking about dandelions. Here's author and educator Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: My son is not a little boy any more. In fact he just turned 40. I was smiling the other day when I thought about a special moment when he was about the age his older daughter now is. He came into the house and handed my wife a bunch of dandelions he had picked in the back yard. These are so sweet, she beamed as he looked on with pride, but they look kind of smashed. I know, he responded immediately. I stomped on every one to make sure there were no bees.</p><p>As a business speaker and writer, I think all the time about what business is really about. I know it's about finding a need and filling it. But the older I get -- maybe I should say the more experienced I get -- I think it's really about stomping on dandelions. The people who do business with you, customers, clients, patients, whatever you call them, they're out there in the backyard of their lives and they also wonder which dandelions have bees on them. Your job -- my job -- is not just to make a sale or fill a need, it's to reassure. Yes, this is the right product or service for you. Yes, this will make you feel comfortable. Yes, this is the finest quality we can offer. Yes, you can trust us to treat you with hospitality and joy and grace. Look, most people can go to a number of places to get what we do. We need to give them a concrete reason to deal with us. I happen to think that stomping on dandelions is a darn good one. I'm Lou Heckler.</p><p>GHARIB: And yes you can trust us to have a lot of interesting news next week Tom. We have those earnings reports that we were talking about and also we're going to be kicking off a week long look at the second, the outlook for the second half of the year with lots of stock market analysis.</p><p>HUDSON: Always a lot happens every second half of the year, but this year especially you got the election. You got all the fiscal issues coming up and of course the Federal Reserve by the end of the year says operation twist may be over. Lots of concerns about what's going to happen over the next six months or so Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of uncertainty and we've got to get answers to that. But anyway in the meantime, have a great weekend everyone and I hope you do too, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: You as well Susie. That is NBR for this Friday night, July 6. Thanks for joining us here in the broadcast. We'll see you online at nbr.com and back here on Monday night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The credit agency warned of a bond rating downgrade unless Europe solves its debt crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Meantime in the U.S., a heavy debt load weighs on the U.S. Postal Service. It aims to save billions by slowing delivery times and cutting its work force. It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 5.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. Europe was put on notice tonight. After the market close, Standard &amp; Poor`s placed 15 European countries on negative credit watch. That means the countries` credit ratings could be cut. And Tom, the warning even applies to the Eurozone`s six AAA-rated nations. That includes Germany and France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Susie, European government credit ratings may be cut, depending on how much progress these European leaders can make at a summit scheduled on Friday. Standard &amp; Poor`s cited several reasons for the warning tonight, including tightening credit conditions in Europe, continuing disagreements among European policymakers on how to resolve the debt crisis, high levels of government and household debt on the continent and the risk of a recession in the Eurozone next year.</p><p><person><nameText>John Chambers </nameText></person>is the managing director at S&amp;P ratings service and chairman of the sovereign rating committee. He joins us tonight from Standard &amp; Poor`s in New York. John, what are the odds now of a credit downgrade after this credit watching warning that you issued tonight?</p><p><person><nameText>JOHN CHAMBERS, </nameText></person>STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Well, the standard definition of credit watch is one in two likelihood or more of a credit downgrade. Empirically about 70 percent of sovereigns that have gone on credit watch have ultimately been downgraded in the last 20 years.</p><p>HUDSON: A significant warning then. You cite, quote that systemic stress in the Eurozone have risen in recent weeks. What specifically have you more concerned today versus say six weeks ago or six months ago?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, it`s an incremental thing, but what we fear now is that there`s been a lot of expectations built up for the summit and that if those expectations disappoint, then we could have a definite leg down that would be very difficult to come back from.</p><p>HUDSON: In your credit warning, can you separate between the level of debt that Europe currently has versus the concerns about a European recession or the lack of economic growth in Europe?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, there`s several factors at play. One is the political impasse that we`ve seen on getting closer to a fiscal union throughout Europe, which we think would put them on a stronger footing. We cited a number of issues with the banks and their ability to roll over their debt to non-residents and also the monetary policy settings and their appropriateness for all of the economies in the Eurozone. All of these factors are at play in our credit watch action.</p><p>HUDSON: With this in regard and with so much now keyed up on Friday`s summit with European Union leaders, what specific actions would you like those EU leaders to take that could then perhaps not submit the credit ratings to an actual downgrade in the next 90 days.</p><p>CHAMBERS: We don`t give policy advice, but you have several people, including Ed Garvey (ph), the president of the ECB pointing to a fiscal compact and in our way of thinking of things, that would include not only a mutualization of the obligations, at least some of the obligations of the Eurozone, but greater resources, greater revenues that would be shared at a Eurozone level. That certainly would be a big jump forward and would help to relieve some of the pressure on what we see on the zone throughout.</p><p>HUDSON: John, finally back in August, of course, S&amp;P downgraded the U.S. credit rating. It has now put 15 European Union countries on warning for a possible credit rating. Overall government finances throughout the world and the developed world seem to be under significant pressure. Do you see that changing over the next year?</p><p>CHAMBERS: I don`t see the pressure on the developed markets changing. I think that we`re in for a long slog ahead of us and it could be that government bonds will no longer be a AAA asset class.</p><p>HUDSON: Certainly that`s the case here in the U.S. and possibly in Europe. John, we appreciate the analysis. With us, <person><nameText>John Chambers </nameText></person>tonight, he`s with us from Standard &amp; Poor`s.</p><p>GHARIB: And joining us now with more analysis, Bob Doll. He`s the chief equity strategist at Blackrock. Hi, Bob, nice to have you with us.</p><p>BOB DOLL, BLACKROCK: Good evening, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: All right so what is your take on this S&amp;P announcement?</p><p>DOLL: Look, I think they`re doing what they have to do. There are stresses and strains and the situation continues to worsen. And as a result they can`t stand by and watch so they put these things on credit watch, I think should be no surprise. The monkey is on the European`s back at the moment, to get an austerity program in place, that has some teeth and they find a way to grow. That`s a tall order Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Do you think that this action by S&amp;P will motivate European leaders to do something new? Is it really a wake-up call?</p><p>DOLL: Well there have been a lot of wake-up calls. Among them the market having riots and going down quite a bit as you know on and off in the last bunch of months, and so yet this is another sign. I think that over the last few months, the last few weeks, we have begun to get some action to say maybe they do here. Let`s hope that there is traction. The meeting is coming up and these next bunch of days is important in that regard.</p><p>GHARIB: Bob what do you think is the solutions to the problems there? What do you think needs to be done to fix the debt crisis in Europe?</p><p>DOLL: I think what has to happen is we have to have some solidarity around a more united fiscal policy for Europe. And they`re working on that. That policy has to have teeth whereby if I am a country and I don`t do what I say I`m going to do, there is some sort of penalty. And then in order to grow we have to find ways to collect more revenues and reduce our expenses at the government level. Those countries have to become more competitive. I am just giving you a recipe that has a fair number of ingredients, Susie and they`re difficult and will take time.</p><p>GHARIB: Right. It is a tall order. In the meantime what does this action by the S&amp;P mean for U.S. investors? Is this a good development for the bond market?</p><p>DOLL: It`s never good when you see credits going in the wrong direction or the warning that they could. And what I think is the market is not going to be all that surprised. I think that given how the spreads between the lower quality and the higher quality countries in Europe have moved up, there`s no question but the bond market knows these concerns exist. So I`m not sure there is a whole lot of news here Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: What about the implications for the U.S. stock market? Does it make U.S. stocks a little more attractive given the new risks in Europe?</p><p>DOLL: Well, we would have argued that Europe was headed for, if not in a recession already and the U.S. while not growing strongly certainly is improving. And that`s why you`ve seen the U.S. stock market outperform most of the stock markets in the world not just Europe, over the course much this year. We suspect there`s more of that to come to the extent the U.S. continues to grow its revenues and earnings.</p><p>GHARIB: You said a moment ago that this doesn`t come as much of a surprise of what is going on with between S&amp;P and these ratings. But how do you think investors are going to react to this news tomorrow when the market opens?</p><p>DOLL: I suspect there will be some sellers who will say, you know, I thought I should be selling. Maybe I will sell a little bit more but on the other hand, I think what`s more important is what comes out of these policy meetings over the next few days. Does what Germany and France have been talking about have some reach beyond just those two countries? Can the peripheral countries of Europe sign on to that fiscal austerity with key plans? If they can, those markets will rally despite this warning.</p><p>GHARIB: Absolutely. A lot of questions hanging over the market. Thank you so much Bob for coming on the program. Really appreciate it.</p><p>And we`ve been speaking with Bob Doll. He`s chief equity strategist at Blackrock.</p><p>HUDSON: Earlier today, stocks were a bit higher on hopes the EU would get its act together this week. Wall Street though gave up some of those gains ahead of the close as the reports of the S&amp;P Eurozone bond warning made the rounds. So at the closing bell this Monday, the Dow Industrials finished with about 78.5 points of gains. The NASDAQ rose almost 29, the S&amp;P 500 up close to 13 points. Now the gains were added to the big jump we saw last week. As the near - as the year rather nears its end, stocks have regained some of the momentum lost in November. Erika Miller reports tonight on what history tells us about the rest of the year.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: `Tis the season to be jolly, especially if you are a stock market investor. December is historically the chart-topping month for the stock market. It`s been that way since 1929, 1945, as well as 1970 -- the year Elvis`s Christmas album came out -- one of the best-selling holiday albums of all time. Over the past three decades, December has posted an average gain of 1.8 percent, more than twice the average increase for all months. S&amp;P`s Sam Stovall believes the year-end rally is largely due to a change in investor perspective.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, S&amp;P: Investors, because they are now focusing on 12 months ahead rather than only about three months ahead, as we approach the end of the year, then I think optimism takes over. Investors put their money to work and basically expect the coming year to be fairly strong.</p><p>MILLER: The question is whether this year will follow historic patterns. On the one hand, U.S. economic data seems to be improving. The unemployment rate dropped last month and consumer confidence hit its highest level since July. And judging by black Friday and cyber Monday results, jingle bells are ringing at cash registers this holiday season. But, there may be a big reason December may prove disappointing for the market. As strategist Vadim Zlotnikov explains, the overarching concern is the debt crisis in Europe, where the S&amp;P 500 gets 14 percent of total sales.</p><p>VADIM ZLOTNIKOV: You have uncertainty as to what is the path that Europe is going to choose. If it is a path of extreme austerity, it could actually depress the U.S. companies` earnings and the U.S. economic growth.</p><p>MILLER: Another big worry is slowing growth in China, the world`s second largest economy. That said, Stovall still believes the S&amp;P 500 will end next year around 1,360, which would be 8 percent above today`s close.</p><p>STOVALL: I am a bull with a lower case \"B.\" I think that we probably could see a low end double digit advance based on where we are right now. I think that when you look at everything in terms of fundamentals, technicals, history, that there is a good chance for a positive return in the coming year.</p><p>MILLER: So, the hope for stock investors is that there will be gains in December, setting a positive tone going into next year. But if there`s no Santa Claus rally, watch out because historically that tends to precede bear markets. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead, your snail mail could soon be moving at a snail`s pace. We look at the latest cuts coming to a post office near you.</p><p>HUDSON: Senate Democrats offered a scaled back version of their payroll tax cut extension today. It includes what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid calls a quote, tiny surcharge on millionaires. The move is designed to appeal to Republicans who shot down previous versions of the bill because of a 3.25 percent tax on incomes above $1 million. The latest Democratic version is for a surcharge of less than 2 percent on incomes over $1 million. The legislation also would extend the payroll tax cut next year, but only for workers, not their employers. With the tax cut due to expire at the end of e year, President Obama today pushed for urgent action.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not only is extending the payroll tax cut important for the economy as a whole, it`s obviously important for individual families. It`s important insurance for them against the unexpected. It will help families pay their bills. It will spur spending. It will spur hiring and it`s the right thing to do.</p><p>HUDSON: Republicans argue tax breaks for workers do little to stimulate the overall economy. They also believe the tax breaks should be paid for with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, rather than relying on a surcharge on millionaires as Democrats have proposed.</p><p>Reports about a looming credit outlook downgrade for European government bonds took the steam out of U.S. stocks during the session. Here is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" We did give up some of the earlier gains we saw this morning, but the major indices still ended in the green on this first Monday in December. Right from the opening bell here, we saw some really follow-through buying interest from the big rally last week, but right around 2:00 p.m. Eastern, just after we hit the intra-day high, when the first reports hit about S&amp;P threatening to downgrade the credit ratings of Europe, the index began to take its first hit and then we saw a second hit as more reports came in indicating a ratings cut could come after the close. Of course it was the ratings outlook that was cut. The index still was able to finish up off its lows with about a 1 percent gain.</p><p>Oddly enough, big banks were not hurt by the threat of a European government debt downgrade. This exchange-traded fund is made up of big U.S. banks and today ending with a 2 percent rally. This fund is at its highest close in a month. Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ: NBXH) (NYSE: MS) was higher by 7 percent during the trading session. Citigroup (NYSE: C) finishing up by almost 6 percent. JPMorgan`s 3.6 percent rally was the best among Dow Jones Industrial components. The financial sector did lead the way for the overall market, up by better than 2 percent.</p><p>Technology and energy sectors meantime ended with over 1 percent gains each. Among the financial fuel for the financial sector, insurer Metlife, up more than 3.5 percent, nice rally here. Metlife`s fourth quarter outlook was disappointing, but it predicted earnings to grow as much as 7 percent next year, driven by two ideals, retirement products in the U.S. as well as its international business.</p><p>The tech sector overall was helped out by a Monday merger in the cloud computing space. Germany business software giant SAP is spending $3.4 billion in cash to buy Success Factors. That`s based in California. This is just the latest deal of a big tech firm picking up a smaller company concentrated in cloud computing. That`s on-demand computing services. The deal sends SAP stock down 2 about percent. Success Factors leapt 51 percent. Shares closing just $0.25 shy of its buyout price of $40 per share.</p><p>Other names in cloud computing software also shot up. Taleo (NASDAQ: TLEO) concentrates on job performance and compensation software. It jumped 20 percent. Kenexa (NASDAQ: KNXA) also focuses on employment recruitment and retraining software. Shares there jumping 16 percent. And business commerce software firm Ariba (NASDAQ: ARBA) rallied 14 percent at the bell. Technology and commerce giant eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw bids for its share price rise today. Thanks to today`s 3.7 percent rally on the price, shares are at this highest price since mid-November now. An analyst at Raymond James upgraded the stock to a \"strong buy,\" pointing to strong holiday sales. While eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) of course is known for its auctions, it has been putting greater emphasis on fixed-price deals.</p><p>Some of those deals may get shipped via FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and its stock gained over just 1 percent today, continuing to trend near this multi-week high. It announced an increase in shipping rates beginning in January. We`re in a six-week high for FDX.</p><p>In commodities meantime, coffee and sugar rallied, how about that for a pair. Traders point to a weaker U.S. dollar and worries about the South American coffee crop for helping push coffee prices up 3 percent. Strong global demand meantime helped supported sugar buying up almost 3 percent. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Federal regulators approved tougher rules for risk taking on Wall Street today, adopting the MF Global rule. It`s named after the collapsed brokerage firm that`s believed to have improperly used hundreds of millions of dollars of customer money. The new rules limit how much the brokerage industry can invest in client funds and stops firms from using customer money to buy foreign sovereign debt. Separately today, two former MF Global employees filed a class-action lawsuit against Jon Corzine, the firm`s former CEO and other senior executives. The suit says they lied to employees about the firm`s financial condition.</p><p>Let`s take a look now at what we`re watching for you for tomorrow: quarterly results from retailers Pep Boys and Men`s Wearhouse (NYSE: MW), along with luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL). Also tomorrow, it`s the largest youth football and cheerleader program in the world. \"Beyond the Scoreboard\" looks at how Pop Warner has weathered a weak economy and how it`s stayed in business for more than 80 years.</p><p>You may see fewer cars at the mall this weekend. More than a third of U.S. shoppers are already done with most of their holiday shopping, according to a new survey. Another 28 percent of people surveyed say they plan to take a break from spending now that black Friday is behind them. About four in 10 shoppers plan to finish checking off their holiday lists at discount chains, highlighting that many Americans are trying to remain frugal.</p><p>HUDSON: Were bond holders misled about the Miami Marlins finances while being encouraged to buy bonds to build a new baseball stadium? This is exactly what Federal investigators want to know. Miami, its surrounding county and the team are financing the stadium, with the city and county covering most of the $645 million cost of building the new stadium and parking lots. They issued $500 million in bonds to help the effort. The stadium opens next spring. The team says it`s cooperating with the investigation, but did not comment further.</p><p>GHARIB: For the first time in 40 years, the United States Postal Service is pushing to slow down delivery time. The Postal Service announced today it plans to close nearly half its mail processing centers to counter falling revenues. That would make it nearly impossible for next day delivery of first class mail. Sylvia Hall takes a look at the proposal and its possible impact on shipping.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When you drop a letter in the mailbox, the Postal Service expects to deliver it in one to three days. But the service now hopes to relax that standard to two to three days instead.</p><p>DAVE WILLIAMS, USPS: Our network is too big. We`ve got more capacity in our network than we can afford. We can`t afford it today. We`ve got to make adjustments today.</p><p>HALL: The cut in service standards would result from Postal Service plans to close half of its 487 mail processing centers across the country. Dave Williams runs network operations for the post office. He says last year the Postal Service delivered about 73 billion pieces of first-class mail. That`s almost a 30 percent drop from its peak mail volume of over 100 billion pieces of first-class mail hit back in 2001. And by the year 2020, he thinks the Postal Service will have lost almost half of its first- class mail volume.</p><p>PATRICK DONAHOE, POSTMASTER GENERAL: The economy has really been tough on us the last couple of years, but the other more long-term issue is people pay bills online. Theoretically, if you looked at us as a regular business, we would be close to bankrupt now. We`ve used $15 billion of borrowing and we have a negative income statement this year.</p><p>HALL: The Postal Service wants the public`s thoughts on the change, offering up a two-month comment period. While the change would not affect express or priority mail, it could save $2 billion a year. But analysts say the savings carry a price of their own.</p><p>JIM CORRIDORE, EQUITY ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Certainly, customers are not going to appreciate it and it`s never a good idea in a business model to make customer service worse. It doesn`t generally lead to more revenue.</p><p>HALL: Equity analyst Jim Corridore says that could mean a minor boost for private carriers like UPS and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) as customers opt for high-speed delivery.</p><p>CORRIDORE: The carriers at Fedex and UPS have already seen their shares shift from online sales, from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), from holiday shipping -- they`re already very much getting a lot of that traffic diverted to them. So they`re only going to see more of that over time and the U.S. Postal Service is not able to capture that because they can`t move as fast as companies like FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS.</p><p>HALL: Regulators will have three months to review the changes, which means the earliest customers would see a difference in delivery times would be spring. Sylvia Hall, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Monday evening, December 5.

The credit agency warned of a bond rating downgrade unless Europe solves its debt crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Meantime in the U.S., a heavy debt load weighs on the U.S. Postal Service. It aims to save billions by slowing delivery times and cutting its work force. It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 5.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. Europe was put on notice tonight. After the market close, Standard &amp; Poor's placed 15 European countries on negative credit watch. That means the countries' credit ratings could be cut. And Tom, the warning even applies to the Eurozone's six AAA-rated nations. That includes Germany and France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Susie, European government credit ratings may be cut, depending on how much progress these European leaders can make at a summit scheduled on Friday. Standard &amp; Poor's cited several reasons for the warning tonight, including tightening credit conditions in Europe, continuing disagreements among European policymakers on how to resolve the debt crisis, high levels of government and household debt on the continent and the risk of a recession in the Eurozone next year.</p><p><person><nameText>John Chambers </nameText></person>is the managing director at S&amp;P ratings service and chairman of the sovereign rating committee. He joins us tonight from Standard &amp; Poor's in New York. John, what are the odds now of a credit downgrade after this credit watching warning that you issued tonight?</p><p><person><nameText>JOHN CHAMBERS, </nameText></person>STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: Well, the standard definition of credit watch is one in two likelihood or more of a credit downgrade. Empirically about 70 percent of sovereigns that have gone on credit watch have ultimately been downgraded in the last 20 years.</p><p>HUDSON: A significant warning then. You cite, quote that systemic stress in the Eurozone have risen in recent weeks. What specifically have you more concerned today versus say six weeks ago or six months ago?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, it's an incremental thing, but what we fear now is that there's been a lot of expectations built up for the summit and that if those expectations disappoint, then we could have a definite leg down that would be very difficult to come back from.</p><p>HUDSON: In your credit warning, can you separate between the level of debt that Europe currently has versus the concerns about a European recession or the lack of economic growth in Europe?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, there's several factors at play. One is the political impasse that we've seen on getting closer to a fiscal union throughout Europe, which we think would put them on a stronger footing. We cited a number of issues with the banks and their ability to roll over their debt to non-residents and also the monetary policy settings and their appropriateness for all of the economies in the Eurozone. All of these factors are at play in our credit watch action.</p><p>HUDSON: With this in regard and with so much now keyed up on Friday's summit with European Union leaders, what specific actions would you like those EU leaders to take that could then perhaps not submit the credit ratings to an actual downgrade in the next 90 days.</p><p>CHAMBERS: We don't give policy advice, but you have several people, including Ed Garvey (ph), the president of the ECB pointing to a fiscal compact and in our way of thinking of things, that would include not only a mutualization of the obligations, at least some of the obligations of the Eurozone, but greater resources, greater revenues that would be shared at a Eurozone level. That certainly would be a big jump forward and would help to relieve some of the pressure on what we see on the zone throughout.</p><p>HUDSON: John, finally back in August, of course, S&amp;P downgraded the U.S. credit rating. It has now put 15 European Union countries on warning for a possible credit rating. Overall government finances throughout the world and the developed world seem to be under significant pressure. Do you see that changing over the next year?</p><p>CHAMBERS: I don't see the pressure on the developed markets changing. I think that we're in for a long slog ahead of us and it could be that government bonds will no longer be a AAA asset class.</p><p>HUDSON: Certainly that's the case here in the U.S. and possibly in Europe. John, we appreciate the analysis. With us, <person><nameText>John Chambers </nameText></person>tonight, he's with us from Standard &amp; Poor's.</p><p>GHARIB: And joining us now with more analysis, Bob Doll. He's the chief equity strategist at Blackrock. Hi, Bob, nice to have you with us.</p><p>BOB DOLL, BLACKROCK: Good evening, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: All right so what is your take on this S&amp;P announcement?</p><p>DOLL: Look, I think they're doing what they have to do. There are stresses and strains and the situation continues to worsen. And as a result they can't stand by and watch so they put these things on credit watch, I think should be no surprise. The monkey is on the European's back at the moment, to get an austerity program in place, that has some teeth and they find a way to grow. That's a tall order Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Do you think that this action by S&amp;P will motivate European leaders to do something new? Is it really a wake-up call?</p><p>DOLL: Well there have been a lot of wake-up calls. Among them the market having riots and going down quite a bit as you know on and off in the last bunch of months, and so yet this is another sign. I think that over the last few months, the last few weeks, we have begun to get some action to say maybe they do here. Let's hope that there is traction. The meeting is coming up and these next bunch of days is important in that regard.</p><p>GHARIB: Bob what do you think is the solutions to the problems there? What do you think needs to be done to fix the debt crisis in Europe?</p><p>DOLL: I think what has to happen is we have to have some solidarity around a more united fiscal policy for Europe. And they're working on that. That policy has to have teeth whereby if I am a country and I don't do what I say I'm going to do, there is some sort of penalty. And then in order to grow we have to find ways to collect more revenues and reduce our expenses at the government level. Those countries have to become more competitive. I am just giving you a recipe that has a fair number of ingredients, Susie and they're difficult and will take time.</p><p>GHARIB: Right. It is a tall order. In the meantime what does this action by the S&amp;P mean for U.S. investors? Is this a good development for the bond market?</p><p>DOLL: It's never good when you see credits going in the wrong direction or the warning that they could. And what I think is the market is not going to be all that surprised. I think that given how the spreads between the lower quality and the higher quality countries in Europe have moved up, there's no question but the bond market knows these concerns exist. So I'm not sure there is a whole lot of news here Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: What about the implications for the U.S. stock market? Does it make U.S. stocks a little more attractive given the new risks in Europe?</p><p>DOLL: Well, we would have argued that Europe was headed for, if not in a recession already and the U.S. while not growing strongly certainly is improving. And that's why you've seen the U.S. stock market outperform most of the stock markets in the world not just Europe, over the course much this year. We suspect there's more of that to come to the extent the U.S. continues to grow its revenues and earnings.</p><p>GHARIB: You said a moment ago that this doesn't come as much of a surprise of what is going on with between S&amp;P and these ratings. But how do you think investors are going to react to this news tomorrow when the market opens?</p><p>DOLL: I suspect there will be some sellers who will say, you know, I thought I should be selling. Maybe I will sell a little bit more but on the other hand, I think what's more important is what comes out of these policy meetings over the next few days. Does what Germany and France have been talking about have some reach beyond just those two countries? Can the peripheral countries of Europe sign on to that fiscal austerity with key plans? If they can, those markets will rally despite this warning.</p><p>GHARIB: Absolutely. A lot of questions hanging over the market. Thank you so much Bob for coming on the program. Really appreciate it.</p><p>And we've been speaking with Bob Doll. He's chief equity strategist at Blackrock.</p><p>HUDSON: Earlier today, stocks were a bit higher on hopes the EU would get its act together this week. Wall Street though gave up some of those gains ahead of the close as the reports of the S&amp;P Eurozone bond warning made the rounds. So at the closing bell this Monday, the Dow Industrials finished with about 78.5 points of gains. The NASDAQ rose almost 29, the S&amp;P 500 up close to 13 points. Now the gains were added to the big jump we saw last week. As the near - as the year rather nears its end, stocks have regained some of the momentum lost in November. Erika Miller reports tonight on what history tells us about the rest of the year.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: 'Tis the season to be jolly, especially if you are a stock market investor. December is historically the chart-topping month for the stock market. It's been that way since 1929, 1945, as well as 1970 -- the year Elvis's Christmas album came out -- one of the best-selling holiday albums of all time. Over the past three decades, December has posted an average gain of 1.8 percent, more than twice the average increase for all months. S&amp;P's Sam Stovall believes the year-end rally is largely due to a change in investor perspective.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, S&amp;P: Investors, because they are now focusing on 12 months ahead rather than only about three months ahead, as we approach the end of the year, then I think optimism takes over. Investors put their money to work and basically expect the coming year to be fairly strong.</p><p>MILLER: The question is whether this year will follow historic patterns. On the one hand, U.S. economic data seems to be improving. The unemployment rate dropped last month and consumer confidence hit its highest level since July. And judging by black Friday and cyber Monday results, jingle bells are ringing at cash registers this holiday season. But, there may be a big reason December may prove disappointing for the market. As strategist Vadim Zlotnikov explains, the overarching concern is the debt crisis in Europe, where the S&amp;P 500 gets 14 percent of total sales.</p><p>VADIM ZLOTNIKOV: You have uncertainty as to what is the path that Europe is going to choose. If it is a path of extreme austerity, it could actually depress the U.S. companies' earnings and the U.S. economic growth.</p><p>MILLER: Another big worry is slowing growth in China, the world's second largest economy. That said, Stovall still believes the S&amp;P 500 will end next year around 1,360, which would be 8 percent above today's close.</p><p>STOVALL: I am a bull with a lower case \"B.\" I think that we probably could see a low end double digit advance based on where we are right now. I think that when you look at everything in terms of fundamentals, technicals, history, that there is a good chance for a positive return in the coming year.</p><p>MILLER: So, the hope for stock investors is that there will be gains in December, setting a positive tone going into next year. But if there's no Santa Claus rally, watch out because historically that tends to precede bear markets. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead, your snail mail could soon be moving at a snail's pace. We look at the latest cuts coming to a post office near you.</p><p>HUDSON: Senate Democrats offered a scaled back version of their payroll tax cut extension today. It includes what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid calls a quote, tiny surcharge on millionaires. The move is designed to appeal to Republicans who shot down previous versions of the bill because of a 3.25 percent tax on incomes above $1 million. The latest Democratic version is for a surcharge of less than 2 percent on incomes over $1 million. The legislation also would extend the payroll tax cut next year, but only for workers, not their employers. With the tax cut due to expire at the end of e year, President Obama today pushed for urgent action.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not only is extending the payroll tax cut important for the economy as a whole, it's obviously important for individual families. It's important insurance for them against the unexpected. It will help families pay their bills. It will spur spending. It will spur hiring and it's the right thing to do.</p><p>HUDSON: Republicans argue tax breaks for workers do little to stimulate the overall economy. They also believe the tax breaks should be paid for with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, rather than relying on a surcharge on millionaires as Democrats have proposed.</p><p>Reports about a looming credit outlook downgrade for European government bonds took the steam out of U.S. stocks during the session. Here is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" We did give up some of the earlier gains we saw this morning, but the major indices still ended in the green on this first Monday in December. Right from the opening bell here, we saw some really follow-through buying interest from the big rally last week, but right around 2:00 p.m. Eastern, just after we hit the intra-day high, when the first reports hit about S&amp;P threatening to downgrade the credit ratings of Europe, the index began to take its first hit and then we saw a second hit as more reports came in indicating a ratings cut could come after the close. Of course it was the ratings outlook that was cut. The index still was able to finish up off its lows with about a 1 percent gain.</p><p>Oddly enough, big banks were not hurt by the threat of a European government debt downgrade. This exchange-traded fund is made up of big U.S. banks and today ending with a 2 percent rally. This fund is at its highest close in a month. Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ: NBXH) (NYSE: MS) was higher by 7 percent during the trading session. Citigroup (NYSE: C) finishing up by almost 6 percent. JPMorgan's 3.6 percent rally was the best among Dow Jones Industrial components. The financial sector did lead the way for the overall market, up by better than 2 percent.</p><p>Technology and energy sectors meantime ended with over 1 percent gains each. Among the financial fuel for the financial sector, insurer Metlife, up more than 3.5 percent, nice rally here. Metlife's fourth quarter outlook was disappointing, but it predicted earnings to grow as much as 7 percent next year, driven by two ideals, retirement products in the U.S. as well as its international business.</p><p>The tech sector overall was helped out by a Monday merger in the cloud computing space. Germany business software giant SAP is spending $3.4 billion in cash to buy Success Factors. That's based in California. This is just the latest deal of a big tech firm picking up a smaller company concentrated in cloud computing. That's on-demand computing services. The deal sends SAP stock down 2 about percent. Success Factors leapt 51 percent. Shares closing just $0.25 shy of its buyout price of $40 per share.</p><p>Other names in cloud computing software also shot up. Taleo (NASDAQ: TLEO) concentrates on job performance and compensation software. It jumped 20 percent. Kenexa (NASDAQ: KNXA) also focuses on employment recruitment and retraining software. Shares there jumping 16 percent. And business commerce software firm Ariba (NASDAQ: ARBA) rallied 14 percent at the bell. Technology and commerce giant eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw bids for its share price rise today. Thanks to today's 3.7 percent rally on the price, shares are at this highest price since mid-November now. An analyst at Raymond James upgraded the stock to a \"strong buy,\" pointing to strong holiday sales. While eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) of course is known for its auctions, it has been putting greater emphasis on fixed-price deals.</p><p>Some of those deals may get shipped via FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and its stock gained over just 1 percent today, continuing to trend near this multi-week high. It announced an increase in shipping rates beginning in January. We're in a six-week high for FDX.</p><p>In commodities meantime, coffee and sugar rallied, how about that for a pair. Traders point to a weaker U.S. dollar and worries about the South American coffee crop for helping push coffee prices up 3 percent. Strong global demand meantime helped supported sugar buying up almost 3 percent. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Federal regulators approved tougher rules for risk taking on Wall Street today, adopting the MF Global rule. It's named after the collapsed brokerage firm that's believed to have improperly used hundreds of millions of dollars of customer money. The new rules limit how much the brokerage industry can invest in client funds and stops firms from using customer money to buy foreign sovereign debt. Separately today, two former MF Global employees filed a class-action lawsuit against Jon Corzine, the firm's former CEO and other senior executives. The suit says they lied to employees about the firm's financial condition.</p><p>Let's take a look now at what we're watching for you for tomorrow: quarterly results from retailers Pep Boys and Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW), along with luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL). Also tomorrow, it's the largest youth football and cheerleader program in the world. \"Beyond the Scoreboard\" looks at how Pop Warner has weathered a weak economy and how it's stayed in business for more than 80 years.</p><p>You may see fewer cars at the mall this weekend. More than a third of U.S. shoppers are already done with most of their holiday shopping, according to a new survey. Another 28 percent of people surveyed say they plan to take a break from spending now that black Friday is behind them. About four in 10 shoppers plan to finish checking off their holiday lists at discount chains, highlighting that many Americans are trying to remain frugal.</p><p>HUDSON: Were bond holders misled about the Miami Marlins finances while being encouraged to buy bonds to build a new baseball stadium? This is exactly what Federal investigators want to know. Miami, its surrounding county and the team are financing the stadium, with the city and county covering most of the $645 million cost of building the new stadium and parking lots. They issued $500 million in bonds to help the effort. The stadium opens next spring. The team says it's cooperating with the investigation, but did not comment further.</p><p>GHARIB: For the first time in 40 years, the United States Postal Service is pushing to slow down delivery time. The Postal Service announced today it plans to close nearly half its mail processing centers to counter falling revenues. That would make it nearly impossible for next day delivery of first class mail. Sylvia Hall takes a look at the proposal and its possible impact on shipping.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When you drop a letter in the mailbox, the Postal Service expects to deliver it in one to three days. But the service now hopes to relax that standard to two to three days instead.</p><p>DAVE WILLIAMS, USPS: Our network is too big. We've got more capacity in our network than we can afford. We can't afford it today. We've got to make adjustments today.</p><p>HALL: The cut in service standards would result from Postal Service plans to close half of its 487 mail processing centers across the country. Dave Williams runs network operations for the post office. He says last year the Postal Service delivered about 73 billion pieces of first-class mail. That's almost a 30 percent drop from its peak mail volume of over 100 billion pieces of first-class mail hit back in 2001. And by the year 2020, he thinks the Postal Service will have lost almost half of its first- class mail volume.</p><p>PATRICK DONAHOE, POSTMASTER GENERAL: The economy has really been tough on us the last couple of years, but the other more long-term issue is people pay bills online. Theoretically, if you looked at us as a regular business, we would be close to bankrupt now. We've used $15 billion of borrowing and we have a negative income statement this year.</p><p>HALL: The Postal Service wants the public's thoughts on the change, offering up a two-month comment period. While the change would not affect express or priority mail, it could save $2 billion a year. But analysts say the savings carry a price of their own.</p><p>JIM CORRIDORE, EQUITY ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: Certainly, customers are not going to appreciate it and it's never a good idea in a business model to make customer service worse. It doesn't generally lead to more revenue.</p><p>HALL: Equity analyst Jim Corridore says that could mean a minor boost for private carriers like UPS and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) as customers opt for high-speed delivery.</p><p>CORRIDORE: The carriers at Fedex and UPS have already seen their shares shift from online sales, from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), from holiday shipping -- they're already very much getting a lot of that traffic diverted to them. So they're only going to see more of that over time and the U.S. Postal Service is not able to capture that because they can't move as fast as companies like FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS.</p><p>HALL: Regulators will have three months to review the changes, which means the earliest customers would see a difference in delivery times would be spring. Sylvia Hall, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on this Monday evening, December 5. We want to remind you this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GHARIB: That's right Tom, support that makes programs like NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT possible.</p><p>HUDSON: Thanks for joining us this Monday evening. Don't forget to support your public television station. I'm Tom Hudson. Have a great evening, you too, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: You too Tom. Good night everyone. I'm Susie Gharib.

New products drive strong earnings at Microsoft (NASDAQ:  MSFT) and amazon.com, but the stocks drop on the news. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  While this doesn`t look  like a farm, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is plowing over $1 billion into server farm  Terremark. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January  27. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight, the tech  sector squarely in focus after the close Susie.  From earnings at Microsoft  (NASDAQ: MSFT) and amazon.com to Verizon`s big deal for computer server  farm Terremark worldwide, we`ve really got the tech active in after hours  trading tonight. </p><p>GHARIB: Tom, it sure was.  Let`s start off with Microsoft (NASDAQ:  MSFT), a double surprise from the software giant tonight -- better than  expected quarterly earnings and the numbers were released earlier than  expected. The report was supposed to come out after the closing bell, but  was accidentally released on the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) web site 15  minutes early. Here are the numbers.  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) earned $0.77  a share in its fiscal second quarter. That was $0.09 more than estimates.  Revenues also came in better than expected -- about $20 billion. The  company credited the sales boost to business customers upgrading their  computers and the debut of its Kinect controller for the X-box 360. </p><p>HUDSON:  Susie, amazon.com also turned in quarterly results after the  close tonight. It as well beat estimates this time by $0.03 per share. The  sale of electronic books for its Kindle reader outpaced sales of old school  paperback books. But expenses last quarter increased, thanks to marketing  for the Kindle over the holidays as well as investments in its distribution  systems. The stocks of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon were both down  after these reports. But shares of Terremark were awfully strong in after  hours trading, surging as much as 35 percent. Here`s why.  Verizon (NYSE:  VZ) offering almost $1.5 billion for the computer server farm, $19 per  share is the offer.  The deal is part of Verizon`s push into cloud  computing. We`re going to have more on all this coming in tonight`s \"Market  Focus.\" </p><p>GHARIB: Also today, big earnings from big CAT.  Caterpillar (NYSE:  CAT) It posted a quarterly profit that quadrupled from a year ago. The  world`s largest maker of construction and mining equipment earned $1.47 a  share in the fourth quarter of last year.  That`s $0.20 more than  estimates. Revenues also came in a billion dollars more than expected, up  62 percent to almost $13 billion. Looking ahead, the company expects annual  revenues to top $50 billion this year, bringing Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)  back to pre-recession levels.  So when I talked with CEO Doug Oberhelman  today, I asked him where is all that growth going to come from? </p><p>DOUG OBERHELMAN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CATTERPILLAR:  We`re seeing growth in  sales and revenue just about across the globe. And most industries with the  exception of our turbine business and large reciprocating engines which we  think are coming but they`ll be coming, the growth will be coming later.   So geographically and industry and product wise, it`s sort of a nice ramp  all across the spectrum in 2011. </p><p>GHARIB:  Mr. Oberhelman, how about in the U.S.?  How strong is the  recovery going to be for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) equipment? </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  Well, the U.S. certainly has been slow coming out of the  recession. There is no doubt we`re one of the last economies to the party.  It is coming, however. And I`ve just been with groups of dealers and  customers the last couple of weeks. They are a lot more optimistic today  than they were a year ago. Now these are not big number increases, of  course from very depressed levels in the last couple of years, but the  anecdotes, the order level, the activity is definitely improving. We put  out our December retail activity which showed a big increase in the United  States and North America.  So it`s coming, but slowly and frustratingly  slow, I would say. </p><p>GHARIB: As you heard, President Obama in the state of the union  address the other night is calling for more spending on our infrastructure,  building a high speed rail system.  Do you see that really happening and  how would that translate into business for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)? </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  Well, you`ve got two great questions there.  I will take  the second one first.  If we see more infrastructure spending and when that  money actually hits the ground, it will help us.  But remember,  infrastructure spending that starts today is months if not a year or two  before it hits the ground.  Secondly, we are watching a very I would say  conservative fiscal level of spending around the U.S. not only at the  Federal level and the states. And that`s a concern to us because on the one  hand, the U.S. has to get its house in order as do most states. On the  other hand we need to stimulate the economy, get people back to work so it  is a real balance to achieve. </p><p>GHARIB: Now you always talk about a lot of growth in the emerging  markets.  How important is China for your growth plan? </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  1.4 billion people modernizing is a good thing for this  planet, people coming out of poverty, moving up into the middle class.  That`s good for all of us. We in America need those export jobs.  In fact,  we exported about $13.5 billion from the U.S. in 2010. That`s up almost a  third from 2009.  Sixty eight percent of our sales or so in 2010 were  outside.  So those external markets are important for Caterpillar (NYSE:  CAT) and for our workers. </p><p>GHARIB: All right so, when China talks about slowing down its economy,  what kind of impact would that have on Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)? </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  Well, they have talked about this and executed pretty  well over the years ups and downs, growth and then slowdowns. They probably  need to break their economy a little bit.  I don`t see how they can grow at  double digit GDP growth rates forever. Having said that, a slowdown to 6, 7  8 percent is probably healthy.  It doesn`t impact us all that much, but it  is something they`ve got to keep their eye on, they`ve got to work hard at. </p><p>GHARIB:  Let`s talk a little bit about jobs, because Caterpillar  (NYSE: CAT) actually has been rehiring over the past year and now with all  the pickup in business that you are talking about, how many more people do  you plan to hire in 2011? </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  With a forecast going over $50 billion in 2011 we`re  going to need more help to increase our production and do more of the  things we`ve got to do. We`re to the going to put a number out. We don`t  really have a forecast, but I`m confident as sales grow and we need more  production, we will have more people working here a year from now than we  do today. </p><p>GHARIB: That some good news for a lot of out of work Americans. </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  It is. </p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk about Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) stock.  It was the  best performing Dow stock last year and it is almost quadrupled since March  of 2009. So where does the stock go from here? </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  We`re focusing on earnings. We`re focusing on quality of  our business, growing market share, expanding geographically, spending  capital, position us for the future. As long as earnings increase, our  stock price will go along with it.  But I will not make a prediction on  that one. </p><p>GHARIB: Fair enough Mr. Oberhelman thank you so much for your time.  Nice talking with you. </p><p>OBERHELMAN:  You bet. Thank you. </p><p>HUDSON:  Let`s take a look at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel.   We`ve got stocks rising slightly ahead of all the tech news after the  close.  The Dow gained four points, the NASDAQ up 15, the S&amp;P 500 added  nearly three. Big board trading volume dipped below a billion shares, while  NASDAQ volume held firmly above two billion shares. New claims for jobless  benefits rose by 51,000 in the past week to 454,000. Economists think bad  winter weather is to blame. They see the trend reversing next week. Durable  goods orders meantime tumbled in December, falling 2.5 percent. That was a  surprise, because an increase in big ticket, long-lasting items was  expected. </p><p>And Standard &amp; Poor`s downgraded Japan`s debt rating. The ratings  agency says the world`s third largest economy is struggling under a huge  debt load. Japan`s debt is more than double its GDP.   Tomorrow on the  program, still ahead rather tonight, stay with us. With gold prices down  sharply since the start of the year, is gold losing its luster? </p><p>GHARIB: Wondering what caused the financial crisis? Well, now we know,  maybe. The panel investigating the meltdown has finally released its  report. And after months of digging, there`s still disagreement. Six  Democrats on the panel say the regulatory system broke down, starting at  the Federal Reserve. Financial firms bet too much, households borrowed too  much and some players totally ignored ethics.  But Republicans on the panel  say there were actually 10 causes. Among them, worldwide credit and housing  bubbles, too many toxic mortgages and credit rating agencies that didn`t do  their jobs. Commission Chairman Phil Angelides says the bottom line is that  the financial crisis didn`t have to happen. </p><p>PHIL ANGELIDES, CHMN., FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY COMMISSION:  The  captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored  warnings and importantly failed to question, to understand and to manage  the evolving risks in a financial system that is so essential to the well  being of our country. Theirs was a big miss, not a stumble. </p><p>GHARIB:  The commission has posted hundreds of documents online. In  one, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says only one of the country`s  big financial firms was on solid footing during the crisis.  But he doesn`t  say which one. </p><p>So Tom, 12,000 on the Dow, 1300 on the S&amp;P during trading hours but  didn`t close there. Psychologists who study investor behavior say that  there is some worries about round numbers whence it comes to these  milestones so didn`t happen today. Maybe it`s tomorrow or next week. </p><p>HUDSON:  Maybe, lots of after hours news though that we mentioned at  the top of the program could put a bit of a bid into the market by  tomorrow. We`ll have to wait and see. But clearly those big round numbers  are going to remain in focus here Susie. Speaking of, let`s get to  tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"  Overall ahead of all that tech news after the  close, we saw another day of slim gains, but any gains at these levels mean  the major indices do hit new post-recession highs.  Some of that though may  be interrupted tomorrow, if the after hours trading is any action (sic).   We will mention Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) here as we roll it out.  We talked  about the earnings at the top of the program. Here`s the last year of MSFT  trading. The 52-week high was back in the springtime.  Shares falling  during the regular session after the close down about 1 percent.  This high  here tonight, this is the highest level since May for MSFT. </p><p>Meantime, amazon.com, it came in to tonight`s report really with some  optimism, a nice 5 percent rally. Just last week, this was a new all-time  high for AMZN.   Revenues though in the fourth quarter were a bit less than  anticipated. Shares fell as much as 10 percent below these numbers down  below $170 per share after the close, one to watch tomorrow. </p><p>Another one in technology was computer data storage firm Sandisk also  had some optimistic buying interest ahead of its quarterly results. Shares  have had a nice 70 percent rally here over the last 12 months.  After the  close, the stock down as much as 3 percent, but did have a bit of a rebound  from that level so it clearly another one to watch in technology tomorrow.  </p><p>Now the tech deal we mentioned earlier, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) buying tech  data center firm Terremark. Ahead of that news, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) saw  small gains, while Terremark was up 2.5 percent.  Remember this was before  the news hit the tape.  After the deal announcement, Terremark jumped over  its buyout price of $19 per share.  </p><p>In addition to the technology news after the close, a quartet of  semiconductor-related stocks really saw some buying interest off of their  earnings today. Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) jumping 19 percent. Earnings  there almost doubled. Teradyne (NYSE: TER) jumped 12 percent. It makes  semiconductor testing equipment. Earnings at Teradyne (NYSE: TER) more than  tripled in the past quarter.  Integrated Silicon added 10 percent. LSI  Logic (NYSE: LSI), another chip maker, lost money last quarter, but did see  revenue growth and the share price reflected some optimism. </p><p>Over on the broad market, consumer stocks really held back the overall  market during the regular session.  Sara Lee (NYSE: SLE) here, we see it  fell another 5 percent. This high was set earlier this week. It has clearly  moved well off of that level.  The company had been looking for a buyer to  offer $19 per share, has found one, according to \"the Wall Street Journal.\"   It now likely will separate its coffee and meat businesses.  Share price  continuing to take a bit of a dive here.</p><p>Colgate Palmolive meantime sliding 3 percent. This is the last 180  sessions on the screen, clearly a bit of volatility over the past six  months or so.  This is a six week low tonight.  Earnings were OK.  Revenue  though a bit disappointing.  The company warns of building pressure from  high commodity prices. This may be a trend because the same issue is in  play at P&amp;G. Procter and Gamble`s latest quarter $0.03 better than  estimates, but down from a year ago. Higher commodity costs clearly in play  at P&amp;G.  It was the leading loser of the Dow Jones Industrial Average today  thanks to the 3 percent drop we saw.   Through the week, share price had  been rallying, in fact hitting a nice new 52-week high just a couple of  sessions ago, ahead of this latest quarterly result.  </p><p>The other sizable loser in the DowAT&amp;T (NYSE: T), down 2 percent.   We`re taking just a look at the last 30 sessions here at AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) and  what`s interesting is we`ve got the most recent low. This was the same day  that Verizon (NYSE: VZ) announced it would start selling the iPhone,  breaking AT&amp;T`s exclusivity. Earnings at AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) a penny over  forecast, but new customer growth slowed and that cost the share price. </p><p>Steel stocks have seen some volatility this week as they report higher  earnings. Again, commodity costs, higher raw material costs one market  worry. Nucor (NYSE: NUE) the latest to report. It lost money in the fourth  quarter, thanks to high commodity costs.  It and U.S. Steel dropped more  than 2 percent. The world`s biggest steel maker, Acelor Mittal, fell as  well today.  And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>GHARIB: Gold has been a less-than-glittering investment lately.  Investors leaving the largest exchange-traded gold fund have pushed prices  to a three-month low.  So far this month, gold has posted its biggest  monthly loss in over a year.  So is this a temporary pullback or is the  metal losing its luster?  Erika Miller reports. </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Whether it`s a  necklace or bracelet, gold will always be attractive as jewelry. But will  it also be attractive as an investment?  After nearly a decade of big  gains, investors have been rushing out of gold this month.  Ditto for the  world`s biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund which saw record  redemptions this week. Analyst Paul Christopher blames the rally in the  stock market for luring investors away from safe havens like gold. </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, SR. INT`L STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: You want  to think about gold as an alternative currency, so that when there are  better prospects in other financial assets other than gold, then gold would  naturally tend to suffer. </p><p>MILLER:  He thinks stocks will outperform gold long term, especially  if the global economy continues to recover.  But Barclays analyst Suki  Cooper thinks the retreat in gold is only short-term profit taking. </p><p>SUKI COOPER, METALS ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL:  We expect gold prices  to average a fresh annual record high of $1,495 per ounce. We expect prices  to continue to build on their gains until the third quarter of 2011. </p><p>MILLER:  She believes the factors behind gold`s rally the past few  years are still firmly in place. </p><p>COOPER: If we are looking at the longer-term drivers in gold, they  still very much remain intact. There`s the longer-term concerns such as  currency debasement or concerns that inflation could spiral. Those factors  are still their driving investment demand. </p><p>MILLER:  Many gold analysts are watching to see if gold falls below  the key technical level of $1,275 an ounce. If it does, expect a heavy wave  of selling, particularly by options traders. Longer term, analysts say  gold`s direction depends on interest rates and inflation. </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  U.S. inflation right around the 1 percent to 2 percent  area, while yields are rising, would be a sign that the economy is gaining  more traction, while inflation is not.  And that would really put a damper  on prospects for gold going forward. </p><p>MILLER:  If gold prices continue to fall, investment interest may  wane.  But the flip side is better deals on jewelry.  And analysts say a  pick up in consumer demand could help support prices. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>GHARIB:  Earlier in the program, Caterpillar`s CEO talked about the  importance of the Chinese market.  But it`s not just construction companies  that are experiencing a boon there. The western part of the country is  seeing a surge in new business and jobs, thanks to government incentives.   Nick Mackie takes a look. </p><p>NICK MACKIE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Cranes dot the  skyline, building homes, high-rise office blocks and high tech factories.  It`s a far cry from five years ago, when all this was mainly farmland. Over  the past 18 months, $3 billion of inward investment has flowed into Xiyong  micro- electronics park, with key players including Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:  HPQ), Foxconn, Quanta, Inventec and Acer deciding to locate here. The  park`s deputy director, Zhu Jiang, says Chongqing is now on track to be a  global manufacturing base for notebooks and tablets. </p><p>TRANSLATION OF: ZHU JIANG, XIYONG MICRO-ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIAL PARK:   By 2015, notebook production will reach 80 million units. Our exports will  reach $80 million U.S. and 400,000 people will be employed in notebook  manufacturing or related fields. </p><p>MACKIE:  Companies are buying into Chongqing because they seek lower  operational costs and to get closer to inland China`s huge maturing  consumer base.  The city recognized this early on and was quick to craft  and finance its strategy to build a new industry from scratch. Labor and  energy costs are 30 percent cheaper here than in China`s coastal region.   But the downside for now, is that 90 percent of component makers are still  over there, a thousand miles away. There are costly supply chain problems  for parts coming in or goods bound for export . So the government offers  incentives to compensate its early movers.   </p><p>JIANG:  Initially, the government provides subsidies to offset high  logistics costs, to help the enterprises get over their early-stage  difficulties. Once more and more companies locate here, there`ll be  economies of scale and logistics costs should improve. Then, that`s when  the government will step back. </p><p>MACKIE:  As part of its strategy, the government first stepped forward  in Xiyong five years ago by establishing a new university city, so that  colleges and vocational schools could relocate from the main urban area.  Chongqing`s college of electronic engineering, with 20,000 students, now  supplies technicians and engineers for the tech-based industry. Its chief  of enterprise cooperation, Mao Weiping, says companies work closely with  the college and even provide machinery to ensure the right skill sets are  developed. </p><p>TRANSLATION OF: MAO WEIPING, CHONGQING COLLEGE/ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING:   Nearly half of our graduates go on to work for the micro-electronics park  and its related industry. Also each year, we send about 2,000 to 3,000  students to the park`s companies for work-related experience. </p><p>MACKIE: While Chongqing`s labor pool is strong on low-skilled and mid- level workers, it`s weak, however, on retaining top flight engineers, who  usually head for the established R&amp;D centers in Beijing and Shanghai.  With  the cost of living soaring in China`s premier cities, Chongqing believes  more engineers will seek opportunities here, notably when the big tech  players shift up a gear. Xiyong illustrates that, even in a once backwater,  if the local government`s vision is global, the support strong and the  execution fast, leading corporations are quick off the blocks to back  Chinese-style state-controlled capitalism in order to grow in a competitive  marketplace. Nick Mackie, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chongqing. </p><p>HUDSON:  Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow: our \"Market Monitor\"  scheduled to be Erik Ristuben, chief investment officer of client  investment strategies at Russell Investments. Did the U.S. economy grow  during the last three months of the year and how much? We`ll get a first  look at fourth quarter GDP tomorrow.  And Ford Motor expected to post its  best yearly profit in more than a decade.  We`ll ask CEO Alan Mulally  what`s driving business. </p><p>GHARIB:  Linked In could be the first of the big social networking  companies to go public. The site aimed at connecting business professionals  with other professionals filed with regulators today for an initial public  offering. But Linked In did not say how much money it`s hoping to raise or  when it will do the offering. Other social network firms are expected to  follow in Linked In.  Groupon and Facebook are set to go public over the  next 18 months. </p><p>HUDSON:  Shares of Bank United begin trading tomorrow at the New York  Stock Exchange. Late today, they priced at $27 per share. That`s $2 more  than the expected range. The bank raised $783 million. We`ll talk with CEO  John Kanas, tomorrow. He himself invested $23 million in the bank when it  was bought by private equity firms, including WL Ross, Blackstone and  Carlyle Group back in 2009. </p><p>GHARIB: With high unemployment and a shaky outlook for housing, you`d  think consumers would stay away from the stores and stop shopping  altogether. But last month, shoppers were out in full force, ringing up the  best holiday season in four years. Tonight`s commentator says there`s a  good reason for it.  He`s Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the  Economic Outlook Group. </p><p>BERNARD BAUMOHL, CHIEF GLOBAL ECON., ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP:  The year  2010 left us with a tantalizing puzzle. We know the unemployment numbers  were awful last year, the worst in 30 years. And yet, even with that dismal  record, Americans were enthusiastic shoppers. Retail sales shot up by the  most in more than a decade. You would think high joblessness would cool  household spending, but it didn`t and one major reason may be that the U.S.  has a thriving underground economy. By underground economy, I`m not talking  about illicit activity, like selling stolen goods or drugs. It`s mostly  legal work, where millions of unemployed find income by doing handyman work  or selling stuff at flea markets or repairing computers. </p><p>Given the job-destroying recession we just had, it is believed a  record number of cash-strapped Americans were driven into the shadowy  underground. By some estimates, the size of the underground economy has  swollen from $350 billion a decade ago to $1.5 trillion now or more than 10  percent of the GDP. While business in the underground economy are typically  done off the books and deprive the government of needed revenues, they can  serve an important source of stimulus during periods of economic weakness  and may in part explain why we had this odd combination of high  unemployment and robust consumer spending. I`m Bernard Baumohl. </p><p>GHARIB:  And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 27.  Good night, everyone and good night to you, Tom. </p><p>HUDSON:  Have a great night, Susie. I`m Tom Hudson.  Thanks for  joining us and we`ll see you right back here tomorrow night.   </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

New products drive strong earnings at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and amazon.com, but the stocks drop on the news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: While this doesn`t look like a farm, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is plowing over $1 billion into server farm Terremark. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 27.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight, the tech sector squarely in focus after the close Susie. From earnings at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and amazon.com to Verizon`s big deal for computer server farm Terremark worldwide, we`ve really got the tech active in after hours trading tonight.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, it sure was. Let`s start off with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), a double surprise from the software giant tonight -- better than expected quarterly earnings and the numbers were released earlier than expected. The report was supposed to come out after the closing bell, but was accidentally released on the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) web site 15 minutes early. Here are the numbers. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) earned $0.77 a share in its fiscal second quarter. That was $0.09 more than estimates. Revenues also came in better than expected -- about $20 billion. The company credited the sales boost to business customers upgrading their computers and the debut of its Kinect controller for the X-box 360.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, amazon.com also turned in quarterly results after the close tonight. It as well beat estimates this time by $0.03 per share. The sale of electronic books for its Kindle reader outpaced sales of old school paperback books. But expenses last quarter increased, thanks to marketing for the Kindle over the holidays as well as investments in its distribution systems. The stocks of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon were both down after these reports. But shares of Terremark were awfully strong in after hours trading, surging as much as 35 percent. Here`s why. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) offering almost $1.5 billion for the computer server farm, $19 per share is the offer. The deal is part of Verizon`s push into cloud computing. We`re going to have more on all this coming in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Also today, big earnings from big CAT. Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) It posted a quarterly profit that quadrupled from a year ago. The world`s largest maker of construction and mining equipment earned $1.47 a share in the fourth quarter of last year. That`s $0.20 more than estimates. Revenues also came in a billion dollars more than expected, up 62 percent to almost $13 billion. Looking ahead, the company expects annual revenues to top $50 billion this year, bringing Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) back to pre-recession levels. So when I talked with CEO Doug Oberhelman today, I asked him where is all that growth going to come from?</p><p>DOUG OBERHELMAN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CATTERPILLAR: We`re seeing growth in sales and revenue just about across the globe. And most industries with the exception of our turbine business and large reciprocating engines which we think are coming but they`ll be coming, the growth will be coming later. So geographically and industry and product wise, it`s sort of a nice ramp all across the spectrum in 2011.</p><p>GHARIB: Mr. Oberhelman, how about in the U.S.? How strong is the recovery going to be for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) equipment?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: Well, the U.S. certainly has been slow coming out of the recession. There is no doubt we`re one of the last economies to the party. It is coming, however. And I`ve just been with groups of dealers and customers the last couple of weeks. They are a lot more optimistic today than they were a year ago. Now these are not big number increases, of course from very depressed levels in the last couple of years, but the anecdotes, the order level, the activity is definitely improving. We put out our December retail activity which showed a big increase in the United States and North America. So it`s coming, but slowly and frustratingly slow, I would say.</p><p>GHARIB: As you heard, President Obama in the state of the union address the other night is calling for more spending on our infrastructure, building a high speed rail system. Do you see that really happening and how would that translate into business for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: Well, you`ve got two great questions there. I will take the second one first. If we see more infrastructure spending and when that money actually hits the ground, it will help us. But remember, infrastructure spending that starts today is months if not a year or two before it hits the ground. Secondly, we are watching a very I would say conservative fiscal level of spending around the U.S. not only at the Federal level and the states. And that`s a concern to us because on the one hand, the U.S. has to get its house in order as do most states. On the other hand we need to stimulate the economy, get people back to work so it is a real balance to achieve.</p><p>GHARIB: Now you always talk about a lot of growth in the emerging markets. How important is China for your growth plan?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: 1.4 billion people modernizing is a good thing for this planet, people coming out of poverty, moving up into the middle class. That`s good for all of us. We in America need those export jobs. In fact, we exported about $13.5 billion from the U.S. in 2010. That`s up almost a third from 2009. Sixty eight percent of our sales or so in 2010 were outside. So those external markets are important for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and for our workers.</p><p>GHARIB: All right so, when China talks about slowing down its economy, what kind of impact would that have on Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: Well, they have talked about this and executed pretty well over the years ups and downs, growth and then slowdowns. They probably need to break their economy a little bit. I don`t see how they can grow at double digit GDP growth rates forever. Having said that, a slowdown to 6, 7 8 percent is probably healthy. It doesn`t impact us all that much, but it is something they`ve got to keep their eye on, they`ve got to work hard at.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk a little bit about jobs, because Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) actually has been rehiring over the past year and now with all the pickup in business that you are talking about, how many more people do you plan to hire in 2011?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: With a forecast going over $50 billion in 2011 we`re going to need more help to increase our production and do more of the things we`ve got to do. We`re to the going to put a number out. We don`t really have a forecast, but I`m confident as sales grow and we need more production, we will have more people working here a year from now than we do today.</p><p>GHARIB: That some good news for a lot of out of work Americans.</p><p>OBERHELMAN: It is.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk about Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) stock. It was the best performing Dow stock last year and it is almost quadrupled since March of 2009. So where does the stock go from here?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: We`re focusing on earnings. We`re focusing on quality of our business, growing market share, expanding geographically, spending capital, position us for the future. As long as earnings increase, our stock price will go along with it. But I will not make a prediction on that one.</p><p>GHARIB: Fair enough Mr. Oberhelman thank you so much for your time. Nice talking with you.</p><p>OBERHELMAN: You bet. Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s take a look at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. We`ve got stocks rising slightly ahead of all the tech news after the close. The Dow gained four points, the NASDAQ up 15, the S&amp;P 500 added nearly three. Big board trading volume dipped below a billion shares, while NASDAQ volume held firmly above two billion shares. New claims for jobless benefits rose by 51,000 in the past week to 454,000. Economists think bad winter weather is to blame. They see the trend reversing next week. Durable goods orders meantime tumbled in December, falling 2.5 percent. That was a surprise, because an increase in big ticket, long-lasting items was expected.</p><p>And Standard &amp; Poor`s downgraded Japan`s debt rating. The ratings agency says the world`s third largest economy is struggling under a huge debt load. Japan`s debt is more than double its GDP. Tomorrow on the program, still ahead rather tonight, stay with us. With gold prices down sharply since the start of the year, is gold losing its luster?</p><p>GHARIB: Wondering what caused the financial crisis? Well, now we know, maybe. The panel investigating the meltdown has finally released its report. And after months of digging, there`s still disagreement. Six Democrats on the panel say the regulatory system broke down, starting at the Federal Reserve. Financial firms bet too much, households borrowed too much and some players totally ignored ethics. But Republicans on the panel say there were actually 10 causes. Among them, worldwide credit and housing bubbles, too many toxic mortgages and credit rating agencies that didn`t do their jobs. Commission Chairman Phil Angelides says the bottom line is that the financial crisis didn`t have to happen.</p><p>PHIL ANGELIDES, CHMN., FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY COMMISSION: The captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings and importantly failed to question, to understand and to manage the evolving risks in a financial system that is so essential to the well being of our country. Theirs was a big miss, not a stumble.</p><p>GHARIB: The commission has posted hundreds of documents online. In one, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says only one of the country`s big financial firms was on solid footing during the crisis. But he doesn`t say which one.</p><p>So Tom, 12,000 on the Dow, 1300 on the S&amp;P during trading hours but didn`t close there. Psychologists who study investor behavior say that there is some worries about round numbers whence it comes to these milestones so didn`t happen today. Maybe it`s tomorrow or next week.</p><p>HUDSON: Maybe, lots of after hours news though that we mentioned at the top of the program could put a bit of a bid into the market by tomorrow. We`ll have to wait and see. But clearly those big round numbers are going to remain in focus here Susie. Speaking of, let`s get to tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" Overall ahead of all that tech news after the close, we saw another day of slim gains, but any gains at these levels mean the major indices do hit new post-recession highs. Some of that though may be interrupted tomorrow, if the after hours trading is any action (sic). We will mention Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) here as we roll it out. We talked about the earnings at the top of the program. Here`s the last year of MSFT trading. The 52-week high was back in the springtime. Shares falling during the regular session after the close down about 1 percent. This high here tonight, this is the highest level since May for MSFT.</p><p>Meantime, amazon.com, it came in to tonight`s report really with some optimism, a nice 5 percent rally. Just last week, this was a new all-time high for AMZN. Revenues though in the fourth quarter were a bit less than anticipated. Shares fell as much as 10 percent below these numbers down below $170 per share after the close, one to watch tomorrow.</p><p>Another one in technology was computer data storage firm Sandisk also had some optimistic buying interest ahead of its quarterly results. Shares have had a nice 70 percent rally here over the last 12 months. After the close, the stock down as much as 3 percent, but did have a bit of a rebound from that level so it clearly another one to watch in technology tomorrow.</p><p>Now the tech deal we mentioned earlier, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) buying tech data center firm Terremark. Ahead of that news, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) saw small gains, while Terremark was up 2.5 percent. Remember this was before the news hit the tape. After the deal announcement, Terremark jumped over its buyout price of $19 per share.</p><p>In addition to the technology news after the close, a quartet of semiconductor-related stocks really saw some buying interest off of their earnings today. Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) jumping 19 percent. Earnings there almost doubled. Teradyne (NYSE: TER) jumped 12 percent. It makes semiconductor testing equipment. Earnings at Teradyne (NYSE: TER) more than tripled in the past quarter. Integrated Silicon added 10 percent. LSI Logic (NYSE: LSI), another chip maker, lost money last quarter, but did see revenue growth and the share price reflected some optimism.</p><p>Over on the broad market, consumer stocks really held back the overall market during the regular session. Sara Lee (NYSE: SLE) here, we see it fell another 5 percent. This high was set earlier this week. It has clearly moved well off of that level. The company had been looking for a buyer to offer $19 per share, has found one, according to \"the Wall Street Journal.\" It now likely will separate its coffee and meat businesses. Share price continuing to take a bit of a dive here.</p><p>Colgate Palmolive meantime sliding 3 percent. This is the last 180 sessions on the screen, clearly a bit of volatility over the past six months or so. This is a six week low tonight. Earnings were OK. Revenue though a bit disappointing. The company warns of building pressure from high commodity prices. This may be a trend because the same issue is in play at P&amp;G. Procter and Gamble`s latest quarter $0.03 better than estimates, but down from a year ago. Higher commodity costs clearly in play at P&amp;G. It was the leading loser of the Dow Jones Industrial Average today thanks to the 3 percent drop we saw. Through the week, share price had been rallying, in fact hitting a nice new 52-week high just a couple of sessions ago, ahead of this latest quarterly result.</p><p>The other sizable loser in the Dow AT&amp;T (NYSE: T), down 2 percent. We`re taking just a look at the last 30 sessions here at AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) and what`s interesting is we`ve got the most recent low. This was the same day that Verizon (NYSE: VZ) announced it would start selling the iPhone, breaking AT&amp;T`s exclusivity. Earnings at AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) a penny over forecast, but new customer growth slowed and that cost the share price.</p><p>Steel stocks have seen some volatility this week as they report higher earnings. Again, commodity costs, higher raw material costs one market worry. Nucor (NYSE: NUE) the latest to report. It lost money in the fourth quarter, thanks to high commodity costs. It and U.S. Steel dropped more than 2 percent. The world`s biggest steel maker, Acelor Mittal, fell as well today. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Gold has been a less-than-glittering investment lately. Investors leaving the largest exchange-traded gold fund have pushed prices to a three-month low. So far this month, gold has posted its biggest monthly loss in over a year. So is this a temporary pullback or is the metal losing its luster? Erika Miller reports.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Whether it`s a necklace or bracelet, gold will always be attractive as jewelry. But will it also be attractive as an investment? After nearly a decade of big gains, investors have been rushing out of gold this month. Ditto for the world`s biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund which saw record redemptions this week. Analyst Paul Christopher blames the rally in the stock market for luring investors away from safe havens like gold.</p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, SR. INT`L STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: You want to think about gold as an alternative currency, so that when there are better prospects in other financial assets other than gold, then gold would naturally tend to suffer.</p><p>MILLER: He thinks stocks will outperform gold long term, especially if the global economy continues to recover. But Barclays analyst Suki Cooper thinks the retreat in gold is only short-term profit taking.</p><p>SUKI COOPER, METALS ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: We expect gold prices to average a fresh annual record high of $1,495 per ounce. We expect prices to continue to build on their gains until the third quarter of 2011.</p><p>MILLER: She believes the factors behind gold`s rally the past few years are still firmly in place.</p><p>COOPER: If we are looking at the longer-term drivers in gold, they still very much remain intact. There`s the longer-term concerns such as currency debasement or concerns that inflation could spiral. Those factors are still their driving investment demand.</p><p>MILLER: Many gold analysts are watching to see if gold falls below the key technical level of $1,275 an ounce. If it does, expect a heavy wave of selling, particularly by options traders. Longer term, analysts say gold`s direction depends on interest rates and inflation.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: U.S. inflation right around the 1 percent to 2 percent area, while yields are rising, would be a sign that the economy is gaining more traction, while inflation is not. And that would really put a damper on prospects for gold going forward.</p><p>MILLER: If gold prices continue to fall, investment interest may wane. But the flip side is better deals on jewelry. And analysts say a pick up in consumer demand could help support prices. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Earlier in the program, Caterpillar`s CEO talked about the importance of the Chinese market. But it`s not just construction companies that are experiencing a boon there. The western part of the country is seeing a surge in new business and jobs, thanks to government incentives. Nick Mackie takes a look.</p><p>NICK MACKIE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Cranes dot the skyline, building homes, high-rise office blocks and high tech factories. It`s a far cry from five years ago, when all this was mainly farmland. Over the past 18 months, $3 billion of inward investment has flowed into Xiyong micro- electronics park, with key players including Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), Foxconn, Quanta, Inventec and Acer deciding to locate here. The park`s deputy director, Zhu Jiang, says Chongqing is now on track to be a global manufacturing base for notebooks and tablets.</p><p>TRANSLATION OF: ZHU JIANG, XIYONG MICRO-ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIAL PARK: By 2015, notebook production will reach 80 million units. Our exports will reach $80 million U.S. and 400,000 people will be employed in notebook manufacturing or related fields.</p><p>MACKIE: Companies are buying into Chongqing because they seek lower operational costs and to get closer to inland China`s huge maturing consumer base. The city recognized this early on and was quick to craft and finance its strategy to build a new industry from scratch. Labor and energy costs are 30 percent cheaper here than in China`s coastal region. But the downside for now, is that 90 percent of component makers are still over there, a thousand miles away. There are costly supply chain problems for parts coming in or goods bound for export . So the government offers incentives to compensate its early movers.</p><p>JIANG: Initially, the government provides subsidies to offset high logistics costs, to help the enterprises get over their early-stage difficulties. Once more and more companies locate here, there`ll be economies of scale and logistics costs should improve. Then, that`s when the government will step back.</p><p>MACKIE: As part of its strategy, the government first stepped forward in Xiyong five years ago by establishing a new university city, so that colleges and vocational schools could relocate from the main urban area. Chongqing`s college of electronic engineering, with 20,000 students, now supplies technicians and engineers for the tech-based industry. Its chief of enterprise cooperation, Mao Weiping, says companies work closely with the college and even provide machinery to ensure the right skill sets are developed.</p><p>TRANSLATION OF: MAO WEIPING, CHONGQING COLLEGE/ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING: Nearly half of our graduates go on to work for the micro-electronics park and its related industry. Also each year, we send about 2,000 to 3,000 students to the park`s companies for work-related experience.</p><p>MACKIE: While Chongqing`s labor pool is strong on low-skilled and mid- level workers, it`s weak, however, on retaining top flight engineers, who usually head for the established R&amp;D centers in Beijing and Shanghai. With the cost of living soaring in China`s premier cities, Chongqing believes more engineers will seek opportunities here, notably when the big tech players shift up a gear. Xiyong illustrates that, even in a once backwater, if the local government`s vision is global, the support strong and the execution fast, leading corporations are quick off the blocks to back Chinese-style state-controlled capitalism in order to grow in a competitive marketplace. Nick Mackie, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chongqing.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow: our \"Market Monitor\" scheduled to be Erik Ristuben, chief investment officer of client investment strategies at Russell Investments. Did the U.S. economy grow during the last three months of the year and how much? We`ll get a first look at fourth quarter GDP tomorrow. And Ford Motor expected to post its best yearly profit in more than a decade. We`ll ask CEO Alan Mulally what`s driving business.</p><p>GHARIB: Linked In could be the first of the big social networking companies to go public. The site aimed at connecting business professionals with other professionals filed with regulators today for an initial public offering. But Linked In did not say how much money it`s hoping to raise or when it will do the offering. Other social network firms are expected to follow in Linked In. Groupon and Facebook are set to go public over the next 18 months.</p><p>HUDSON: Shares of Bank United begin trading tomorrow at the New York Stock Exchange. Late today, they priced at $27 per share. That`s $2 more than the expected range. The bank raised $783 million. We`ll talk with CEO John Kanas, tomorrow. He himself invested $23 million in the bank when it was bought by private equity firms, including WL Ross, Blackstone and Carlyle Group back in 2009.</p><p>GHARIB: With high unemployment and a shaky outlook for housing, you`d think consumers would stay away from the stores and stop shopping altogether. But last month, shoppers were out in full force, ringing up the best holiday season in four years. Tonight`s commentator says there`s a good reason for it. He`s Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group.</p><p>BERNARD BAUMOHL, CHIEF GLOBAL ECON., ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP: The year 2010 left us with a tantalizing puzzle. We know the unemployment numbers were awful last year, the worst in 30 years. And yet, even with that dismal record, Americans were enthusiastic shoppers. Retail sales shot up by the most in more than a decade. You would think high joblessness would cool household spending, but it didn`t and one major reason may be that the U.S. has a thriving underground economy. By underground economy, I`m not talking about illicit activity, like selling stolen goods or drugs. It`s mostly legal work, where millions of unemployed find income by doing handyman work or selling stuff at flea markets or repairing computers.</p><p>Given the job-destroying recession we just had, it is believed a record number of cash-strapped Americans were driven into the shadowy underground. By some estimates, the size of the underground economy has swollen from $350 billion a decade ago to $1.5 trillion now or more than 10 percent of the GDP. While business in the underground economy are typically done off the books and deprive the government of needed revenues, they can serve an important source of stimulus during periods of economic weakness and may in part explain why we had this odd combination of high unemployment and robust consumer spending. I`m Bernard Baumohl.</p><p>GHARIB: And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 27. Good night, everyone and good night to you, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Have a great night, Susie. I`m Tom Hudson. Thanks for joining us and we`ll see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 17.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. Some cautious signs of relief by investors around the world today. There`s a rescue plan in the works for Greece. Jittery financial markets stabilized somewhat after Germany agreed to a compromise deal to resolve the economic problems in Greece. U.S. stocks took that news and finished mixed today. The Dow Industrials was able to gain 42 points; the S&amp;P slipped more than seven, rather the NASDAQ slipped more than seven. The S&amp;P 500 gained almost four.</p><p>Now here`s how things looked for what was a rough week for investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added almost 1.5 percent. That snapped a six-week losing streak. The NASDAQ though didn`t fare as well, falling 1 percent for the week. The S&amp;P turned positive this week, ending a six-week slide, adding just a fraction. Despite today`s market rebound of sorts in America, investors are still worried about Greece. As Suzanne Pratt reports, Americans will be following the Greek drama closely for weeks to come.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Recently Greece has gone from being viewed as a fabulous tourist spot to a thorn in the side of U.S. stock investors. The question now is whether Greece and its financial woes will dictate the direction of the American stock market for the immediate future. NYSE trader Jonathan Corpina says it absolutely will because investors hate uncertainty and Greece`s financial outlook is far from certain.</p><p>JONATHAN CORPINA: Until we have some stability, any information about a plan or some sort of recovery that`s put in place coming out of Europe and Greece at that point then investors will feel much more confident to get back in the market. Looking into today, markets are positive this morning and leading into the afternoon due to the fact that the headlines are coming our of Greece.</p><p>PRATT: Market strategist Rick Bensignor agrees positive news out of Greece is just as important for U.S. investors as negative.</p><p>RICK BENSIGNOR, MARKET STRATEGIST: If by chance something good out over the weekend, a good headline or something like that, it wouldn`t surprise me if the S&amp;P was up 20, 25 points on Monday, the Dow up a couple hundred points. Good news could easily turn the psychology very quickly.</p><p>PRATT: Still others say the issue right now for the U.S. stock market is that it`s in a bit of an information void. Reporting season for corporate profits is still nearly a month away and lately there`s been little major U.S. economic data for investors to chew on. As a result, every twist and turn across the pond with Greece and its weaker neighbors gets extra special attention on U.S. trading floors. And experts say investors should expect Greece and its debt troubles to remain in the headlines for some time.</p><p>BENSIGNOR: You can`t fix it for good over the weekend. It`s too big a problem with too far reaching circumstances. And, it`s not just Greece. Greece is just the one in the headlines the most these days. But, there`s a likelihood that this stuff spreads to Ireland, Spain and Portugal.</p><p>PRATT: One thing many market pros agree on is if Greece defaults on its government debt, it will mean big trouble for U.S. stocks. In fact, some estimate major market averages could quickly lose as much as 15 percent. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: While Greece`s debt woes are grabbing headlines tonight, Italy`s problems may be heating up. Late today, Moody`s investor service put Italy on review for possible downgrade. Moody`s is worried the country won`t be able to cut spending enough to reduce its debt.</p><p>Back here in the U.S. meantime, watch for slower economic growth. That`s what the International Monetary Fund predicts. The global lending agency today said it thinks the U.S. economy will grow 2.5 percent this year, 2.7 percent next year. Both are down from a previous estimate issued just two months ago. The IMF`s Jose Vinals says the U.S. and Eurozone nations are playing with fire, unless they take steps to cut their budget deficits immediately.</p><p>JOSE VINALS, FINANCIAL COUNSELLOR, IMF: Well, I think that the biggest threat to global financial stability is that governments in various countries may not have enough political resolve to take the important measures which are needed to deal with the legacy of the crisis.</p><p>HUDSON: Vinals thinks that the global economy has gained ground despite slowing recently. He sees it accelerating in the second half of the year.</p><p>SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Let`s check now at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. With jobs still scarce and gas prices still high, consumers are feeling down. A new survey on consumer sentiment from Reuters University of Michigan shows a drop in confidence. The consumer sentiment index fell to 71.8. Economists had expected a higher, more positive number. And more evidence today of just how grim the job market is. The Labor Department says last month that the unemployment rate fell in fewer than half of the nation`s states. May`s jobless rate was down in 24 states, up in 13 and unchanged in 13, showing job growth has stalled across much of the country.</p><p>And still ahead on the program tonight, tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" takes on financial stocks. Bernie Schaeffer tells us if he thinks the year`s worst performing stock sector is ready for a rebound. He`s chairman of Schaeffer`s Investment Research.</p><p>HUDSON: Exports have been a bright spot for the U.S. economy this year, helping boost growth and create American jobs. But new trade deals with Panama, Colombia and South Korea have been stalled in Congress for months on Capitol Hill. That standoff may end soon. Washington bureau chief Darren Gersh spoke with U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk. Kirk also is the former major of Dallas, Texas. Darren began by asking why it`s been so hard to pass these trade agreements.</p><p>AMB. RON KIRK, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: Well, because you`re in Washington. And everything is, you know, everything is hard in this town. But the reason that we took the time to look at Korea and Panama and Colombia, not just from the standpoint of what does it take to pass them, but look at them in the broader context, that what 95 percent of the world`s consumers somewhere other than the United States, part of our success in the future is going to be linked to our ability to take more of what we make, manufacture, innovate, create here in the U.S. and share it with the world. And so within that, you`ve got to have a trade policy that not only speaks to those that say hey, pass these agreements, get going, we need the market access. But you`ve also got to have a trade policy that reflects those that say we want to make sure our trade reflects our core values, particularly how you ought to treat workers, not just here but also around the world. And that passing the agreements with trade adjustment assistance gives us the best chance to have a balanced approach.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Right, but Republicans argue that trade adjustment assistance which helps workers who lose their jobs because of trade, they don`t want it. They say that it`s not an effective program. They want to pass these agreements without it. Why is that such a priority for the administration?</p><p>KIRK: Well, Democrats on the other hand say trade has become a primer for shipping our jobs overseas. And the trades, you know, the unfair trade deals are the reason we`ve seen manufacturing and they don`t want the trade deals. Well, the reality and part of our challenge in this administration, what President Obama tasks me to do is say we`ve got to find common ground. There`s no way we`re going to disadvantage American exporters and manufacturers by saying we`re going to put us on less favorable terms in these markets that other countries are getting. But at the same time, we can`t dismiss the concerns of those that have said honestly that a lot of Americans, through no fault of their own, that happen to work for an industry that may have been displaced by trade, they typically are 46 years old, Anglo and the sole breadwinner of their family and they have good skills. And if we can get them the training, the coaching that they need, they can become reemployed. We not only save their job, we keep those families intact. And in many cases we keep those communities intact.</p><p>GERSH: But really what this comes down to is how are you going to do? How are you going to get this done because many of our biggest trade programs are on hold right now, have expired. How are you going to get this done and when?</p><p>KIRK: All along we have made a point. Our goal was not just to pass a trade agreement. We`re trying to build a new paradigm and a new rationale to the American public that is increasingly skeptical about trade, about how we can do trade in a different way. And for us there has to be that holistic approach that you combine new market access through trade agreements with strong enforcement, which we`ve done at USTR and we reflect our core values as represented by our commitment to trade adjustment assistance. That`s how you get it done. And we`re closer than I think most people think we are.</p><p>GERSH: The president has set a goal of doubling exports, but everybody else in the world has set a goal of expanding exports. Everybody can`t export their way out of their problems. How is it going to work?</p><p>KIRK: We can, it is work. And the one good thing is you know the president laid out that marker two years ago and remarkably we`re well on pace to meeting that. One of the things helping to drive our economic recovery is the reality that exports and only 13 percent of our GDP are contributing almost as much to our economic recovery as consumer spending.</p><p>GERSH: Well, U.S. trade representative and Mavericks fan Ron Kirk, thank you very much for your time.</p><p>KIRK: Huge Mavericks fan. Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And a U-turn today for one of the nation`s most powerful lobbies. AARP, which represents millions of older Americans said it is open to modest cuts in Social Security benefits for future recipients. The group has been a leading opponent of cutting benefits. But AARP now says it wants to limit any changes in benefits, while making sure the system remains solvent.</p><p>Well, Tom, it was a choppy week to be an understatement. And now investors have a weekend to think things over and start all over again on Monday.</p><p>HUDSON: Start all over again and of course always looking to Europe over the weekend, really, for the clues that we`re going to see on Monday. But it was quite a day today here, Susie. Let`s go ahead and roll with tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" We had a mixed finish for the major indices for the second day in a row. Investors still trying to balance the threat of European government debt against the consistency of lower energy prices that we`ve seen over the past several sessions. Let`s start by updating where the S&amp;P 500 is in relation back to its March low. There`s that March low that we had back in the spring. This remains an area of key technical support and so far, it is holding as we can see with the fractional rise we`ve got with in the S&amp;P index. It bounced off that level. The market has held above that March low, so far optimistic.</p><p>The slide in oil prices meantime, here`s what the last 90 sessions in the front month crude oil contract in New York looked like. Crude here falling today another 2 percent. This is the lowest price that we`ve seen since February. Energy prices -- that may help the broad market lower prices, but it hurt energy stocks. Drilling company Nabors falling almost 4 percent. Oil producer Hess (NYSE: HES) dropping 1.5 percent. That`s a new 2011 low for Hess (NYSE: HES). And equipment company National Oilwell Varco shed just over 1 percent. These were the leading energy stock losers today in that sector.</p><p>Technology stocks also weak and check out Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) here. Continues to see money coming out of its share price, sinking another 3 percent today. This is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)`s lowest price that we`ve seen in many months since September of last year. An analyst at investment banking firm Raymond James reports that paid online search spending is slowing down for the industry. Clearly that`s taken a chunk out of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG). Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)`s smartphone operating system Android is part of the challenge for Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)`s Blackberry. RIMM shares just got crushed today, very active trading. Look at this, 21.5 percent lower, losing more than a fifth of its value. This is just the past 30 sessions where you see the trend lower and then just falling off a shelf today. Volume exploding because of that sour outlook that we told you about last night. Let`s pull out to the past five years, showing this recent drop really in context and here it is over the past several months with RIMM, now in fact below the March of `09 low. Remember this is the low for the broader market. We`re seeing prices here in RIMM 27 3/4. We haven`t seen that since the fall of 2006. Now we do have an analysis of Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)`s chart on our website. Go to NBR on pbs.org.</p><p>A couple of other big tech stocks that are in the Dow Industrial index. Cisco dropping another half percent, just pennies above its most recent 52-week low. The company has struggled with disappointing guidance trying to restructure. Cisco is the worst Dow stock this year. Since January, we`ve got it down 25 percent.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) meantime the best Dow stock today with a 1.2 percent rally. It`s also though negative for the year as it continues to trend lower for tech. The worst stock sector this year, financials, not today though. Real estate service firm CB Richard Ellis jumping more than 4.5 percent. Tennessee-based bank First Horizon gaining almost 4 percent. And Zion bank out of Utah up about 3.5 percent, helping out the financials. According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" PNC Financial meantime is the winner in the bidding war for the U.S. retail operation of Royal Bank of Canada. No confirmation. Here`s PNC shares trending lower here, along with the rest of the financial sector, slipping almost 3 percent. Heavy volume, this is the lowest price of PNC since December.</p><p>The \"Journal\" also reports securities regulators are considering civil charges against credit rating agencies. Moody`s shares dropping 5 percent on this news. Parent company of Standard &amp; Poor`s, McGraw-Hill falling 3.6 percent.</p><p>We saw a trio of new stocks going public this week, get you updated here, a couple of high profile issues. Bankrate.com sold its stock at $15 today for the first time, rising a tad. Internet radio provider Pandora Media started at $16. It`s below that IPO price tonight. And oil and nat gas services company Compressco Partners began at $20 and it slipped from there. That is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Former Washington Mutual CEO Kerry Killinger and other top Wamu executives are in talks with the FDIC to settle a nearly $1 billion lawsuit filed against them. Killinger has until to the end of this month to respond to the FDIC`s complaint against him. Regulators allege Wamu executives took extreme risks with the bank`s mortgage portfolio, which led to the largest bank failure in U.S. history.</p><p>Meanwhile, another former bank executive is headed to prison for eight years. Catherine Kissick (ph) used to head a mortgage division at the now- defunct Colonial Bank. She learned her punishment today. Prosecutors say Kissick`s role in a $3 billion fraud scheme led to Colonial`s demise, as well as to Taylor Bean and Whitaker -- one of the nation`s largest private mortgage companies. Taylor Bean`s former chairman and owner Lee Farkas (ph) is due to be sentenced later this month.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we`re watching for next week. Our scheduled Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Alan Lancz. He`s editor of the \"Lancz Letter.\" The Federal Reserve will be back in the spotlight. It begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday next week. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a news conference on Wednesday. Monday on the program, creating jobs during challenging economic times. We talk to state leaders about what the role of government should be.</p><p>GHARIB: Food prices will likely head higher over the next decade. That`s what the United Nations and the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development are predicting. The reason - rising commodities prices and demand. The groups fear that higher food prices will hurt the world`s poor who already spend as much as 80 percent of their income on food.</p><p>HUDSON: The fight against Medicare and Medicaid fraud goes high tech next month. That`s when the Federal government begins using new software aimed at flagging would-be criminals before they get a check from Uncle Sam. Medicare has awarded a $77 million contract for the new system to defense giant Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) and a group of companies. They`ll use technology that`s similar to that of banking and telecommunication companies to spot fraud.</p><p>Greece, jobs, housing. There is no shortage of worries for investors and that may be one reason to get more optimistic. So says tonight`s \"Market Monitor.\" Bernie Schaeffer back with us, chairman of Schaeffer`s Investment Research, publisher of the \"Option Advisor Market Letter.\" Always nice to see you Bernie. Welcome back.</p><p>BERNIE SCHAEFFER, CHMN., SCHAEFFER`S INVESTMENT RESEARCH: Thank you, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: It was January when you were here last and you said that the market was in a disbelief rally. Investors just didn`t believe that stock prices deserved to move higher. We`re in essentially the same place in the market today than we were back in January. What about the market rally?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Still in disbelief. Got another magazine cover from \"Time\" recently, June 20th dated, talking about what economic recovery question mark, still no major end close equity mutual funds. Something interesting right here and now is the market is at a point, all the major averages are flat for the year. Very often you find that when you reach a benchmark like that, just as we did in March, it is time for a rally. People look to come in at points like that.</p><p>HUDSON: One of the places that has fueled this move back to flat is the financial space. The financial stocks are always seen as market leading. It`s clearly led the market lower over the past six weeks. It`s the worst performing sector so far this year. Are you saying, if the market can move higher from here, that bank stocks will as well?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: I think the bank stocks are an interesting short. And an interesting put by, simply because you mentioned that people were looking at the bank stocks and people were quite bullish on the bank stocks. Analysts are still extremely bullish. There are big fund planners in there if the sector had not been able to get out of its own way.</p><p>HUDSON: So you are bearish on banks?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: I bearish. This is the slope of hope that sectors decline on until you get the capitulation stage. So I think there is still a good short trade shaping up in the banking sector even though I`m bullish on the overall market.</p><p>HUDSON: You are using options here to play the downside that you expect in banks looking at the XLF, ticker symbol for the I shares, financial select. Here is the options trade, buy January 2012 at the money puts, the option to sell, a bearish call. It profits if this exchange- traded fund falls. It has clearly fallen a lot already. And you are expecting it to what move into the single digits, perhaps?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: That would be a home run on this option trade but you know, even if you got a 25 percent decline, that would be a very nice gain. And it`s a good hedge for a sector that you might be bullish on.</p><p>HUDSON: So noted. You do like consumers and at least consumer stocks, specifically retail stocks. Here is the S&amp;P retail exchange-traded fund, the XRT. You are looking at again January 2012 calls, a bullish call, an option to buy this exchange-traded fund. If the XRT moves up at the rallies, this option rallies in price as well. What`s fueling retail?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: What`s fueling the retail stocks is kind of the opposite of what the banking and financial stocks are having trouble with. The actual price action has been strong. Despite the fact that Wall Street is very skeptical on these stocks and so what that means is, this is the wall of worry that bullish sectors and markets climb. It means that sideline money is being drawn in reluctantly but steadily into sectors like retailers whose price action and earnings is positively surprising and potentially out of sectors like financial where the results are negatively surprising and the expectations are high.</p><p>HUDSON: That is your set-up for the next six months. Six months ago when you were here you had a couple of options plays. Let`s look how these have turned out. You were essentially bullish on the I shares Russell 2000 exchange- traded fund, August at the money calls. The option price though is down 43 percent as the exchange-traded fund essentially has gone nowhere. So time decay is what option traders call this. Do you still like this?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Yes. And time decay versus leverage is the conundrum of making money in buying options.</p><p>HUDSON: Meantime this one was a big strikeout. You lost all your money with the June at the money calls for the iPath S&amp;P 500, VIX exchange- traded note. Essentially you were looking for volatility as a hedge which has actually gone down in the last six months even though it has ticked up here lately in the past few weeks.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Right. And I would rather hedge sector to sector as we are talking about today.</p><p>HUDSON: So noted. What about disclosures for these options?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: I don`t have positions in the XLF or XRT exchange-traded fund.</p><p>HUDSON: We`re going to catch up in six months. Nice to see you again.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Great, pleasure.</p><p>HUDSON: Bernie Schaeffer, Schaeffer Investment Research.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, the author who got kids and parents reading together has something new, but it`s not a book. Harry Potter author JK Rowling will soon unveil her latest venture and all we know so far is that it`s called Pottermore and it won`t be a book. The site has few details, but links to a countdown clock marking the days and hours until the launch Tom and media watchers are speculating that the big announcement will be about some sort of online \"Harry Potter\" experience, perfect thing for you to do with your two boys.</p><p>HUDSON: I tell you. We`re not quite there yet for the Harry Potter books but we will be in just a short few years, Susie. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday night, June 17. Thanks for joining us. Have a great weekend, you as well Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you Tom and a happy Father`s Day to you and all the other fathers in our audience. I`m Susie Gharib. Hope to see all of you again next week.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 17.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. Some cautious signs of relief by investors around the world today. There`s a rescue plan in the works for Greece. Jittery financial markets stabilized somewhat after Germany agreed to a compromise deal to resolve the economic problems in Greece. U.S. stocks took that news and finished mixed today. The Dow Industrials was able to gain 42 points; the S&amp;P slipped more than seven, rather the NASDAQ slipped more than seven. The S&amp;P 500 gained almost four.</p><p>Now here`s how things looked for what was a rough week for investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added almost 1.5 percent. That snapped a six-week losing streak. The NASDAQ though didn`t fare as well, falling 1 percent for the week. The S&amp;P turned positive this week, ending a six-week slide, adding just a fraction. Despite today`s market rebound of sorts in America, investors are still worried about Greece. As Suzanne Pratt reports, Americans will be following the Greek drama closely for weeks to come.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Recently Greece has gone from being viewed as a fabulous tourist spot to a thorn in the side of U.S. stock investors. The question now is whether Greece and its financial woes will dictate the direction of the American stock market for the immediate future. NYSE trader Jonathan Corpina says it absolutely will because investors hate uncertainty and Greece`s financial outlook is far from certain.</p><p>JONATHAN CORPINA: Until we have some stability, any information about a plan or some sort of recovery that`s put in place coming out of Europe and Greece at that point then investors will feel much more confident to get back in the market. Looking into today, markets are positive this morning and leading into the afternoon due to the fact that the headlines are coming our of Greece.</p><p>PRATT: Market strategist Rick Bensignor agrees positive news out of Greece is just as important for U.S. investors as negative.</p><p>RICK BENSIGNOR, MARKET STRATEGIST: If by chance something good out over the weekend, a good headline or something like that, it wouldn`t surprise me if the S&amp;P was up 20, 25 points on Monday, the Dow up a couple hundred points. Good news could easily turn the psychology very quickly.</p><p>PRATT: Still others say the issue right now for the U.S. stock market is that it`s in a bit of an information void. Reporting season for corporate profits is still nearly a month away and lately there`s been little major U.S. economic data for investors to chew on. As a result, every twist and turn across the pond with Greece and its weaker neighbors gets extra special attention on U.S. trading floors. And experts say investors should expect Greece and its debt troubles to remain in the headlines for some time.</p><p>BENSIGNOR: You can`t fix it for good over the weekend. It`s too big a problem with too far reaching circumstances. And, it`s not just Greece. Greece is just the one in the headlines the most these days. But, there`s a likelihood that this stuff spreads to Ireland, Spain and Portugal.</p><p>PRATT: One thing many market pros agree on is if Greece defaults on its government debt, it will mean big trouble for U.S. stocks. In fact, some estimate major market averages could quickly lose as much as 15 percent. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: While Greece`s debt woes are grabbing headlines tonight, Italy`s problems may be heating up. Late today, Moody`s investor service put Italy on review for possible downgrade. Moody`s is worried the country won`t be able to cut spending enough to reduce its debt.</p><p>Back here in the U.S. meantime, watch for slower economic growth. That`s what the International Monetary Fund predicts. The global lending agency today said it thinks the U.S. economy will grow 2.5 percent this year, 2.7 percent next year. Both are down from a previous estimate issued just two months ago. The IMF`s Jose Vinals says the U.S. and Eurozone nations are playing with fire, unless they take steps to cut their budget deficits immediately.</p><p>JOSE VINALS, FINANCIAL COUNSELLOR, IMF: Well, I think that the biggest threat to global financial stability is that governments in various countries may not have enough political resolve to take the important measures which are needed to deal with the legacy of the crisis.</p><p>HUDSON: Vinals thinks that the global economy has gained ground despite slowing recently. He sees it accelerating in the second half of the year.</p><p>SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Let`s check now at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. With jobs still scarce and gas prices still high, consumers are feeling down. A new survey on consumer sentiment from Reuters University of Michigan shows a drop in confidence. The consumer sentiment index fell to 71.8. Economists had expected a higher, more positive number. And more evidence today of just how grim the job market is. The Labor Department says last month that the unemployment rate fell in fewer than half of the nation`s states. May`s jobless rate was down in 24 states, up in 13 and unchanged in 13, showing job growth has stalled across much of the country.</p><p>And still ahead on the program tonight, tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" takes on financial stocks. Bernie Schaeffer tells us if he thinks the year`s worst performing stock sector is ready for a rebound. He`s chairman of Schaeffer`s Investment Research.</p><p>HUDSON: Exports have been a bright spot for the U.S. economy this year, helping boost growth and create American jobs. But new trade deals with Panama, Colombia and South Korea have been stalled in Congress for months on Capitol Hill. That standoff may end soon. Washington bureau chief Darren Gersh spoke with U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk. Kirk also is the former major of Dallas, Texas. Darren began by asking why it`s been so hard to pass these trade agreements.</p><p>AMB. RON KIRK, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: Well, because you`re in Washington. And everything is, you know, everything is hard in this town. But the reason that we took the time to look at Korea and Panama and Colombia, not just from the standpoint of what does it take to pass them, but look at them in the broader context, that what 95 percent of the world`s consumers somewhere other than the United States, part of our success in the future is going to be linked to our ability to take more of what we make, manufacture, innovate, create here in the U.S. and share it with the world. And so within that, you`ve got to have a trade policy that not only speaks to those that say hey, pass these agreements, get going, we need the market access. But you`ve also got to have a trade policy that reflects those that say we want to make sure our trade reflects our core values, particularly how you ought to treat workers, not just here but also around the world. And that passing the agreements with trade adjustment assistance gives us the best chance to have a balanced approach.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Right, but Republicans argue that trade adjustment assistance which helps workers who lose their jobs because of trade, they don`t want it. They say that it`s not an effective program. They want to pass these agreements without it. Why is that such a priority for the administration?</p><p>KIRK: Well, Democrats on the other hand say trade has become a primer for shipping our jobs overseas. And the trades, you know, the unfair trade deals are the reason we`ve seen manufacturing and they don`t want the trade deals. Well, the reality and part of our challenge in this administration, what President Obama tasks me to do is say we`ve got to find common ground. There`s no way we`re going to disadvantage American exporters and manufacturers by saying we`re going to put us on less favorable terms in these markets that other countries are getting. But at the same time, we can`t dismiss the concerns of those that have said honestly that a lot of Americans, through no fault of their own, that happen to work for an industry that may have been displaced by trade, they typically are 46 years old, Anglo and the sole breadwinner of their family and they have good skills. And if we can get them the training, the coaching that they need, they can become reemployed. We not only save their job, we keep those families intact. And in many cases we keep those communities intact.</p><p>GERSH: But really what this comes down to is how are you going to do? How are you going to get this done because many of our biggest trade programs are on hold right now, have expired. How are you going to get this done and when?</p><p>KIRK: All along we have made a point. Our goal was not just to pass a trade agreement. We`re trying to build a new paradigm and a new rationale to the American public that is increasingly skeptical about trade, about how we can do trade in a different way. And for us there has to be that holistic approach that you combine new market access through trade agreements with strong enforcement, which we`ve done at USTR and we reflect our core values as represented by our commitment to trade adjustment assistance. That`s how you get it done. And we`re closer than I think most people think we are.</p><p>GERSH: The president has set a goal of doubling exports, but everybody else in the world has set a goal of expanding exports. Everybody can`t export their way out of their problems. How is it going to work?</p><p>KIRK: We can, it is work. And the one good thing is you know the president laid out that marker two years ago and remarkably we`re well on pace to meeting that. One of the things helping to drive our economic recovery is the reality that exports and only 13 percent of our GDP are contributing almost as much to our economic recovery as consumer spending.</p><p>GERSH: Well, U.S. trade representative and Mavericks fan Ron Kirk, thank you very much for your time.</p><p>KIRK: Huge Mavericks fan. Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: And a U-turn today for one of the nation`s most powerful lobbies. AARP, which represents millions of older Americans said it is open to modest cuts in Social Security benefits for future recipients. The group has been a leading opponent of cutting benefits. But AARP now says it wants to limit any changes in benefits, while making sure the system remains solvent.</p><p>Well, Tom, it was a choppy week to be an understatement. And now investors have a weekend to think things over and start all over again on Monday.</p><p>HUDSON: Start all over again and of course always looking to Europe over the weekend, really, for the clues that we`re going to see on Monday. But it was quite a day today here, Susie. Let`s go ahead and roll with tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" We had a mixed finish for the major indices for the second day in a row. Investors still trying to balance the threat of European government debt against the consistency of lower energy prices that we`ve seen over the past several sessions. Let`s start by updating where the S&amp;P 500 is in relation back to its March low. There`s that March low that we had back in the spring. This remains an area of key technical support and so far, it is holding as we can see with the fractional rise we`ve got with in the S&amp;P index. It bounced off that level. The market has held above that March low, so far optimistic.</p><p>The slide in oil prices meantime, here`s what the last 90 sessions in the front month crude oil contract in New York looked like. Crude here falling today another 2 percent. This is the lowest price that we`ve seen since February. Energy prices -- that may help the broad market lower prices, but it hurt energy stocks. Drilling company Nabors falling almost 4 percent. Oil producer Hess (NYSE: HES) dropping 1.5 percent. That`s a new 2011 low for Hess (NYSE: HES). And equipment company National Oilwell Varco shed just over 1 percent. These were the leading energy stock losers today in that sector.</p><p>Technology stocks also weak and check out Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) here. Continues to see money coming out of its share price, sinking another 3 percent today. This is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)`s lowest price that we`ve seen in many months since September of last year. An analyst at investment banking firm Raymond James reports that paid online search spending is slowing down for the industry. Clearly that`s taken a chunk out of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG). Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)`s smartphone operating system Android is part of the challenge for Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)`s Blackberry. RIMM shares just got crushed today, very active trading. Look at this, 21.5 percent lower, losing more than a fifth of its value. This is just the past 30 sessions where you see the trend lower and then just falling off a shelf today. Volume exploding because of that sour outlook that we told you about last night. Let`s pull out to the past five years, showing this recent drop really in context and here it is over the past several months with RIMM, now in fact below the March of `09 low. Remember this is the low for the broader market. We`re seeing prices here in RIMM 27 3/4. We haven`t seen that since the fall of 2006. Now we do have an analysis of Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM)`s chart on our website. Go to NBR on pbs.org.</p><p>A couple of other big tech stocks that are in the Dow Industrial index. Cisco dropping another half percent, just pennies above its most recent 52-week low. The company has struggled with disappointing guidance trying to restructure. Cisco is the worst Dow stock this year. Since January, we`ve got it down 25 percent.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) meantime the best Dow stock today with a 1.2 percent rally. It`s also though negative for the year as it continues to trend lower for tech. The worst stock sector this year, financials, not today though. Real estate service firm CB Richard Ellis jumping more than 4.5 percent. Tennessee-based bank First Horizon gaining almost 4 percent. And Zion bank out of Utah up about 3.5 percent, helping out the financials. According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" PNC Financial meantime is the winner in the bidding war for the U.S. retail operation of Royal Bank of Canada. No confirmation. Here`s PNC shares trending lower here, along with the rest of the financial sector, slipping almost 3 percent. Heavy volume, this is the lowest price of PNC since December.</p><p>The \"Journal\" also reports securities regulators are considering civil charges against credit rating agencies. Moody`s shares dropping 5 percent on this news. Parent company of Standard &amp; Poor`s, McGraw-Hill falling 3.6 percent.</p><p>We saw a trio of new stocks going public this week, get you updated here, a couple of high profile issues. Bankrate.com sold its stock at $15 today for the first time, rising a tad. Internet radio provider Pandora Media started at $16. It`s below that IPO price tonight. And oil and nat gas services company Compressco Partners began at $20 and it slipped from there. That is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Former Washington Mutual CEO Kerry Killinger and other top Wamu executives are in talks with the FDIC to settle a nearly $1 billion lawsuit filed against them. Killinger has until to the end of this month to respond to the FDIC`s complaint against him. Regulators allege Wamu executives took extreme risks with the bank`s mortgage portfolio, which led to the largest bank failure in U.S. history.</p><p>Meanwhile, another former bank executive is headed to prison for eight years. Catherine Kissick (ph) used to head a mortgage division at the now- defunct Colonial Bank. She learned her punishment today. Prosecutors say Kissick`s role in a $3 billion fraud scheme led to Colonial`s demise, as well as to Taylor Bean and Whitaker -- one of the nation`s largest private mortgage companies. Taylor Bean`s former chairman and owner Lee Farkas (ph) is due to be sentenced later this month.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we`re watching for next week. Our scheduled Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Alan Lancz. He`s editor of the \"Lancz Letter.\" The Federal Reserve will be back in the spotlight. It begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday next week. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a news conference on Wednesday. Monday on the program, creating jobs during challenging economic times. We talk to state leaders about what the role of government should be.</p><p>GHARIB: Food prices will likely head higher over the next decade. That`s what the United Nations and the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development are predicting. The reason - rising commodities prices and demand. The groups fear that higher food prices will hurt the world`s poor who already spend as much as 80 percent of their income on food.</p><p>HUDSON: The fight against Medicare and Medicaid fraud goes high tech next month. That`s when the Federal government begins using new software aimed at flagging would-be criminals before they get a check from Uncle Sam. Medicare has awarded a $77 million contract for the new system to defense giant Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) and a group of companies. They`ll use technology that`s similar to that of banking and telecommunication companies to spot fraud.</p><p>Greece, jobs, housing. There is no shortage of worries for investors and that may be one reason to get more optimistic. So says tonight`s \"Market Monitor.\" Bernie Schaeffer back with us, chairman of Schaeffer`s Investment Research, publisher of the \"Option Advisor Market Letter.\" Always nice to see you Bernie. Welcome back.</p><p>BERNIE SCHAEFFER, CHMN., SCHAEFFER`S INVESTMENT RESEARCH: Thank you, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: It was January when you were here last and you said that the market was in a disbelief rally. Investors just didn`t believe that stock prices deserved to move higher. We`re in essentially the same place in the market today than we were back in January. What about the market rally?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Still in disbelief. Got another magazine cover from \"Time\" recently, June 20th dated, talking about what economic recovery question mark, still no major end close equity mutual funds. Something interesting right here and now is the market is at a point, all the major averages are flat for the year. Very often you find that when you reach a benchmark like that, just as we did in March, it is time for a rally. People look to come in at points like that.</p><p>HUDSON: One of the places that has fueled this move back to flat is the financial space. The financial stocks are always seen as market leading. It`s clearly led the market lower over the past six weeks. It`s the worst performing sector so far this year. Are you saying, if the market can move higher from here, that bank stocks will as well?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: I think the bank stocks are an interesting short. And an interesting put by, simply because you mentioned that people were looking at the bank stocks and people were quite bullish on the bank stocks. Analysts are still extremely bullish. There are big fund planners in there if the sector had not been able to get out of its own way.</p><p>HUDSON: So you are bearish on banks?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: I bearish. This is the slope of hope that sectors decline on until you get the capitulation stage. So I think there is still a good short trade shaping up in the banking sector even though I`m bullish on the overall market.</p><p>HUDSON: You are using options here to play the downside that you expect in banks looking at the XLF, ticker symbol for the I shares, financial select. Here is the options trade, buy January 2012 at the money puts, the option to sell, a bearish call. It profits if this exchange- traded fund falls. It has clearly fallen a lot already. And you are expecting it to what move into the single digits, perhaps?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: That would be a home run on this option trade but you know, even if you got a 25 percent decline, that would be a very nice gain. And it`s a good hedge for a sector that you might be bullish on.</p><p>HUDSON: So noted. You do like consumers and at least consumer stocks, specifically retail stocks. Here is the S&amp;P retail exchange-traded fund, the XRT. You are looking at again January 2012 calls, a bullish call, an option to buy this exchange-traded fund. If the XRT moves up at the rallies, this option rallies in price as well. What`s fueling retail?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: What`s fueling the retail stocks is kind of the opposite of what the banking and financial stocks are having trouble with. The actual price action has been strong. Despite the fact that Wall Street is very skeptical on these stocks and so what that means is, this is the wall of worry that bullish sectors and markets climb. It means that sideline money is being drawn in reluctantly but steadily into sectors like retailers whose price action and earnings is positively surprising and potentially out of sectors like financial where the results are negatively surprising and the expectations are high.</p><p>HUDSON: That is your set-up for the next six months. Six months ago when you were here you had a couple of options plays. Let`s look how these have turned out. You were essentially bullish on the I shares Russell 2000 exchange- traded fund, August at the money calls. The option price though is down 43 percent as the exchange-traded fund essentially has gone nowhere. So time decay is what option traders call this. Do you still like this?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Yes. And time decay versus leverage is the conundrum of making money in buying options.</p><p>HUDSON: Meantime this one was a big strikeout. You lost all your money with the June at the money calls for the iPath S&amp;P 500, VIX exchange- traded note. Essentially you were looking for volatility as a hedge which has actually gone down in the last six months even though it has ticked up here lately in the past few weeks.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Right. And I would rather hedge sector to sector as we are talking about today.</p><p>HUDSON: So noted. What about disclosures for these options?</p><p>SCHAEFFER: I don`t have positions in the XLF or XRT exchange-traded fund.</p><p>HUDSON: We`re going to catch up in six months. Nice to see you again.</p><p>SCHAEFFER: Great, pleasure.</p><p>HUDSON: Bernie Schaeffer, Schaeffer Investment Research.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, the author who got kids and parents reading together has something new, but it`s not a book. Harry Potter author JK Rowling will soon unveil her latest venture and all we know so far is that it`s called Pottermore and it won`t be a book. The site has few details, but links to a countdown clock marking the days and hours until the launch Tom and media watchers are speculating that the big announcement will be about some sort of online \"Harry Potter\" experience, perfect thing for you to do with your two boys.</p><p>HUDSON: I tell you. We`re not quite there yet for the Harry Potter books but we will be in just a short few years, Susie. That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Friday night, June 17. Thanks for joining us. Have a great weekend, you as well Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you Tom and a happy Father`s Day to you and all the other fathers in our audience. I`m Susie Gharib. Hope to see all of you again next week.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Susie Gharib.  The unemployment rate drops to a four year low as U.S.   businesses add 146,000 jobs in November.  We look behind the numbers.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Good evening.  I'm Tom  Hudson.  We meet the CEOs of three small businesses hiring right now.  What  they do and why they're looking for help.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  And House Speaker Boehner accuses President Obama of wasting  another week in the fiscal cliff negotiations.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  That and more coming up on a Friday night edition here on  NBR. </p><p>GHARIB:  The job market is proving to be surprisingly resilient.   American employers hired 146,000 workers in November, much more than  expected.  And the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent.  That's the  lowest level since December of 2008.  As Erika Miller reports, that wasn't  the only surprise in today's report.  </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Almost no one on  Wall Street saw this good news coming.  There was every reason to think  hiring would be weak last month.  After all, many parts of the east coast  are still recovering from devastation caused by super storm Sandy.  </p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN:  I think the most likely  explanation here is that Sandy's impact was significant but was so short- lived that it didn't extend to the sample period of the employment report  which was the week that covered November 12.  </p><p>MILLER:  Hiring was also supposed to be weak due to worries about the  fiscal cliff.  With $600 billion in tax hikes and government spending cuts  set to start next year, why aren't more firms postponing hiring decisions?  </p><p>JULIA CORONADO, CHIEF N. AMERICA ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS:  What we're  hearing from businesses is that it is really hard to actually pull back  hiring right now, because they've already fired so many workers, gotten so  lean that it's really difficult.  </p><p>MILLER:  But not all the surprises in the report were good.  At 7.7  percent, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level since December 2008.   But that was mostly due to people giving up their search for work.  And  there's another disappointing trend, weak wage growth.  </p><p>KASMAN:  What we are not seeing is strong income generation.  The  slowing in wage gains -- the weak bargaining power of labor comes across in  this report. </p><p>MILLER:  So although the labor market is not getting worse, it's not  getting a lot better, either.  And there are plenty of risks that could  cause businesses to cancel projects, and hiring plans.  </p><p>CORONADO:  Clearly one of the biggest risks is that we don't see a  deal on the fiscal cliff or that they drag it out over a number of months  and that that really erodes confidence.  </p><p>MILLER:  Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve is trying to do  all it can to help the economy.  The central bank is widely expected to  announce an extension of its bond buying program when it meets next week.   Erika Miller, NBR, New York.  </p><p>HUDSON:  With the fiscal cliff about three weeks away tonight,  Washington has not made much progress to avoid it.  At least that was the  assessment today from one of those directly involved in the talks, House  Speaker John Boehner.  The top Republican accused President Obama of quote,  slow walking the economy to the edge of the cliff.  He repeated his call  for the president to send to Congress a plan that can pass both houses.   Tax rates are still the major sticking point.  The president wants to raise  them for America's highest earners; House Republicans strongly oppose. </p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER:  Instead of reforming the tax code  and cutting spending, the president wants to raise tax rates.  But even if  the president got the tax rate hike that he wanted, understand that we  would continue to see trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can  see.  Washington's got a spending problem, not a revenue problem.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Congress and the president now have about 24 days to reach a  deal before the fiscal cliff's tax hikes and spending cuts take effect.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Mark Zandi says bad things will happen to the economy pretty  fast if lawmakers don't settle the fiscal cliff issue.  He's chief  economist of Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.  So Mark, falling off the fiscal  cliff means bad things.  How bad?  </p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  It could be quite  bad, Susie.  I don't think it's cataclysmic if we get into January and we  haven't settled this, but if House makers haven't nailed this down by early  February, I think stock investors, bond investors will start to get very,  very nervous, start selling, risky businesses pull back and by the end of  February when we start approaching the ceiling for the debt limit, I think  we'll be back in recession.  It will be a fairly severe recession.  So  policy makers have a few weeks but not much more than that.  They have to  get this together.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Some people are saying that today's jobs report is very  encouraging and that you can look at this as a way that maybe the economy  can handle some tough belt tightening because things are looking a little  bit better.  How do you think the various parties, Republican and Democrats  will handle this jobs report in their fiscal cliff negotiations?  </p><p>ZANDI:  Well, you know, you're right.  Some folks look at this and say  the economy's strong enough.  It should be able to digest big tax  increases, spending cuts.  Others look at it and say look we still have a  very high unemployment rate, a long way to go to get back to full  employment.  The economy can't tolerate big tax increases and spending  cuts.  Like most political debates, the reality is in between.  We do need  to address our fiscal problem so we do need to go through some spending  cuts and we also need some tax revenue increases.  But we have to phase it  in over time, otherwise the economy will choke on that.  We can't have too  much restraint too quickly.  So we have to phase this in, smooth it in to  make it palpable for the economy.  </p><p>GHARIB:  But until that happens, there is a lot of anxiety in the  labor market.  The big fear for many individuals and for investors is that  companies are going to start laying off workers.  We saw this week that  Citigroup (NYSE:C) announced 11,000 job cuts.  Is this the beginning of a  trend, Mark?  </p><p>ZANDI:  No, Susie, I don't think so.  I think if Washington can  reasonably address the fiscal issues and I'm still confident that they will  ultimately get it together.  There will be a fair amount of brinkmanship  but at the end of the day, they'll get it together.  If they're able to do  that when we get into next spring, I do think we're going to be in much  better shape.  Businesses are going to get their groove back.  Certainly  investors are going to be very happy about that.  By this time next year, I  think we should see a much better job market because the housing market,  which is already starting to turn should be in full swing.  So no, I don't  think businesses are going to pull back.  The only reason they would is if  Washington completely botches this.  At this point I don't think that's  going to happen.  </p><p>GHARIB:  How do you think the Federal Reserve is going to read and  factor in today's jobs report?  They're meeting on Tuesday as you know.  Do  you think it's going to trigger any new response from the Fed?  </p><p>ZANDI:  Well, as you know the Fed's on high alert.  They've got their  foot to the accelerator.  They're now using open-ended quantitative easing,  buying long-term bonds and they're going to up the ante I think at the next  meeting in the coming week.  Operation Twist ends and they're going to  start rolling that into this quantitative even process.  So a lot of bond  purchases.  I think they're going to continue to do that until unemployment  is moving definitively lower and is much lower than it is today.  And most  importantly, they're going to wait and see how these things go in  Washington.  They're very nervous that policy makers aren't going to get  this right.  So as long as Washington's dithering I think the Fed's going  to be on high alert.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Absolutely.  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has been talking about  this for a while now.  Thanks a lot Mark, great talking about you.  We've  been speaking with Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics. </p><p>HUDSON:  Still ahead tonight, slow job growth does not discourage  tonight's \"Market Monitor.\" Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott tells  us why.  </p><p>The slow job growth we saw in November, growth but slow, didn't lead  to a lot of consumer cheer as December began.  The Reuters-University of  Michigan consumer sentiment survey fell early this month to its lowest  level we've seen since August.  So you add all this up here, the DowIndustrials rose 81 points, the NASDAQ was down 11 with some further losses  in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, the S&amp;P 500 up four points.  A mixed week for  the major indices, the Dow Industrials, which does not include Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), gained 1 percent for the week.  With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  the NASDAQ fell 1.1 percent.  And the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.01 of 1 percent  gain since last Friday.  </p><p>GHARIB:  One hundred of the small businesses behind the job growth  that we're seeing were honored last night in Washington with the \"Inc\"  magazine's \"hire power\" awards.  The businesses span the country and cross  an array of sectors.  Sylvia Hall met with three of the winners to talk  about their businesses and the one thing that they have in common:   success.  </p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  They work in  different states and in completely different fields.  But together, these  CEOs have added more than 1,500 jobs to the nation's economy over the past  three years.  This is Mike Derheim, who heads a Minnesota tech firm; Sharon  Virts Mozer, whose Virginia-based company runs administration for the  Federal government and Karl Schledwitz of Memphis, who's turned jerky and  hot dogs into opportunity.  (INAUDIBLE) seems to be kind of a mature  business.  How do you find growth there?  </p><p>KARL SCHLEDWITZ, CEO, MONOGRAM FOOD SOLUTIONS:  The actual space is  growing.  There are meat snacks, beef jerky really started growing with the  Atkins diet craze and it's probably quadrupled in the last two years.   We've been able to grow by buying under utilized manufacturing facilities  and centralizing the back office and putting robust sales operation  together filling up the plants.  And that creates employment and creates  more profitability.  It's no different than an office building or a  shopping center.  If it's half empty, it doesn't do very well cash flow  wise, but you take that same exact building and fill it up and it cash  flows.  </p><p>HALL:  You work with the Federal government.  Again, not exactly what  one would consider a growth market.  How have you been able to find growth?  </p><p>SHARON VIRTS MOZER, PRESIDENT, FCI FEDERAL:  We found that the demand  is going up just based on how the economy's going and the fact that people  want to be here in the U.S.  We've also found growth through our process  and our process takes what I call collaborative work forces and puts them  through a methodology in a training program that allows them to accomplish  great things.  </p><p>HALL:  Tell me just a little bit about this process.  </p><p>VIRTS MOZER: We hire typically high school graduates.  And we bring  them in and we assess their skills and their training and what they have to  offer.  We put them through a training program to train them towards a  particular task or a particular set of tasks.  </p><p>HALL:  One hundred nerds in 100 days.  Where did you get to the point  where you were on this nerd drive?  How did you get here and how is the  drive going?  </p><p>MIKE DERHEIM, CEO, THE NERDERY:  We started in November with our 100  nerds and 100 days program and just modeled actually very closely after a  PBS telethon member drive.  And the deal is that if you were known to us  and you get an interview we send you a hundred bucks.  If we end up hiring  the person we send you another 400 bucks and we're trying to get to a  hundred nerds in as many days.  As of right now, I think now we've had  about 900 applications submitted and we've hired 19 people.   </p><p>HALL:  What's the challenge for you specifically in hiring the people?  </p><p>DERHEIM:  The last I checked the unemployment rate for people in IT,  for people that I'm looking for was something like half of the national  average.  So above all there just aren't enough people who are out there  looking for jobs.  </p><p>HALL:  I just wanted to open it up and ask if hiring is a challenge -- </p><p>VIRTS MOZER:  (INAUDIBLE) associated with it and as a result credit  issues come up.  So finding folks that have the right attitude with good  credit particularly since we have a market or a set of work force that  often times they are suffering in a poor economy and they do need those  jobs but they have credit issues.  That's our biggest challenge but for the  most part, we have no problems in recruiting this particular market with  unemployment as high as it's been.  </p><p>DERHEIM:  I wish we had that problem.  We're exactly the opposite.   We're struggling all the time to figure out new ways to get more  applications in the door.  Just a different worker I guess but it's  different.  </p><p>HALL:  I wanted to go around and ask this about your growth prospects  for the next year.  </p><p>SCHLEDWITZ:  We hope to have more acquisitions this year and continue  to add to the plants that we're operating in.  So I don't, without an  acquisition, it would be 10-15 percent growth.  </p><p>VIRTS MOZER:  We're looking to grow by at least 500 if not 600 jobs by  the end of 2013.  </p><p>DERHEIM:  We are planning 25 percent a year revenue growth for 2013.   So we're definitely planning continuing to grow aggressively and  organically.  </p><p>HALL:  Thank you all so much and congratulations on your awards.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Calling it a robust investment in the region, the White House  today said President Obama would ask Congress for more than $60 billion in  aid for states impacted by hurricane Sandy.  Still that was less than the  $82 billion the states wanted for rebuilding.  Millions of homeowners and  businesses that were in the path of hurricane Sandy are now waiting for  checks as the long rebuilding effort begins.  Ruben Ramirez spent a day  with an insurance claim adjuster touring one of the hardest hit areas.  </p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's the calm  after the storm, empty streets, houses ripped from foundations, boats  sandwiched between homes, remnants of the famous Jersey shore boardwalk.  </p><p>KARL NEW, CLAIMS ADJUSTER, AMERICAN MODERN:  What makes this storm  different was the large amounts of sand that it brought with it.  So the  sand and the surge itself, it moved houses just like Katrina did, but it  just the sand is bad.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  Karl New is one of about 30 claims adjusters American Modern  Insurance dispatched to New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.  For the  barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, it was north of the eye of the  storm but think of it like a windmill spinning counter-clockwise.  </p><p>NEW:  Seaside was hit with a 37-foot wall wave so that's a pretty big  wall that was coming in so you're talking water that's higher than that  building.  that's crashing in here and causing this much - and the force.   It's bringing sand.  It's bringing all that water in.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  It took a month before insurance adjusters were allowed on  the island to assess the damage.  New inspected this property earlier this  week.</p><p>NEW:  The \"L\" shape all the way up top, everything is sagging down  from the weight of the sand that was pushing it and the water that was  pushing it out.  It pushed somebody's shed completely right into his house.   He got 5 1/2 feet of water in his house so everything on the first floor  needs to be completely gutted and taken out.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  John Marchetti's house sits just two doors down closer to  the beach.  </p><p>JOHN MARCHETTI, HOMEOWNER:  I do have flood insurance (INAUDIBLE) and  flood.  Obviously everything that you see here is from the bottom. It's  from the flood.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  Marchetti's insurer, NJM will take a loss of more than $300  million from Sandy, four times what it paid out from Irene last year.  It's  the largest loss in the company's history.  Industry estimates put the  total amount of damage from super storm Sandy at $50 billion.  Insurance  companies are expected to pick up about $10-$20 billion of that putting  super storm Sandy at the top of the list and ahead of hurricanes Ivan, Ike  and Irene.  Monday we will look at why rebuilding from Sandy is so  expensive thanks to where she came ashore.  Ruben Ramirez, Seaside Heights,  New Jersey.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Back here on Wall Street, Tom, some interesting revolutions  from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) today saying that it got a Wells notice, is  being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  But behind  it is a very interesting debate going on.  The reason for the investigation  is that the CEO Reid Hastings had posted some information on his Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) page about developments at the company and the SEC said you  didn't disclose this properly. It should have been a press release.  It  should have been a filing with the SEC and it raises whole new questions  about social media and fair disclosure.  </p><p>HUDSON:  This is all about how technology is changing and regulations  have such a hard time Susie keeping up with it.  We've see it with high  frequency trading for instance and now we're seeing with how companies  disseminate information using social media getting it out arguably to more  people faster than what a traditional press release or SEC filing.  So  we'll have to see how this one plays out.  That stock by the way Susie  didn't move much today on the notice although we did have plenty of other  movement.  Let's get going with our \"Market Focus\" here.  As we saw the  influence of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that it can have on the broad market  really continue today with the major indices closing mix.  The jobs data  helped the S&amp;P 500 start in the green but the early gains disappeared as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares sank.  The index climbed into positive in the  afternoon and was able to finish up a 0.03 of a percent.  Trading volume  slowed, 605 million on the big board, 1.6 billion shares on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>The materials and financials sectors gained 0.08 of a percent.  The  energy sector up 0.07 of a percent.  Technology was the big drag, thanks  once again to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AAPL.  Over the past week here it is,  gone from almost $600 per share down to $533.  That's down about 9 percent.   Looking at it longer term in the last year, the sell-off with Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) now about $8 above that mid-November low.  Several theories  behind the stock drop:  profit taking, disappointment over no special  dividend and more fundamental concerns about Apple's business growth.  </p><p>Two other big tech stocks under pressure.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  falling 1 percent, just pennies tonight above its low for the year.  Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems falling 0.07 of 1 percent.  The firm repeated today  its previous earnings growth forecast.  </p><p>Big banks, they were on the upswing though with further improvement in  the job market, and ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting with  expectations building for the possibility of more economic help.  JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) jumped 2.6 percent, its highest price since early November.   Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added another 1.8 percent.  That's an 18-month  high for shares of B of A.  </p><p>A big global energy deal one step closer to reality tonight.  Late  today Canada OK'd the buyout of Nexen (NYSE:NXY) Energy by Chinese energy  giant C-NOOC.  It's a $15.3 billion deal, representing another foreign  expansion by a Chinese energy company.  Canada's ministry of industry said  C-NOOC agreed to quote, free market principles.  The buyout offer for Nexen  (NYSE:NXY) came back in July.  In today's regular session, the stock was  heavily traded falling 6.6 percent.  But after the Canadian OK, they jumped  more than 14.5 percent in extended hours trading, around $27 per share.   U.S. and British regulators still have to approve the deal.  </p><p>Two years ago Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered $6 billion to buy daily  deal website Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) before it went public.  Groupon's market  value is half that tonight.  Bloomberg reports there's new take-over  speculation.  By whom we don't know.  The stock though jumped 23 percent.   Volume doubled.  Some of the buying could also be from traders who sold  short the stock to profit as it was falling.  </p><p>Four of the top five most actively traded exchange-traded products  were higher.  The lone hold-out the NASDAQ 100 tracking fund, which does  include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after all.  The fund was down 0.06 of 1 percent  today.  And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>Job growth is one reason tonight's \"Market Monitor\" thinks the economy  will pick up speed next year and so will stocks.  Mark Luschini back with  us, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.  Always great  to see you Mark. So the job market that we saw today improving in the last  month but still slow.  Do you think it's going to pick up the pace of that  improvement next year and why?  </p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT:    Well we do, Tom.  The fact of the matter is we've been seeing steady if  unspectacular job growth for the better part of 2012, job growth averaging  roughly 150,000 or so a month.  We think on the back of an up tick on  several factors here that we're looking forward to improve in 2013, we  could see a modicum of an up tick in job growth.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Among those other improvements you see consumers paying down  debt as beneficial to the economy.  Doesn't that lead to less demand, less  consumer spending?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   We think it's bringing up their balance sheet.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Which is a good thing.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   It is a good thing.  All this (ph) leads to a much  healthier foundation upon which consumption can be built which is all  important in the economy.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Where are we in that de-leveraging cycle do you think, closer  to the end?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   I think it's advanced.  I think it's probably a 2015-16  phenomena before we get trend but nonetheless, well off the peak in 2006.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Businesses meantime are not necessarily de-leveraging. They  don't necessarily have to.  They have a lot of cash out there but they're  not spending it.  You think they're going to less loose some of that cash.   We've heard so much uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and companies  holding back.  How are those two related?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   I think the fiscal cliff ultimately is going to be  rendered into a fiscal slow.  Between now and then the uncertainty is  really paralyzing CEOs and companies from big to small.  You can see it in  the core capital goods orders which have basically fallen off in the last  two quarters indicative of holding that business investment and hiring back  which we think will change once we have some certainty brought into that  equation.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Finally housing which has shown remarkable stability here, an  uptick in several markets but there's talk about limiting mortgage  deductions with the fiscal cliff negotiations sometime next year.  Couldn't  that impact the recovery?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   It could.  Obviously it might be relegated to more  affluent households in terms of the ability to do a deduction either in  full or part.  But at the end of the day there's still a large swath of  household formation that is occurring that's going to drive I think  perspective homeowners into the market regardless.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Let's get to the pics here.  You do like housing stocks with  the home builders ETF.  What do you anticipate?  They've had a nice run  already.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   They've been terrific.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Put new money to work?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   We turned bullish about a year ago and they've doubled or  better and yes we would.  They may be subject to profit taking but  nonetheless we still think we're in the early innings of the house  recovery.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You also like technology.  Is this a play on your business  investment expectations for next year?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   It is, if business wallets open up we expect the  destination for some of that money to go towards more productivity  enhancing tools and they've been under investing in technology now for  several years.  </p><p>HUDSON:  What about that transition from the PC to tablets and smart  phones?  Does that concern you at all about traditional technology terms  firms?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   It does a little bit.  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is intriguing  and then really the sweet spot of that.  The fact of the matter is though  it's an interesting company that is trying to make itself into more of a  tablet or a smart phone oriented company.  In the meantime they get paid an  enormous dividend yield to wait.</p><p>HUDSON:  Speaking of which, I know you like dividend stocks.  The last  time we spoke to you July 6, you liked Conoco Phillips and Johnson &amp;  Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).  Both of them in terms of just the stock price  appreciation up by single digits percentage terms.  You still like them.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:   Very much so.  Battleship companies good places to be in,  in health care and energy and again a very handsome coupon (ph) which is  think is going to matter to total return.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Do you own everything that we mentioned tonight?</p><p>LUSCHINI:  We do.</p><p>HUDSON:  Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Mark Luschini.  He's with  Janney Montgomery Scott.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Thanks Tom.</p><p>GHARIB:  And it's often said that in life, it's not the destination  that counts, but the journey.  This week Lou's been thinking about journeys  and their not so straight lines.  Here's author and educator, Lou Heckler.  </p><p>LOU HECKLER:  How many of you are now doing what you thought you'd be  doing when you first went to work?  I'll guess maybe about 25 percent.  I  was reminded of this recently when I spoke to a group of dentists about  leadership.  We talked about how they got into dentistry because they liked  working with their hands, they liked helping people.  And now?  Now, they  also negotiate building leases and manage staffs and cope with shrinking  reimbursements and the soft economy.  My first job as a manager involved  leading 17 people in a television news department.  </p><p>One day, one of my old college friends surprised me by asking:  how  does it feel to be out of the news business?  I only later realized he  meant that all of us who have the privilege of leading others soon realize  that leading is our job.  That once-straight line we visualized where our  skills were needed has zigs and zags in it.  The skills we now need to  learn and hone and practice have changed.  It's a wonderful honor to be at  the top of an organization, but that old concept of straight to the top,  that's not how it is.  Not by a long shot.  I'm Lou Heckler.  </p><p>GHARIB:  And finally, we want to let all of you know that we've posted  an extended version of our conversation with NBR founding anchor Paul  Kangas from yesterday.  It's on the web at nbr.com and have a great weekend  everyone and Tom, it was great seeing you yesterday as well.</p><p>HUDSON:  Great to have you in south Florida Susie with Paul as well, a  lot more viewer questions on that extended video at nbr.com.  Have a great  weekend and we'll see you back here nest week.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The credit  agency warned of a bond rating downgrade unless Europe solves its debt  crisis.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Meantime in the U.S., a  heavy debt load weighs on the U.S. Postal Service.  It aims to save  billions by slowing delivery times and cutting its work force.  It's  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, December 5. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:   Good evening everyone.   Europe was put on notice tonight.    After the market close, Standard &amp; Poor's placed 15 European countries on  negative credit watch.   That means the countries' credit ratings could be  cut.   And Tom, the warning even applies to the Eurozone's six AAA-rated  nations.  That includes Germany and France.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HUDSON:   Susie, European government credit ratings may be cut,  depending on how much progress these European leaders can make at a summit  scheduled on Friday.   Standard &amp; Poor's cited several reasons for the  warning tonight, including tightening credit conditions in Europe,  continuing disagreements among European policymakers on how to resolve the  debt crisis, high levels of government and household debt on the continent  and the risk of a recession in the Eurozone next year.   </p><p>  John Chambers is the managing director at S&amp;P ratings service and  chairman of the sovereign rating committee.  He joins us tonight from  Standard &amp; Poor's in New York.  John, what are the odds now of a credit  downgrade after this credit watching warning that you issued tonight?</p><p>  JOHN CHAMBERS, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S:  Well, the standard definition of  credit watch is one in two likelihood or more of a credit downgrade.   Empirically about 70 percent of sovereigns that have gone on credit watch  have ultimately been downgraded in the last 20 years.</p><p>  HUDSON: A significant warning then.  You cite, quote that systemic  stress in the Eurozone have risen in recent weeks. What specifically have  you more concerned today versus say six weeks ago or six months ago?</p><p>  CHAMBERS:  Well, it's an incremental thing, but what we fear now is  that there's been a lot of expectations built up for the summit and that if  those expectations disappoint, then we could have a definite leg down that  would be very difficult to come back from.</p><p>  HUDSON:  In your credit warning, can you separate between the level of  debt that Europe currently has versus the concerns about a European  recession or the lack of economic growth in Europe?</p><p>  CHAMBERS:  Well, there's several factors at play. One is the political  impasse that we've seen on getting closer to a fiscal union throughout  Europe, which we think would put them on a stronger footing.  We cited a  number of issues with the banks and their ability to roll over their debt  to non-residents and also the monetary policy settings and their  appropriateness for all of the economies in the Eurozone.  All of these  factors are at play in our credit watch action.</p><p>  HUDSON:  With this in regard and with so much now keyed up on Friday's  summit with European Union leaders, what specific actions would you like  those EU leaders to take that could then perhaps not submit the credit  ratings to an actual downgrade in the next 90 days.</p><p>  CHAMBERS:  We don't give policy advice, but you have several people,  including Ed Garvey (ph), the president of the ECB pointing to a fiscal  compact and in our way of thinking of things, that would include not only a  mutualization of the obligations, at least some of the obligations of the  Eurozone, but greater resources, greater revenues that would be shared at a  Eurozone level.   That certainly would be a big jump forward and would help  to relieve some of the pressure on what we see on the zone throughout.</p><p>  HUDSON: John, finally back in August, of course, S&amp;P downgraded the  U.S. credit rating.  It has now put 15 European Union countries on warning  for a possible credit rating.   Overall government finances throughout the  world and the developed world seem to be under significant pressure.   Do  you see that changing over the next year?   </p><p>  CHAMBERS: I don't see the pressure on the developed markets changing.    I think that we're in for a long slog ahead of us and it could be that  government bonds will no longer be a AAA asset class.   </p><p>  HUDSON:   Certainly that's the case here in the U.S. and possibly in  Europe.   John, we appreciate the analysis.   With us, John Chambers  tonight, he's with us from Standard &amp; Poor's.</p><p>  GHARIB:   And joining us now with more analysis, Bob Doll.  He's the  chief equity strategist at Blackrock.   Hi, Bob, nice to have you with us.</p><p>  BOB DOLL, BLACKROCK: Good evening, Susie.   </p><p>  GHARIB:   All right so what is your take on this S&amp;P announcement?   </p><p>  DOLL:  Look, I think they're doing what they have to do.   There are  stresses and strains and the situation continues to worsen.   And as a  result they can't stand by and watch so they put these things on credit  watch, I think should be no surprise.   The monkey is on the European's  back at the moment, to get an austerity program in place, that has some  teeth and they find a way to grow.   That's a tall order Susie.   </p><p>  GHARIB:   Do you think that this action by S&amp;P will motivate European  leaders to do something new?  Is it really a wake-up call?   </p><p>  DOLL:  Well there have been a lot of wake-up calls.   Among them the  market having riots and going down quite a bit as you know on and off in  the last bunch of months, and so yet this is another sign. I think that  over the last few months, the last few weeks, we have begun to get some  action to say maybe they do here.   Let's hope that there is traction.    The meeting is coming up and these next bunch of days is important in that  regard.   </p><p>  GHARIB:  Bob what do you think is the solutions to the problems there?  What do you think needs to be done to fix the debt crisis in Europe?   </p><p>  DOLL:   I think what has to happen is we have to have some solidarity  around a more united fiscal policy for Europe.   And they're working on  that.   That policy has to have teeth whereby if I am a country and I don't  do what I say I'm going to do, there is some sort of penalty.   And then in  order to grow we have to find ways to collect more revenues and reduce our  expenses at the government level.   Those countries have to become more  competitive.   I am just giving you a recipe that has a fair number of  ingredients, Susie and they're difficult and will take time.   </p><p>  GHARIB:  Right.  It is a tall order.   In the meantime what does this  action by the S&amp;P mean for U.S. investors? Is this a good development for  the bond market?   </p><p>  DOLL:   It's never good when you see credits going in the wrong  direction or the warning that they could.   And what I think is the market  is not going to be all that surprised.   I think that given how the spreads  between the lower quality and the higher quality countries in Europe have  moved up, there's no question but the bond market knows these concerns  exist.   So I'm not sure there is a whole lot of news here Susie.   </p><p>  GHARIB:   What about the implications for the U.S. stock market?    Does it make U.S. stocks a little more attractive given the new risks in  Europe?   </p><p>  DOLL:  Well, we would have argued that Europe was headed for, if not  in a recession already and the U.S. while not growing strongly certainly is  improving.   And that's why you've seen the U.S. stock market outperform  most of the stock markets in the world not just Europe, over the course  much this year.   We suspect there's more of that to come to the extent the  U.S. continues to grow its revenues and earnings.   </p><p>  GHARIB:  You said a moment ago that this doesn't come as much of a  surprise of what is going on with between S&amp;P and these ratings.   But how  do you think investors are going to react to this news tomorrow when the  market opens?   </p><p>  DOLL:  I suspect there will be some sellers who will say, you know, I  thought I should be selling.   Maybe I will sell a little bit more but on  the other hand, I think what's more important is what comes out of these  policy meetings over the next few days.   Does what Germany and France have  been talking about have some reach beyond just those two countries?   Can  the peripheral countries of Europe sign on to that fiscal austerity with  key plans?   If they can, those markets will rally despite this warning.   </p><p>  GHARIB:  Absolutely.   A lot of questions hanging over the market.    Thank you so much Bob for coming on the program.   Really appreciate it.   </p><p>  And we've been speaking with Bob Doll.  He's chief equity strategist  at Blackrock.   </p><p>  HUDSON:   Earlier today, stocks were a bit higher on hopes the EU  would get its act together this week.  Wall Street though gave up some of  those gains ahead of the close as the reports of the S&amp;P Eurozone bond  warning made the rounds.   So at the closing bell this Monday, the Dow  Industrials finished with about 78.5 points of gains. The NASDAQ rose  almost 29, the S&amp;P 500 up close to 13 points.   Now the gains were added to  the big jump we saw last week.   As the near - as the year rather nears its  end, stocks have regained some of the momentum lost in November.   Erika  Miller reports tonight on what history tells us about the rest of the year.     </p><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   'Tis the season  to be jolly, especially if you are a stock market investor.   December is  historically the chart-topping month for the stock market.   It's been that  way since 1929, 1945, as well as 1970 -- the year Elvis's Christmas album  came out -- one of the best-selling holiday albums of all time.  Over the  past three decades, December has posted an average gain of 1.8 percent,  more than twice the average increase for all months.   S&amp;P's Sam Stovall  believes the year-end rally is largely due to a change in investor  perspective.   </p><p>  SAM STOVALL, S&amp;P:  Investors, because they are now focusing on 12  months ahead rather than only about three months ahead, as we approach the  end of the year, then I think optimism takes over.   Investors put their  money to work and basically expect the coming year to be fairly strong.   </p><p>  MILLER: The question is whether this year will follow historic  patterns.   On the one hand, U.S. economic data seems to be improving.    The unemployment rate dropped last month and consumer confidence hit its  highest level since July.   And judging by black Friday and cyber Monday  results, jingle bells are ringing at cash registers this holiday season.    But, there may be a big reason December may prove disappointing for the  market.   As strategist Vadim Zlotnikov explains, the overarching concern  is the debt crisis in Europe, where the S&amp;P 500 gets 14 percent of total  sales.   </p><p>  VADIM ZLOTNIKOV: You have uncertainty as to what is the path that  Europe is going to choose.  If it is a path of extreme austerity, it could  actually depress the U.S. companies' earnings and the U.S. economic growth.   </p><p>  MILLER:   Another big worry is slowing growth in China, the world's  second largest economy.   That said, Stovall still believes the S&amp;P 500  will end next year around 1,360, which would be 8 percent above today's  close.   </p><p>  STOVALL: I am a bull with a lower case \"B.\"   I think that we probably  could see a low end double digit advance based on where we are right now.    I think that when you look at everything in terms of fundamentals,  technicals, history, that there is a good chance for a positive return in  the coming year.   </p><p>  MILLER:   So, the hope for stock investors is that there will be gains  in December, setting a positive tone going into next year.   But if there's  no Santa Claus rally, watch out because historically that tends to precede  bear markets.   Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.   </p><p>  GHARIB:   Still ahead, your snail mail could soon be moving at a  snail's pace.   We look at the latest cuts coming to a post office near  you.   </p><p>  HUDSON:   Senate Democrats offered a scaled back version of their  payroll tax cut extension today.   It includes what Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid calls a quote, tiny surcharge on millionaires.   The move is  designed to appeal to Republicans who shot down previous versions of the  bill because of a 3.25 percent tax on incomes above $1 million.   The  latest Democratic version is for a surcharge of less than 2 percent on  incomes over $1 million.   The legislation also would extend the payroll  tax cut next year, but only for workers, not their employers.   With the  tax cut due to expire at the end of e year, President Obama today pushed  for urgent action.   </p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only is extending  the payroll tax cut important for the economy as a whole, it's obviously  important for individual families.   It's important insurance for them  against the unexpected.   It will help families pay their bills.  It will  spur spending.   It will spur hiring and it's the right thing to do.   </p><p>  HUDSON:   Republicans argue tax breaks for workers do little to  stimulate the overall economy.   They also believe the tax breaks should be  paid for with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, rather than relying on  a surcharge on millionaires as Democrats have proposed.   </p><p>  Reports about a looming credit outlook downgrade for European  government bonds took the steam out of U.S. stocks during the session.   Here is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"  We did give up some of the earlier gains  we saw this morning, but the major indices still ended in the green on this  first Monday in December.  Right from the opening bell here, we saw some  really follow-through buying interest from the big rally last week, but  right around 2:00 p.m.  Eastern, just after we hit the intra-day high, when  the first reports hit about S&amp;P threatening to downgrade the credit ratings  of Europe, the index began to take its first hit and then we saw a second  hit as more reports came in indicating a ratings cut could come after the  close.  Of course it was the ratings outlook that was cut.  The index still  was able to finish up off its lows with about a 1 percent gain.  </p><p>  Oddly enough, big banks were not hurt by the threat of a European  government debt downgrade.   This exchange-traded fund is made up of big  U.S. banks and today ending with a 2 percent rally.  This fund is at its  highest close in a month.   Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ: NBXH) (NYSE: MS) was  higher by 7 percent during the trading session.  Citigroup (NYSE: C)  finishing up by almost 6 percent.   JPMorgan's 3.6 percent rally was the  best among Dow Jones Industrial components.   The financial sector did lead  the way for the overall market, up by better than 2 percent.   </p><p>  Technology and energy sectors meantime ended with over 1 percent gains  each.   Among the financial fuel for the financial sector, insurer Metlife,  up more than 3.5 percent, nice rally here.   Metlife's fourth quarter  outlook was disappointing, but it predicted earnings to grow as much as 7  percent next year, driven by two ideals, retirement products in the U.S. as  well as its international business.   </p><p>  The tech sector overall was helped out by a Monday merger in the cloud  computing space.   Germany business software giant SAP is spending $3.4  billion in cash to buy Success Factors.  That's based in California.  This  is just the latest deal of a big tech firm picking up a smaller company  concentrated in cloud computing.  That's on-demand computing services.    The deal sends SAP stock down 2 about percent.  Success Factors leapt 51  percent.   Shares closing just $0.25 shy of its buyout price of $40 per  share.   </p><p>  Other names in cloud computing software also shot up.   Taleo (NASDAQ:  TLEO) concentrates on job performance and compensation software.   It  jumped 20 percent.   Kenexa (NASDAQ: KNXA) also focuses on employment  recruitment and retraining software.   Shares there jumping 16 percent.    And business commerce software firm Ariba (NASDAQ: ARBA) rallied 14 percent  at the bell.   Technology and commerce giant eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw bids  for its share price rise today.   Thanks to today's 3.7 percent rally on  the price, shares are at this highest price since mid-November now.   An  analyst at Raymond James upgraded the stock to a \"strong buy,\" pointing to  strong holiday sales.   While eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) of course is known for  its auctions, it has been putting greater emphasis on fixed-price deals.   </p><p>  Some of those deals may get shipped via FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and its  stock gained over just 1 percent today, continuing to trend near this  multi-week high. It announced an increase in shipping rates beginning in  January.   We're in a six-week high for FDX.   </p><p>  In commodities meantime, coffee and sugar rallied, how about that for  a pair.   Traders point to a weaker U.S. dollar and worries about the South  American coffee crop for helping push coffee prices up 3 percent.   Strong  global demand meantime helped supported sugar buying up almost 3 percent.    And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>  GHARIB:   Federal regulators approved tougher rules for risk taking on  Wall Street today, adopting the MF Global rule.  It's named after the  collapsed brokerage firm that's believed to have improperly used hundreds  of millions of dollars of customer money.   The new rules limit how much  the brokerage industry can invest in client funds and stops firms from  using customer money to buy foreign sovereign debt.   Separately today, two  former MF Global employees filed a class-action lawsuit against Jon  Corzine, the firm's former CEO and other senior executives.   The suit says  they lied to employees about the firm's financial condition.   </p><p>  Let's take a look now at what we're watching for you for tomorrow:    quarterly results from retailers Pep Boys and Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW),  along with luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL).   Also tomorrow,  it's the largest youth football and cheerleader program in the world.    \"Beyond the Scoreboard\" looks at how Pop Warner has weathered a weak  economy and how it's stayed in business for more than 80 years.   </p><p>  You may see fewer cars at the mall this weekend.  More than a third of  U.S. shoppers are already done with most of their holiday shopping,  according to a new survey.   Another 28 percent of people surveyed say they  plan to take a break from spending now that black Friday is behind them.    About four in 10 shoppers plan to finish checking off their holiday lists  at discount chains, highlighting that many Americans are trying to remain  frugal.   </p><p>  HUDSON:   Were bond holders misled about the Miami Marlins finances  while being encouraged to buy bonds to build a new baseball stadium?   This  is exactly what Federal investigators want to know.   Miami, its  surrounding county and the team are financing the stadium, with the city  and county covering most of the $645 million cost of building the new  stadium and parking lots.   They issued $500 million in bonds to help the  effort.   The stadium opens next spring.   The team says it's cooperating  with the investigation, but did not comment further.   </p><p>  GHARIB:  For the first time in 40 years, the United States Postal  Service is pushing to slow down delivery time.   The Postal Service  announced today it plans to close nearly half its mail processing centers  to counter falling revenues.  That would make it nearly impossible for next  day delivery of first class mail.  Sylvia Hall takes a look at the proposal  and its possible impact on shipping.   </p><p>  SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   When you drop a  letter in the mailbox, the Postal Service expects to deliver it in one to  three days.   But the service now hopes to relax that standard to two to  three days instead.   </p><p>  DAVE WILLIAMS, USPS: Our network is too big.   We've got more capacity  in our network than we can afford.   We can't afford it today.  We've got  to make adjustments today.   </p><p>  HALL:  The cut in service standards would result from Postal Service  plans to close half of its 487 mail processing centers across the country.    Dave Williams runs network operations for the post office.   He says last  year the Postal Service delivered about 73 billion pieces of first-class  mail.   That's almost a 30 percent drop from its peak mail volume of over  100 billion pieces of first-class mail hit back in 2001.   And by the year  2020, he thinks the Postal Service will have lost almost half of its first- class mail volume.   </p><p>  PATRICK DONAHOE, POSTMASTER GENERAL: The economy has really been tough  on us the last couple of years, but the other more long-term issue is  people pay bills online.   Theoretically, if you looked at us as a regular  business, we would be close to bankrupt now.   We've used $15 billion of  borrowing and we have a negative income statement this year.   </p><p>  HALL: The Postal Service wants the public's thoughts on the change,  offering up a two-month comment period.   While the change would not affect  express or priority mail, it could save $2 billion a year.   But analysts  say the savings carry a price of their own.   </p><p>  JIM CORRIDORE, EQUITY ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S:  Certainly,  customers are not going to appreciate it and it's never a good idea in a  business model to make customer service worse.   It doesn't generally lead  to more revenue.   </p><p>  HALL:   Equity analyst Jim Corridore says that could mean a minor  boost for private carriers like UPS and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) as customers opt  for high-speed delivery.   </p><p>  CORRIDORE:  The carriers at Fedex and UPS have already seen their  shares shift from online sales, from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), from holiday  shipping -- they're already very much getting a lot of that traffic  diverted to them.   So they're only going to see more of that over time and  the U.S. Postal Service is not able to capture that because they can't move  as fast as companies like FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS.</p><p>  HALL:  Regulators will have three months to review the changes, which  means the earliest customers would see a difference in delivery times would  be spring.

My interview with Duncan Neiderauer coming up.</p><p>KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas.</p><p>GHARIB: And I`m Susie Gharib. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, April 9.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. Oil prices surged to a new record today, topping $112 a barrel for the first time. By the close of trading in New York, May crude futures settled at $110.87 a barrel, up $2.37. In intra- day trading, crude futures traded as high as $112.16. The spike followed a government report showing oil and gasoline supplies were lower than expected last week. Oil analyst Eitan Bernstein of Friedman, Billings Ramsey says despite recent volatility, these record prices won`t last.</p><p>EITAN BERNSTEIN, VP ENERGY RESEARCH, FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, RAMSEY &amp; CO.: What you`ve got crude oil prices rallying is fear of the unknown, supply concerns, China, OPEC demand growth. But we have some very real bearish headlines on U.S. economic growth, U.S. demand growth. And to the extent that that starts catching up with the fundamentals and ultimately with the traders, that could pull back on prices.</p><p>GHARIB: Bernstein predicts in the near term that oil prices will pull back to around $95 a barrel.</p><p>KANGAS: It was first expected to fly last August, now Boeing says the 787 Dreamliner won`t get off the ground until the end of this year. Deliveries won`t start until the second half of 2009. Still as Scott Gurvey explains, the delays are not unusual for a new aircraft design.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It is the third time in the last six months that Boeing has revised the delivery schedule for its new 787 Dreamliner. Boeing now expects to deliver the first 787 in the third quarter of next year, instead of the first quarter. It also expects to ship 25 planes, down from the 109 previously planned. Boeing isn`t alone in setbacks. Manufacturing problems also delayed delivery of the most recent Airbus model, the 380 and are common in the industry. Analyst Brian Nelson of Morningstar says this latest schedule may not be the last for the Dreamliner.</p><p>BRIAN NELSON, EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: At this point, because Boeing has yet to power on the aircraft which means it has yet to perform basic, integrated functional testing of the aircraft and because Boeing has yet to perform the flight tests necessary to gain certification, I think it is impossible to be completely certain that this delivery schedule is going to be the last, the one that Boeing delivers upon.</p><p>GURVEY: The holding pattern was caused primarily by problems with Boeing`s worldwide supply chain. The company outsourced a record amount of the production and some of those suppliers haven`t met deadlines. Boeing must also redesign part of the plane`s mid section to make it stronger. But Boeing shares actually gained on today`s news because the delays in the schedule were no worse than industry analysts had predicted. The company also maintained its profit guidance. As Standard &amp; Poor`s analyst Richard Tortoriello notes, the Dreamliner is just one part of Boeing`s vast revenue stream.</p><p>RICHARD TORTORIELLO, EQUITY ANALYST, STANDARD AND POOR`S: Fifty percent of its business is military. And I see that kind of as a steady, slow growth, high cash flow business and that is going to continue. Boeing also has a big commercial aerospace business, including the Boeing 737, the 777 and other planes that are not at all related to the 787. And there`s been big demand for those other planes as well.</p><p>GURVEY: Boeing will incur additional research and development costs on the Dreamliner because of the design changes and also customer penalty costs because of the missed delivery dates. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>KANGAS: Stocks on Wall Street opened narrowly mixed but then headed broadly lower as investors viewed last night`s earnings warning from UPS as a sign of things to come from corporate America`s first quarter results. In a steady downturn, the Dow posted a 91-point loss by 1:00 p.m., with the NASDAQ Composite off 30 points. That surge in oil futures to new record highs kept the market on the defensive as the Dow fell as much as 100 points by by around 3:00 p.m. But some late buying trimmed the losses at the final bell. The Dow Industrial Average closed down 49.18 at 12,527.26. The NASDAQ lost 26.64 ending at 2322.12. Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 Index fell 11.05 to 1354.49. In the bond market, the 10-year note gained 22/32 to par and 5/32, putting the yield at 3.48 percent.</p><p>GHARIB: The New York Stock Exchange just marked the one year anniversary of its big merger with France`s Euronext, creating the first transatlantic stock exchange. So how`s the integration going so far? I asked CEO Duncan Neiderauer, who succeeded John Thain as the big board`s boss four months ago.</p><p>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, CEO, NYSE EURONEXT: We`re about I`d say a little further along than we thought we would be in some areas and not as far along as we thought we`d be in other areas. We`re learning as we go. I said when I took John`s place, I thought that as we looked forward, I thought it was more important to focus on integration rather than maybe worrying about the next deal, because these are always more work than you think they are.</p><p>GHARIB: Duncan, how do you plan to deal with the intense competition, not only from the NASDAQ but so many start-up exchanges in the U.S. and Europe?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: We need to get closer to the customers, roll out the functionality they`re looking for, try to remind ourselves that even though the liquidity is fragmented, we can still be a very, very meaningful player in some of the markets where before are we going to have market share that we had three or four years ago? No. But there is a lot of other new areas where we can get a lot better.</p><p>GHARIB: As you know, the momentum is towards electronic trading. I know this is a touchy subject here at the exchange, but don`t you have to accelerate that move into electronic trading just to stay competitive?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: We have embraced technology here. I think people think because we still have a floor we`re somehow resistant to the changes. We know that`s where the market is going. We just don`t think all electronic all the time is the right answer. And we think the markets over the past few months have proven that, that if you`re all electronic all the time and there`s no opportunity for price discovery, all that does is maximize volatility at the time when you least want that volatility.</p><p>GHARIB: Duncan, NYSE Euronext stock is down something like 30 percent since you took over as CEO four months ago. What is it going to take to get it to move higher?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: I think what we need to do is put up two or three quarters of good results while you`re having all this volatility in financial services and you`re seeing a lot of those stocks trade down quite a bit. If we put up two or three good quarters in a row to show that we`re not attached to those securities, we shouldn`t be correlated to those securities. That`s step one. Step two is in addition to performing, reminding everybody that the business model really is quite different. It`s a very different business model. We don`t have the leverage that those companies have. It`s a much cleaner balance sheet. We may not have the opportunity to make the kind of money they make in the good times, but we`re a much safer bet in more volatile times, as well.</p><p>GHARIB: We have been seeing so much volatility, how is that impacting your earnings?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: Quite favorably because remember, volatility usually leads to higher volumes. Some would argue that`s not sustainable because if there is a protracted bear market in the U.S., they look back at the other bear markets in history and say, look what happens to volume in a protracted bear market. It goes down precipitously. What`s very different about today is the demographics of order flow have changed a lot. A lot of today`s market participants were not around five, 10, 15 years ago when they`re looking at the previous downturns. They are huge providers of volume on a daily basis, who I don`t think really care whether it`s a bull market or a bear market because they`re short-term investors.</p><p>GHARIB: Looking at the regulatory reform plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Paulson, how would, if that reform were to go through, how would that impact the NYSE?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: Our view is almost any change that would happen there to make it more fluid would be good for us because we`re the only exchange in this country with a 75-year-old rule book. It`s harder for us to be nimble because we live under a set of guidelines that were outlined many, many years ago and each time we want to be flexible or change something, we`ve got to go back to the rule book and work closely with the SEC and try to figure out how to do that. That`s hard to do. So I think any change for us would be viewed as a positive and our ability to compete would be enhanced.</p><p>GHARIB: I know you talked to a lot of CEOs and market leaders. Do you get the sense that the worst of this financial crisis is over?</p><p>NIEDERAUER: The general sense is one of cautious optimism. I think CEOs outside of the financial services industry still feel quite good. Whether that`s unfounded optimism remains to be seen, but remember, what`s really changed in this country in the last 10 or 20 years and I hear it every day from the CEOs who walk through the door here, is many of their businesses are much more global. Their customer bases are much more global. So they`re not completely immunized against the U.S. recession, if we are in fact in one, but they`re much less exposed to a U.S. recession than they would have been 10 or 20 years ago as their businesses have diversified.</p><p>GHARIB: Duncan, thank you for your time, so nice seeing you.</p><p>NIEDERAUER: Thank you very much.</p><p>KANGAS: The White House and Congress are moving closer to working together to address the housing crisis. The Bush administration expanded what`s called the FHA secure program today to help more borrowers refinance troubled mortgages. As Stephanie Dhue reports, it came as the House Financial Services Committee considered more sweeping legislation to expand the FHA role.</p><p>STEPHANIE DHUE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Chairman Barney Frank calls today`s expansion of the administration`s FHA secure program a remarkable coincidence, coming on the day of a hearing on his plan to grow the housing agency.</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: We have a substantial amount of agreement now and those who think that we should do nothing that could theoretically or even actually expose taxpayers to more risk, they will have to deal with me and the Bush administration together. And we will work this out.</p><p>DHUE: For homeowners upside down on their mortgages, both the administration and Frank`s plan would require lenders to voluntarily write down a portion of the loan amount. The administration`s plan is more modest. It uses an increase in FHA insurance premiums to pay for half a million refinancings. Frank`s plan would have the FHA guarantee some two million refinancings with $20 billion of taxpayer money. But Frank`s plan came under fire from many Republicans. Congressman Spencer Bachus says it will keep home prices from declining to a more affordable level.</p><p>REP. SPENCER BACHUS, (R) ALABAMA: This process of market correction, while undeniably painful is a necessary and unavoidable reality, government intervention to impede the return to the long term trend line no matter how well intentioned is likely to do more harm than good.</p><p>DHUE: But Frank`s plan did get some support from regulators. Office of Thrift Supervision Director John Reich says the situation is serious enough to warrant creative solutions.</p><p>JOHN REICH, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION: While we do not think that using FHA as a financing vehicle to prevent foreclosures will be the silver bullet to stop the housing slide, we do think that it`s an important additional tool that lenders can use to stem the rise in foreclosures.</p><p>DHUE: It`s unclear if even both plans would be enough to prevent a mass wave of foreclosures. Both require lenders to voluntarily take losses on troubled loans, something so far they`ve been reluctant to do. Stephanie Dhue, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Shares of American Airlines fell 11 percent today after it canceled more than 1,000 flights today. That`s nearly half of its total daily schedule as it worked to complete inspections of its md-80 jets. Those md-80s usually fly between 1,000 and 1,200 flights a day. Yesterday, American canceled about 500 flights nationwide for the same reason. The massive cancellations left tens of thousands of customers stranded. American expects operations will return to normal by Saturday. The airline is working to accommodate passengers on other flights, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Susie, American shares fell $1.15, closing at $9.17. Now, let`s take a look at some other stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Most active big board issue on 20.8 million shares, Citigroup (C) down $0.18. The company reportedly close to selling $12 billion in leveraged loans and bonds to a private equity group.</p><p>Washington Mutual (WM) dropped $0.36.</p><p>Ford Motor (F) $0.19 loss.</p><p>General Electric (GE) $0.51 loss.</p><p>And then SprintNextel (S) down $0.11, not a gainer in that group.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) was off $0.11. The company`s inhalable insulin drug Exubera may be linked to causing lung cancer according to Pfizer. Its partner Nectar (ph) saw its stock plummet $1.80, down to $5.39 a share on that news.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) after a couple of days of losses, up $0.23.</p><p>Bank of America (BAC) a $0.45 drop.</p><p>Wells Fargo (WFC) off $0.48.</p><p>And then Lehman Brothers (LEH) down $3.13. We`ll have more on that in just a moment.</p><p>Boeing (BA) itself up $3.58 despite the delay in the 787 Dreamliner as you heard, but the company did reaffirm its 2008 earnings guidance and that would help the stock.</p><p>Helping this stock, Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) up nearly $3 was Boeing. A revision in a supply pact with Boeing will result in additional cash advance payments to Spirit Aerosystems.</p><p>Proctor and Gamble (PG) a $0.44 loss, even though it`s boosting its quarterly dividend 14 percent from $0.35 to $0.40 a share, but Goldman Sachs still downgraded the stock from \"buy\" to \"neutral.\"</p><p>And Goldman Sachs also downgraded Kimberly Clark (KMB) but in this case from \"neutral\" to a \"sell.\" The stock off $1.29.</p><p>Apache Corp (APA), obviously the oils were strong today on those record high prices, up $3.89 there. Also the company had positive test results in three drilling operations in British Columbia. UBS financial boosted Apache`s price target from $138 to $146 a share.</p><p>Some of the other stocks in the oil patch did well today, Hess Corp (HES), Occidental (OXY) and Sunoco (SUN) all posting decent gains.</p><p>The airline stocks in the other hand, down on those record oil prices, Continental Airlines (CAL), Delta Airlines (DAL), UAL Corp (UAUA) and US Airways (LCC) all in the minus column.</p><p>Goldman Sachs (GS) itself off $4.76. The company disclosed it has received government requests for information regarding the auction rate security market which has been frozen for the most part and the complaint of many clients of a lot of brokerages. Let`s have a look at some of those stocks. Once again we see Lehman (LEH) dropped $3.13 as you saw and Morgan Stanley (MS) down $1.25.</p><p>Speaking of Morgan Stanley MSCI Inc (MXB) down $2.81. Morgan Stanley owns 81 percent and this company plans to sell 28 million shares. First quarter earnings for MSCI only $0.18, down from $0.26 last year.</p><p>Graftech Intl (GTI) up $1.34. Oppenheimer upgraded it from \"market perform\" to \"out perform.\"</p><p>And then Ternium SA (TX) down $4.01 on reports that Venezuela is going to nationalize Sidor, which is a steel company that Ternium has a big stake in.</p><p>NASDAQ`s most active, Apple (AAPL) down $1.40.</p><p>Google (GOOG) losing $3.62. The company and Yahoo! are testing Google`s (INAUDIBLE) tool which would give the two companies 90 percent of the search ad market. The combination could foil Microsoft`s bid for Yahoo! Late today, Microsoft said any agreement between Google and Yahoo! would make the search market less competitive.</p><p>Research in Motion (RIMM) down $2.82.</p><p>Baidu.com (BIDU) dropped $7.14.</p><p>And then Dell (DELL) in there with a $0.31 loss.</p><p>Cisco Systems (CSCO) down $0.43 bucking the trend.</p><p>Intel Corp (INTC) a $0.34 gain.</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) itself up $0.14.</p><p>First Solar (FSLR) down $2.12.</p><p>And then Yahoo! (YHOO) with a $0.07 gain.</p><p>And finally shares in EP Medsystems (EPMD) rose $1.45 on news the company will be acquired by St. Jude Medical for cash and stock worth $3 a share.</p><p>My \"Street Critique\" guest tonight specializes in growth and technology stocks and says when it comes to investing in this crazy environment, it`s best to weigh things on a stock by stock basis. He`s Toan Tran, equity strategist at Morningstar and author of Morningstar`s growth investor newsletter. And Toan, welcome to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>TOAN TRAN, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MORNINGSTAR: Thank you, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: Tech stocks took a drubbing in the first quarter, as we know, with the NASDAQ Index down over 14 percent. And with that in mind, is it time to look at techs again or are you still kind of sitting on the sidelines here?</p><p>TRAN: Like you said, Paul, the NASDAQ had a tough time in the first quarter. But with bad news in the headlines, I think it`s time for investors to start maybe taking a look at high-quality technology companies and start putting some on the radar screen.</p><p>KANGAS: Many of the big tech firms are really catering to the consumer and consumer spending is not looking very hot right now. So where do you see spending headed and improved (ph)?</p><p>TRAN: I think I`m not very optimistic about consumer spending in the United States. The U.S. consumer is way over burdened with debt. But that won`t always be the case. So if you`re willing to take a long-term view of things, there are some good values today.</p><p>KANGAS: All right. Let`s get specific. I understand you like Apple (AAPL), but not at the current price.</p><p>TRAN: Yeah. I think Apple is a great company run by a great management team. It got cheap about maybe a month or two ago. I think at $120 per share investors should start building positions. And Apple of course is exposed to the U.S. consumer so I think investors will get a shot at it.</p><p>KANGAS: OK. Your second choice is another big name tech stock. Let`s have a look at that and we see none other than Intel (INTC).</p><p>TRAN: Yeah. Intel is definitely I think should be a core tech holding for any investor. If the shares were to get a little bit cheaper, I think investors again should start building position. Intel is diversifying away from its core PC business into chips for mobile devices and that could potentially be a very big business for them a few years down the road.</p><p>KANGAS: So you like INTC on the NASDAQ right.</p><p>TRAN: That`s correct.</p><p>KANGAS: OK. Now your last choice is small cap play. Give me the name and symbol on that one.</p><p>TRAN: Sure. This is definitely a very small cap play. The company is called Isilon Systems and the ticker is ISLN. And what Isilon does is it provides storage hardware for things like digital video and digit music, all the things that everyone is producing more of every day. The company became public in late 2007 and it had just a horrid 2007 with a management change and an accounting restatement. But the company`s put things behind it and has a great growth opportunity ahead of it. And the shares are exceptionally cheap right now.</p><p>KANGAS: OK, very interesting indeed, Isilon. I`ll have to remember that one. Toan, do you own any of the stocks personally or have any other disclosure to make?</p><p>TRAN: Yes I own both Apple and Isilon personally.</p><p>KANGAS: Very good. I want to thank you very much for being with us and we appreciate your views.</p><p>TRAN: Thank you, Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: My guest, Toan Tran, equity strategist at Morningstar.</p><p>GHARIB: Tomorrow, the doctor is in at the office. We look at corporate efforts to keep you healthy on the job.</p><p>Toyota is recalling more than half a million Corolla and Matrix models sold in the U.S. because of a problem with the windows. The recall affects 2003 and 2004 vehicles with power windows. Manual windows are not affected. Toyota plans to notify car owners later this month. This latest recall may add to speculation that Toyota is struggling with quality- control issues as it grows.</p><p>KANGAS: The Treasury Department says the number of financial restatements by U.S. public companies skyrocketed between 1997 and 2006. The increase started before the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate law reforms were passed in 2002. Most restatements come from smaller companies not listed on major exchanges. Restatements due to fraud have dropped, down to just 2 percent in 2006, from 29 percent in 1997.</p><p>GHARIB: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks at the University of Richmond on stability in global finance. Also tomorrow, March chain store sales and weekly jobless claims are released.</p><p>Well, the tax season is in the home stretch. There are just six days left to get your Federal income tax return in the mail. So all this week we have helpful hints on getting the paperwork done. In tonight`s tax tips, Kevin McCormally of \"Kiplinger`s Personal Finance\" tackles write-offs for non-itemizers.</p><p>KEVIN MCCORMALLY, EDITORIAL DIR., KIPLINGER`S PERSONAL FINANCE: Here`s a tax riddle: who gets the better deal, taxpayers who claim the standard deduction or those who itemize? At first blush, itemizers appear to be in the cat bird seat. After all, they get to cut their tax bills by deducting their mortgage interest and state income and property taxes, medical expenses and charitable gifts, even interest on home equity loans used to pay for vacations and new cars.</p><p>But truth be told, it`s the 90 million Americans who claim the standard deduction - that`s about two-thirds of all taxpayers -- who get the better deal. Remember, you use the standard deduction only when it saves you more money than itemizing would. On 2007 returns, married couples can deduct $10.700, no matter how little they actually spent on deductible items. Singles get a $5,350 standard deduction, no questions asked, no paperwork involved. And remember, there`s a long list of write- offs open even to those who claim the standard deduction. There`s the $250 deduction for teachers and the $4,000 write off for college tuition. Non- itemizers can deduct job-related moving expenses, interest paid on student loans and alimony.</p><p>Self-employeds can deduct the cost of their health insurance. Contributions to traditional IRAs and HSAs can be written off of course, and members of the National Guard who travel more than 100 miles to overnight meetings can deduct their travel expenses. Last year, taxpayers claimed about $100 billion worth of these so-called adjustments to income and a big share of the tax savings went to folks who claimed the standard deduction. I`m Kevin McCormally.</p><p>KANGAS: You can submit your tax questions to Kevin McCormally and learn more about the stories in tonight`s broadcast on our web site.

New products drive strong earnings at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and amazon.com, but the stocks drop on the news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: While this doesn`t look like a farm, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is plowing over $1 billion into server farm Terremark. You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 27.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Good evening and thanks for joining us tonight, the tech sector squarely in focus after the close Susie. From earnings at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and amazon.com to Verizon`s big deal for computer server farm Terremark worldwide, we`ve really got the tech active in after hours trading tonight.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, it sure was. Let`s start off with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), a double surprise from the software giant tonight -- better than expected quarterly earnings and the numbers were released earlier than expected. The report was supposed to come out after the closing bell, but was accidentally released on the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) web site 15 minutes early. Here are the numbers. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) earned $0.77 a share in its fiscal second quarter. That was $0.09 more than estimates. Revenues also came in better than expected -- about $20 billion. The company credited the sales boost to business customers upgrading their computers and the debut of its Kinect controller for the X-box 360.</p><p>HUDSON: Susie, amazon.com also turned in quarterly results after the close tonight. It as well beat estimates this time by $0.03 per share. The sale of electronic books for its Kindle reader outpaced sales of old school paperback books. But expenses last quarter increased, thanks to marketing for the Kindle over the holidays as well as investments in its distribution systems. The stocks of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon were both down after these reports. But shares of Terremark were awfully strong in after hours trading, surging as much as 35 percent. Here`s why. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) offering almost $1.5 billion for the computer server farm, $19 per share is the offer. The deal is part of Verizon`s push into cloud computing. We`re going to have more on all this coming in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Also today, big earnings from big CAT. Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) It posted a quarterly profit that quadrupled from a year ago. The world`s largest maker of construction and mining equipment earned $1.47 a share in the fourth quarter of last year. That`s $0.20 more than estimates. Revenues also came in a billion dollars more than expected, up 62 percent to almost $13 billion. Looking ahead, the company expects annual revenues to top $50 billion this year, bringing Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) back to pre-recession levels. So when I talked with CEO Doug Oberhelman today, I asked him where is all that growth going to come from?</p><p>DOUG OBERHELMAN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CATTERPILLAR: We`re seeing growth in sales and revenue just about across the globe. And most industries with the exception of our turbine business and large reciprocating engines which we think are coming but they`ll be coming, the growth will be coming later. So geographically and industry and product wise, it`s sort of a nice ramp all across the spectrum in 2011.</p><p>GHARIB: Mr. Oberhelman, how about in the U.S.? How strong is the recovery going to be for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) equipment?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: Well, the U.S. certainly has been slow coming out of the recession. There is no doubt we`re one of the last economies to the party. It is coming, however. And I`ve just been with groups of dealers and customers the last couple of weeks. They are a lot more optimistic today than they were a year ago. Now these are not big number increases, of course from very depressed levels in the last couple of years, but the anecdotes, the order level, the activity is definitely improving. We put out our December retail activity which showed a big increase in the United States and North America. So it`s coming, but slowly and frustratingly slow, I would say.</p><p>GHARIB: As you heard, President Obama in the state of the union address the other night is calling for more spending on our infrastructure, building a high speed rail system. Do you see that really happening and how would that translate into business for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: Well, you`ve got two great questions there. I will take the second one first. If we see more infrastructure spending and when that money actually hits the ground, it will help us. But remember, infrastructure spending that starts today is months if not a year or two before it hits the ground. Secondly, we are watching a very I would say conservative fiscal level of spending around the U.S. not only at the Federal level and the states. And that`s a concern to us because on the one hand, the U.S. has to get its house in order as do most states. On the other hand we need to stimulate the economy, get people back to work so it is a real balance to achieve.</p><p>GHARIB: Now you always talk about a lot of growth in the emerging markets. How important is China for your growth plan?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: 1.4 billion people modernizing is a good thing for this planet, people coming out of poverty, moving up into the middle class. That`s good for all of us. We in America need those export jobs. In fact, we exported about $13.5 billion from the U.S. in 2010. That`s up almost a third from 2009. Sixty eight percent of our sales or so in 2010 were outside. So those external markets are important for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and for our workers.</p><p>GHARIB: All right so, when China talks about slowing down its economy, what kind of impact would that have on Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT)?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: Well, they have talked about this and executed pretty well over the years ups and downs, growth and then slowdowns. They probably need to break their economy a little bit. I don`t see how they can grow at double digit GDP growth rates forever. Having said that, a slowdown to 6, 7 8 percent is probably healthy. It doesn`t impact us all that much, but it is something they`ve got to keep their eye on, they`ve got to work hard at.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk a little bit about jobs, because Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) actually has been rehiring over the past year and now with all the pickup in business that you are talking about, how many more people do you plan to hire in 2011?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: With a forecast going over $50 billion in 2011 we`re going to need more help to increase our production and do more of the things we`ve got to do. We`re to the going to put a number out. We don`t really have a forecast, but I`m confident as sales grow and we need more production, we will have more people working here a year from now than we do today.</p><p>GHARIB: That some good news for a lot of out of work Americans.</p><p>OBERHELMAN: It is.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk about Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) stock. It was the best performing Dow stock last year and it is almost quadrupled since March of 2009. So where does the stock go from here?</p><p>OBERHELMAN: We`re focusing on earnings. We`re focusing on quality of our business, growing market share, expanding geographically, spending capital, position us for the future. As long as earnings increase, our stock price will go along with it. But I will not make a prediction on that one.</p><p>GHARIB: Fair enough Mr. Oberhelman thank you so much for your time. Nice talking with you.</p><p>OBERHELMAN: You bet. Thank you.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s take a look at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel. We`ve got stocks rising slightly ahead of all the tech news after the close. The Dow gained four points, the NASDAQ up 15, the S&amp;P 500 added nearly three. Big board trading volume dipped below a billion shares, while NASDAQ volume held firmly above two billion shares. New claims for jobless benefits rose by 51,000 in the past week to 454,000. Economists think bad winter weather is to blame. They see the trend reversing next week. Durable goods orders meantime tumbled in December, falling 2.5 percent. That was a surprise, because an increase in big ticket, long-lasting items was expected.</p><p>And Standard &amp; Poor`s downgraded Japan`s debt rating. The ratings agency says the world`s third largest economy is struggling under a huge debt load. Japan`s debt is more than double its GDP. Tomorrow on the program, still ahead rather tonight, stay with us. With gold prices down sharply since the start of the year, is gold losing its luster?</p><p>GHARIB: Wondering what caused the financial crisis? Well, now we know, maybe. The panel investigating the meltdown has finally released its report. And after months of digging, there`s still disagreement. Six Democrats on the panel say the regulatory system broke down, starting at the Federal Reserve. Financial firms bet too much, households borrowed too much and some players totally ignored ethics. But Republicans on the panel say there were actually 10 causes. Among them, worldwide credit and housing bubbles, too many toxic mortgages and credit rating agencies that didn`t do their jobs. Commission Chairman Phil Angelides says the bottom line is that the financial crisis didn`t have to happen.</p><p>PHIL ANGELIDES, CHMN., FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY COMMISSION: The captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings and importantly failed to question, to understand and to manage the evolving risks in a financial system that is so essential to the well being of our country. Theirs was a big miss, not a stumble.</p><p>GHARIB: The commission has posted hundreds of documents online. In one, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says only one of the country`s big financial firms was on solid footing during the crisis. But he doesn`t say which one.</p><p>So Tom, 12,000 on the Dow, 1300 on the S&amp;P during trading hours but didn`t close there. Psychologists who study investor behavior say that there is some worries about round numbers whence it comes to these milestones so didn`t happen today. Maybe it`s tomorrow or next week.</p><p>HUDSON: Maybe, lots of after hours news though that we mentioned at the top of the program could put a bit of a bid into the market by tomorrow. We`ll have to wait and see. But clearly those big round numbers are going to remain in focus here Susie. Speaking of, let`s get to tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" Overall ahead of all that tech news after the close, we saw another day of slim gains, but any gains at these levels mean the major indices do hit new post-recession highs. Some of that though may be interrupted tomorrow, if the after hours trading is any action (sic). We will mention Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) here as we roll it out. We talked about the earnings at the top of the program. Here`s the last year of MSFT trading. The 52-week high was back in the springtime. Shares falling during the regular session after the close down about 1 percent. This high here tonight, this is the highest level since May for MSFT.</p><p>Meantime, amazon.com, it came in to tonight`s report really with some optimism, a nice 5 percent rally. Just last week, this was a new all-time high for AMZN. Revenues though in the fourth quarter were a bit less than anticipated. Shares fell as much as 10 percent below these numbers down below $170 per share after the close, one to watch tomorrow.</p><p>Another one in technology was computer data storage firm Sandisk also had some optimistic buying interest ahead of its quarterly results. Shares have had a nice 70 percent rally here over the last 12 months. After the close, the stock down as much as 3 percent, but did have a bit of a rebound from that level so it clearly another one to watch in technology tomorrow.</p><p>Now the tech deal we mentioned earlier, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) buying tech data center firm Terremark. Ahead of that news, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) saw small gains, while Terremark was up 2.5 percent. Remember this was before the news hit the tape. After the deal announcement, Terremark jumped over its buyout price of $19 per share.</p><p>In addition to the technology news after the close, a quartet of semiconductor-related stocks really saw some buying interest off of their earnings today. Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) jumping 19 percent. Earnings there almost doubled. Teradyne (NYSE: TER) jumped 12 percent. It makes semiconductor testing equipment. Earnings at Teradyne (NYSE: TER) more than tripled in the past quarter. Integrated Silicon added 10 percent. LSI Logic (NYSE: LSI), another chip maker, lost money last quarter, but did see revenue growth and the share price reflected some optimism.</p><p>Over on the broad market, consumer stocks really held back the overall market during the regular session. Sara Lee (NYSE: SLE) here, we see it fell another 5 percent. This high was set earlier this week. It has clearly moved well off of that level. The company had been looking for a buyer to offer $19 per share, has found one, according to \"the Wall Street Journal.\" It now likely will separate its coffee and meat businesses. Share price continuing to take a bit of a dive here.</p><p>Colgate Palmolive meantime sliding 3 percent. This is the last 180 sessions on the screen, clearly a bit of volatility over the past six months or so. This is a six week low tonight. Earnings were OK. Revenue though a bit disappointing. The company warns of building pressure from high commodity prices. This may be a trend because the same issue is in play at P&amp;G. Procter and Gamble`s latest quarter $0.03 better than estimates, but down from a year ago. Higher commodity costs clearly in play at P&amp;G. It was the leading loser of the Dow Jones Industrial Average today thanks to the 3 percent drop we saw. Through the week, share price had been rallying, in fact hitting a nice new 52-week high just a couple of sessions ago, ahead of this latest quarterly result.</p><p>The other sizable loser in the Dow AT&amp;T (NYSE: T), down 2 percent. We`re taking just a look at the last 30 sessions here at AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) and what`s interesting is we`ve got the most recent low. This was the same day that Verizon (NYSE: VZ) announced it would start selling the iPhone, breaking AT&amp;T`s exclusivity. Earnings at AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) a penny over forecast, but new customer growth slowed and that cost the share price.</p><p>Steel stocks have seen some volatility this week as they report higher earnings. Again, commodity costs, higher raw material costs one market worry. Nucor (NYSE: NUE) the latest to report. It lost money in the fourth quarter, thanks to high commodity costs. It and U.S. Steel dropped more than 2 percent. The world`s biggest steel maker, Acelor Mittal, fell as well today. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Gold has been a less-than-glittering investment lately. Investors leaving the largest exchange-traded gold fund have pushed prices to a three-month low. So far this month, gold has posted its biggest monthly loss in over a year. So is this a temporary pullback or is the metal losing its luster? Erika Miller reports.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Whether it`s a necklace or bracelet, gold will always be attractive as jewelry. But will it also be attractive as an investment? After nearly a decade of big gains, investors have been rushing out of gold this month. Ditto for the world`s biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund which saw record redemptions this week. Analyst Paul Christopher blames the rally in the stock market for luring investors away from safe havens like gold.</p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, SR. INT`L STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: You want to think about gold as an alternative currency, so that when there are better prospects in other financial assets other than gold, then gold would naturally tend to suffer.</p><p>MILLER: He thinks stocks will outperform gold long term, especially if the global economy continues to recover. But Barclays analyst Suki Cooper thinks the retreat in gold is only short-term profit taking.</p><p>SUKI COOPER, METALS ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: We expect gold prices to average a fresh annual record high of $1,495 per ounce. We expect prices to continue to build on their gains until the third quarter of 2011.</p><p>MILLER: She believes the factors behind gold`s rally the past few years are still firmly in place.</p><p>COOPER: If we are looking at the longer-term drivers in gold, they still very much remain intact. There`s the longer-term concerns such as currency debasement or concerns that inflation could spiral. Those factors are still their driving investment demand.</p><p>MILLER: Many gold analysts are watching to see if gold falls below the key technical level of $1,275 an ounce. If it does, expect a heavy wave of selling, particularly by options traders. Longer term, analysts say gold`s direction depends on interest rates and inflation.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: U.S. inflation right around the 1 percent to 2 percent area, while yields are rising, would be a sign that the economy is gaining more traction, while inflation is not. And that would really put a damper on prospects for gold going forward.</p><p>MILLER: If gold prices continue to fall, investment interest may wane. But the flip side is better deals on jewelry. And analysts say a pick up in consumer demand could help support prices. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Earlier in the program, Caterpillar`s CEO talked about the importance of the Chinese market. But it`s not just construction companies that are experiencing a boon there. The western part of the country is seeing a surge in new business and jobs, thanks to government incentives. Nick Mackie takes a look.</p><p>NICK MACKIE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Cranes dot the skyline, building homes, high-rise office blocks and high tech factories. It`s a far cry from five years ago, when all this was mainly farmland. Over the past 18 months, $3 billion of inward investment has flowed into Xiyong micro- electronics park, with key players including Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), Foxconn, Quanta, Inventec and Acer deciding to locate here. The park`s deputy director, Zhu Jiang, says Chongqing is now on track to be a global manufacturing base for notebooks and tablets.</p><p>TRANSLATION OF: ZHU JIANG, XIYONG MICRO-ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIAL PARK: By 2015, notebook production will reach 80 million units. Our exports will reach $80 million U.S. and 400,000 people will be employed in notebook manufacturing or related fields.</p><p>MACKIE: Companies are buying into Chongqing because they seek lower operational costs and to get closer to inland China`s huge maturing consumer base. The city recognized this early on and was quick to craft and finance its strategy to build a new industry from scratch. Labor and energy costs are 30 percent cheaper here than in China`s coastal region. But the downside for now, is that 90 percent of component makers are still over there, a thousand miles away. There are costly supply chain problems for parts coming in or goods bound for export . So the government offers incentives to compensate its early movers.</p><p>JIANG: Initially, the government provides subsidies to offset high logistics costs, to help the enterprises get over their early-stage difficulties. Once more and more companies locate here, there`ll be economies of scale and logistics costs should improve. Then, that`s when the government will step back.</p><p>MACKIE: As part of its strategy, the government first stepped forward in Xiyong five years ago by establishing a new university city, so that colleges and vocational schools could relocate from the main urban area. Chongqing`s college of electronic engineering, with 20,000 students, now supplies technicians and engineers for the tech-based industry. Its chief of enterprise cooperation, Mao Weiping, says companies work closely with the college and even provide machinery to ensure the right skill sets are developed.</p><p>TRANSLATION OF: MAO WEIPING, CHONGQING COLLEGE/ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING: Nearly half of our graduates go on to work for the micro-electronics park and its related industry. Also each year, we send about 2,000 to 3,000 students to the park`s companies for work-related experience.</p><p>MACKIE: While Chongqing`s labor pool is strong on low-skilled and mid- level workers, it`s weak, however, on retaining top flight engineers, who usually head for the established R&amp;D centers in Beijing and Shanghai. With the cost of living soaring in China`s premier cities, Chongqing believes more engineers will seek opportunities here, notably when the big tech players shift up a gear. Xiyong illustrates that, even in a once backwater, if the local government`s vision is global, the support strong and the execution fast, leading corporations are quick off the blocks to back Chinese-style state-controlled capitalism in order to grow in a competitive marketplace. Nick Mackie, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chongqing.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow: our \"Market Monitor\" scheduled to be Erik Ristuben, chief investment officer of client investment strategies at Russell Investments. Did the U.S. economy grow during the last three months of the year and how much? We`ll get a first look at fourth quarter GDP tomorrow. And Ford Motor expected to post its best yearly profit in more than a decade. We`ll ask CEO Alan Mulally what`s driving business.</p><p>GHARIB: Linked In could be the first of the big social networking companies to go public. The site aimed at connecting business professionals with other professionals filed with regulators today for an initial public offering. But Linked In did not say how much money it`s hoping to raise or when it will do the offering. Other social network firms are expected to follow in Linked In. Groupon and Facebook are set to go public over the next 18 months.</p><p>HUDSON: Shares of Bank United begin trading tomorrow at the New York Stock Exchange. Late today, they priced at $27 per share. That`s $2 more than the expected range. The bank raised $783 million. We`ll talk with CEO John Kanas, tomorrow. He himself invested $23 million in the bank when it was bought by private equity firms, including WL Ross, Blackstone and Carlyle Group back in 2009.</p><p>GHARIB: With high unemployment and a shaky outlook for housing, you`d think consumers would stay away from the stores and stop shopping altogether. But last month, shoppers were out in full force, ringing up the best holiday season in four years. Tonight`s commentator says there`s a good reason for it. He`s Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group.</p><p>BERNARD BAUMOHL, CHIEF GLOBAL ECON., ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROUP: The year 2010 left us with a tantalizing puzzle. We know the unemployment numbers were awful last year, the worst in 30 years. And yet, even with that dismal record, Americans were enthusiastic shoppers. Retail sales shot up by the most in more than a decade. You would think high joblessness would cool household spending, but it didn`t and one major reason may be that the U.S. has a thriving underground economy. By underground economy, I`m not talking about illicit activity, like selling stolen goods or drugs. It`s mostly legal work, where millions of unemployed find income by doing handyman work or selling stuff at flea markets or repairing computers.</p><p>Given the job-destroying recession we just had, it is believed a record number of cash-strapped Americans were driven into the shadowy underground. By some estimates, the size of the underground economy has swollen from $350 billion a decade ago to $1.5 trillion now or more than 10 percent of the GDP. While business in the underground economy are typically done off the books and deprive the government of needed revenues, they can serve an important source of stimulus during periods of economic weakness and may in part explain why we had this odd combination of high unemployment and robust consumer spending. I`m Bernard Baumohl.</p><p>GHARIB: And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 27. Good night, everyone and good night to you, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Have a great night, Susie. I`m Tom Hudson. Thanks for joining us and we`ll see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Susie Gharib. The unemployment rate drops to a four year low as U.S. businesses add 146,000 jobs in November. We look behind the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Tom Hudson. We meet the CEOs of three small businesses hiring right now. What they do and why they're looking for help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And House Speaker Boehner accuses <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>of wasting another week in the fiscal cliff negotiations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more coming up on a Friday night edition here on NBR.</p><p>GHARIB: The job market is proving to be surprisingly resilient. American employers hired 146,000 workers in November, much more than expected. And the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent. That's the lowest level since December of 2008. As Erika Miller reports, that wasn't the only surprise in today's report.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Almost no one on Wall Street saw this good news coming. There was every reason to think hiring would be weak last month. After all, many parts of the east coast are still recovering from devastation caused by super storm Sandy.</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN: I think the most likely explanation here is that Sandy's impact was significant but was so short- lived that it didn't extend to the sample period of the employment report which was the week that covered November 12.</p><p>MILLER: Hiring was also supposed to be weak due to worries about the fiscal cliff. With $600 billion in tax hikes and government spending cuts set to start next year, why aren't more firms postponing hiring decisions?</p><p>JULIA CORONADO, CHIEF N. AMERICA ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS: What we're hearing from businesses is that it is really hard to actually pull back hiring right now, because they've already fired so many workers, gotten so lean that it's really difficult.</p><p>MILLER: But not all the surprises in the report were good. At 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level since December 2008. But that was mostly due to people giving up their search for work. And there's another disappointing trend, weak wage growth.</p><p>KASMAN: What we are not seeing is strong income generation. The slowing in wage gains -- the weak bargaining power of labor comes across in this report.</p><p>MILLER: So although the labor market is not getting worse, it's not getting a lot better, either. And there are plenty of risks that could cause businesses to cancel projects, and hiring plans.</p><p>CORONADO: Clearly one of the biggest risks is that we don't see a deal on the fiscal cliff or that they drag it out over a number of months and that that really erodes confidence.</p><p>MILLER: Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve is trying to do all it can to help the economy. The central bank is widely expected to announce an extension of its bond buying program when it meets next week. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: With the fiscal cliff about three weeks away tonight, Washington has not made much progress to avoid it. At least that was the assessment today from one of those directly involved in the talks, House Speaker John Boehner. The top Republican accused <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>of quote, slow walking the economy to the edge of the cliff. He repeated his call for the president to send to Congress a plan that can pass both houses. Tax rates are still the major sticking point. The president wants to raise them for America's highest earners; House Republicans strongly oppose.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER: Instead of reforming the tax code and cutting spending, the president wants to raise tax rates. But even if the president got the tax rate hike that he wanted, understand that we would continue to see trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see. Washington's got a spending problem, not a revenue problem.</p><p>HUDSON: Congress and the president now have about 24 days to reach a deal before the fiscal cliff's tax hikes and spending cuts take effect.</p><p>GHARIB: Mark Zandi says bad things will happen to the economy pretty fast if lawmakers don't settle the fiscal cliff issue. He's chief economist of Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. So Mark, falling off the fiscal cliff means bad things. How bad?</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: It could be quite bad, Susie. I don't think it's cataclysmic if we get into January and we haven't settled this, but if House makers haven't nailed this down by early February, I think stock investors, bond investors will start to get very, very nervous, start selling, risky businesses pull back and by the end of February when we start approaching the ceiling for the debt limit, I think we'll be back in recession. It will be a fairly severe recession. So policy makers have a few weeks but not much more than that. They have to get this together.</p><p>GHARIB: Some people are saying that today's jobs report is very encouraging and that you can look at this as a way that maybe the economy can handle some tough belt tightening because things are looking a little bit better. How do you think the various parties, Republican and Democrats will handle this jobs report in their fiscal cliff negotiations?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, you know, you're right. Some folks look at this and say the economy's strong enough. It should be able to digest big tax increases, spending cuts. Others look at it and say look we still have a very high unemployment rate, a long way to go to get back to full employment. The economy can't tolerate big tax increases and spending cuts. Like most political debates, the reality is in between. We do need to address our fiscal problem so we do need to go through some spending cuts and we also need some tax revenue increases. But we have to phase it in over time, otherwise the economy will choke on that. We can't have too much restraint too quickly. So we have to phase this in, smooth it in to make it palpable for the economy.</p><p>GHARIB: But until that happens, there is a lot of anxiety in the labor market. The big fear for many individuals and for investors is that companies are going to start laying off workers. We saw this week that Citigroup (NYSE:C) announced 11,000 job cuts. Is this the beginning of a trend, Mark?</p><p>ZANDI: No, Susie, I don't think so. I think if Washington can reasonably address the fiscal issues and I'm still confident that they will ultimately get it together. There will be a fair amount of brinkmanship but at the end of the day, they'll get it together. If they're able to do that when we get into next spring, I do think we're going to be in much better shape. Businesses are going to get their groove back. Certainly investors are going to be very happy about that. By this time next year, I think we should see a much better job market because the housing market, which is already starting to turn should be in full swing. So no, I don't think businesses are going to pull back. The only reason they would is if Washington completely botches this. At this point I don't think that's going to happen.</p><p>GHARIB: How do you think the Federal Reserve is going to read and factor in today's jobs report? They're meeting on Tuesday as you know. Do you think it's going to trigger any new response from the Fed?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, as you know the Fed's on high alert. They've got their foot to the accelerator. They're now using open-ended quantitative easing, buying long-term bonds and they're going to up the ante I think at the next meeting in the coming week. Operation Twist ends and they're going to start rolling that into this quantitative even process. So a lot of bond purchases. I think they're going to continue to do that until unemployment is moving definitively lower and is much lower than it is today. And most importantly, they're going to wait and see how these things go in Washington. They're very nervous that policy makers aren't going to get this right. So as long as Washington's dithering I think the Fed's going to be on high alert.</p><p>GHARIB: Absolutely. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has been talking about this for a while now. Thanks a lot Mark, great talking about you. We've been speaking with Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead tonight, slow job growth does not discourage tonight's \"Market Monitor.\" Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott tells us why.</p><p>The slow job growth we saw in November, growth but slow, didn't lead to a lot of consumer cheer as December began. The Reuters-University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey fell early this month to its lowest level we've seen since August. So you add all this up here, the Dow Industrials rose 81 points, the NASDAQ was down 11 with some further losses in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, the S&amp;P 500 up four points. A mixed week for the major indices, the Dow Industrials, which does not include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), gained 1 percent for the week. With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the NASDAQ fell 1.1 percent. And the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.01 of 1 percent gain since last Friday.</p><p>GHARIB: One hundred of the small businesses behind the job growth that we're seeing were honored last night in Washington with the \"Inc\" magazine's \"hire power\" awards. The businesses span the country and cross an array of sectors. Sylvia Hall met with three of the winners to talk about their businesses and the one thing that they have in common: success.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: They work in different states and in completely different fields. But together, these CEOs have added more than 1,500 jobs to the nation's economy over the past three years. This is Mike Derheim, who heads a Minnesota tech firm; Sharon Virts Mozer, whose Virginia-based company runs administration for the Federal government and Karl Schledwitz of Memphis, who's turned jerky and hot dogs into opportunity. (INAUDIBLE) seems to be kind of a mature business. How do you find growth there?</p><p>KARL SCHLEDWITZ, CEO, MONOGRAM FOOD SOLUTIONS: The actual space is growing. There are meat snacks, beef jerky really started growing with the Atkins diet craze and it's probably quadrupled in the last two years. We've been able to grow by buying under utilized manufacturing facilities and centralizing the back office and putting robust sales operation together filling up the plants. And that creates employment and creates more profitability. It's no different than an office building or a shopping center. If it's half empty, it doesn't do very well cash flow wise, but you take that same exact building and fill it up and it cash flows.</p><p>HALL: You work with the Federal government. Again, not exactly what one would consider a growth market. How have you been able to find growth?</p><p>SHARON VIRTS MOZER, PRESIDENT, FCI FEDERAL: We found that the demand is going up just based on how the economy's going and the fact that people want to be here in the U.S. We've also found growth through our process and our process takes what I call collaborative work forces and puts them through a methodology in a training program that allows them to accomplish great things.</p><p>HALL: Tell me just a little bit about this process.</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: We hire typically high school graduates. And we bring them in and we assess their skills and their training and what they have to offer. We put them through a training program to train them towards a particular task or a particular set of tasks.</p><p>HALL: One hundred nerds in 100 days. Where did you get to the point where you were on this nerd drive? How did you get here and how is the drive going?</p><p>MIKE DERHEIM, CEO, THE NERDERY: We started in November with our 100 nerds and 100 days program and just modeled actually very closely after a PBS telethon member drive. And the deal is that if you were known to us and you get an interview we send you a hundred bucks. If we end up hiring the person we send you another 400 bucks and we're trying to get to a hundred nerds in as many days. As of right now, I think now we've had about 900 applications submitted and we've hired 19 people.</p><p>HALL: What's the challenge for you specifically in hiring the people?</p><p>DERHEIM: The last I checked the unemployment rate for people in IT, for people that I'm looking for was something like half of the national average. So above all there just aren't enough people who are out there looking for jobs.</p><p>HALL: I just wanted to open it up and ask if hiring is a challenge --</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: (INAUDIBLE) associated with it and as a result credit issues come up. So finding folks that have the right attitude with good credit particularly since we have a market or a set of work force that often times they are suffering in a poor economy and they do need those jobs but they have credit issues. That's our biggest challenge but for the most part, we have no problems in recruiting this particular market with unemployment as high as it's been.</p><p>DERHEIM: I wish we had that problem. We're exactly the opposite. We're struggling all the time to figure out new ways to get more applications in the door. Just a different worker I guess but it's different.</p><p>HALL: I wanted to go around and ask this about your growth prospects for the next year.</p><p>SCHLEDWITZ: We hope to have more acquisitions this year and continue to add to the plants that we're operating in. So I don't, without an acquisition, it would be 10-15 percent growth.</p><p>VIRTS MOZER: We're looking to grow by at least 500 if not 600 jobs by the end of 2013.</p><p>DERHEIM: We are planning 25 percent a year revenue growth for 2013. So we're definitely planning continuing to grow aggressively and organically.</p><p>HALL: Thank you all so much and congratulations on your awards.</p><p>GHARIB: Calling it a robust investment in the region, the White House today said <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>would ask Congress for more than $60 billion in aid for states impacted by hurricane Sandy. Still that was less than the $82 billion the states wanted for rebuilding. Millions of homeowners and businesses that were in the path of hurricane Sandy are now waiting for checks as the long rebuilding effort begins. Ruben Ramirez spent a day with an insurance claim adjuster touring one of the hardest hit areas.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It's the calm after the storm, empty streets, houses ripped from foundations, boats sandwiched between homes, remnants of the famous Jersey shore boardwalk.</p><p>KARL NEW, CLAIMS ADJUSTER, AMERICAN MODERN: What makes this storm different was the large amounts of sand that it brought with it. So the sand and the surge itself, it moved houses just like Katrina did, but it just the sand is bad.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Karl New is one of about 30 claims adjusters American Modern Insurance dispatched to New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. For the barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, it was north of the eye of the storm but think of it like a windmill spinning counter-clockwise.</p><p>NEW: Seaside was hit with a 37-foot wall wave so that's a pretty big wall that was coming in so you're talking water that's higher than that building. that's crashing in here and causing this much - and the force. It's bringing sand. It's bringing all that water in.</p><p>RAMIREZ: It took a month before insurance adjusters were allowed on the island to assess the damage. New inspected this property earlier this week.</p><p>NEW: The \"L\" shape all the way up top, everything is sagging down from the weight of the sand that was pushing it and the water that was pushing it out. It pushed somebody's shed completely right into his house. He got 5 1/2 feet of water in his house so everything on the first floor needs to be completely gutted and taken out.</p><p>RAMIREZ: John Marchetti's house sits just two doors down closer to the beach.</p><p>JOHN MARCHETTI, HOMEOWNER: I do have flood insurance (INAUDIBLE) and flood. Obviously everything that you see here is from the bottom. It's from the flood.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Marchetti's insurer, NJM will take a loss of more than $300 million from Sandy, four times what it paid out from Irene last year. It's the largest loss in the company's history. Industry estimates put the total amount of damage from super storm Sandy at $50 billion. Insurance companies are expected to pick up about $10-$20 billion of that putting super storm Sandy at the top of the list and ahead of hurricanes Ivan, Ike and Irene. Monday we will look at why rebuilding from Sandy is so expensive thanks to where she came ashore. Ruben Ramirez, Seaside Heights, New Jersey.</p><p>GHARIB: Back here on Wall Street, Tom, some interesting revolutions from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) today saying that it got a Wells notice, is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But behind it is a very interesting debate going on. The reason for the investigation is that the CEO Reid Hastings had posted some information on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page about developments at the company and the SEC said you didn't disclose this properly. It should have been a press release. It should have been a filing with the SEC and it raises whole new questions about social media and fair disclosure.</p><p>HUDSON: This is all about how technology is changing and regulations have such a hard time Susie keeping up with it. We've see it with high frequency trading for instance and now we're seeing with how companies disseminate information using social media getting it out arguably to more people faster than what a traditional press release or SEC filing. So we'll have to see how this one plays out. That stock by the way Susie didn't move much today on the notice although we did have plenty of other movement. Let's get going with our \"Market Focus\" here. As we saw the influence of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that it can have on the broad market really continue today with the major indices closing mix. The jobs data helped the S&amp;P 500 start in the green but the early gains disappeared as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares sank. The index climbed into positive in the afternoon and was able to finish up a 0.03 of a percent. Trading volume slowed, 605 million on the big board, 1.6 billion shares on the NASDAQ.</p><p>The materials and financials sectors gained 0.08 of a percent. The energy sector up 0.07 of a percent. Technology was the big drag, thanks once again to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AAPL. Over the past week here it is, gone from almost $600 per share down to $533. That's down about 9 percent. Looking at it longer term in the last year, the sell-off with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) now about $8 above that mid-November low. Several theories behind the stock drop: profit taking, disappointment over no special dividend and more fundamental concerns about Apple's business growth.</p><p>Two other big tech stocks under pressure. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling 1 percent, just pennies tonight above its low for the year. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems falling 0.07 of 1 percent. The firm repeated today its previous earnings growth forecast.</p><p>Big banks, they were on the upswing though with further improvement in the job market, and ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting with expectations building for the possibility of more economic help. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) jumped 2.6 percent, its highest price since early November. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added another 1.8 percent. That's an 18-month high for shares of B of A.</p><p>A big global energy deal one step closer to reality tonight. Late today Canada OK'd the buyout of Nexen (NYSE:NXY) Energy by Chinese energy giant C-NOOC. It's a $15.3 billion deal, representing another foreign expansion by a Chinese energy company. Canada's ministry of industry said C-NOOC agreed to quote, free market principles. The buyout offer for Nexen (NYSE:NXY) came back in July. In today's regular session, the stock was heavily traded falling 6.6 percent. But after the Canadian OK, they jumped more than 14.5 percent in extended hours trading, around $27 per share. U.S. and British regulators still have to approve the deal.</p><p>Two years ago Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered $6 billion to buy daily deal website Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) before it went public. Groupon's market value is half that tonight. Bloomberg reports there's new take-over speculation. By whom we don't know. The stock though jumped 23 percent. Volume doubled. Some of the buying could also be from traders who sold short the stock to profit as it was falling.</p><p>Four of the top five most actively traded exchange-traded products were higher. The lone hold-out the NASDAQ 100 tracking fund, which does include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after all. The fund was down 0.06 of 1 percent today. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Job growth is one reason tonight's \"Market Monitor\" thinks the economy will pick up speed next year and so will stocks. Mark Luschini back with us, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. Always great to see you Mark. So the job market that we saw today improving in the last month but still slow. Do you think it's going to pick up the pace of that improvement next year and why?</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Well we do, Tom. The fact of the matter is we've been seeing steady if unspectacular job growth for the better part of 2012, job growth averaging roughly 150,000 or so a month. We think on the back of an up tick on several factors here that we're looking forward to improve in 2013, we could see a modicum of an up tick in job growth.</p><p>HUDSON: Among those other improvements you see consumers paying down debt as beneficial to the economy. Doesn't that lead to less demand, less consumer spending?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We think it's bringing up their balance sheet.</p><p>HUDSON: Which is a good thing.</p><p>LUSCHINI: It is a good thing. All this (ph) leads to a much healthier foundation upon which consumption can be built which is all important in the economy.</p><p>HUDSON: Where are we in that de-leveraging cycle do you think, closer to the end?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I think it's advanced. I think it's probably a 2015-16 phenomena before we get trend but nonetheless, well off the peak in 2006.</p><p>HUDSON: Businesses meantime are not necessarily de-leveraging. They don't necessarily have to. They have a lot of cash out there but they're not spending it. You think they're going to less loose some of that cash. We've heard so much uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and companies holding back. How are those two related?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I think the fiscal cliff ultimately is going to be rendered into a fiscal slow. Between now and then the uncertainty is really paralyzing CEOs and companies from big to small. You can see it in the core capital goods orders which have basically fallen off in the last two quarters indicative of holding that business investment and hiring back which we think will change once we have some certainty brought into that equation.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally housing which has shown remarkable stability here, an uptick in several markets but there's talk about limiting mortgage deductions with the fiscal cliff negotiations sometime next year. Couldn't that impact the recovery?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It could. Obviously it might be relegated to more affluent households in terms of the ability to do a deduction either in full or part. But at the end of the day there's still a large swath of household formation that is occurring that's going to drive I think perspective homeowners into the market regardless.</p><p>HUDSON: Let's get to the pics here. You do like housing stocks with the home builders ETF. What do you anticipate? They've had a nice run already.</p><p>LUSCHINI: They've been terrific.</p><p>HUDSON: Put new money to work?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We turned bullish about a year ago and they've doubled or better and yes we would. They may be subject to profit taking but nonetheless we still think we're in the early innings of the house recovery.</p><p>HUDSON: You also like technology. Is this a play on your business investment expectations for next year?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It is, if business wallets open up we expect the destination for some of that money to go towards more productivity enhancing tools and they've been under investing in technology now for several years.</p><p>HUDSON: What about that transition from the PC to tablets and smart phones? Does that concern you at all about traditional technology terms firms?</p><p>LUSCHINI: It does a little bit. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is intriguing and then really the sweet spot of that. The fact of the matter is though it's an interesting company that is trying to make itself into more of a tablet or a smart phone oriented company. In the meantime they get paid an enormous dividend yield to wait.</p><p>HUDSON: Speaking of which, I know you like dividend stocks. The last time we spoke to you July 6, you liked Conoco Phillips and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Both of them in terms of just the stock price appreciation up by single digits percentage terms. You still like them.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Very much so. Battleship companies good places to be in, in health care and energy and again a very handsome coupon (ph) which is think is going to matter to total return.</p><p>HUDSON: Do you own everything that we mentioned tonight?</p><p>LUSCHINI: We do.</p><p>HUDSON: Our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest Mark Luschini. He's with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Thanks Tom.</p><p>GHARIB: And it's often said that in life, it's not the destination that counts, but the journey. This week Lou's been thinking about journeys and their not so straight lines. Here's author and educator, Lou Heckler.</p><p>LOU HECKLER: How many of you are now doing what you thought you'd be doing when you first went to work? I'll guess maybe about 25 percent. I was reminded of this recently when I spoke to a group of dentists about leadership. We talked about how they got into dentistry because they liked working with their hands, they liked helping people. And now? Now, they also negotiate building leases and manage staffs and cope with shrinking reimbursements and the soft economy. My first job as a manager involved leading 17 people in a television news department.</p><p>One day, one of my old college friends surprised me by asking: how does it feel to be out of the news business? I only later realized he meant that all of us who have the privilege of leading others soon realize that leading is our job. That once-straight line we visualized where our skills were needed has zigs and zags in it. The skills we now need to learn and hone and practice have changed. It's a wonderful honor to be at the top of an organization, but that old concept of straight to the top, that's not how it is. Not by a long shot. I'm Lou Heckler.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, we want to let all of you know that we've posted an extended version of our conversation with NBR founding anchor Paul Kangas from yesterday. It's on the web at nbr.com and have a great weekend everyone and Tom, it was great seeing you yesterday as well.</p><p>HUDSON: Great to have you in south Florida Susie with Paul as well, a lot more viewer questions on that extended video at nbr.com. Have a great weekend and we'll see you back here nest week.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Susie Gharib.  Only 80,000 people got jobs in June, way below  estimates.  But the news isn't all bad.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  I'm Tom Hudson.   Employment is the issue this election season.  Tonight we'll hear what the  presidential candidates say about today's job numbers.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  And it's infected thousands of computers already.  Are you  ready for Monday's web attack?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  That and more coming up tonight right here on NBR.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Another lousy jobs report today.  American businesses were  hiring in June, but not a whole lot, Tom and stocks sold off on the news.  </p><p>HUDSON:  A lackluster report here Susie, this is three straight months  now of weak hiring, showing the U.S. economy obviously still struggling.   U.S. employers added just 80,000 jobs.  That's certainly less than the  100,000 jobs expected.  The unemployment rate meantime unchanged, 8.2  percent. That's stuck pretty much in the same level for most of this year.   Investors clearly hoping for some stronger job growth, pushing down stocks  in reaction to the disappointment.  At the bell, the Dow was down 124  points.  The NASDAQ fell almost 39, the S&amp;P was off nearly 13.  So between  the weak jobs data and European worries, caution remains the business plan  for many companies.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT:   CEOs might continue to play things fairly close to the vest.  We know  they're holding elevated cash levels and they're going to therefore  potentially defer business investment and hiring which once again feeds  back into maintaining a slow pace of economic growth in the U.S. going  forward.  So we need animal spirits to be rekindled here through greater  certainty about what the future looks like than what we have today.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Mark Luschini is tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest.  We'll  talk more with him later in the program.  But first tonight, Suzanne Pratt  takes a deeper look at today's employment report.  </p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   When the  economy creates 80,000 new jobs in one month, it's good enough to keep us  from slipping into another recession, but not good enough to chip away at  that pesky unemployment rate.  In the first quarter of this year, employers  added an average of 225,000 jobs.  But in the second quarter, the average  downshifted to a disappointing 75,000.  Some economists credit warm winter  weather for the early boost in hiring, saying it robbed jobs from the  spring.  But no matter how you slice it, the economy is slowing and  businesses are afraid to commit to new workers.  </p><p>CONRAD DEQUADROS, SR. ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS:  The debt crisis in  Europe has the potential to dip the U.S. economy back into recession,  although that's unlikely, it's probably a concern for businesses.  And  secondly we have a lot of uncertainty related to tax policy and fiscal  issues this year.  </p><p>PRATT:  Today's weak data sparked new debate about what more the  Federal Reserve can do to help.  To some, a new round of bond buying, known  as QE3, looks like a strong possibility.  </p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHASE WEALTH MGMT.:   It has to put  quantitative easing on the table and it has to be a viable option for the  Federal Reserve.  Did this report basically tell us that the economy has  completely falling off the cliff, not really.  But it's certainly telling  us that we're not making much progress.  </p><p>PRATT:  Still, not all of the June labor snapshot was doom and gloom.   Average hourly wages gained $0.06 and so did the amount of time spent on  the job by one tenth of an hour or six minutes.  Both suggest support for  consumer spending, particularly as lower gas prices puts more money into  peoples' wallets.  </p><p>DEQUADROS:  This is sort of the strongest income increase that we've  seen or implied income increase from the employment report since February.   And then on top of that, it's an increase that's in real terms because we  have prices that are falling.  </p><p>PRATT:  Against this backdrop, there is some optimism about the labor  market in the second half of this year.  Many expect a pickup in job  growth, but not enough to bring the unemployment rate below 8 percent.   Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Our next guest sees a silver lining in today's gloomy jobs  numbers.  He's Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.   Mark, it's hard to be positive these days .  What is it that you're seeing  in the labor market that gives you some hope?  </p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  Well Susie, let me  say that was a disappointing number and the reporter was right.  If we stay  at 80K, unemployment will rise and that an 8.2 percent unemployment rate,  that will be very uncomfortable.  So we need to see better numbers and I  think we will.  I think American businesses are in good shape.  They've  reduced their cost structures, their profit margin are as wide as they've  ever been.   They're as profitable as they have ever been.  Their balance  sheets are very strong.  They've reduced debt.  So in my mind, it's not a  question can American businesses invest and hire more?  It's a matter of  confidence.  They're still very very nervous and that's the missing  ingredient here is those animal spirits that the other economists were  talking about.  </p><p>GHARIB:  At the beginning of this year, businesses were hiring at a  very rapid clip, 200,000 people plus a month but not any more now and  that's just worrying a lot of people.  When do you see the hiring picking  up and what's going to motivate and drive companies to do more hiring?  </p><p>ZANDI:  You make a good point and just to reinforce it, we were  creating 250,000 jobs per month back in December, January, February. The  last three months we've been creating less than 100,000 per month.  Both  overstate the case.  We weren't going nearly as strongly earlier in the  year and we're not as weak currently.  The reality is somewhere in between  and I think that will become more evident as we make our way through the  summer and into the fall months.  I really don't think businesses are going  to fully engage and really let loose and begin to hire in a more aggressive  way until we nail down our fiscal situation.  We've got a number of  significant fiscal issues we have to solve after the presidential election  and also not until we get more clarity with respect to what's happening in  Europe.  Europe is still a very serious threat to our economy and I think  that's making people very nervous and businesses is forestalling more  business hiring.  </p><p>GHARIB:  A lot of CEO's and business people that I've been talking to  are really spooked out by what's going on in Europe.  You were just there.   From the people you talked to while you were in Europe, what was your sense  of their seriousness about an action plan and a timetable to fix their  situation and get the economy growing over there?  </p><p>ZANDI:  Well, you know, it's a bit discouraging because there's just  no consensus with respect to how it's going to play out.  You talk to one  person and you get one story and another person a totally different one.  I  was encouraged by the fact that in general I think there was consensus with  regard to what needs to get done.  In fact, a few of those things actually  got done at the end of last week when the EU ministers met and we got some  action.  I do think it's a process and I think this process is going to  take place over the course of the next couple years.  And so we're going to  be facing several rounds if not more of financial market turmoil.  That's  going to be what's necessary to generate the political will to make the  changes that they need to, but at the end of the day Susie, I think they  will and once that become clear, that's when American businesses I think  will get going and we'll see more hiring.  </p><p>GHARIB:  OK.  We'll leave it there.  Mark thank you so much for coming  on the program.  We appreciate it.  Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's  (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Election 2012 now, there's one thing investors and  politicians have in common:  they both watch closely the monthly jobs'  report for clues about the future.  And in this election season especially,  the jobs data could determine the winner.  Here's Darren Gersh in  Washington.  </p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Even the  president did not seem particularly satisfied with today's jobs report.   Mr. Obama said the employment numbers were moving in the right direction  but quickly added --  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I want to get back to a  time when middle class families and those working to get into the middle  class have some basic security.  That's our goal, so we've got to grow the  economy even faster.  </p><p>GERSH:  Whether or not we are moving in the right direction fast  enough is the critical question for the election.  Political scientists  believe most voters begin to make up their minds about the president's  handling of the economy right now in the six months or so before casting  their votes.  </p><p>WILLIAM GALSTON, SR. FELLOW, BROOKINGS:  So I would say after another  two jobs reports, the summer reports, July and August reports, by Labor  Day, I think a lot of people are going to have made up their minds.  </p><p>GERSH:  Republican challenger Mitt Romney urged voters not to wait  that long.  He blamed the poor jobs' report on high taxes and burdensome  regulation.  </p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The president's policies  have not gotten America working again and the president's going to have to  stand up and take responsibility for it.  </p><p>GERSH:  There may still be some spillover in this jobs' report from  strong hiring over the warm winter.  If that's the case, job creation could  bounce up a little in the coming months, perhaps averaging 150,000 jobs a  month.  But even that might not be enough good news to sway voters.  </p><p>HEIDI SHEIRHOLZ, ECON., ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE:  Obama or any other  incumbent politician, they are really going to want to see stronger job  growth between now and November.  I don't necessarily think that we are  going to see the numbers that will bring the unemployment rate down in a  substantial way in the next few months.  </p><p>GERSH:  So Tom that means that the president will head into the  election day with the unemployment rate still painfully high.  </p><p>HUDSON:   Darren, voters want to know what is the policy to get more  Americans back to work faster?  The president's been talking about patience  not being satisfied and Governor Romney has been criticizing the president.   So what are the policies to get more Americans back to work?  </p><p>GERSH:  Well today the president was looking backwards a little bit  defending the auto bailout saying that it accounted for saving a lot of  jobs in Ohio, a few swing states, a lot of auto workers there.  President's  also been pushing still for infrastructure spending.  He says a lot of  unemployed construction workers, need to get them back to work.  He talked  about support for state and local government which have been laying off a  lot of people as you know.  Governor Romney has been talking about the need  to bring corporate taxes down.  We have a high corporate tax rate he says,  the highest in the world and also he's been talking about regulatory  reform.  So in some ways, a lot of these issues and positions should sound  very familiar.  </p><p>HUDSON:  It seems like we've been having this discussion as they've  been having the debate over the past 90 days as we've seen the job growth  slow down.  What's the catalyst here for action?  Will here be any before  November?  </p><p>GERSH:  I think we have seen this movie before and I wouldn't count on  there being a different outcome in Congress.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Speaking of which, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue  from where you are tonight, what about that legislative agenda?  Anything  job related that we can anticipate here in the summer into the fall?  </p><p>GERSH: I would absolutely anticipate that Republicans will come back  and will try to get the president to move on the fiscal cliff issues, try  to get him to agree to extend tax cuts so we can take it off the table.   The president has absolutely said he will not do that.  Also the rating  agencies are watching this debate very closely to see whether Congress  comes up with sustainable reforms.  As you well know Tom, if Congress  doesn't come up with that and isn't signed into law, we could be looking at  another ratings downgrade for the United States.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Thank you for the reminder of that, at the intersection of  jobs and politics tonight, it's Darren Gersh in Washington.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Beware of malware Monday.  This is a computer virus that  could affect your access to the Internet starting this Monday.  Tens of  thousands of Americans could lose their Internet service.  Ruben Ramirez  reports.  </p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Come Monday,  computer users may find it impossible to reach the Internet.  In November,  the FBI cracked down on a ring of hackers that figured out how to redirect  peoples' computers to websites that were different from what they typed  into their search bar.  Samara Lynn is a networking analyst at pcmag.com.  </p><p>SAMARA LYNN, NETWORKING ANALYST, PCMAG:  What these virus makers did  was they redirected all these thousands of computers to this site and the  more hits that go on this site the more revenue and the more advertising  dollars are generated.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  One concern:  third parties getting a hold of private  information.  </p><p>LYNN:  The biggest threat is you don't want your information if you're  using a credit card for online shopping or doing any banking.  You don't  want to be redirected to a site that could potentially take that  information.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  Online giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  have done a lot to warn people about the malicious software known as DNS  changer.  What's the easiest way to figure out if you're computer has been  infected?  </p><p>LYNN:  There's a great website that will quickly tell you.  It's  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dns-ok.us\">www.dns-ok.us</url>.   It's the DNS changer checkup and once you click on it, it  will automatically check your DNS settings.  If you get DNS resolution  equals green, you're fine.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  If your screen gives you a red alert, scroll down and follow  the link to the FBI website.  Ruben Ramirez, NBR, New York.  </p><p>GHARIB:  More claims today that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) used anti- competitive tactics to delay the release of the generic version of Lipitor,  its top-selling anti-cholesterol pill.  Walgreens, Kroger (NYSE:KR) and  three other major retail chains sued Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), saying it forced  them to buy the more costly Lipitor, rather than a generic.  Generic  Lipitor entered the market last November, but these companies say it should  have come to market about a year earlier.  Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) denies that  and says while some patents on Lipitor expired in the year 2010, others  stretched through last year allowing it to delay the launch of generics.   The suits has a little impact on Pfizer's stock Tom.  It lost $0.13 today  to $22 and change, but there were other companies that had bigger losses in  today's sell-off.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Yes, there weren't many ports in the storm that we saw in the  sell-off after that disappointing job data here Susie.  Let's go ahead and  roll with tonight's \"Market Focus\" taking a look at another month of  lackluster job growth really souring the market tone this Friday, capping a  week of disappointing economic data and stock price performance.  Here's  what the major stock indices did this week.  The Dow Industrials on the  week falling 0.8 of a percent.  The NASDAQ eking out the smallest of gains,  0.1 of a percent higher.  The S&amp;P 500 tonight 0.6 of a percent lower  compared to one week ago.  </p><p>Let's focus in on Friday's actions with the week's losses coming  today as the S&amp;P 500 fell from the opening bell after that jobs data.   Rising government bond yields in Spain also cast a shadow over worries that  the market has still with Europe.  The lowest level of the day for the S&amp;P  hit about 90 minutes before the closing bell.  Volume, it fell a little bit  on the big board, down to 595 million shares, 1.4 billion plus shares  moving on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>All 10 major stock sectors were lower to end the week on the Friday.   The tech sector suffered the worst losses, down 1.8 percent.  The  economically sensitive areas, industrials and materials falling more than 1  percent each.  </p><p>Even big tech stocks provided no relief at all today.  Those doing  big business in Europe especially hit by the selling.  Hewlett-Packard's  3.5 percent drop was the biggest among Dow Industrial components, taking it  back below $20 per share.  Big blue saw red.  IBM falling 2 percent on  heavier volume.   Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shedding 1.6 percent.  </p><p>But it was software company Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) that really  knocked down tech today.  It warned second quarter results will miss  earlier predictions thanks in part to weakness in Europe.  INFA, the  warning sending shares careening, down more than 27.5 percent.  Volume  huge, the stock falling to a new 52-week low.  Other firms in the data  services business were hurting with worries about spending on technology.   Data storage firm Teradata (NYSE:TDC) shed 10.5 percent.  Software maker  Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) falling 7.6 percent.  Data delivery firm F-5  Networks down almost 7 percent.  </p><p>After the close tonight, Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) announced they will settle their patent infringement fight.   Instead of fighting, the two will actually launch a new advertising  partnership and expand their distribution deals.  Before the news, there  are the closing prices. Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)! shares down a fraction,  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closing up almost 1 percent.  </p><p>Even though job growth in the U.S. has slowed to a crawl, that hasn't  hurt the U.S. dollar, especially compared to the euro.  The euro falling  into a two-year low against the dollar, now $1.23 will buy you one euro.   The European currency has been sinking over the continent's debt crisis.   The result of the falling euro, U.S. businesses more price competitive  overseas.  </p><p>The dollar strength also helping push down commodity prices,  especially oil and gold.  Crude oil dropping more than 3.5 percent today,  settling below $85 per barrel.  How about gold back below $1,600 an ounce  tonight.  Emblematic of today's risk-averse market, bond prices dropping,  bond prices rallying rather, pushing down interest rates.  The yield on the  10-year government note 1.55 percent tonight, the lowest yield, the highest  price since the beginning of June.  </p><p>All five of our most actively traded ETFs lower.  The emerging  markets fund suffering the biggest drop, down 1.8 percent.  That is  tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>The last time we spoke to tonight's \"Market Monitor\" guest, the U.S.  economy was creating more than 200,000 jobs per month.  Mark Luschini is  the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott with us tonight  from Pittsburgh.  Mark, that was way back in January.  How about that, job  growth has slowed considerably.  How does it change your investment  outlook?  </p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, :   Seems like a long time ago, Tom.  But it really hasn't done anything to  change it.  In fact it's probably reinforced it.  We didn't know at the  time that perhaps some of that increase in job growth that we had in the  beginning of the year might have been pulled forward from now on the back  of better than expected weather.  But as a consequence, we still thought  though that we would see still somewhat anemic growth in the United States,  slowing growth in Europe, slowing growth in China and that led us to an  opinion that we wanted to stay largely domestic with regard to our equity  exposure and that's kind of leaning into larger cap high quality names and  especially those that pay handsome dividend yields because in a low-growth  world, income matters.  And you certainly can't find much income being  produced today by the traditional source of that which is of course fixed  income investments.  </p><p>HUDSON:  And you've got some new picks that fit with that strategy,  but I want to ask you, are you concerned that this trade is getting pretty  crowded, a lot of folks looking for yields in dividends at this point.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Most definitely Tom.  I mean granted some of the buying  that's occurred in areas like real estate investment trusts, master (ph)  limited partnerships are indicative of almost an indiscriminate search for  income and that has pushed some of these traditional bastions of yield to I  think somewhat elevated valuations and as a consequence, we need to be  under weight or completely unexposed to some areas like real estate  investment trusts, like for instance the utility sector and even be light  in telecommunications as a consequence.  But other sectors do still  represent good value and good yields can be found there as well.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Energy is one of those and that's first up on your new pick,  ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), COP, cop, the ticker symbol on this one and  dividend yield almost 5 percent.  Energy prices have been very volatile as  of late.  Does this concern you at all especially as the dollar seems to  want to strengthen?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Well certainly the pullback in oil prices has hurt the  energy patch and as a consequence dragged down the baby with the bath  water.  But ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is becoming more profitable via  shrinking disposing of assets that are non-core, maintain a very high as  you mentioned dividend yield.  Valuations are inexpensive and ultimately on  the prospects of global growth continue to expand and almost inelastic  demand for oil among the emerging market countries, we think that bodes  well for the energy sector longer term. So secularly we like having  exposure in that space and predominantly through names, like the quality of  a ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).  </p><p>HUDSON:  Also looking at healthcare, a little defensive with Johnson &amp;  Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).  J&amp;J has been suffering certainly some quality control  issues over the past several years, lots of high profile recalls but the  stock has had a nice jump in the last six weeks or so.  You see value here  in the mid 60's, up 60's?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Most definitely.  New CEO, so hopefully work in progress  toward putting some of that if you will (INAUDIBLE) issues behind it  starting with a good evaluation one of only four triple A rated companies  in America, so obviously pristine balance sheet and a 3.6 percent or so  dividend yield makes it appealing for both growth and income seekers alike.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You liked energy and drugs back when we last spoke with you  at the first of the year, January 6th.  Let's take a look at those previous  picks with Chevron (NYSE:CVX), CVS (NYSE:CVS) down about 3 percent from  then.  The Swiss drug giant Novartis down 3 percent.  You also like  financials, XLF, that exchange-traded fund up about 8 percent.  Do you  still like these spaces?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  We do like financial still among the other two as well, but  have leaned more away from the big universal banks, the money centers into  the regional banks.  We think again somewhat steadier U.S. economic  conditions coupled with what we think is a hardening of pricing in the  housing market should lead to stabilization of regional bank balance sheets  and so we would continue to be exposed to that space.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You own everything that we mentioned here tonight, Mark?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  I do.  </p><p>HUDSON: Mark Luschini, our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest.  He's with  Janney Montgomery Scott.  Quick programming note here, long-time NBR  \"Market Monitor\" Gary Motyl passed away recently.  He was the chief  investment officer at Franklin Templeton and we will miss his market  insights here on NBR.  You can find his last \"Market Monitor\" appearance on  our website, nbr.com. </p><p>GHARIB:  And next week on NBR, it's the start of earnings season.   Alcoa (NYSE:AA) CEO Klaus Kleinfeld joins us on Monday.  He'll talk about  how the giant aluminum maker did in the second quarter and the outlook for  the rest of the year.  </p><p>And when it comes to customer service, sometimes you have to give  customers more than what they ask for.  This week Lou's been thinking about  dandelions.  Here's author and educator Lou Heckler.  </p><p>LOU HECKLER: My son is not a little boy any more.  In fact he just  turned 40.  I was smiling the other day when I thought about a special  moment when he was about the age his older daughter now is.  He came into  the house and handed my wife a bunch of dandelions he had picked in the  back yard.  These are so sweet, she beamed as he looked on with pride, but  they look kind of smashed.  I know, he responded immediately.  I stomped on  every one to make sure there were no bees.  </p><p>As a business speaker and writer, I think all the time about what  business is really about.  I know it's about finding a need and filling it.   But the older I get -- maybe I should say the more experienced I get -- I  think it's really about stomping on dandelions.  The people who do business  with you, customers, clients, patients, whatever you call them, they're out  there in the backyard of their lives and they also wonder which dandelions  have bees on them.  Your job -- my job -- is not just to make a sale or  fill a need, it's to reassure.  Yes, this is the right product or service  for you.  Yes, this will make you feel comfortable.  Yes, this is the  finest quality we can offer.  Yes, you can trust us to treat you with  hospitality and joy and grace.  Look, most people can go to a number of  places to get what we do.  We need to give them a concrete reason to deal  with us.  I happen to think that stomping on dandelions is a darn good one.   I'm Lou Heckler.  </p><p>GHARIB:  And yes you can trust us to have a lot of interesting news  next week Tom.  We have those earnings reports that we were talking about  and also we're going to be kicking off a week long look at the second, the  outlook for the second half of the year with lots of stock market analysis.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Always a lot happens every second half of the year, but this  year especially you got the election.  You got all the fiscal issues coming  up and of course the Federal Reserve by the end of the year says operation  twist may be over.  Lots of concerns about what's going to happen over the  next six months or so Susie.  </p><p>GHARIB:  A lot of uncertainty and we've got to get answers to that.   But anyway in the meantime, have a great weekend everyone and I hope you do  too, Tom. </p><p>HUDSON:  You as well Susie. That is NBR for this Friday night, July  6.  Thanks for joining us here in the broadcast.   We'll see you online at  nbr.com and back here on Monday night.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

From oil to IPOs, what to expect from the year ahead. It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 30th.</p><p>Good evening and thanks for joining us. Susie is off tonight. Investors say good bye to a year of wild market swings and lots of economic worries but also a year that ends very close to where it began for the major stock averages. With today`s fractional losses for those averages, the broad market ended the year virtually unchanged. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to end the year on the upside rising 5.5 percent. The NASDAQ closed down this year almost 2 percent. How about the S&amp;P 500, finishing with a loss of 4/100 of a percent, essentially in the same place it was at the end of last year. But for the 11th straight year, gold prices rallied, closing at $1,566 an ounce. That marks a 10 percent gain this year. After this roller coaster ride for investors, 2012 is set to begin with many of the same concerns and uncertainties. Suzanne Pratt reports from New York.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tomorrow evening New York`s famed Times Square will be filled with thousands of people celebrating the New Year. On Wall Street, however there will be far less partying as stock investors say good riddance to a tough year. 2011 has been volatile due to Europe`s debt crisis, slow economic growth here at home and political uncertainty around the globe. And there`s little unanimity among financial pros as to whether 2012 will be an up or down year for the major averages. Still most do agree trading will be sloppy and choppy.</p><p>MIKE RYAN, CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I think we`re going to get more of the same. We`re going get a lot of volatile markets and I think we`re going to continue to trade off headlines.</p><p>PRATT: And those headlines are likely to come out of Europe, at least in the first half of the year.</p><p>VADIM ZLOTINIKOV, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN: You have uncertainty as to what is the path that Europe is going to choose. If it is a path of extreme austerity, you could actually depress the U.S. companies earnings and the U.S. economic growth. If on the other hand it`s some combination of monetary easing in a framework for reducing the deficit, that would be viewed by the market as more popular.</p><p>PRATT: No matter what happens in the Eurozone, U.S. economic growth is likely to be muted next year. Yes, there are signs the recovery is gaining momentum. But headwinds are still plentiful. Not only are job prospects for millions of Americans bleak, but the housing market remains in the cellar and there is one more factor likely to create uncertainty for investors in 2012, call it a global changing of the guard.</p><p>RYAN: Think about the countries that potentially face a change in leadership. The United States, China, France, India, Iran, Korea, you know, this is, these are countries that represent about half the world`s GDP. So those leadership changes can also be add to the volatility of the markets.</p><p>PRATT: Before you head for the exits permanently, there are at least a few reasons to be positive about stocks in 2012. Corporate profits are expected to remain decent. Companies can still borrow at very low rates and don`t forget the oodles of money in corporate coffers.</p><p>ZLOTINIKOV: Companies that are generating a lot of cash and are likely to increase the payout, likely to increase dividends, I want to be clear. This is not a new theme. It is actually an extremely crowded theme. It has been recommended by every single person in the world, doesn`t make it wrong.</p><p>PRATT: Investor sentiment is still a big wild card for next year. Trading volume in the last few months has been very low, suggesting a serious lack of conviction. And that is unlikely to change until there`s better clarity on Europe. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: All that uncertainty has lead for one of the best place for investors this year, it`s the bond market. Most bond mutual funds did better than stock mutual fund funds in 2011. Mutual funds focused on U.S. government bonds gained 9 percent on the year while the average large-cap core stock fund lost 0.3 of 1 percent. What to do after those gains? Well, bond expert Larry Swedroe of Buckingham Asset Management shares a portfolio suggestion for the New Year.</p><p>LARRY SWEDROE, RESEARCH DIR., BUCKINGHAM ASSET MANAGEMENT: I think you should have a well thought out plan, an asset allocation, maybe 60 percent stock, 40 percent bonds or if you are older maybe it is 40 percent bonds and 60 percent stocks. And then you want to have the discipline to stay the course. And that means after a bond run, you are going to be selling bonds at high prices, meaning you are going to have a nice profit, you get to sell high. And you should be buying stocks at low prices when expected returns are high.</p><p>HUDSON: You can hear more of what Larry says about investing in 2012. The full interview is on our web site, just go to nbr.com.</p><p>On the eve of the New Year and new tension between the west and Iran. The country has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway linking the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea. Seventeen million barrels of oil move through the strait every day. And it`s about 20 percent of all oil traded worldwide. Iran has threatened to close the strait if it faces new sanctions over its nuclear program. John Kilduff is with us, founding partner at Again Capital with us at the NASDAQ. John, you`ve been following the oil market for years. How serious is the oil market taking this new threat?</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, FOUNDING PARTNER, AGAIN CAPITAL: It`s taking it relatively seriously. And it`s certainly ratcheted up here over the past several weeks. To the western countries` credit, for once, the sanctions are biting in Iran. And that`s why you are seeing a reaction by the Iranians to them. And while though I think that they are certainly capable of causing trouble in the strait, we`re not there yet in terms of being on the precipice. There`s a lot of diplomatic dancing work to go on before that occurs.</p><p>HUDSON: It hasn`t impacted global supply yet. Most of that oil that runs through the Strait of Hormuz heads to Asia. We know that China has slowed down a little bit. But does this threaten the Asian economies?</p><p>KILDUFF: Well, it will. It will threaten all our economies if it were to get blocked, even momentarily, even if it is just a single barge let`s say in the one of the two shipping lanes. The headline is going to hit the tape. We`re all going to buy it and not sort out the details until much later. Because look, it`s most of the Saudi oil. It`s Iraq`s southern production which is half of that country`s output that goes through that narrow strait, UAE and Iranian oil for that matter. So it will be a shortage of oil that can`t be made up by anyone so that is why the stakes are so high.</p><p>HUDSON: John, what about the ability to reroute some of that Persian Gulf oil to pipelines and take it up to the north?</p><p>KILDUFF: It really is not an option. It`s not going to be a sufficient ability. Like I said, the (INAUDIBLE) oil facility off Saudi Arabia`s coast which I like to call the world`s oil aorta really is irreplaceable, just too much of a volume of oil to displace in any fashion.</p><p>HUDSON: John, we know it is a global market for crude. U.S. crude, domestic oil, meantime, just shy of $100 a barrel as we wind up this year. How about the impact if this threat continues to raise tensions with the Mideast?</p><p>KILDUFF: Yeah, like you said, it is a global market. And the price reverberates around the world no matter where the shortage is. We saw what the Libyan outage did to the Brent crude oil prices and what it did to the west Texas prices as well. It kept it sustained at levels much higher than we otherwise would have been. And even this Iranian situation has probably added a good $15 to $20 a barrel in geo-political premium right now.</p><p>HUDSON: And finally what about the demand picture in the first quarter with Europe still in question?</p><p>KILDUFF: It`s going to be very much in doubt. Not only here we`re seeing gasoline demand consistently down about 5 percent week in and week out and the Chinese economy is a big question mark. The data we`re getting from there is pointing to a slowdown. And whether or not it`s going to be significant or not, what remains to be seen. But they are the swing demand center. So the way we talk about Saudi Arabia`s oil being so precious to supply, China`s demand is equally as precious on the demand side of the equation.</p><p>HUDSON: That`s the outlook as we move into the New Year for oil. John, happy New Year to you.</p><p>KILDUFF: Happy New Year to you.</p><p>HUDSON: John Kilduff with us tonight from Again Capital.</p><p>From oil to IPOs this year saw the return of the Internet initial public offering and lots of hype surrounding the trading debuts of stocks like Linkedin and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). But investors did not always buy into the hype. Joya Dass tonight looks back at the year`s newest stocks and the IPO everybody is waiting for next year.</p><p>JOYA DASS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: While the markets renewed their appetite for companies going public in 2011, it wasn`t the blockbuster year as some had hoped.</p><p>JAMES KRAPFEL, IPO STRATEGIST, MORNINGSTAR: The companies that went public in 2011, on average under performed the S&amp;P 500 by 12 percentage points.</p><p>DASS: Big tech IPOs Linkedin, Groupon and game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) started off with a bang, but finished the year in some cases with a dull thud.</p><p>KRAPFEL: Groupon was the second one. They were up about 25, 30 percent on the first day, immediately in the first couple of weeks fell about 40 percent. But it has shot back up above its IPO price, which is why, we along with others are very skeptical of that company and their business model.</p><p>DASS: This year`s top IPO performers included Imperva, a leader in data security. GNC Holdings, a mall favorite featuring nutrition bars. Tangoe, a telecom group and Tesoro Logistics, a refiner and marketer of petroleum-based products. This year`s worst IPO performers included China Century Dragon Media, a Chinese television media buyer. Friendfinder Networks, a dating web site, Imperial Holdings, a specialty finance company and finally Kips Bay Medical, which develops products such as mesh stents for use in bypass surgery. And that brings us to the IPO market for 2012.</p><p>DAVID MENLOW, PRESIDENT,IPOFINANCIAL.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The balance sheets of the companies coming public, the deleveraged aspects of those companies that are coming public, all point to a very strong cycle for the IPO market. And one that is going to put the individual investor or the institutional investor in a very advantaged position because valuation models are at historic lows.</p><p>DASS: Companies David is watching out for include Gogo, the company that provides Internet access aboard planes. Software company with a focus on the TV industry NDS Group Holdings and marketing company Exact Target (NYSE:TGT). And then there is the 800 pound gorilla in the IPO market for 2012 better known as Facebook.</p><p>KRAPFEL: They have a prospectus ready to go, could file for the first time in January and looks like they`re targeting a second quarter 2012 filing. They`re targeting a $100 billion valuation and look to raise $10 billion.</p><p>DASS: With Facebook revenues expected to top $4 billion for 2011, investors might just like this IPO. Joya Dass for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead from us tonight, pain from paying into college to paying it off. It was one of the big issues for the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement. We`ll take a look at the state of student loans.</p><p>A quiet ending today through the year with the major averages sinking just a bit, capping really a volatile year for investors. Let`s go ahead and take a look at tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" Before we take a look back at the year that was, we will look at today`s trading activity with stocks sliding in to the New Year`s holiday and the long holiday weekend. The Dow Industrials Average spent almost the entire session in the red. The index continued dropping into the closing bell, ending the session down a little more than one half of 1 percent.</p><p>But as we reported at the beginning of the program, blue chips were the stocks of interest for investors. The Dow gained 5.5 percent this year, outpacing the other major stock averages. And leading the area for the Dow, McDonald`s, MCD, shares shooting up more than 30 percent this year as its North American business continued to strengthen even as the company raised some menu prices making up for higher commodity prices.</p><p>On the bottom meantime, the worst Dow stock, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) losing more than half its value as B of A continues battling the weak housing market -- worries about its financial stability and questions about its corporate leadership. Earlier this month, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shares dipped below $5 per share. Tonight they are just above $5.50 per share.</p><p>The stocks had plenty of ups and downs clearly this year, but it was not as volatile as some recent years. Thirty eight percent of trading sessions this year had swings of at least 1 percent for the S&amp;P 500. While that is more than last year, it`s actually less volatile than what we saw in 2009.</p><p>The year end numbers for the major indices would have been worse if it wasn`t for the nice rally in the fourth quarter that we`re looking at here. The Dow Industrials popping 12 percent this quarter, S&amp;P 500 up 11 percent. Remember it ended the year flat. The NASDAQ gained almost 8 percent over just the past three months.</p><p>The worst sector for the past quarter though was the telecom sector, dragged down by AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) dropping its buyout effort of T-Mobile. Today Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the telecom company canceling plans and deciding not go through with a new $2 fee for some wireless customers paying their bills over the phone or online. Customers and regulators complained about that. Shares gained just a fraction. It was enough to put Verizon (NYSE:VZ) at a new 52-week high tonight, the stock up 13 percent this year.</p><p>Two other telecom stocks rallying nicely, prepaid wireless provider Metro PCS jumping more than 5 percent on renewed speculation it could be a buyout target in the New Year. And Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR) jumping almost 3 percent. Piper Jaffray began coverage of the stock calling it \"neutral,\" but expecting its dividend to continue in the near term.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, bonds beat stocks this year as investors sought safety despite the U.S. losing its AAA credit rating this summer. The interest rate on the 10-year government note fell today down to 1.88 percent. As the rates fall of course, bond prices rise. This is the first year on record the 10-year note has closed out a calendar year with an interest rate below 2 percent. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Collectively Americans owe more money on student loans now than we do on our credit cards. Student debt is nearing $1 trillion. This was one of the big issues when college graduates joined \"Occupy Wall Street\" rallies across the country this fall, many of them voicing concern about rising tuition costs and mounting student debt crisis. Sylvia Hall tonight takes a look at what`s fueling soaring college costs and how to pay for them.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you went to an \"Occupy Wall Street\" protest, you wouldn`t have had to stay long before hearing angry cries of frustrated college graduates. The frustration has been fueled by ever-higher college tuition forcing more students to borrow more money to afford a higher education.</p><p>MARK KANTROWITZ, PUBLISHER, FINAID.COM: I`m very pessimistic about college affordability over the next decade.</p><p>HALL: Mark Kantrowitz publishes an top financial aid information web site. He says slim government budgets have slashed college and university funding, leading schools to have students pay a higher price. This year alone tuition at four-year public universities is up more than 8 percent from last year according to the College Board. The recession also has dealt a below to financial aid grants leaving students to foot more of the bill than ever before. For many it`s a bigger burden than they can afford.</p><p>KANTROWITZ: We see this first and foremost with the lower and moderate income students. They`re the canaries in the cage that keel over first.</p><p>HALL: Jane Wellman heads the Delta Cost Project, a non-profit tracking how colleges use their funds. She points to faculty benefits as one of the largest drivers of school spending.</p><p>JANE WELLMAN, EXECUTIVE DIR., DELTA COST PROJECT: We can`t expect students to pay for all of this. We shouldn`t have to.</p><p>HALL: She says many colleges are working to minimize tuition hikes. The school budgets aren`t nimble enough to shift quickly.</p><p>WELLMAN: The structural problems of higher education finance have been growing for 20 years. But the depth of the recession, the 2008 recession and the slow recovery from it, no one expects this is going to turn around any time soon.</p><p>HALL: With prices rising, experts like Reyna Gobel say paying for college doesn`t have to become a crisis because Federal student loans carry a variety of payment plans.</p><p>REYNA GOBEL, AUTHOR, \"GRADUATION DEBT\": Whatever you do, don`t give up on it, these type of loans. Don`t listen to its (ph) bears because you have so much power. You are the consumer. No matter how much money is in your pocket right now, you are the consumer and you have options. And don`t let`s anybody tell you different.</p><p>HALL: President Obama took up the student debt issue earlier this year by easing payback terms on some Federal student loans. But experts say ultimately making college more affordable must come from how states run higher education. Sylvia Hall, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Here is what we are watching for next week as 2012 gets under way. December economic data begins pouring in. We`ll see auto sales, manufacturing and the number everybody is watching on Friday of next week - - December`s employment report. Now Monday with the stock markets closed, we`ll bring you an NBR special edition. Women and leadership, focus on Pamela Newman, one of the insurance industry`s most powerful women.</p><p>While we await the auto industry`s December results, strong sales help drive Ford Motor (NYSE:F)`s recovery across the new milestone. 2011 sales of Ford brand cars and trucks topped two million units this week for the year, the first time since 2007 that any single auto brand has hit that mark. Ford`s F-series pickup trucks were the top selling vehicle in the nation as they have been for the past three decades. As far as total sales, Ford remains number two U.S. auto maker behind General Motors (NYSE:GM).</p><p>President Obama put his request to increase the nation`s debt limit on hold. The White House was expected today to ask for $1.2 trillion increase in the government`s ability to borrow money. Congressional leaders though asked for a delay saying they would like time to address the measure when they were back in session next month. Lawmakers are not due back in Washington until mid-January. The government is currently within about $100 billion of reaching its borrowing limit.</p><p>Despite all the sound and fury this year over European debt problems, quantitative easing here in the U.S. and record corporate profits, 2011 comes to an end, where it pretty much began at least for the S&amp;P 500 stock index. Tonight`s \"Market Monitor\" has one word to describe this year -- dividends. Sam Stovall is the chief investment strategist for Standard &amp; Poor`s Capital IQ with us tonight from New York. Happy New Year to you Samuel.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: Happy New Year, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Not exactly a bull market, certainly not a bear market, it was a market where shareholders got paid to wait. Is that the best description?</p><p>STOVALL: Absolutely. Not a bull, not a bear but a blah market and the investors who focused on quality as well as dividend yields were the ones who were rewarded.</p><p>HUDSON: Yeah and you can see that when you take a look at the top three stock sectors in the S&amp;P 500, utilities, consumer staples, health care, kind of defensive but also sectors that traditionally pay their shareholders. What went into that kind of stock performance this year?</p><p>STOVALL: I think basically the reason why you had the three best performing sectors post total returns above 13 percent each and not be cyclical sectors in nature is because they were substitutes for bonds. Investors were looking for nice payouts, dividend yields, some sort of a return that was better than money markets and also that would not present them with the potential of a bubble as some investors fear with the bond market. So they focused on these good total return sectors.</p><p>HUDSON: And at least for the utilities, a sector that really wasn`t in the headlines much, not much news going on there and perhaps it benefited from that.</p><p>STOVALL: Absolutely. You would have thought that telecom services group would have done better than it did because it does have the highest dividend yield of all 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500. But utilities beat out the telecom group, I think mainly as you said because of static demand and very high dividends.</p><p>HUDSON: Of course, in the telecom group, it was the big busted deal with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile to end the year. Meantime financials, banks were the weakest again. You know, it`s tough to get market to move forward when the financials aren`t moving forward, isn`t it?</p><p>STOVALL: It`s tough, certainly to get them moving forward for any long-term period. We were able to establish an all-time high back in 2007 when the financials were starting their nosedive. But obviously that advance did not last very long as we saw in 2008. So yes, we have the possibility for short-term advances in the market without the financials, but nothing that I think would be very long lasting.</p><p>HUDSON: So here we are again at the end of another year, Sam, you and I speaking pretty much where the S&amp;P 500 was a year ago when we were together. But corporate profits are at record levels, so what kind of valuation does that present investors as we begin a new year?</p><p>STOVALL: It presents investors with a very good valuation, actually a 10 percent discount to the median P/E since 1936. And history also says but does not guarantee that you would need to see the yield on the 10-year note rise above 7 percent in order for the P/E on the S&amp;P to be able to fall below 11. So we have very attractive P/E ratios and based on the yield on the 10-year note, not a good likelihood that we`ll see single digits any time soon.</p><p>HUDSON: With that in mind, we`ll take a look at the last year of trading for the S&amp;P 500 and despite all the ups and downs, we are pretty much where we began the year at and we`re close to the middle of the range from the April high to the October low. So what is the outlook for the S&amp;P 500 for 2012?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, the outlook on a price basis is probably a very, very low double digit advance. Corporate profits are likely to advance by more than 8 percent according to the S&amp;P Capital IQ consensus. Valuations look fairly attractive, no likelihood of a recession in the U.S., in our opinion, unless we are dragged lower by Europe and the possibility of a hard landing in China. And from a technical perspective, our belief is that the market is sort of like a coiled spring, poised to move higher, certainly into the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>HUDSON: And of course that also brings up the third and fourth quarter of 2012, big election. Could that hold back any gains?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, it could hold back some gains. I think the fact that 2011 the third year of the president`s term in office was such a lackluster year, historically it implies that we could end up with a blah 2012 as well.</p><p>HUDSON: We`ll leave it there. Happy New Year to you, great to see you. It`s our \"Market Monitor\" as we wind up the year, Sam Stovall with S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p><p>Finally tonight, when the ball drops in Times Square, New York City tomorrow night, it will ring in more than just the New Year. It also rings in the new energy, independence and security Act. It`s a mouth full but to mark the occasion, all 32,000 balls on the Times Square ball are energy efficient. The bill is designed to encourage new lighting technology like LED and halogen bulbs. It`s aimed at cutting energy consumption and saving consumers money. Thanks to all of those new balls this year, the Times Square ball drop will use, get this, 88 percent less electricity than previous years.</p><p>That`s it for us for this year and for tonight. It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday December 30th, the last trading day of 2011. I`m Tom Hudson. Thanks for joining us. From all of us at NBR, have a happy and safe New Year. We`ll see you back here in 2012.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

We saw ups  and big slides down.  But now that the nerve-wracking week is over, what  happens next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Sentenced reduced.   He was the man at the center of one of the most notorious financial  scandals in U.S. history.  And today, the former CEO of Enron was told  he'll get out of jail early. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Age of insourcing.  After years of seeing jobs go overseas,  companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are reversing  the trend and keeping some jobs right here in the U.S.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June  21st </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>Sue Herera joins me tonight.  Susie Gharib has the evening off. </p><p>Well, you couldn't really call it a come back day, not after  Thursday's 350-point Dow infarction.  But the patient was stabilized,  despite some wild swings on the so-called quadruple winching day when  certain options and future contracts expire. </p><p>On heavy volume, the Dow rocked and rolled and finished 41 points  higher at 14,799.  The NASDAQ was dragged lower, especially by Oracle  (NASDAQ:ORCL), which fell 9 percent on an earnings miss last quarter  reported yesterday.  NASDAQ dipped more than seven points, to $33.57.  The  S&amp;P 500 gained mere four points, to 1,592.  The yield on the benchmark 10- year treasury note, hitting 2.59 percent, the highest in nearly two years. </p><p>Overall, the week answered some questions: no, stocks don't always go  up; yes, the Fed will stop buying bonds sometimes.  But it also left some  queries hanging in the winds. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over):  For most of us, thoughts about our  investments this week were unnerving, to say the least. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is a lot of uncertainty out there. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you take a few bruises, you got to put your  best game in there.  What do you do?  That's the stock market.  That's how  it works.</p><p>MATHISEN:  At the start of the week a two-day run-up on the Dow and  S&amp;P put May's record highs back in sight. </p><p>Then came Wednesday, and a 200-point drop after Federal Chairman Ben  Bernanke put investors on notice with word the Fed may trim its bond-buying  before the end of the year and end it not long after that. </p><p>BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  We will continue to reduce  the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next  year, ending purchases around mid year. </p><p>MATHISEN:  With the end of the Fed's asset buying program in sight,  stocks dropped another 300 points Thursday before stabilizing today.  Of  course, that plan depends on whether the economy continues to improve. </p><p>Gone in two days were the last two months of gains in the stock  market.  For the year, though, stocks are still up more than 12 percent,  even if a lot of us have doubts about the health of the economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Unemployment needs to be fixed, it's horrible.   The housing market still isn't really good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm worried about the economy. </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, what's next?  The year is almost half way down.   Corporate reports will come out soon, even experts are nervous.  That  housing recovery, well, mortgage rates are inching up. </p><p>BRAD HUNTER:  Everyone is getting a little spooked.</p><p>MEGAN MCGRATH:  These stocks are going to be very volatile until we  get some clarity around what the Feds doing. </p><p>MATHISEN:  There is no shortage of opinions even inside the Fed  itself. </p><p>St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, still worried about the economy  today said the announcement of a bond-buying pullback was, quote,  \"inappropriate time\".</p><p>Others say Bernanke and Fed got just what they wanted.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS:  I think the Fed was purposely  trying to take some air out of the housing market and stock market.  They  don't want the stock market going up 20 percent every six months.  They  don't want house prices rising 10-plus percent year over year for the next  five years.</p><p>MATHISEN:  But others took Bernanke at his word, that the economy is  recovering, that a policy charge is just a short-term shock to the system.</p><p>DAVID KELLY:  We're bating over medicating this economy.  This  economy is like a 12-year-old sitting on a bicycle with training wheels.   It can cycle forward on its own. </p><p>DAVID SEABURG, COWEN &amp; COMPANY:  Where are you going to put your  money right now?  In cash?  I don't think so.</p><p>Are you going to put it in the 30-year?  I don't have an interest in  having that duration risk.  I'm going to put it in equity.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And with the quarter ending next week, market watchers say  they expect professional investors to buy blue chips to dress up their  portfolios. </p><p>HERERA:  Some burned investors in bankrupt energy giant Enron may  have a little bit more to be upset about today.  A shortened prison  sentenced for the jailed one-time chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling. </p><p>Scott Cohn was in the courtroom for this controversial decision today  and he joins us live from Houston.</p><p>So, Scott, why the more lenient resentencing and why right now? </p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know,  since, Sue, it makes sense for a guy in charge of an energy trading  company, this was basically a trade off.  A federal appeals court had  already said that the original sentence, 24 years, was too harsh.  It  should be more like 15 or 16 years. </p><p>Skilling wasn't willing to settle for that initially.  He was going  to charge the government committed misconduct in prosecuting the case.   That would drag it out for a whole lot longer. </p><p>So, ultimately, the government and Skilling came to this agreement,  where Skilling would drop the remaining appeals, $40 million would be  returned to the investors, the convictions would stand but he would get out  of prison early, basically 14 years.  But time out for good behavior, he'll  be out in about 11 or in 2017.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Give us a sense, Scott, if you would, of the atmosphere in  the courtroom today and how did Skilling look?  You've been working this  story for years.</p><p>COHN:  Skilling is 59 years old and he looks every bit of that.  He's  grown a beard since he's been in prison.  He looks like he's aged somewhat.   He was in prison garb.  In handcuffs initially and then they took them off.</p><p>This courtroom was packed with Skilling supporters.  The judge said  250 people had written in support of Jeff Skilling.  Among the people in  the courtroom, Skilling's family, his wife Rebecca, members of Ken Lay's  family.  Remember, Ken Lay passed away in 2006, shortly after he was  convicted, then those convictions wiped out. </p><p>One victim spoke for those who are victimized by this scandal, Dianna  Peters, a former Enron employee, who said that Skilling betrayed the  employees' trust.</p><p>HERERA:  Talk more about that, Scott.  What exactly does this mean  for Enron's victims?</p><p>COHN:  Well, for one thing, they will get this $20 million held in  escrow since the trial in 2006.  All of that money will go to the victims. </p><p>Now, that's pittance in terms of the $60 billion or so that was lost  and there have been some big settlements in the order of about $7 billion  mainly with some of the banks that were involved.  But they will get some  money back and that's something that the Justice Department is emphasizing  in all of this, that they didn't come down that much from what the appeals  court wanted.  People will get their money back and most important, they  say, Skilling will not be able to challenge his convictions.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Scott Cohn, an honorary citizen of Houston after all the  type you spent down there -- Scott, have a good weekend.  </p><p>Good news about jobs to tell you about.  Unemployment rates fell in  about half in all states in May led by big declines on the jobless rolls in  California, West Virginia, New York and Hawaii.  California's unemployment  rate is now 8.6 percent, higher than average.  But it is at its lowest in  five years. </p><p>Overall, North Dakota has the lowest of unemployment, 3.2 percent,  and Nevada, the highest at 9.3 percent.  The rates rose in 17 states and  remained the same in eight more. </p><p>HERERA:  And there was also good news, about autos sales, but this  time, used auto sales.  Car Max, the nation's biggest used car dealership  chain with 120 stores nationwide, reported a 21 percent rise in profits  last quarter on a 22 percent jump in sales.  Prices on those used cars were  also up about 1 percent from a year ago. </p><p>MATHISEN:  If you're flying instead of driving, there may be some  relief on board that plane.  The Federal Aviation Administration is  expected to relax the ban on using some personal electronic devices during  taxiing, take-offs and landings and low altitude flying.  The ban of making  cell phone calls, however, will likely remain in effect but passengers may  soon be allowed to use e-readers, tablets and MP3 players without  admonishment from airline staff. </p><p>The actor Alec Baldwin who was famously thrown off an American  Airlines flight in 2011 for refusing to stop playing the game \"Words with  Friends\" on his smartphone during take off tweeted this reaction, \"If  you're flying first class on American Air, I'd still apply an extra measure  of restraint.\"</p><p>HERERA:  Well, the easing back of those airline rules may have turned  the initial public stock offering for Gogo into more of a no-no.  Shares of  the airline Internet service provider tumbled on their first day of trading  today.  After pricing last night at $17 a share, Gogo shares closed nearly  6 percent lower, at exactly $16 a piece.</p><p>Another big tech company is on the move.  The company that makes  smartphones for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Mac Pros for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is making efforts to move manufacturing back to the U.S.  It's called  onshoring.</p><p>And Jon Fortt has our story tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's  become an article of faith in America these days, manufacturing jobs that  have gone overseas can't come back.  American workers cost too much and  don't have the cutting-edge skills to build the latest gadgets. </p><p>But what if that is wrong?  In just the past month, Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) have both announced products they  plan to make here.  Apple's, a high end computer. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is designed by brilliant engineers in  California and assembled here in the USA. </p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a fantastic device we want to get in the  hands.</p><p>FORTT:  Google's, a risky new smartphone we haven't seen yet. </p><p>(on camera):  For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's a major gamble.  If it  succeeds, made in America is a major selling point for a cutting-edge  phone.  If it fails, American dreams and real American jobs are at stake.</p><p>ROBERT REICH, UNIV. OF CA (NASDAQ:CA)., BERKELEY:  Certainly, it will  boost morale.  I mean, I think a lot of people for a long time were kind of  economic determinist.  They assumed that our jobs, particular our low-skill  jobs would go abroad to the lowest waged countries, and that was never  wholly the case, but when manufacturing does start coming back, people's  hopes will get up.</p><p>FORTT (voice-over):  Flextronics, the contract manufacturer, will be  building both Apple's Mac Pro and Google's Motorola X phone, both later  this year.  Why make them in the U.S.?  The cost of labor is raising in  China and Malaysia, for one.</p><p>And as innovators like Tesla have shown, when there is a brand-new  high margin product that needs close attention, sometimes, it's worth it to  have it crafted close to home. </p><p>MIKE MCNAMARA, FLEXTRONICS CEO:  We're seeing a lot of work move into  places like Texas where we put up the Moto X factory and as well into North  Carolina, South Carolina.  These kinds of places, the governments are very  aggressive at improving regulation so it's pro-business and keeping taxes  down and really working to stimulate jobs. </p><p>FORTT (on camera):  It will probably take years for this story to  play out for us to see if tech really can bring American manufacturing jobs  back long-term.  But this initial chapter is key.  If names as big as Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can't succeed at this, chances are  the others won't be about to, either. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, how big American companies are taking advantage  of an even bigger trend, urbanization, especially in China.  But, first, a  look at the best performing stocks of the S&amp;P this week. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Violent protests continue to rock the streets of Brazil's  biggest cities for the second week running.  As an estimated 1 million  people rallied against the government for raising prices on public service  last night, some cities even cancelled the transit fair hikes that set off  those demonstrations a week ago.  But that didn't stop the protest.  More  unrest is expected tonight in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, and other major  cities.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Two U.S. senators say a Chinese company's purchase of  Smithfield Foods (NYSE:SFD) is quote difficult to square, but the Chinese's  government's restrictions on U.S. pork and beef exports.  Senators Max  Baucus and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and a Republican, say the interest of  U.S. farmers and ranchers must be protected, calling for a full review of  Shuanghui group's planned acquisition of Smithfield.   That's the world's  largest pork producer.  </p><p>HERERA:  And in China, the government is pushing ahead with a  sweeping plan to move millions of rural residents into more populated areas  and this growth and urbanization has not gone unnoticed by some of  America's biggest companies.</p><p>Eunice Yoon reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  All  over the world, people are heading to the cities.  Nowhere of that more  true than in China.  By 2030, one in eight people on the planet will live  in a Chinese city. </p><p>That's good for companies like Honeywell. </p><p>STEPHEN SHANG, HONEYWELL CHINA CEO:  The wealth of these people is  increasing at a tremendous peak. </p><p>YOON:  Honeywell is betting big on China's plans to build up its  cities.  The American industrial giant has opened up new factories like  this one in a midwestern city of Chongqing, expecting its urbanization  expertise in the U.S. and Europe to translate here. </p><p>SHANG:  Urbanization is really, if you look at it, it's a building of  the mega, mega movement and not in one location but all across China, new  towns, new subways, new trains, new planes, new hospitals and they are all  in the Honeywell scope. </p><p>YOON (on camera):  If China wasn't urbanizing at this fast a pace,  would your growth be as strong? </p><p>SHANG:  Of course not. </p><p>YOON (voice-over):  Honeywell is making and selling brake pads here.   It's targeting sales growth about double the country's growth rate, which  is currently above 7 percent. </p><p>To build it cities, China needs everything, Australian iron for steel  beams to American bulldozers. </p><p>(on camera):  At shopping plazas like this one, you can see all sorts  of international brands, with more and more for Chinese moving into the  city, companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), H&amp;M, and Gucci can make more  consumers here than ever before. </p><p>SHANG:  They create jobs for us in China, but also create jobs for  U.S.  Many of this product know-how (ph) is in the foreign countries.  As  in the process of localization, you actually create for jobs for these  foreign countries, whether it's the U.S., Germany or U.K.  So everybody  benefits.</p><p>YOON (voice-over):  Welcomed news with economy so weak back at home.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And tonight in \"Market Focus\", some bargain hunting on the  day after the big Dow dipper. </p><p>Bristol-Myers gaining back most of its Thursday's loss as investors  cheered FDA labeling approval for leukemia treatment.  Shares of Bristol- Myers up 2.5 percent on above average volume.  It closed at $45.73. </p><p>DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) meanwhile, touching a new five-year high  as it abandoned its efforts to acquire Sprint.  DISH took on more than $2.6  billion in debt and interest to finance the Sprint deal.  They're not going  to be spending it now.  That didn't matter to the market today as DISH  network gained more than 3 percent to close at $41.40.  DISH up 7 percent  since it lost that Sprint bid back in April. </p><p>HERERA:  Archer Daniels Midland gained after saying that it's in  talks to sell its coco business, about 4 percent of its overall sales.  ADM  shares were up almost 1 1/2 percent, closing at $33.09.</p><p>And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also gained today on an upgrade to buy from  neutral over at UBS.  And some astonishing stats on Instagram video.  One  year of video was uploaded in the first eight hours.  In other words, it  would take a year to watch all of those videos and remember, they are only  15 seconds long. </p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) acquired Instagram in September of 2012.  And in  today's trade, shares tacked on 2 1/2 percent, closing at $24.53. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And time now to turn our attention to this week's market  monitor guest who says she is positive on equities both over the short and  the long-term.  She's Judy Saryan, portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN)  Vance.</p><p>Judy, welcome.  What a week, great week to have you here with us. </p><p>Explain why you think this is not just -- not a fatally wounded bull  market. </p><p>JUDY SARYAN, EATON VANCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Well, I'm very happy to  be here, Tyler.</p><p>I think that the move by the Fed and the comments by Bernanke  indicate that the economy is growing.  It's not growing too rapidly.  It's  not growing too slowly.  It's just right. </p><p>And I think that is really the key underpin of the market. </p><p>So, we're very positive about the market, both near term and long  term.  The Fed is basically on the track that they set.  There is really  nothing new in what they said. </p><p>HERERA:  Judy, though, we did see a lot of volatility this week and  we've seen interest rates move quite a bit higher than they were a couple  weeks ago.  Does that worry you at all?  I mean, it's good for savers  certainly.  But does it worry you about the market's ability to move  forward in the market?</p><p>SARYAN:  The interest level has moved up.  It was pretty dramatic in  the last couple weeks.  But at this current level, the 10-year Treasury 2.5  percent, that's still a very reasonable interest rate.  I believe the  economy can grow with that rate.  It's not a problem for the housing  market.</p><p>And, of course, the housing market is key for the growth in the  economy but housing is still extremely affordable at record rates in terms  of affordability.  It would take rates going much higher before we saw  that, you know, really affect or impact the housing market.</p><p>MATHISEN:  I think our viewers have their pencils ready, Judy, for a  couple of your stocks picks.  And a couple of stocks on your list this week  are banks -- one big, one somewhat smaller.  Let's start with the big one,  which is Citigroup (NYSE:C).</p><p>SARYAN:  OK.  Well, at Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance, where you focus on  fundamentals and the fundamentals are very positive for Citigroup (NYSE:C).   There are several positive factors favoring Citigroup (NYSE:C).  There's an  improvement in the capital market's activity. </p><p>Also, Citigroup (NYSE:C) benefits from the real estate market.  In  fact, they are going to be releasing $8.5 billion in reserves from the  North American Mortgage business.  So that will be a strong tail wind to  earnings looking out this year. </p><p>On top of that, the evaluation is very attractive.  The stock is  selling at 63 percent of book, a low P/E ratio and I think the stock could  get up to book value.</p><p>HERERA:  I would assume housing would help the next pick, which is  Regions. </p><p>SARYAN:  Absolutely.  Regions Financial is a regional bank.  About 55  percent of their portfolio is in loans so they benefit from the real estate  market.  They are selling at a very attractive valuation.  They have a  reasonable yield and we're expecting dividend growth out of Regions as  well. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's see if we can squeeze in two more very quickly, 15  seconds for each.  One is Sanofi and the other is Phillips 66. </p><p>SARYAN:  OK.  On Sanofi, it's a French-based company.  Great  pharmaceutical company.  Very strong position in the diabetes market place.   They've got one of the strong insulin drugs and that business is doing very  well.  They've also got some very strong positions in the vaccine business.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And Phillips. </p><p>SARYAN:  And on Phillips, they are -- became independent about a year  ago from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).  Strong free cash flow, over $4 billion  we project this year and potential to grow that dividend at a very nice  clip, very inexpensive stock, selling at a 7 multiple on P/E.  Great stuff.</p><p>MATHISEN:  I assume, Judy, that your funds own all of these companies  or your business does.  Any other disclosures? </p><p>SARYAN:  No, that would be the primary disclosure. </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right. Judy, thank you very much.  Judy Saryan is  portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance. </p><p>And still ahead, after falling, excuse me, to the bottom of the pizza  food chain, we'll show you how Domino's turned things around and delivered  for shareholders. </p><p>But, first, a look at some of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P  this week. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is raising its prices.  The java  giant plans to jack up prices on some of its drinks but only by an average  of 1 percent.  For some markets, the company say it will be the first price  hike in about two years.</p><p>Even though coffee bean prices have been dropping, Starbucks  (NASDAQ:SBUX) blames the increase on higher rents, labor costs and raising  prices milk and sugar.</p><p>HERERA:  And those rising material costs and changing consumer tastes  are some of the biggest challenges for eateries.  And there is one chain  that's worked very hard to figure out what its customers want and has  succeeded, delivering for both diners and investors.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has the latest in NBR series on \"Comeback Companies\"  with a look at pizza giant, Domino's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDNT (voice-over):   In 2009, Domino's ranked at the bottom of a consumer survey on pizza taste  preferences, tied with Chuck E. Cheese's -- particularly galling for the  company that virtually invented the pizza delivery chain business. </p><p>The situation was desperate. </p><p>PATRICK DOYLE, DOMINO'S PIZZA PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  The combination of  poor results for a couple of years in our domestic business and then, you  know, some surveys coming out that were not particularly kind to us and the  quality of our pizza, it sent us into a room one day.  We made the decision  that it was time to really fix this. </p><p>DEANGELIS:  But, now, four years later, Domino's is at the top of the  latest rankings and people love their pizza. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Their food is really delicious.  It's really  savoring.  It really feels in your taste buds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Domino's is a good place to come because it's  cheap and you get a lot of food for like money and have a lot of good  deals. </p><p>DEANGELIS:  How did Domino's do it?  First, they fixed the pizza. </p><p>DOYLE:  Brought the team in and said, look, everything is on the  table.  You can chance anything and we just simply want to have the best  pizza out there. </p><p>DEANGELIS:  Then they stream lined business, adding online ordering  for convenience and to drive sales. </p><p>DOYLE:  Digital orders have been growing about 5 percent a year as a  mix of our total sales.  So we're now in the 35 percent to 45 percent  range.  Customer satisfaction is higher, order accuracy is higher.  The  ticket on those orders is a little bit higher.  The labor cost is slightly  little lower.  So everything is better. </p><p>DEANGELIS:  Those who invested in Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) has seen  a sweet return, after hitting a low of $3.30 a share in November of 2008,  the stock has run up nearly 1,800 percent. </p><p>The turnaround has been good for investors and also employees. </p><p>DOYLE:  Over 90 percent of our franchises in the U.S. started as  hourly workers in our stores, either as delivery drivers or customer  service representatives.  They worked their way up through -- to become a  manager and then bought their first store. </p><p>DEANGELIS (on camera):  But there are challenges ahead for Domino's:  one is growing the international business, especially in China, to keep up  with the competition. </p><p>STEPHEN ANDERSON, MILLER TABAK SENIOR RESTAUTRANT ANALYST:  I think  one of the ways that Domino's can succeed in China is having a broad menu  approach or maybe specializing in chicken, which is a very popular fast  food staple in China. </p><p>DEANGELIS:  So, the stock that has doubled since last year at this  time still have room to run? </p><p>ANDERSON:  I don't think it moves much higher right now.  I think the  challenge that Domino's faces in the next 12 months.  It will be up against  a tougher year of comparisons, particularly in the U.S. coming off the  introduction of pan pizza very late in the third quarter.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, an appropriate end of what must  inevitably be called a roller costar week on Wall Street and it comes just  in time for the start of summer. </p><p>Take a look at the full throttle rollercoaster debuting today at Six  Flags Magic Mountain outside Los Angeles. </p><p>I bet, Sue, you grew up going there. </p><p>HERERA:  I went to Magic Mountain. </p><p>MATHISEN:  It is the world's tallest and fastest looping roller  coaster top speed 70 miles per hour through a 160-foot high loop.</p><p>HERERA:  Mercifully, they didn't have that when I went to Magic  Mountain.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera, in for  Susie Gharbi.  Thanks for joining us. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen have a great weekend, everybody.

I`m Susie Gharib.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) says it will bring some computer production back to the United States, but why has the stock dropped more than 20 percent this fall?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: The fiscal cliff moves to the kitchen table. President Obama visits a Virginia family and tells them how the cliff could impact their budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: And a very special conversation tonight with Paul Kangas. NBR`s founding co-anchor joins us to answer your questions.</p><p>GHARIB: We have that and more right here tonight on NBR.</p><p>HUDSON: Millions and millions of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) brag they were designed in California, but admit they were built in China. Next year, some of those Macs will be built in the U.S. too. CEO Tim Cook made the pledge to return to U.S. manufacturing in two media interviews. It marks a return for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which transferred most of its technology building to Asia more than a decade ago. It`s more of a symbolic move though than a big financial investment. After all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) spends more than $9 billion a year on manufacturing and the U.S. commitment is expected to be about $100 million or 1 percent of its global factory investments. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn`t say where in the U.S. the line of Mac computers would be built or how many jobs might be included. Now the return of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to U.S. manufacturing comes as shareholders have experienced a very rocky ride in the past few months. The stock is down 22 percent from its all-time high in September. Suzanne Pratt reports.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A peak inside this Manhattan Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and it looks like everything is a- OK, plenty of customers, plenty of purchases. So why has the shine come off Apple`s shares? Within a word, actually two, profit-taking.</p><p>BRIAN COSTELLO, SR. EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: I think the biggest reason for the selling going back to when it was priced $700 in September has been pure profit-taking. If you look from the beginning of the year to September, the stock was up 74 percent. So I think you had some natural profit-taking.</p><p>PRATT: But this isn`t ordinary year-end selling by institutions looking to record nice numbers. This supposedly is fiscal cliff related selling as shareholders worry that capital gains tax rates will be higher next year. Still, financial planner Sharon Appelman says selling stock solely for tax reasons isn`t the best idea.</p><p>SHARON APPELMAN, FINANCIAL PLANNER: I definitely think it`s a legitimate concern and can be an opportunity. And I would say if somebody was interested in reducing a position anyway, that can certainly be a great time to do it. You know, why pay higher taxes in a few months time when you can pay a lower tax now?</p><p>PRATT: And some analysts say, before unloading the shares, consider that fundamentals for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven`t really changed. Sure, revenue growth may slow and there are worries the tech giant will have trouble fending off competition from increasingly popular Android products. But to some analysts, the shares look especially cheap today, especially considering their move south since the September high.</p><p>COSTELLO: We think the smart phone trend is still in the early to middle innings. It is not in the late innings yet. So we think, to the extent that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can maintain its share of the premium smart phone market, we think they`ll do quite well. You throw the iPad on top of it and how it`s cannibalizing PCs, that`s another great growth driver.</p><p>PRATT: It is worth noting that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are still up more than 30 percent this year. Even with more tax-related selling, it will be tough to erase all of those profits in the next few weeks. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose more than 1.5 percent today and that gave a boost to stocks. Also better than expected job news encouraged investors. New claims for jobless benefits fell by 25,000 in the week ending December 1 to a lower than expected 370,000 requests and that could be a good sign for the November jobs report that comes out tomorrow and we`ll have more on that in just a moment. Separately, American companies announced 57,000 job cuts in November. That`s accord to employment firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, says that`s 20 percent higher from October`s levels. On Wall Street today, the Dow rose 39 points, the NASDAQ added 15, the S&amp;P up nearly five.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Erika Miller in New York. Coming up tonight, we`ll talk to the CEO of kitchen store Sur la Table and get his outlook for holiday sales.</p><p>HUDSON: Lots of theatrics today, but few visible signs of progress in Washington towards a fix for the fiscal cliff. The only hopeful sign is that Republicans and Democrats are talking privately again. There remains a lot of work ahead certainly including what to do about the nation`s debt limit. Washington will hit its borrowing limit early next year. Darren Gersh has the latest.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Sitting around the kitchen table with a middle class family in Virginia, the president once again pressed for Congress to avoid the fiscal cliff.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If this family has a couple of thousand dollars less to spend, that translates into $200 billion of less consumer spending next year. And that`s bad for businesses, large and small.</p><p>GERSH: Behind the scenes, the two sides are talking again. But there was no progress in public. Senators today fought over the debt limit and ended up deadlocked over a bill to allow the president to automatically increase borrowing.</p><p>SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, MINORITY LEADER: He`s shown what he is really after is assuming unprecedented power to spend taxpayer dollars without any limit at all.</p><p>GERSH: If the debt limit isn`t raised, the country can`t pay for the spending Congress has already approved. And economists say the nation pays a high price for this kind of brinkmanship.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ANALYTICS: Business people aren`t going to engage unless they have clarity with respect to this thing.</p><p>GERSH: But few insiders expect to find much clarity from Washington in the coming weeks. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Investors will be searching for more clarity on those fiscal cliff talks and they will also be studying tomorrow`s important jobs report. But Josh Feinman says the November numbers won`t give an accurate picture of the labor market. He`s chief economist at DB Advisors. Hi, Josh, so you`re talking about distortions in that report. Tell us more.</p><p>JOSH FEINMAN, CHIEF GLOBAL ECONOMIST, DB ADVISORS: Yes, hi, Susie. I think that the hurricane Sandy may distort the numbers. We`ve seen it in some of the other high frequency data in the last couple of weeks. Keep in mind tomorrow`s labor market report will report on a snapshot of the labor market that was taken in the middle of last month. And that`s when the hurricane and its aftermath were having their effects.</p><p>GHARIB: So the consensus numbers from a survey of economists, they`re expecting American businesses added 110,000 jobs to their payroll. Their unemployment rate staying around 7.9 percent. Does that sit right with you? Is that what you are seeing?</p><p>FEINMAN: Probably somewhere around that, maybe a little less. One of the problems is it is hard to gauge exactly what the impact of the storm will have. We know it`s transitory but it`s hard to say exactly how much numerically it will subtract. The thing is, if the number comes in lower than that I think a lot of people will say oh, it was probably the effect of the hurricane and they`ll wait until the following month to see what kind of a rebound we get.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s talk a little bit about what we can expect from the job market going forward. I don`t know if you saw Alan Blinder`s op/ed piece in \"The Wall Street Journal.\" The former Fed governor saying that if we go over the fiscal cliff, the unemployment rate will jump to 11 percent because we`ll be a recession and customarily when you are in a recession, the unemployment rate goes up 3 percentage points. Does that sound right to you? And if that is the case, what does this mean for consumers and for businesses?</p><p>FEINMAN: Well, it would be seriously bad news. But I think what is important is not just whether we go over the cliff but how long we stay over there. I mean if it turns out that they need a couple more days to hammer out an accord, I don`t think that`s going to have a big lasting effect. But if we go over the cliff and all those spending cuts and all those tax hikes go into effect and stay in effect for the whole year, then you would be talking about a very high likelihood of a recession and a rising unemployment, a substantial rise, we can quibble about how much. But it would be seriously bad news for consumers and businesses.</p><p>GHARIB: As you know Josh, the Federal Reserve is going to be meeting next week on Tuesday. Certainly this is all going to be a topic around the table. Is there a role for the Federal Reserve in this fiscal cliff back and forth?</p><p>FEINMAN: There really isn`t a direct role that they can play. This is fiscal policy. The Fed does not make fiscal policy. It makes monetary policy. I think Chairman Bernanke and others have been very clear to stay out of the battle that has to be resolved by the Congress and the administration. Look, I think at the end of the day, they are going to reach some sort of an accord to avert the most draconian aspects of the fiscal cliff. Maybe the 11th, or 12th or maybe even the 13th hour, but I think they are going to reach that because I think they recognize that the consequences of not doing so are so severe.</p><p>GHARIB: But let`s face it, that even if there is a deal, we`re talking about an economy that is going to have to deal with people having higher taxes and dealing with spending cuts. What are you projecting for 2013 real quickly? We have a little time left, for economic growth and unemployment.</p><p>FEINMAN: Sure. I think the economy is going to be facing some fiscal drag from the Federal side, but if it is phased in slowly, it`s not really austere and abrupt, I think it can handle it because I think the private sector is healing and I`m looking for some improvement in growth by the second half of the year provided that we don`t hit a landmine here on the fiscal side.</p><p>GHARIB: All right, Josh, thanks so much, great talking with you. We`ve been speaking with Josh Feinman of DB Advisors.</p><p>HUDSON: Nearly a month and a half after super storm Sandy wreaked havoc along the New Jersey shore, President Obama met today with Governor Chris Christie at the White House. The topic was Federal aid for storm recovery. The president is expected to ask Congress for about $50 billion in additional emergency help. Ruben Ramirez is in Seaside Heights, New Jersey tonight, where business owners are still trying to recover. Ruben?</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Tom. Yes, nearly six weeks after super storm Sandy devastated this barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, there`s still a curfew in place. A lot of the traffic you see behind me is a lot of those longtime residents from the island and business owners who have been going back day in and day out, trying to recover and repair whatever`s left. Some of those business owners we had a chance to speak to today. They say they`ll reopen come next summer. You`ve been in business 33 years. Have you seen this sort of devastation before?</p><p>SAM HAMMER, OWNER, CRAB`s CLAW INN: No, nothing like this. We -- that`s the reason we stayed because they were explaining that there was going to be a terrible storm. But we, of this magnitude we had no idea. This is just like -- hard to believe.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Here we are almost six weeks after the storm hit. How soon until you get the business open and up and running again?</p><p>JIM BOEKHOLT, OWNER, BEN FRANKLIN: There`s a few problems -- electrical and structural. But hopefully in the next maybe two months, we might be able to get open again. But definitely we will be open for the summer season.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Tom, some of those small business owners we spoke to say they didn`t have flood insurance because they say the summer season is short here and the insurance is just too expensive. Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Thanks, Ruben. You`ll have more from Seaside Heights tomorrow. We have more on how insurance companies manage risk when it comes to natural disasters Learn about the modeling on our web site, nbr.com. Look for that nbr-u tab.</p><p>GHARIB: Americans were feeling a little richer recently, thanks to gains in real estate and the stock market. The Federal Reserve said today that household net worth rose to nearly $65 trillion between July and September. That`s up nearly $2 trillion from the previous quarter. Net worth is total assets, like homes and stock portfolios, minus liabilities like mortgages and credit card debt. That wealth effect could make consumers feel more comfortable about shopping this holiday season. There are still 20 days to go before Christmas and the rush is on. Toys are always popular items of course, but there`s one category that`s expected to do even better and no, it`s not electronics. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>MILLER: For many families, the holidays are all about the home. Few retailers know that better than Sur la Table, a 104-store chain selling kitchenware and tabletop items. CEO Jack Schwefel says sales are off to a strong start, and credits changing American values.</p><p>JACK SCHWEFEL, PRES &amp; CEO, SUR LA TABLE: I think Americans are realizing the importance of the family meal, where people get together. No matter how crazy the day is, you can have that moment every day where it becomes the most important moment of the day and you share it with the people you love the most.</p><p>MILLER: Unlike many retailers, Sur la Table says it hasn`t had a problem with showrooming this holiday season. That`s when people come in to browse, but purchase cheaper versions online. Part of the reason is that 40 percent of the store`s products are exclusive.</p><p>SCHWEFEL: One of the things that we are most proud of is the fact that we still import more product from Europe than we do from China. So you are talking about artisan product, product that has a story to it, that`s special. You just don`t see that in retailing in America.</p><p>MILLER: Stores like Sur la Table are expected to be one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster holiday season. In fact, some analyst think home goods will be hotter than toys this holiday year. IBM projects home goods will see the strongest sales growth this year, up over 6 percent. That`s far more than toys and electronics.</p><p>JILL PUFERI, GLOBAL RETAIL LEADER, IBM: You might ask yourself, why home, right? And we think home is up because of a lot of things -- things like the changing demographic of the home itself. There`s one stat that says 41 percent of those between 25 and 29 are living back at home.</p><p>MILLER: But there also a second reason.</p><p>PUFERI: We think that this holiday people are buying what they need versus what they want.</p><p>MILLER: Which had me wondering what`s on Jack Schwefel`s wish list this holiday season. It wasn`t this $5,500 coffee maker.</p><p>SCHWEFEL: There are some new knives in our store that I`m actually pretty excited about, so probably those. They`re cutting board material is actually used in the handle of the knives.</p><p>MILLER: And there`s no denying it will look good sur la table during the holidays. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: I know what`s on your wish list. A lot of people are buying new housewares. You love cooking.</p><p>HUDSON: I do love cooking. Listen I think is great that the house goods category is seeing some good growth here. It says that there is a lot of confidence in the housing market number one. But let`s face it, just because it`s home goods doesn`t mean it`s cheap Susie or inexpensive. A $5500 coffeemaker, some of these home appliance blenders can be $500.</p><p>GHARIB: If you are looking for discounts Tom, now there is green Monday. We have black Friday. We`ve had cyber Monday. Green Monday is the second Monday in December and that`s when there is a lots of discounts online. So it will be good for consumers.</p><p>HUDSON: We`ve been talking a lot about the fiscal cliff, but I think there is the holiday cliff almost every year which is that game of chicken between stores. Are they going have to discount as we get closer to the holidays or are consumers, shoppers going to spend the money that the stores are asking for right now? Clearly another indication that stores perhaps may be getting a little bit nervous now.</p><p>GHARIB: Speaking of green, there was some green on Wall Street today.</p><p>HUDSON: There was some buying on Wall Street. Let`s take a look at our \"Market Focus\" here Susie and we saw some better than expected data on first-time unemployment claims leading to a bit of a choppy start for the S&amp;P 500. After Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) went positive in the 10:00 a.m. Eastern time hour, so did the index. Tech stocks turned solidly higher, so did the market, finishing up a third of a percent. Trading volume still moderate, 616 million shares on the big board, just over 1.7 trading on the NASDAQ.</p><p>It was the tech sector that led the way, up 0.8 of a percent. Consumer discretionary sector added 0.6 of 1 percent on the session. Now the big tech names in the Dow industrials weren`t left out in the rally. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had the biggest percentage gains of the Dow 30 stocks. Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) up 1.6 percent. The CEO said the company could manufacture semiconductors for other chip makers quote, for the right types of products, end quote. So, queue the rumors today that hint about maybe Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) possibly making chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>How about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems moving up 1.4 percent. The move takes Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to its highest price since September. The top tech sector stock was Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM). It helps speed up and manage online content and traffic. A new partnership announced today with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) led to the rally. Shares jumping 10 percent on heavy volume. Analysts say the deal turns AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) from a competitor to Akamai`s customer, eliminating rival business for Akamai.</p><p>On the consumer side, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) red hot. The company said it will pay more taxes in Britain in the next two years. Yesterday, it also announced plans to open at least 1,500 new stores in the U.S. over the next five years. Shares of SBUX jumping 5.7 percent. Volume tripled today with the stock closing tonight at five-month highs.</p><p>How about tax prep giant H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB)? It sits at a new 52- week high tonight. It lost less money than feared last quarter. That was seen as good news. H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) has been cutting costs to focus on its core tax preparation business, especially drilling down to the digital tax prep business.</p><p>Even satellite radio operator Sirius/XM radio can`t resist returning some cash to shareholders this season. It announced a one-time dividend of a nickel per share and a $2 billion stock buyback plan. Sirius shares are consistently among the most actively traded issues on the NASDAQ. Volume was very heavy as you`d expect today. The stock didn`t move a whole lot though, up just $0.02. But there was a bigger stock move in Liberty Media Capital. Why Liberty Media? Well, it`s the biggest shareholder of Sirius/XM stock. It stands to get $160 million thanks to the special dividend.</p><p>Online social gaming company Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has struggled to repeat the success of its Farmville game. It`s going after a gaming license now in Nevada. Don`t look it on the strip though. It wants customers to use real money, bet real money on Internet poker. Shares rallying 7.1 percent, volume doubled. Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has lost more than 70 percent of its value since becoming a publicly traded company.</p><p>All of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were higher with the emerging markets fund up the most, up 0.8 of a percent. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: And also with some market news, one of the hedge funds embroiled in the FBI`s crackdown on insider trading is closing its doors. Diamondback Capital Management is shutting down and that`s after clients pulled more than half a billion dollars from the fund. Federal agents raided the Connecticut firm two years ago as part of a nation-wide sweep that resulted in the arrest of one of the firm`s former portfolio managers on insider trading charges. Since then, Diamondback`s assets have dwindled to just over $1.5 billion, down from $5 billion.</p><p>GHARIB: Our viewers have been waiting and he`s finally here. Paul Kangas, NBR co-founding anchor. Welcome home, it`s so nice to have you back here.</p><p>PAUL KANGAS, NBR CO-FOUNDING ANCHOR: Well, it is like home and it`s great to hear that I`m still welcome.</p><p>GHARIB: Actually, speaking of welcome. We got -- Tom and I got so many viewer questions for you and comments saying that they want to hear from the Walter Cronkite of financial news. A little bit of your wisdom in these confusing time, right, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely there is so much going on in the market and you`ve seen so much market cycles. We got a lot to talk about, but what we have got to ask ,what do you make of the stock market today?</p><p>KANGAS: It`s sort of a stop and go affair. We get good news one day, better building permits and building news and on that front. And inflation is down a little bit. And then the next day it`s all countered by new uprisings in Egypt and one thing or another. So the market tries to step higher and is countered by bad news. So stop and go all the way.</p><p>HUDSON: We got a great question from Eric P. Edson. You saw the Dow Industrials move from 1,000 to over 10,000 in your career. He asks, will the Dow Jones see 8,000 or 18,000 first?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, there`s not that much volatility but it could see both in the same year. But I intend, I`m actually a little on the bullish bias because corporations continue to make money and the American people are basically optimistic. And a lot of stocks are under priced, particularly blue chips even though the Dow Industrial Average has more than doubled since 2009. But there`s a reason for that and that`s good earnings and that`s good dividends.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, there`s a lot of questions about if that is going to continue. And one of our viewers has a question for you about the fiscal cliff. You know all about the back and forth and the drama about the fiscal cliff and Delores Kile wants your thoughts on where do you stand on this whole fiscal cliff? How can it play out?</p><p>KANGAS: Congress better get off its duff and do something. And I think that finally the pressure is going to be enough (ph). But they always do it right to the last, you know, minute. But I think it`s got to happen or they`re going to be ousted from their hallowed political seats.</p><p>HUDSON: You could argue in the three years you`ve been away from the NBR anchor desk Congress hasn`t done a whole heck of a lot to address the fiscal situation.</p><p>KANGAS: No it`s just ridiculous. I mean these are our elected representatives and they have got to pay a little more attention to those that got them in the office. And they`re arguing amongst themselves without much care about the people they represent.</p><p>HUDSON: A lot of those folks are retirees, we do have a question about retirement from Anita asking what is the investing or financial planning lesson Paul uses most during retirement?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, the number one is hope I can live my life to the last and still have enough capital to keep me going. And a lot of investors are running up against the same thing. They`re running out of capital because yields are so low in the bond market; money markets are yielding practically nothing. So they have to chip into their base capital and that`s hurtful. So what I am doing is looking for blue chip stocks with decent dividends.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of people are wondering that in this climate, what do you think is going to be the new investment opportunity available to all of us in 2013? That`s a question from Fay.</p><p>KANGAS: New investment opportunity.</p><p>GHARIB: What is your prediction?</p><p>KANGAS: They`ll come up with something new just like ETF exchange- traded funds were relatively new a few years ago and now have gained such popularity it is almost, it`s staggering how much money has gone into ETFs.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned how volatility could have the Dow see 8,000 and 18,000, maybe in the same year. Frank sent us a tweet on Twitter asking individual investors are afraid of the markets. What needs to be done to gain their confidence?</p><p>KANGAS: Less regulation. I think that investors are afraid that they make an investment and something comes along, the rules change from what got them into the investment in the first place. Well you can`t change, you know, canoes in the middle of a stream.</p><p>GHARIB: On this whole subject of investor confidence, we do have a question from Billy who says what`s the greatest changes that you`ve seen in the market today? You`ve had some perspective three years being away from it on a day-to-day basis. What do you see as the biggest change?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, Billy, I`ll tell you that the computer is a wonderful thing, but it`s not the greatest thing for investing. And for investors who don`t have a high speed capability and have large box of stock at their arm`s length. I think that that is -- it`s taken away the idea that long- term, long-term investing is a good thing. I think that`s one of the changes that I don`t like. Too much computer meddling.</p><p>HUDSON: Well, Paul, as much as the markets have changed, you haven`t. It`s great to see and hear from you again. Susie, we have to say good night but I think it`s only proper to ask Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Susie Gharib. Home prices head higher, as the housing recovery digs in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: I'm Tom Hudson. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) shares tumble though. The fast food giant posts its first monthly sales drop in nearly a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And the U.S. futures market, it's been hit by scandal, but investors are still buying in. We continue our look at confidence and the markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: That and more tonight here on NBR.</p><p>There's more evidence tonight the housing market is recovering. Two reports today show home prices jumped significantly in the second quarter. And it's a classic story of supply and demand. Fewer homes for sale has helped push up prices for those looking for buyers. Here's the data. Real estate data firm CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) finds home prices up 6 percent. Freddie Mac's survey has prices up 4.8 percent. This are the largest quarter over quarter price hikes in at least seven years. Housing had been a drag on the economy, but fewer homes for sale and record low mortgage rates have really continued to repair the sector even though consumers remain cautious.</p><p>And we saw the latest data that (INAUDIBLE) that caution from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) today. July sales at the fast food restaurant fell flat, surprising investors and sending its stock lower. Sales at U.S. stores open for more than a year fell slightly last month, down 0.1 of one percent. That marks the first time in almost a decade monthly sales didn't rise. Like other analysts, Morningstar's RJ Hottovy expects sales to slow, but thought they'd still be positive.</p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: Whether it be sluggish wage growth and an uneven housing recovery and just a lot of headlines about a worsening global macroeconomic picture, I think a combination of those have definitely put consumers in a more value oriented mindset and that's something that will probably continue in the months to come. This may not be the last month that McDonalds puts up a slightly negative same store sales results for the U.S.</p><p>GHARIB: McDonalds was one of the big losers here on the big board today and that pressured stocks. But the Dow still eked out a fourth day of gains. Here are the numbers. The blue chips rose seven points, the NASDAQ slipped four and a half and the S&amp;P added nearly a point.</p><p>So get ready for a pull back in stocks. That's what our market guest is telling his clients. He's Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors. So Scott, let's talk about that pull back. When, how big and why are you thinking that?</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SR. EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: Well, Susie, I think probably over the next couple of months, we are very susceptible to headlines out of Europe. I think that the ECB will certainly be in at some point buying Spanish and Italian debt. But I don't think it's going to be as soon as the market wants. Much of this rally was based on what the Fed might do, also what the ECB might do. So I think it's very possible the Fed does do some easing. I think it's very possible and very likely the ECB does go in and buy some bonds. I just don't think it's going to be as soon. I think the market's a little bit ahead of itself. I think probably you could see certainly a 5 percent pullback and possibly upwards of a 10 percent pullback, but really on a pullback like that, we're looking at that as an opportunity. We want our clients in there taking advantage of a pullback like that and adding to positions.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me pick up on some of the points that you made there, first of all, about policy action. Investors do seem to be banking on the Federal Reserve and the European central bank doing something. Let's say they do. Is that a long term or just a temporary boost to the market?</p><p>WREN: I think that -- let's look at the Federal Reserve. If they do a QE3, in my opinion I would have to doubt the effectiveness as that. I almost feel there's kind of pushing on a string. I think there's a lot of liquidity in the system. It's just that there's no velocity of money. Confidence is down and people don't want to really borrow and spend. The ECB is in a much more dire situation. Spain and Italy both have a lot of debt this year that they need to roll over and there's just not very many investors stepping up to buy that. So I think the ECB is in a very dire situation. They are likely to act sooner. But let's be certain. If we have sub-two percent GDP growth and 8 percent plus unemployment, the Federal Reserve is not going to sit on its hands and do nothing.</p><p>GHARIB: You just tell people (ph) fundamentals there. But let me ask you, let me make the positive case and there are a lot of market guests who come on our program. They point to those housing numbers, for example. Housing is making a recovery. We just talked about that at the top of the show, also corporate profits coming in better than expected. They always talk about some kind of Fed action. But none of that resonates with you. You're still (INAUDIBLE) on a pullback.</p><p>WREN: Well I think and let me say this -- our year end target on the S&amp;P 500 is 1400 to 1450, so we're inside at the bottom range of that target. And I'm very confident in that year end target. I just think that we came to this level a little bit too fast. I think we came to this level because of anticipated action by central banks. That's probably a little further out than what the market thinks.</p><p>GHARIB: We have about 20 seconds left. Talk to us about investor confidence. We're running a whole series this week about this subject. What are your clients telling you about their confidence level?</p><p>WREN: Retail investor confidence level is low. They're fearful. They're afraid to get back into the market no matter what the valuations are. So our clients have a lot of cash on the sidelines, and one of my main jobs is to point out to people that you're going to be living longer. You're going to need to grow your money. You're going to need to participate in the global and U.S. growth and one of the best ways to do that is going to continue to be stocks. You need to be invested in the stock market.</p><p>GHARIB: Lots of good information. Scott, thanks a lot, Scott Wren at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors.</p><p>WREN: Thanks, Susie.</p><p>DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I'm Diane Eastabrook. Still ahead, I'll tell you why the futures market isn't what it used to be.</p><p>HUDSON: Fine coffee (ph) at some Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the future, may only take your name. The catch is you'll have to have a special pay with Square ap on your smart phone that announces your arrival at the cash register. It's part of a new partnership announced today between Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Square. That's the mobile payments start-up run by one of the co-founders of Twitter. The deal calls for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to invest $25 million in Square. Square will also process all of Starbucks' credit card payments, at significant savings. Earlier today, NBR's Erika Miller spoke with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz and Square CEO Jack Dorsey.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I would imagine that every big tech company has been beating at your door begging for a mobile payment deal. What do you think that Jack and Square is the right partnership for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)?</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, CEO, STARBUCKS: It's true that we have spoken to most of the high profile blue chip tech companies, all of whom are trying to crack the code on how to monetize mobile payments. I think when we met Square and then Jack, there were a few things that really stuck one. One was like minded values of both companies and I think Square's singular focus on payments and their level of innovation and entrepreneurialship (sic) and understanding of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) experience quickly separated them from the pack and it was a very easy choice for us.</p><p>MILLER: And Jack, talk about what this deal means for Square. Is it more than just a positive development? Is this a game changer for your company?</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, SQUARE: Absolutely. It really proves out that the technology we built scales from the individual and the small business all the way up to the very largest organizations in the world.</p><p>MILLER: Until this point, Square has been focused on small, even micro businesses. Does this partnership signal a new focus towards big global companies?</p><p>DORSEY: It's really around that scale. We're building a technology that should be treated as a utility, that an individual can come to or a very large organization can come to it and use it in very similar ways.</p><p>MILLER: Howard, it's one thing to encourage local payments in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). It's another thing to make a $25 million investment in a company that's not yet profitable. Why did you go that route?</p><p>SCHULTZ: I think we've all seen as consumers that the smart phone has really become the primary device in our life. The investment we're making of $i25 million is a significant vote of confidence to Square and Jack. We think that is going to create shareholder value for our shareholders.</p><p>MILLER: Jack, this partnership comes at a time when you're facing stiff competition from the likes of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), from the likes of Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), big competitors. Is it game on now? Are there going to be a rush to sign up big corporate partners?</p><p>DORSEY: We do something very specific which is not just focus on the mechanics of payments, but actually the experience around it. Everything from the point of sale all the way to what's in the consumers' pocket. And that bridge between the two is what is powerful and what is meaningful.</p><p>MILLER: Howard, I'd like to get your assessment of the global economy. Obviously you're a big global corporation. What do you see in terms of trends? Are consumers becoming more willing to spend? Is your ticket price going up? What can you tell me about Europe?</p><p>SCHULTZ: I think with 18,000 stores in 60 countries, every single day we have a window into consumer confidence and consumer behavior. It's no surprise that over the last few months there's been a significant level of pressure on consumer behavior and consumer spending in Europe. I don't think any of us see that changing any time soon.</p><p>GHARIB: This deal is obviously a big vote of confidence for mobile payments. Do you think (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>DORSEY: It is definitely disappearing. I can't imagine my grandmother leaving it at home. But I think what's always been true about payments is that the merchant always needs to accept whatever comes over the counter. They always want to make the sale. So it's important (INAUDIBLE)to that, but at the same time recognize the technologies that are coming to make it easier, to make it faster and improve the experience.</p><p>MILLER: hank you both very much for joining us.</p><p>SCHULTZ: Thank you.</p><p>DORSEY: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>GHARIB: If you live in a political swing state, chances are you've seen a political ad, or two or 20 in the past few months. This year's presidential campaign season already is on pace to be the most expensive on record. And with the so-called super pacs able to raise unlimited amounts of money for political advertisements, the spending is expected to rise. Sylvia Hall reports.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Summer may be ending, but the fight for the presidency is heating up. You just need a remote control to see it play out.</p><p>DARRELL WEST, VP &amp; DIR., GOV. STUDIES, BROOKINGS: The tide does not rise evenly. Some battleground states tend to get all the money and last time around, the top 11 states got 90 percent of the spending.</p><p>HALL: Television campaign spending is on pace to break records. And this year, super pacs are set to spend huge sums of money on advertising, for or against the candidates.</p><p>JACK POOR, VP, TELEVISION BUREAU OF ADVERTISING: Romney and his collaborators will probably spend a billion. Obama will be less than that, maybe $800 million.</p><p>HALL: But most of the country won't see the ads that spring from all that cash. So far this year, spending is concentrated in nine swing states. By law, campaigns pay fairly low rates for television ad space. But for super pacs, it's a different game. Some super pacs pay as much as twice what a campaign pays for airtime.</p><p>POOR: The irony is there are a very few number of undecided voters this year, so we're going to spend $3 billion essentially trying to persuade 5 to 10 percent of the electorate in nine states.</p><p>HALL: If you're in one of those states, you'll have a front row seat for a presidential campaign that's shaping up to be one of the most intense and negative on record. Just listen to some of the most recent attack ads to hit the airwaves.</p><p>CAMPAIGN AD: Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work, you wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.</p><p>CAMPAIGN AD: I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he's done to anyone. And furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.</p><p>WEST: It's way, way negative, somewhere north of 70 percent negative to 30 percent positive. We think that's going to continue and perhaps get worse. And one of the big reasons is the pacs, the super pacs. They're providing the bulk of the Republican spending right now and a significant portion of the Democratic as well.</p><p>HALL: Nobody knows yet how all this political spending could affect the businesses who usually advertise on television year round. The super pac money could raise ad rates for everyone. Sylvia Hall, NBR, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Toyota (NYSE:TM) says it's only a matter of time before it starts building more cars in North America and you can thank its native currency. A strong Japanese yen is clobbering the country's bottom line or rather the company's bottom line on U.S. exports. Toyota's U.S. sales chief Jim Lentz today said the auto maker's looking at moving production of Lexus ES sedans from Japan to the U.S. But he says before making such a costly move, the company will keep monitoring the yen. Lentz also re- affirmed Toyota's U.S. sales forecast at 14.3 million vehicles this year, predicting a pick up in sales after the presidential election.</p><p>GHARIB: Those rising home prices we told you about a little earlier in the program are also helping Fannie Mae. It reported today a solid second quarter profit just a day after Freddie Mac did the same. The government controlled mortgage giant earned $5 billion. That works out to $0.37 a share. The gains mark Fannie Mae's best quarter in a decade. So as a result, the company didn't need to ask for more taxpayer help and Tom, that's kind of significant because since the financial crisis, Fannie Mae has relied on loans from American taxpayers something along the lines of $116 billion.</p><p>HUDSON: A good development there, positive news in housing here tonight. And that's got a little bit of the market going here today Susie. In our \"Market Focus\" the major stock indices really kind of meandered around for most of the day before closing essentially flat. The S&amp;P 500 did have a choppy session, trading in a very narrow range. The index saw its worst and best levels of the day this morning, creating only an eight point trading range, very narrow. It ended higher by a fraction, still enough though for yes a new three-month high tonight. Trading volume moderate, 636 million shares on the big board, just under 1.9 billion moving on the NASDAQ. Then the consumer was in focus for the markets. The consumer staples sector had the best gains, up 0.6 of a percent, while the consumer discretionary sector was the biggest drag, down 0.4 of one percent.</p><p>Now consumer staples are those things we tend to buy because we need them. And Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock saw a big pop as the company plans to spin off its Horizon organic and Silk soy milk business. Lots of folks wanting Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock today, shooting up 40.6 percent. Volume more than -- jumped seven fold with the stock up to its highest price in two and a half years tonight. The firm has hinted for some time about a possible spin-off, wanting to separate its faster growing business from its traditional dairy operations. That news came after the company reported a stronger than expected second quarter helped out by lower costs. Earnings at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) a nickel better than estimates. The company also raised its guidance for the year. And despite the U.S. drought's impact on grain prices for dairy producers, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) does not think the impact on dairy prices will be as bad as some predict.</p><p>Meantime, consumer discretionary companies, firms selling things we want but may not need, were under some pressure thanks to travel websites. Priceline.com topped the losers in this area, down 17.3 percent. Among S&amp;P 500 traded stocks, the lowest price since February after the company's financial forecast came in short of expectations. Fellow online travel site Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) saw even bigger loss, losing more than a quarter of its value. Its outlook is below expectations as well. Tripadvisor lost 4.9 percent as the sector moved lower.</p><p>Meantime, homebuilding stocks - here we go -- higher prices thanks to the two reports we mentioned at the beginning of the program tonight showing that home prices were climbing. This exchange-traded fund in made up for homebuilding stocks. With today's 0.8 of a percent gain, it's at its highest price since May and less than $0.50 away from a four-year high.</p><p>On HP, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), ticker HPQ, been struggling for a couple of years, hit by CEO turnover and its traditional computer business really under pressure by tablets and smart phones. The company warned it will take an $8 billion write down due to a drop in its stock and business in its services unit. But excluding that massive charge, it raised its adjusted earnings forecast for the third quarter. That positive news in shares certainly responded positively, rising 2.4 percent, heavy traded HPQ today. Shares coming off an eight-year low earlier hit this month.</p><p>After closing just below a five-year high, media giant News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) may be one to watch tomorrow. After the closing bell, shares sank rather 2.5 percent from this closing price. The company reported disappointing revenues. The company is preparing to spin off its newspaper publishing business from its television and film operations.</p><p>It was a mixed day for the five most actively traded ETFs. Only the S&amp;P 500 and emerging markets exchange-traded funds eked out some very small gains. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>All this week on NBR, we're talking about investor confidence in the markets. In the futures market, that confidence has been hit by the bankruptcy of MF Global and the admitted fraud at PFG Best. Farmers started trading futures in Chicago in the middle of the 19th century. Today, pension funds, hedge funds, individual investors have millions of dollars s on the line in corn, soybeans and other products. As Diane Eastabrook reports, some old-style market participants say these newer players are making it tougher for them to trade.</p><p>EASTABROOK: For 164 years farmers, grain elevators and food companies have used futures contracts traded in Chicago's commodity pits to hedge risk. Alpha Baking Company uses them to lock in prices for the wheat and natural gas used to make its breads and rolls. President Larry Marcucci's been trading futures for 30 years. About eight years ago he noticed it changed.</p><p>LARRY MARCUCCI, PRESIDENT, ALPHA BAKING: It used to be if the market went up a couple of cents or down a couple of cents a day that was a big deal. Then it started bouncing around double digits, $0.10, $0.20 a day.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Marcucci thinks so called financial participants are the reason. They include pension funds, commodity pool advisors and swap dealers who are trading futures as a way to make money. Together they can comprise anywhere from a quarter to nearly half of the market.</p><p>MARCUCCI: They add liquidity, but they can drive the market up and they can certainty drive the market down.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Speculators have always been crucial to the futures market, buying a grain contract a hedger is trying to sell. David Lehman is the managing director of commodity research and development at the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME). He says these new financial participants are improving the market for hedgers like Marcucci.</p><p>DAVID LEHMAN, MANAGING DIR., CME GROUP: Bringing a much broader array of participants into the market globally, as well as bringing more liquidity into the markets from investors has actually dampened volatility as you look at it statistically.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Lehman says what makes markets volatile is uncertainty. The current drought is a good example. And today hedgers and speculators have instant access to information and can trade electronically 24-7. University of Illinois agriculture economist Scott Irwin says that can make for faster moving markets.</p><p>SCOTT IRWIN, AGRICULTURE ECONOMIST, UNIV. OF ILLINOIS: But overall you'd have to say on net it likely means just simply, more efficient, quicker reacting markets to even more relevant information.</p><p>EASTABROOK: For Marcucci it now means spending a little less time on the plant floor and a bit more time monitoring commodity prices.</p><p>MARCUCCI: I've gone from maybe watching it maybe monthly, to weekly, to daily, to hourly.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Marcucci is still hedging. He says he thinks that future provide great assurance for his company. He's just being a little bit more cautious about how he uses them in the future. Tom?</p><p>HUDSON: Diane a lot of folks may be looking at the futures industry a little bit more cautiously now because of the bankruptcy of MF Global that we mentioned last fall and of course the fraud this summertime of PFG Best. How has that impacted the trusts of the futures industry?</p><p>EASTABROOK: Well, I think from a customer standpoint, where people like Marcucci, he trusts the markets. He thinks the markets are functioning as they should be. But I think there is some concern that there needs to be a bit more oversight, particularly of these futures commission merchants or FCMs like Peregrine and MF Global and regulators are doing more to look into those companies. They're doing more electronic audits and are also making extra sure that these companies are not co- mingling their money with customer money.</p><p>HUDSON: That's a key point and of course the MF Global collapse was just a trade that went wrong of course. With PFG, you've got admitted fraud. In fact after the MF Global failure, you sat in the same room with Russell Wasendorf, Sr. (ph) (INAUDIBLE) who is now at the center of the alleged fraud and he said that it was sacrosanct to keep separate customer money -- not to co-mingle it. But allegedly now we've learned he was ripping off customers.</p><p>EASTABROOK: Yeah. That's what took a lot of people -- it really stunned a lot of people, particularly me. I had interviewed him many times in the past. He was a very trusted member of the futures industry. And I think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier. There just needs to be more oversight and hopefully that's what we'll be seeing.</p><p>HUDSON: Looking at investor trust in the futures market here tonight. It's our Midwest bureau chief, Diane Eastabrook reporting for the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) in Chicago. Thanks, Diane.</p><p>GHARIB: When it comes to confidence in the markets, tonight's commentator says market makers like Knight Capital have a great responsibility. Here's Joseph Cotterill, editor at the \"Financial Times.\"</p><p>JOSEPH COTTERILL, EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: Is it so terrifying that you should gut your 401(k) of stocks? You could say that the market itself absorbed Knight's problem trades pretty well last week. Those weird prices died down after that wild half hour. Even if you trade stocks day to day, that seems like better resilience than the big flash crash of two years ago. If you hold stocks for months or years, you could be feeling pretty insulated. Instead, the only downer on your confidence would be the merely atrocious economy.</p><p>But that can't be the whole story. Investors (INAUDIBLE) would be justified to have second thoughts over the bewildering pace of change in technology. These algorithms aren't space invaders or black swans. They're put in place by market makers locked in an arms race to be the fastest. They go fast to get you a tight stock quote. But weigh that against the unease when it goes wrong, or, as with Knight, there is no kill switch. It needs to be stoppable before it goes live. Otherwise, it's a dead market. I'm Joseph Cotterill.</p><p>HUDSON: Tomorrow on NBR, we're going to have some more details about the appetites of consumers, from the every day shopper to the higher end, more big retailers report results and outlooks. Second quarter earnings due in tomorrow from Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).</p><p>GHARIB: And finally, Bond, James Bond has always been a box office hit and now British pay TV service BSkyB is banking on it. It announced the launch of a new 24 hour channel dedicated solely to what else, films featuring the one and only James Bond. The new channel will launch in October to mark the 50th anniversary of the franchise and will put the 007 films on (INAUDIBLE) Tom, these guys, they recently bought the rights to the Britain film franchise from MGM Studios.</p><p>HUDSON: I'll see if I can get that channel in the office. I'm a sucker any time those films are on.</p><p>GHARIB: I love them. But (INAUDIBLE) watch them in the middle of the report, of the movie. Anyway, that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for us for Wednesday this August 8. Have a great evening everyone and you too Tom. Take in a movie, a Bond movie.</p><p>HUDSON: Report, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, ergo (ph) online, nbr.com, back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Fresh data show that as the recession deepens, Americans are buying only what`s needed and stashing the rest of their cash. Coming up, a look at what could ignite new spending.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Macy`s joins the parade of layoffs as the latest major company to cut jobs. As the nation`s employment picture darkens, we begin a month-long focus on jobs. Tonight, our interview with employment expert John Challenger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KANGAS: Fixing the economy will come down to fixing the housing mess. That`s the word from Republicans as the Senate debates the president`s massive stimulus spending plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PRATT: Then, we continue to \"Get Your Finances Ready for Retirement\" with a look at long-term care. With Americans living a lot longer, it could be key to your retirement plans.</p><p>KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas.</p><p>PRATT: And I`m Suzanne Pratt. Susie Gharib is on assignment. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February 2.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. Concerned consumers are cutting back on consumption in a big way. Personal spending fell by 1 percent in December, the sixth straight monthly decline. Worries about jobs as well as tightened credit conditions were key reasons people kept their wallets shut. As Erika Miller reports, with consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of economic activity, experts worry this trend could prolong the recession.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For many Americans, the shopping spree is over. Outside Macy`s Herald Square today, we found many shoppers buying only necessities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m shopping for the essential items, clothes for work and stuff like that. So it`s not like anything I don`t need. It`s things that I need.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At work, we`re all frightened, a little bit. We`re all more or less scared that at some point we will get laid off, maybe. But until then, there`s really nothing you can do.</p><p>MILLER: But there is some good news. Less spending is helping boost the national savings rate. The average American household saved about $0.03 of every dollar in December, compared to next to nothing at the start of last year. Still, economists see these trends as a challenge to overcoming recession, because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic growth. Economist Cary Leahey says the key to reviving consumer spending is stabilizing the labor market.</p><p>CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS: The most important single determinant of consumer spending is how people feel about the labor market, whether or not they have a job, are they worried about their job or they know someone well enough that they know what their job prospects are.</p><p>MILLER: He and others expect President Obama`s economic stimulus plan and efforts to support banks will help eventually. Economist Bob Brusca thinks the government should also encourage banks to lower lending standards. That way, more Americans could take advantage of record low interest rates to borrow and refinance.</p><p>ROBERT BRUSCA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FACT &amp; OPINION ECONOMICS: It`s about banks. It`s about getting banks that have taken Federal money to loosen up and use it for the purpose of digging the economy out of a ditch, instead of trying to win some banking balance sheet beauty contest.</p><p>MILLER: Some economists believe the pullback in consumer spending will last longer than the economic downturn. They say people are changing their shopping habits and the changes could stick. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>PRATT: We`re starting off the new month with new layoffs. Macy`s announced today it`s cutting 7,000 employees or about 4 percent of the workforce. The layoffs will be in stores, offices and other locations. Since January, U.S. companies have slashed nearly 200,000 jobs. With so many people worried about becoming unemployed, tonight we kick off a month- long series \"Reviving the Economy: Jobs.\" Each week night, we`ll tackle an employment-related topic, everything from coping with losing your job to what sectors are hiring. Tonight, John Challenger joins me to talk more about the nation`s employment picture. He is CEO of the outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray and Christmas. John, welcome back to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>JOHN CHALLENGER, CEO, CHALLENGER, GRAY &amp; CHRISTMAS: Nice to be here, Suzanne.</p><p>PRATT: The economy lost about 2.5 million jobs last year so we`re not off to a good start this year. Lots of companies as you just heard with Macy`s have already announced big layoffs. What is your outlook for 2009?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, certainly in the near term over this first quarter, maybe second quarter, we`re going to continue to see these job losses, more than likely, maybe not at the pace we have seen in the last three months which has just been devastating. But I am more confident as we go into the summer months we`ll start to see some improvement.</p><p>PRATT: So Friday we get the employment report, the monthly employment report. There is a lot of fear in the market about that report. We see the unemployment rate is already up to 7.2 percent. What is your expectation for that report on Friday? Is it going to be really dismal?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Seems highly likely it is going to take another big jump as it has for the last two months. November and December almost half point jumps a month. And this January we see just a steady run of layoffs, not just from the companies that have -- the types of companies that have lead the way in this recession like banks and housing companies and automotive companies, but now we are seeing layoffs come from really almost every corner of the economy, heavy equipment companies, retailers like in today`s Macy`s, pharmaceutical companies, telecom companies. And that has been what`s so difficult about this, been what has been so difficult about this January.</p><p>PRATT: A lot of people may not realize it, but employment is a lagging indicator. And in previous recessions, it takes a long time for the employment picture to pick up even though the recession may end, it could be many months before we start to see a lot of new jobs added to the economy. What do you think is going to be the likely scenario this time? Do you think there`s going to be a very big lag in terms of when the employment`s ultimately going to pick up in a strong way?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, after this last recession in 2001 after the dotcom and technology collapse, it did take 18 months after the economy started to improve from a GDP standpoint for jobs to start getting created. It didn`t mean unemployment kept going up, that at least too much. But it did stay flat for quite a while. It seems likely coming out of this period we will see a similar period of jobless recovery because business owners are just going to be super cautious after this devastating recession we`ve been in about hiring too many people. So it is likely we`ll continue to see people going to back to work in part-time jobs and using those as auditions for full-time jobs and then companies being very selective in their hiring.</p><p>PRATT: What about the stimulus package? How hopeful are you that in its current form it is going to do a lot to create jobs?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, it`s being revised right now so we don`t know what it is going to end up as. But certainly fiscal stimulus job creation by putting people back to work on projects, buildings, roads, ports as well as building schools and hospitals, say information systems, I`m positive about the fact that that is going to create jobs. We don`t want to see pork barrel. I think you want to get money in terms of tax cuts back into people who are going to spend that money. That means middle class and people, you know, who have had a hard time holding on to their jobs at the low wage level. That`s I think the key to making this recovery.</p><p>PRATT: One last question. We don`t have a lot of time left. But what is your best advice to those who may have recently lost their job?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, you`ve got to get back to work, so don`t be too picky about what you find. Better to take the job now, might even be a part-time job. Get some money coming in. Show them what you can do. Keep looking if you need to do that. In fact, you might put together several jobs, even extra ones right now. If you are in work, hold on to that job tight. Show them you know, the work you can do, the quality what it is, the long hours you work. And prove that you just need to be there.</p><p>PRATT: Some very good advice, thank you for joining me this evening.</p><p>CHALLENGER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>PRATT: Our guest: John Challenger of Challenger, Gray and Christmas.</p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow as we continue \"Reviving the Economy: Jobs,\" the best advice for all employees may be to adopt the boy scout motto: be prepared.</p><p>Investors greeted Wall Street with an opening sell off on that drop in consumer spending. The Dow tumbled about 100 points at the opening while the NASDAQ fell 10 points. Then strength in big tech stocks like Microsoft and Apple helped the Dow trim its loss to just 15 points at 1:00 p.m. with the NASDAQ actually up 18 points. The afternoon brought more selling on the Dow, down 125 points at one stage, but that tech strength helped the blue chips recover part of their losses, so the Dow Industrial Average ended down 64.03 at 7936.83. The tech-laden NASDAQ was up 18.01 at 1494.43, while the Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 lost .44, ending at 825.44. Over in the bond market, the 10-year note climbed 1 4/32 to 108 24/32, putting the yield at 2.72 percent.</p><p>PRATT: The Senate opened debate today on an economic stimulus package that is getting closer to the $1 trillion mark. President Obama met with lawmakers today to try to keep the massive effort on track. But as Darren Gersh reports, there`s a growing debate about changing the bill to make it more effective.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The president is optimistic a stimulus bill could be on his desk in a matter of weeks.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What we can`t do is let very modest differences get in the way of the overall package moving forward swiftly.</p><p>GERSH: But it really depends on your definition of modest. As the debate started in the Senate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell was pushing for a greater focus on tax cuts over spending and he also offered a new suggestion.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, MINORITY LEADER: We believe, Republicans, that a stimulus bill must fix the main problem first and that`s housing. That`s how all of this began. We think you ought to go right at housing first.</p><p>GERSH: The Republican plan calls for government financing to bring home mortgage rates down to 4 percent. The authors of the plan figure 40 million homeowners would qualify, saving each an average of $424 a month. Republicans believe taxpayers might come out ahead on the deal, since the government can now borrow at 2.5 percent. But independent estimates say it could cost the government $20 billion a year or more. Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, gave the idea a cool reception.</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: An absolute subsidy for every borrower in America regardless of income, I think is a very expensive program.</p><p>GERSH: There is a very good reason the stimulus is attracting so many proposals both extremely large and small. As budget hawk Maya Macguineas points out, this may be many a lobbyist`s last hope.</p><p>MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET: There are not going to be that many vehicles which will actually bring taxes down or spending up, because we`re just going to have run out of fiscal space to pay for all of these things. So everybody and their lobbyist is fighting to get their favorite items on to the stimulus train before it leaves because who knows when the next chance will be.</p><p>GERSH: It is widely expected the stimulus plan will top $900 billion as it moves through the Senate. Likely additions include a patch for the alternative minimum tax and a doubling of the home buyer tax credit to $15,000. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>KANGAS: Now, let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Most active big board issue on 51.4 million shares, Bank of America (BAC) losing $0.58. That stock is now down 85 percent on the last 12 months.

Americans are living longer. But the older you get, the more likely it is that you won`t be able to live independently. That`s why long-term care is something everyone should consider in their retirement planning. So tonight, as we continue our series \"Get Your Finances Ready for Retirement,\" Joe Collum looks at the many forms of long- term care.</p><p>JOE COLLUM, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: At age 88, Leo Gerber is still the life of the party and although he suffers from emphysema and cardiac problems, he says life has never been better for him and his wife Nettie.</p><p>LEO GERBER/RETIREE: You can`t live here unless you`re happy. If you want to live a happy life, this is the place. </p><p>COLLUM: This place is the Court at Palm Aire in Pompano, Florida, a long-term care facility. Although many associate long-term care only with nursing homes, it can also include being cared for at home by a health aide or a relative; an adult day-care program; or living in an alternate setting, like an assisted-living facility. Seniors reach the point of needing long-term care at different times, says Pernille Ostberg, president and CEO of Matrix Home Care.</p><p>PERNILLE OSTBERG, PRES. &amp; CEO OF MATRIX HOME CARE: Typically it`s the 70s, 80s, when one isn`t as capable of taking care of everything in their home as they used to be, cutting the lawn, cleaning the pool, all the grocery shopping, all the maintenance, all these things to think about.</p><p>COLLUM: Long-term care can be an expensive proposition and many people think that when the times comes, it will be paid for by Medicare. But if you are one of those people, think again.</p><p>KATHRYN VOTAVA, PRES. &amp; FOUNDER, GOODCARE.COM: Medicare generally does not cover nursing home costs with the exception being a rehabilitation stay. So sometimes people get a little confused and say, well, my grandmother went into a nursing home and Medicare covered it. Well that was short-term for a month or two after she broke her hip. But for long-term chronic care in a nursing home, you`re absolutely right, Medicare does not cover that.</p><p>COLLUM: Medicare also does not cover many other long-term care costs, which can be daunting. The average price to have a home health aide come to your home is about $19 per hour. Assisted living and nursing home care are far more expensive, says Emily Brandon of \"U.S. News &amp; World Report.\"</p><p>EMILY BRANDON, BUSINESS REPORTER, U.S. NEWS &amp; WORLD REPORT: A private room in a nursing home is likely to cost about $76,000 a year. That`s the national average. It varies from state to state, but that`s about $209 a day for a nursing home.</p><p>COLLUM: Finding a good long-term care facility on short notice may not be easy. For that reason, many people who expect to need long-term care at some point choose to live in a continuing care community which guarantees them care at various levels, sometimes at no extra cost. Alan and Joy Turner went that route by moving into an apartment at one such community, La Posada, in Palm Beach Gardens. To get in, they paid a lump sum of $500,000, 90 percent of which will eventually be returned to their estate. They also pay a monthly charge of $4,700 for their apartment, meals and a variety of programs. Because Alan has Parkinson`s disease, Joy Turner says it`s worth the price.</p><p>JOY TURNER/RETIREE: If, for instance, my husband were to have to go to assisted living, I could still keep my apartment and it wouldn`t be any more.</p><p>COLLUM: The Turners and the Gerbers were able to cover their costs by selling their previous homes. But if a home sale does not generate enough cash, long-term care expenses can quickly deplete a person`s retirement savings. Having long-term care insurance is one way to avoid that, but it`s not cheap. And in our next segment, we`ll see what you need to consider before buying a policy. Joe Collum, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.</p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow, \"Of Mutual Interest\" guests Jim Lowell and Dan Wiener tell us how Vanguard and Fidelity are faring during the recession.</p><p>PRATT: Steelcase, the world`s largest office furniture maker, today announced broad cost-cutting measures. They include reducing salaried workers` pay by 5 percent. Top managers are also taking a pay cut. The salaries of the firms` CEO and CFO will be slashed by 12 percent and 10 percent respectively. Steelcase is also implementing previously announced layoffs of 300 hourly workers.</p><p>KANGAS: General Motors and Chrysler are offering a new round of buyouts and retirement incentives for hourly workers. GM will not comment, but officials with the United Auto workers say that the plan includes worker buyouts. Chrysler is offering $50,000 in cash and a $25,000 new car voucher. Both auto makers must submit viability plans to the government by February 17th as part of their bailout funding.</p><p>PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. January auto sales are released and we`ll see quarterly results from Dow Chemical, Marathon Oil, Merck, UPS and Walt Disney.</p><p>As we continue our month-long focus on employment, tonight`s commentator says creating more jobs and fixing the financial system aren`t separate goals. Here`s Alice Rivlin, senior fellow at Brookings and former vice chair of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>ALICE RIVLIN, SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS: It is not fair that millions of wage earners are losing their jobs and homes because overpaid financial hotshots made stupid mistakes. This crisis was caused by financial innovation gone wild, excessive greed and inadequate regulation. So why not let the high-flyers slide into oblivion, while the government concentrates on putting people back to work and saving their homes?</p><p>Unfortunately, it isn`t that simple. The economy can`t function without healthy banks and financial markets. When businesses and individuals can`t get credit, jobs disappear really fast. That is happening as we speak. The huge injection of government capital into the banks kept the system from imploding and eased credit a little, but we still need to remove toxic assets and restore bank viability, so that credit can flow normally.</p><p>More help for the banks doesn`t sound like a job creation program, but unless it succeeds, no economic stimulus will turn the downward spiral around. The financial hot shots should forget the perks and bonuses and work hard to use the taxpayers` money to fuel the economic engine. After that, we need their clever minds to help figure out how to make the capitalist system less to prone to excesses followed by collapses that destroy the livelihoods of average workers. I`m Alice Rivlin.</p><p>KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision for Wall Street. The Dow dropped 64 points while the NASDAQ Composite gained 18 points.

STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I think we're going to get more of the same. We're going to get a lot of volatile markets and I think we're going to continue to trade off headlines.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: 2011 ends with the major stock averages pretty much where they were one year ago. From oil to IPOs, what to expect from the year ahead. It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 30th.</p><p>Good evening and thanks for joining us. Susie is off tonight. Investors say good bye to a year of wild market swings and lots of economic worries but also a year that ends very close to where it began for the major stock averages. With today's fractional losses for those averages, the broad market ended the year virtually unchanged. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to end the year on the upside rising 5.5 percent. The NASDAQ closed down this year almost 2 percent. How about the S&amp;P 500, finishing with a loss of 4/100 of a percent, essentially in the same place it was at the end of last year. But for the 11th straight year, gold prices rallied, closing at $1,566 an ounce. That marks a 10 percent gain this year. After this roller coaster ride for investors, 2012 is set to begin with many of the same concerns and uncertainties. Suzanne Pratt reports from New York.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tomorrow evening New York's famed Times Square will be filled with thousands of people celebrating the New Year. On Wall Street, however there will be far less partying as stock investors say good riddance to a tough year. 2011 has been volatile due to Europe's debt crisis, slow economic growth here at home and political uncertainty around the globe. And there's little unanimity among financial pros as to whether 2012 will be an up or down year for the major averages. Still most do agree trading will be sloppy and choppy.</p><p>MIKE RYAN, CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I think we're going to get more of the same. We're going get a lot of volatile markets and I think we're going to continue to trade off headlines.</p><p>PRATT: And those headlines are likely to come out of Europe, at least in the first half of the year.</p><p>VADIM ZLOTINIKOV, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN: You have uncertainty as to what is the path that Europe is going to choose. If it is a path of extreme austerity, you could actually depress the U.S. companies earnings and the U.S. economic growth. If on the other hand it's some combination of monetary easing in a framework for reducing the deficit, that would be viewed by the market as more popular.</p><p>PRATT: No matter what happens in the Eurozone, U.S. economic growth is likely to be muted next year. Yes, there are signs the recovery is gaining momentum. But headwinds are still plentiful. Not only are job prospects for millions of Americans bleak, but the housing market remains in the cellar and there is one more factor likely to create uncertainty for investors in 2012, call it a global changing of the guard.</p><p>RYAN: Think about the countries that potentially face a change in leadership. The United States, China, France, India, Iran, Korea, you know, this is, these are countries that represent about half the world's GDP. So those leadership changes can also be add to the volatility of the markets.</p><p>PRATT: Before you head for the exits permanently, there are at least a few reasons to be positive about stocks in 2012. Corporate profits are expected to remain decent. Companies can still borrow at very low rates and don't forget the oodles of money in corporate coffers.</p><p>ZLOTINIKOV: Companies that are generating a lot of cash and are likely to increase the payout, likely to increase dividends, I want to be clear. This is not a new theme. It is actually an extremely crowded theme. It has been recommended by every single person in the world, doesn't make it wrong.</p><p>PRATT: Investor sentiment is still a big wild card for next year. Trading volume in the last few months has been very low, suggesting a serious lack of conviction. And that is unlikely to change until there's better clarity on Europe. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: All that uncertainty has lead for one of the best place for investors this year, it's the bond market. Most bond mutual funds did better than stock mutual fund funds in 2011. Mutual funds focused on U.S. government bonds gained 9 percent on the year while the average large-cap core stock fund lost 0.3 of 1 percent. What to do after those gains? Well, bond expert Larry Swedroe of Buckingham Asset Management shares a portfolio suggestion for the New Year.</p><p>LARRY SWEDROE, RESEARCH DIR., BUCKINGHAM ASSET MANAGEMENT: I think you should have a well thought out plan, an asset allocation, maybe 60 percent stock, 40 percent bonds or if you are older maybe it is 40 percent bonds and 60 percent stocks. And then you want to have the discipline to stay the course. And that means after a bond run, you are going to be selling bonds at high prices, meaning you are going to have a nice profit, you get to sell high. And you should be buying stocks at low prices when expected returns are high.</p><p>HUDSON: You can hear more of what Larry says about investing in 2012. The full interview is on our web site, just go to nbr.com.</p><p>On the eve of the New Year and new tension between the west and Iran. The country has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway linking the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea. Seventeen million barrels of oil move through the strait every day. And it's about 20 percent of all oil traded worldwide. Iran has threatened to close the strait if it faces new sanctions over its nuclear program. John Kilduff is with us, founding partner at Again Capital with us at the NASDAQ. John, you've been following the oil market for years. How serious is the oil market taking this new threat?</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, FOUNDING PARTNER, AGAIN CAPITAL: It's taking it relatively seriously. And it's certainly ratcheted up here over the past several weeks. To the western countries' credit, for once, the sanctions are biting in Iran. And that's why you are seeing a reaction by the Iranians to them. And while though I think that they are certainly capable of causing trouble in the strait, we're not there yet in terms of being on the precipice. There's a lot of diplomatic dancing work to go on before that occurs.</p><p>HUDSON: It hasn't impacted global supply yet. Most of that oil that runs through the Strait of Hormuz heads to Asia. We know that China has slowed down a little bit. But does this threaten the Asian economies?</p><p>KILDUFF: Well, it will. It will threaten all our economies if it were to get blocked, even momentarily, even if it is just a single barge let's say in the one of the two shipping lanes. The headline is going to hit the tape. We're all going to buy it and not sort out the details until much later. Because look, it's most of the Saudi oil. It's Iraq's southern production which is half of that country's output that goes through that narrow strait, UAE and Iranian oil for that matter. So it will be a shortage of oil that can't be made up by anyone so that is why the stakes are so high.</p><p>HUDSON: John, what about the ability to reroute some of that Persian Gulf oil to pipelines and take it up to the north?</p><p>KILDUFF: It really is not an option. It's not going to be a sufficient ability. Like I said, the (INAUDIBLE) oil facility off Saudi Arabia's coast which I like to call the world's oil aorta really is irreplaceable, just too much of a volume of oil to displace in any fashion.</p><p>HUDSON: John, we know it is a global market for crude. U.S. crude, domestic oil, meantime, just shy of $100 a barrel as we wind up this year. How about the impact if this threat continues to raise tensions with the Mideast?</p><p>KILDUFF: Yeah, like you said, it is a global market. And the price reverberates around the world no matter where the shortage is. We saw what the Libyan outage did to the Brent crude oil prices and what it did to the west Texas prices as well. It kept it sustained at levels much higher than we otherwise would have been. And even this Iranian situation has probably added a good $15 to $20 a barrel in geo-political premium right now.</p><p>HUDSON: And finally what about the demand picture in the first quarter with Europe still in question?</p><p>KILDUFF: It's going to be very much in doubt. Not only here we're seeing gasoline demand consistently down about 5 percent week in and week out and the Chinese economy is a big question mark. The data we're getting from there is pointing to a slowdown. And whether or not it's going to be significant or not, what remains to be seen. But they are the swing demand center. So the way we talk about Saudi Arabia's oil being so precious to supply, China's demand is equally as precious on the demand side of the equation.</p><p>HUDSON: That's the outlook as we move into the New Year for oil. John, happy New Year to you.</p><p>KILDUFF: Happy New Year to you.</p><p>HUDSON: John Kilduff with us tonight from Again Capital.</p><p>From oil to IPOs this year saw the return of the Internet initial public offering and lots of hype surrounding the trading debuts of stocks like Linkedin and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). But investors did not always buy into the hype. Joya Dass tonight looks back at the year's newest stocks and the IPO everybody is waiting for next year.</p><p>JOYA DASS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: While the markets renewed their appetite for companies going public in 2011, it wasn't the blockbuster year as some had hoped.</p><p>JAMES KRAPFEL, IPO STRATEGIST, MORNINGSTAR: The companies that went public in 2011, on average under performed the S&amp;P 500 by 12 percentage points.</p><p>DASS: Big tech IPOs Linkedin, Groupon and game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) started off with a bang, but finished the year in some cases with a dull thud.</p><p>KRAPFEL: Groupon was the second one. They were up about 25, 30 percent on the first day, immediately in the first couple of weeks fell about 40 percent. But it has shot back up above its IPO price, which is why, we along with others are very skeptical of that company and their business model.</p><p>DASS: This year's top IPO performers included Imperva, a leader in data security. GNC Holdings, a mall favorite featuring nutrition bars. Tangoe, a telecom group and Tesoro Logistics, a refiner and marketer of petroleum-based products. This year's worst IPO performers included China Century Dragon Media, a Chinese television media buyer. Friendfinder Networks, a dating web site, Imperial Holdings, a specialty finance company and finally Kips Bay Medical, which develops products such as mesh stents for use in bypass surgery. And that brings us to the IPO market for 2012.</p><p>DAVID MENLOW, PRESIDENT,IPOFINANCIAL.COM (BY TELEPHONE): The balance sheets of the companies coming public, the deleveraged aspects of those companies that are coming public, all point to a very strong cycle for the IPO market. And one that is going to put the individual investor or the institutional investor in a very advantaged position because valuation models are at historic lows.</p><p>DASS: Companies David is watching out for include Gogo, the company that provides Internet access aboard planes. Software company with a focus on the TV industry NDS Group Holdings and marketing company Exact Target (NYSE:TGT). And then there is the 800 pound gorilla in the IPO market for 2012 better known as Facebook.</p><p>KRAPFEL: They have a prospectus ready to go, could file for the first time in January and looks like they're targeting a second quarter 2012 filing. They're targeting a $100 billion valuation and look to raise $10 billion.</p><p>DASS: With Facebook revenues expected to top $4 billion for 2011, investors might just like this IPO. Joya Dass for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Still ahead from us tonight, pain from paying into college to paying it off. It was one of the big issues for the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement. We'll take a look at the state of student loans.</p><p>A quiet ending today through the year with the major averages sinking just a bit, capping really a volatile year for investors. Let's go ahead and take a look at tonight's \"Market Focus.\" Before we take a look back at the year that was, we will look at today's trading activity with stocks sliding in to the New Year's holiday and the long holiday weekend. The Dow Industrials Average spent almost the entire session in the red. The index continued dropping into the closing bell, ending the session down a little more than one half of 1 percent.</p><p>But as we reported at the beginning of the program, blue chips were the stocks of interest for investors. The Dow gained 5.5 percent this year, outpacing the other major stock averages. And leading the area for the Dow, McDonald's, MCD, shares shooting up more than 30 percent this year as its North American business continued to strengthen even as the company raised some menu prices making up for higher commodity prices.</p><p>On the bottom meantime, the worst Dow stock, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) losing more than half its value as B of A continues battling the weak housing market -- worries about its financial stability and questions about its corporate leadership. Earlier this month, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shares dipped below $5 per share. Tonight they are just above $5.50 per share.</p><p>The stocks had plenty of ups and downs clearly this year, but it was not as volatile as some recent years. Thirty eight percent of trading sessions this year had swings of at least 1 percent for the S&amp;P 500. While that is more than last year, it's actually less volatile than what we saw in 2009.</p><p>The year end numbers for the major indices would have been worse if it wasn't for the nice rally in the fourth quarter that we're looking at here. The Dow Industrials popping 12 percent this quarter, S&amp;P 500 up 11 percent. Remember it ended the year flat. The NASDAQ gained almost 8 percent over just the past three months.</p><p>The worst sector for the past quarter though was the telecom sector, dragged down by AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) dropping its buyout effort of T-Mobile. Today Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the telecom company canceling plans and deciding not go through with a new $2 fee for some wireless customers paying their bills over the phone or online. Customers and regulators complained about that. Shares gained just a fraction. It was enough to put Verizon (NYSE:VZ) at a new 52-week high tonight, the stock up 13 percent this year.</p><p>Two other telecom stocks rallying nicely, prepaid wireless provider Metro PCS jumping more than 5 percent on renewed speculation it could be a buyout target in the New Year. And Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR) jumping almost 3 percent. Piper Jaffray began coverage of the stock calling it \"neutral,\" but expecting its dividend to continue in the near term.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, bonds beat stocks this year as investors sought safety despite the U.S. losing its AAA credit rating this summer. The interest rate on the 10-year government note fell today down to 1.88 percent. As the rates fall of course, bond prices rise. This is the first year on record the 10-year note has closed out a calendar year with an interest rate below 2 percent. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>Collectively Americans owe more money on student loans now than we do on our credit cards. Student debt is nearing $1 trillion. This was one of the big issues when college graduates joined \"Occupy Wall Street\" rallies across the country this fall, many of them voicing concern about rising tuition costs and mounting student debt crisis. Sylvia Hall tonight takes a look at what's fueling soaring college costs and how to pay for them.</p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you went to an \"Occupy Wall Street\" protest, you wouldn't have had to stay long before hearing angry cries of frustrated college graduates. The frustration has been fueled by ever-higher college tuition forcing more students to borrow more money to afford a higher education.</p><p>MARK KANTROWITZ, PUBLISHER, FINAID.COM: I'm very pessimistic about college affordability over the next decade.</p><p>HALL: Mark Kantrowitz publishes an top financial aid information web site. He says slim government budgets have slashed college and university funding, leading schools to have students pay a higher price. This year alone tuition at four-year public universities is up more than 8 percent from last year according to the College Board. The recession also has dealt a below to financial aid grants leaving students to foot more of the bill than ever before. For many it's a bigger burden than they can afford.</p><p>KANTROWITZ: We see this first and foremost with the lower and moderate income students. They're the canaries in the cage that keel over first.</p><p>HALL: Jane Wellman heads the Delta Cost Project, a non-profit tracking how colleges use their funds. She points to faculty benefits as one of the largest drivers of school spending.</p><p>JANE WELLMAN, EXECUTIVE DIR., DELTA COST PROJECT: We can't expect students to pay for all of this. We shouldn't have to.</p><p>HALL: She says many colleges are working to minimize tuition hikes. The school budgets aren't nimble enough to shift quickly.</p><p>WELLMAN: The structural problems of higher education finance have been growing for 20 years. But the depth of the recession, the 2008 recession and the slow recovery from it, no one expects this is going to turn around any time soon.</p><p>HALL: With prices rising, experts like Reyna Gobel say paying for college doesn't have to become a crisis because Federal student loans carry a variety of payment plans.</p><p>REYNA GOBEL, AUTHOR, \"GRADUATION DEBT\": Whatever you do, don't give up on it, these type of loans. Don't listen to its (ph) bears because you have so much power. You are the consumer. No matter how much money is in your pocket right now, you are the consumer and you have options. And don't let's anybody tell you different.</p><p>HALL: President Obama took up the student debt issue earlier this year by easing payback terms on some Federal student loans. But experts say ultimately making college more affordable must come from how states run higher education. Sylvia Hall, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Here is what we are watching for next week as 2012 gets under way. December economic data begins pouring in. We'll see auto sales, manufacturing and the number everybody is watching on Friday of next week - - December's employment report. Now Monday with the stock markets closed, we'll bring you an NBR special edition. Women and leadership, focus on Pamela Newman, one of the insurance industry's most powerful women.</p><p>While we await the auto industry's December results, strong sales help drive Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s recovery across the new milestone. 2011 sales of Ford brand cars and trucks topped two million units this week for the year, the first time since 2007 that any single auto brand has hit that mark. Ford's F-series pickup trucks were the top selling vehicle in the nation as they have been for the past three decades. As far as total sales, Ford remains number two U.S. auto maker behind General Motors (NYSE:GM).</p><p>President Obama put his request to increase the nation's debt limit on hold. The White House was expected today to ask for $1.2 trillion increase in the government's ability to borrow money. Congressional leaders though asked for a delay saying they would like time to address the measure when they were back in session next month. Lawmakers are not due back in Washington until mid-January. The government is currently within about $100 billion of reaching its borrowing limit.</p><p>Despite all the sound and fury this year over European debt problems, quantitative easing here in the U.S. and record corporate profits, 2011 comes to an end, where it pretty much began at least for the S&amp;P 500 stock index. Tonight's \"Market Monitor\" has one word to describe this year -- dividends. Sam Stovall is the chief investment strategist for Standard &amp; Poor's Capital IQ with us tonight from New York. Happy New Year to you Samuel.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: Happy New Year, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Not exactly a bull market, certainly not a bear market, it was a market where shareholders got paid to wait. Is that the best description?</p><p>STOVALL: Absolutely. Not a bull, not a bear but a blah market and the investors who focused on quality as well as dividend yields were the ones who were rewarded.</p><p>HUDSON: Yeah and you can see that when you take a look at the top three stock sectors in the S&amp;P 500, utilities, consumer staples, health care, kind of defensive but also sectors that traditionally pay their shareholders. What went into that kind of stock performance this year?</p><p>STOVALL: I think basically the reason why you had the three best performing sectors post total returns above 13 percent each and not be cyclical sectors in nature is because they were substitutes for bonds. Investors were looking for nice payouts, dividend yields, some sort of a return that was better than money markets and also that would not present them with the potential of a bubble as some investors fear with the bond market. So they focused on these good total return sectors.</p><p>HUDSON: And at least for the utilities, a sector that really wasn't in the headlines much, not much news going on there and perhaps it benefited from that.</p><p>STOVALL: Absolutely. You would have thought that telecom services group would have done better than it did because it does have the highest dividend yield of all 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500. But utilities beat out the telecom group, I think mainly as you said because of static demand and very high dividends.</p><p>HUDSON: Of course, in the telecom group, it was the big busted deal with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile to end the year. Meantime financials, banks were the weakest again. You know, it's tough to get market to move forward when the financials aren't moving forward, isn't it?</p><p>STOVALL: It's tough, certainly to get them moving forward for any long-term period. We were able to establish an all-time high back in 2007 when the financials were starting their nosedive. But obviously that advance did not last very long as we saw in 2008. So yes, we have the possibility for short-term advances in the market without the financials, but nothing that I think would be very long lasting.</p><p>HUDSON: So here we are again at the end of another year, Sam, you and I speaking pretty much where the S&amp;P 500 was a year ago when we were together. But corporate profits are at record levels, so what kind of valuation does that present investors as we begin a new year?</p><p>STOVALL: It presents investors with a very good valuation, actually a 10 percent discount to the median P/E since 1936. And history also says but does not guarantee that you would need to see the yield on the 10-year note rise above 7 percent in order for the P/E on the S&amp;P to be able to fall below 11. So we have very attractive P/E ratios and based on the yield on the 10-year note, not a good likelihood that we'll see single digits any time soon.</p><p>HUDSON: With that in mind, we'll take a look at the last year of trading for the S&amp;P 500 and despite all the ups and downs, we are pretty much where we began the year at and we're close to the middle of the range from the April high to the October low. So what is the outlook for the S&amp;P 500 for 2012?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, the outlook on a price basis is probably a very, very low double digit advance. Corporate profits are likely to advance by more than 8 percent according to the S&amp;P Capital IQ consensus. Valuations look fairly attractive, no likelihood of a recession in the U.S., in our opinion, unless we are dragged lower by Europe and the possibility of a hard landing in China. And from a technical perspective, our belief is that the market is sort of like a coiled spring, poised to move higher, certainly into the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>HUDSON: And of course that also brings up the third and fourth quarter of 2012, big election. Could that hold back any gains?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, it could hold back some gains. I think the fact that 2011 the third year of the president's term in office was such a lackluster year, historically it implies that we could end up with a blah 2012 as well.</p><p>HUDSON: We'll leave it there. Happy New Year to you, great to see you. It's our \"Market Monitor\" as we wind up the year, Sam Stovall with S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p><p>Finally tonight, when the ball drops in Times Square, New York City tomorrow night, it will ring in more than just the New Year. It also rings in the new energy, independence and security Act. It's a mouth full but to mark the occasion, all 32,000 balls on the Times Square ball are energy efficient. The bill is designed to encourage new lighting technology like LED and halogen bulbs. It's aimed at cutting energy consumption and saving consumers money. Thanks to all of those new balls this year, the Times Square ball drop will use, get this, 88 percent less electricity than previous years.</p><p>That's it for us for this year and for tonight. It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday December 30th, the last trading day of 2011. I'm Tom Hudson. Thanks for joining us. From all of us at NBR, have a happy and safe New Year. We'll see you back here in 2012.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Tom  Hudson.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Hi, Tom.  It's great to  be here.  Good evening everyone.  I'm Susie Gharib.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HUDSON:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) says it will bring some computer  production back to the United States, but why has the stock dropped more  than 20 percent this fall?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  The fiscal cliff moves to the kitchen table.  President Obama  visits a Virginia family and tells them how the cliff could impact their  budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HUDSON:  And a very special conversation tonight with Paul Kangas.   NBR's founding co-anchor joins us to answer your questions.</p><p>  GHARIB:  We have that and more right here tonight on NBR.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Millions and millions of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers  from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) brag they were designed in California, but admit  they were built in China.  Next year, some of those Macs will be built in  the U.S. too.  CEO Tim Cook made the pledge to return to U.S. manufacturing  in two media interviews.  It marks a return for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which  transferred most of its technology building to Asia more than a decade ago.   It's more of a symbolic move though than a big financial investment.  After  all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) spends more than $9 billion a year on  manufacturing and the U.S. commitment is expected to be about $100 million  or 1 percent of its global factory investments.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't  say where in the U.S. the line of Mac computers would be built or how many  jobs might be included.  Now the return of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to U.S.  manufacturing comes as shareholders have experienced a very rocky ride in  the past few months.  The stock is down 22 percent from its all-time high  in September.  Suzanne Pratt reports.    </p><p>  SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   A peak inside  this Manhattan Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and it looks like everything is a- OK, plenty of customers, plenty of purchases.  So why has the shine come  off Apple's shares?  Within a word, actually two, profit-taking.  </p><p>  BRIAN COSTELLO, SR. EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:   I think the biggest  reason for the selling going back to when it was priced $700 in September  has been pure profit-taking.  If you look from the beginning of the year to  September, the stock was up 74 percent.  So I think you had some natural  profit-taking.  </p><p>  PRATT:  But this isn't ordinary year-end selling by institutions  looking to record nice numbers.  This supposedly is fiscal cliff related  selling as shareholders worry that capital gains tax rates will be higher  next year.  Still, financial planner Sharon Appelman says selling stock  solely for tax reasons isn't the best idea.  </p><p>  SHARON APPELMAN, FINANCIAL PLANNER:  I definitely think it's a  legitimate concern and can be an opportunity.  And I would say if somebody  was interested in reducing a position anyway, that can certainly be a great  time to do it.  You know, why pay higher taxes in a few months time when  you can pay a lower tax now?  </p><p>  PRATT:  And some analysts say, before unloading the shares, consider  that fundamentals for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven't really changed.  Sure,  revenue growth may slow and there are worries the tech giant will have  trouble fending off competition from increasingly popular Android products.   But to some analysts, the shares look especially cheap today, especially  considering their move south since the September high.  </p><p>  COSTELLO:  We think the smart phone trend is still in the early to  middle innings.  It is not in the late innings yet.  So we think, to the  extent that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can maintain its share of the premium smart  phone market, we think they'll do quite well.  You throw the iPad on top of  it and how it's cannibalizing PCs, that's another great growth driver.  </p><p>  PRATT:  It is worth noting that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are still  up more than 30 percent this year.  Even with more tax-related selling, it  will be tough to erase all of those profits in the next few weeks.  Suzanne  Pratt, NBR, New York.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose more than 1.5 percent today  and that gave a boost to stocks.  Also better than expected job news  encouraged investors.  New claims for jobless benefits fell by 25,000 in  the week ending December 1 to a lower than expected 370,000 requests and  that could be a good sign for the November jobs report that comes out  tomorrow and we'll have more on that in just a moment.   Separately,  American companies announced 57,000 job cuts in November.  That's accord to  employment firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, says that's 20 percent  higher from October's levels.  On Wall Street today, the Dow rose 39  points, the NASDAQ added 15, the S&amp;P up nearly five.  </p><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Erika Miller  in New York.  Coming up tonight, we'll talk to the CEO of kitchen store Sur  la Table and get his outlook for holiday sales.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Lots of theatrics today, but few visible signs of progress in  Washington towards a fix for the fiscal cliff.  The only hopeful sign is  that Republicans and Democrats are talking privately again.  There remains  a lot of work ahead certainly including what to do about the nation's debt  limit.  Washington will hit its borrowing limit early next year.  Darren  Gersh has the latest.  </p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Sitting around  the kitchen table with a middle class family in Virginia, the president  once again pressed for Congress to avoid the fiscal cliff.  </p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If this family has a  couple of thousand dollars less to spend, that translates into $200 billion  of less consumer spending next year.  And that's bad for businesses, large  and small.  </p><p>  GERSH:  Behind the scenes, the two sides are talking again.  But there  was no progress in public.  Senators today fought over the debt limit and  ended up deadlocked over a bill to allow the president to automatically  increase borrowing.  </p><p>  SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, MINORITY  LEADER:  He's shown what he is really  after is assuming unprecedented power to spend taxpayer dollars without any  limit at all.  </p><p>  GERSH:  If the debt limit isn't raised, the country can't pay for the  spending Congress has already approved.  And economists say the nation pays  a high price for this kind of brinkmanship.  </p><p>  MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  Business people  aren't going to engage unless they have clarity with respect to this thing.  </p><p>  GERSH:  But few insiders expect to find much clarity from Washington  in the coming weeks.  Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Investors will be searching for more clarity on those fiscal  cliff talks and they will also be studying tomorrow's important jobs  report.  But Josh Feinman says the November numbers won't give an accurate  picture of the labor market.  He's chief economist at DB Advisors.   Hi,  Josh, so you're talking about distortions in that report.  Tell us more.  </p><p>  JOSH FEINMAN, CHIEF GLOBAL ECONOMIST, DB ADVISORS:   Yes, hi, Susie.   I think that the hurricane Sandy may distort the numbers.  We've seen it in  some of the other high frequency data in the last couple of weeks.  Keep in  mind tomorrow's labor market report will report on a snapshot of the labor  market that was taken in the middle of last month.  And that's when the  hurricane and its aftermath were having their effects.  </p><p>  GHARIB:   So the consensus numbers from a survey of economists,  they're expecting American businesses added 110,000 jobs to their payroll.   Their unemployment rate staying around 7.9 percent.  Does that sit right  with you? Is that what you are seeing?  </p><p>  FEINMAN:  Probably somewhere around that, maybe a little less.  One of  the problems is it is hard to gauge exactly what the impact of the storm  will have.  We know it's transitory but it's hard to say exactly how much  numerically it will subtract.  The thing is, if the number comes in lower  than that I think a lot of people will say oh, it was probably the effect  of the hurricane and they'll wait until the following month to see what  kind of a rebound we get.  </p><p>  GHARIB:   Let's talk a little bit about what we can expect from the  job market going forward.  I don't know if you saw Alan Blinder's op/ed  piece in \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  The former Fed governor saying that if  we go over the fiscal cliff, the unemployment rate will jump to 11 percent  because we'll be a recession and customarily when you are in a recession,  the unemployment rate goes up 3 percentage points.  Does that sound right  to you?  And if that is the case, what does this mean for consumers and for  businesses?  </p><p>  FEINMAN:  Well, it would be seriously bad news.  But I think what is  important is not just whether we go over the cliff but how long we stay  over there.  I mean if it turns out that they need a couple more days to  hammer out an accord, I don't think that's going to have a big lasting  effect.  But if we go over the cliff and all those spending cuts and all  those tax hikes go into effect and stay in effect for the whole year, then  you would be talking about a very high likelihood of a recession and a  rising unemployment, a substantial rise, we can quibble about how much.   But it would be seriously bad news for consumers and businesses.  </p><p>  GHARIB:   As you know Josh, the Federal Reserve is going to be meeting  next week on Tuesday.  Certainly this is all going to be a topic around the  table.  Is there a role for the Federal Reserve in this fiscal cliff back  and forth?  </p><p>  FEINMAN:  There really isn't a direct role that they can play.  This  is fiscal policy.  The Fed does not make fiscal policy. It makes monetary  policy.  I think Chairman Bernanke and others have been very clear to stay  out of the battle that has to be resolved by the Congress and the  administration.  Look, I think at the end of the day, they are going to  reach some sort of an accord to avert the most draconian aspects of the  fiscal cliff.  Maybe the 11th, or 12th or maybe even the 13th hour, but I  think they are going to reach that because I think they recognize that the  consequences of not doing so are so severe.  </p><p>  GHARIB:   But let's face it, that even if there is a deal, we're  talking about an economy that is going to have to deal with people having  higher taxes and dealing with spending cuts.  What are you projecting for  2013 real quickly?  We have a little time left, for economic growth and  unemployment.  </p><p>  FEINMAN:  Sure.  I think the economy is going to be facing some fiscal  drag from the Federal side, but if it is phased in slowly, it's not really  austere and abrupt, I think it can handle it because I think the private  sector is healing and I'm looking for some improvement in growth by the  second half of the year provided that we don't hit a landmine here on the  fiscal side.  </p><p>  GHARIB:   All right, Josh, thanks so much, great talking with you.   We've been speaking with Josh Feinman of DB Advisors. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Nearly a month and a half after super storm Sandy wreaked  havoc along the New Jersey shore, President Obama met today with Governor  Chris Christie at the White House.  The topic was Federal aid for storm  recovery.  The president is expected to ask Congress for about $50 billion  in additional emergency help.  Ruben Ramirez is in Seaside Heights, New  Jersey tonight, where business owners are still trying to recover.  Ruben?  </p><p>  RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks, Tom.   Yes, nearly six weeks after super storm Sandy devastated this barrier  island off the coast of New Jersey, there's still a curfew in place.  A lot  of the traffic you see behind me is a lot of those longtime residents from  the island and business owners who have been going back day in and day out,  trying to recover and repair whatever's left.  Some of those business  owners we had a chance to speak to today.  They say they'll reopen come  next summer.  You've been in business 33 years.  Have you seen this sort of  devastation before?  </p><p>  SAM HAMMER, OWNER, CRAB's CLAW INN:  No, nothing like this.  We --  that's the reason we stayed because they were explaining that there was  going to be a terrible storm.  But we, of this magnitude we had no idea.   This is just like -- hard to believe.  </p><p>  RAMIREZ:  Here we are almost six weeks after the storm hit.  How soon  until you get the business open and up and running again?  </p><p>  JIM BOEKHOLT, OWNER, BEN FRANKLIN:  There's a few problems --  electrical and structural.  But hopefully in the next maybe two months, we  might be able to get open again.  But definitely we will be open for the  summer season.  </p><p>  RAMIREZ:  Tom, some of those small business owners we spoke to say  they didn't have flood insurance because they say the summer season is  short here and the insurance is just too expensive.  Tom.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Thanks, Ruben.  You'll have more from Seaside Heights  tomorrow.  We have more on how insurance companies manage risk when it  comes to natural disasters  Learn about the modeling on our web site,  nbr.com.  Look for that nbr-u tab.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Americans were feeling a little richer recently, thanks to  gains in real estate and the stock market.  The Federal Reserve said today  that household net worth rose to nearly $65 trillion between July and  September.  That's up nearly $2 trillion from the previous quarter.  Net  worth is total assets, like homes and stock portfolios, minus liabilities  like mortgages and credit card debt.  That wealth effect could make  consumers feel more comfortable about shopping this holiday season.  There  are still 20 days to go before Christmas and the rush is on.  Toys are  always popular items of course, but there's one category that's expected to  do even better and no, it's not electronics.  Erika Miller reports.    </p><p>  MILLER:  For many families, the holidays are all about the home.  Few  retailers know that better than Sur la Table, a 104-store chain selling  kitchenware and tabletop items.  CEO Jack Schwefel says sales are off to a  strong start, and credits changing American values.  </p><p>  JACK SCHWEFEL, PRES &amp; CEO, SUR LA TABLE:  I think Americans are  realizing the importance of the family meal, where people get together.  No  matter how crazy the day is, you can have that moment every day where it  becomes the most important moment of the day and you share it with the  people you love the most.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Unlike many retailers, Sur la Table says it hasn't had a  problem with showrooming this holiday season.  That's when people come in  to browse, but purchase cheaper versions online.  Part of the reason is  that 40 percent of the store's products are exclusive.  </p><p>  SCHWEFEL:  One of the things that we are most proud of is the fact  that we still import more product from Europe than we do from China.  So  you are talking about artisan product, product that has a story to it,  that's special.  You just don't see that in retailing in America.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Stores like Sur la Table are expected to be one of the few  bright spots in an otherwise lackluster holiday season.  In fact, some  analyst think home goods will be hotter than toys this holiday year.  IBM  projects home goods will see the strongest sales growth this year, up over  6 percent.  That's far more than toys and electronics.  </p><p>  JILL PUFERI, GLOBAL RETAIL LEADER, IBM:  You might ask yourself, why  home, right?  And we think home is up because of a lot of things -- things  like the changing demographic of the home itself.  There's one stat that  says 41 percent of those between 25 and 29 are living back at home.  </p><p>  MILLER:  But there also a second reason.  </p><p>  PUFERI:  We think that this holiday people are buying what they need  versus what they want.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Which had me wondering what's on Jack Schwefel's wish list  this holiday season.  It wasn't this $5,500 coffee maker.  </p><p>  SCHWEFEL:  There are some new knives in our store that I'm actually  pretty excited about, so probably those.  They're cutting board material is  actually used in the handle of the knives.  </p><p>  MILLER:  And there's no denying it will look good sur la table during  the holidays.  Erika Miller, NBR, New York.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  I know what's on your wish list.  A lot of people are buying  new housewares. You love cooking.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  I do love cooking.  Listen I think is great that the house  goods category is seeing some good growth here.  It says that there is a  lot of confidence in the housing market number one.  But let's face it,  just because it's home goods doesn't mean it's cheap Susie or inexpensive.   A $5500 coffeemaker, some of these home appliance blenders can be $500.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  If you are looking for discounts Tom, now there is green  Monday.  We have black Friday.  We've had cyber Monday. Green Monday is the  second Monday in December and that's when there is a lots of discounts  online.  So it will be good for consumers.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  We've been talking a lot about the fiscal cliff, but I think  there is the holiday cliff almost every year which is that game of chicken  between stores.  Are they going have to discount as we get closer to the  holidays or are consumers, shoppers going to spend the money that the  stores are asking for right now?  Clearly another indication that stores  perhaps may be getting a little bit nervous now.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Speaking of green, there was some green on Wall Street today.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  There was some buying on Wall Street.  Let's take a look at  our \"Market Focus\" here Susie and we saw some better than expected data on  first-time unemployment claims leading to a bit of a choppy start for the  S&amp;P 500.  After Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) went positive in the 10:00 a.m. Eastern  time hour, so did the index.  Tech stocks turned solidly higher, so did the  market, finishing up a third of a percent.  Trading volume still moderate,  616 million shares on the big board, just over 1.7 trading on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>  It was the tech sector that led the way, up 0.8 of a percent.   Consumer discretionary sector added 0.6 of 1 percent on the session.  Now  the big tech names in the Dow industrials weren't left out in the rally.   Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had the biggest percentage gains of the Dow 30 stocks.   Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) up 1.6 percent.  The CEO said the company  could manufacture semiconductors for other chip makers quote, for the right  types of products, end quote.  So, queue the rumors today that hint about  maybe Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) possibly making chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>  How about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems moving up 1.4 percent.  The move  takes Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to its highest price since September.  The top  tech sector stock was Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM).  It helps speed up  and manage online content and traffic.  A new partnership announced today  with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) led to the rally.  Shares jumping 10 percent on heavy  volume.  Analysts say the deal turns AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) from a competitor to  Akamai's customer, eliminating rival business for Akamai.  </p><p>  On the consumer side, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) red hot.  The company  said it will pay more taxes in Britain in the next two years.  Yesterday,  it also announced plans to open at least 1,500 new stores in the U.S. over  the next five years.  Shares of SBUX jumping 5.7 percent.  Volume tripled  today with the stock closing tonight at five-month highs.  </p><p>  How about tax prep giant H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB)?  It sits at a new 52- week high tonight.  It lost less money than feared last quarter.  That was  seen as good news.  H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) has been cutting costs to focus on  its core tax preparation business, especially drilling down to the digital  tax prep business.  </p><p>  Even satellite radio operator Sirius/XM radio can't resist returning  some cash to shareholders this season.  It announced a one-time dividend of  a nickel per share and a $2 billion stock buyback plan.  Sirius shares are  consistently among the most actively traded issues on the NASDAQ.  Volume  was very heavy as you'd expect today.  The stock didn't move a whole lot  though, up just $0.02.  But there was a bigger stock move in Liberty Media  Capital.  Why Liberty Media?  Well, it's the biggest shareholder of  Sirius/XM stock. It stands to get $160 million thanks to the special  dividend.  </p><p>  Online social gaming company Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has struggled to  repeat the success of its Farmville game.  It's going after a gaming  license now in Nevada.  Don't look it on the strip though.  It wants  customers to use real money, bet real money on Internet poker.  Shares  rallying 7.1 percent, volume doubled.  Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has lost more  than 70 percent of its value since becoming a publicly traded company.  </p><p>  All of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were  higher with the emerging markets fund up the most, up 0.8 of a percent.   And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>  GHARIB:  And also with some market news, one of the hedge funds  embroiled in the FBI's crackdown on insider trading is closing its doors.   Diamondback Capital Management is shutting down and that's after clients  pulled more than half a billion dollars from the fund.  Federal agents  raided the Connecticut firm two years ago as part of a nation-wide sweep  that resulted in the arrest of one of the firm's former portfolio managers  on insider trading charges.  Since then, Diamondback's assets have dwindled  to just over $1.5 billion, down from $5 billion.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Our viewers have been waiting and he's finally here.  Paul  Kangas, NBR co-founding anchor.  Welcome home, it's so nice to have you  back here.  </p><p>  PAUL KANGAS, NBR CO-FOUNDING ANCHOR:   Well, it is like home and it's  great to hear that I'm still welcome.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Actually, speaking of welcome.  We got -- Tom and I got so  many viewer questions for you and comments saying that they want to hear  from the Walter Cronkite of financial news.  A little bit of your wisdom in  these confusing time, right, Tom.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Absolutely there is so much going on in the market and you've  seen so much market cycles.  We got a lot to talk about, but what we have  got to ask ,what do you make of the stock market today?  </p><p>  KANGAS:  It's sort of a stop and go affair.  We get good news one day,  better building permits and building news and on that front.  And inflation  is down a little bit.  And then the next day it's all countered by new  uprisings in Egypt and one thing or another.  So the market tries to step  higher and is countered by bad news.  So stop and go all the way.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  We got a great question from Eric P. Edson.  You saw the Dow  Industrials move from 1,000 to over 10,000 in your career.  He asks, will  the Dow Jones see 8,000 or 18,000 first?  </p><p>  KANGAS:  Well, there's not that much volatility but it could see both  in the same year.  But I intend, I'm actually a little on the bullish bias  because corporations continue to make money and the American people are  basically optimistic.  And a lot of stocks are under priced, particularly  blue chips even though the Dow Industrial Average has more than doubled  since 2009.  But there's a reason for that and that's good earnings and  that's good dividends.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, there's a lot of questions about if that is going to  continue.  And one of our viewers has a question for you about the fiscal  cliff.  You know all about the back and forth and the drama about the  fiscal cliff and Delores Kile wants your thoughts on where do you stand on  this whole fiscal cliff?  How can it play out?  </p><p>  KANGAS:   Congress better get off its duff and do something.  And I  think that finally the pressure is going to be enough (ph).  But they  always do it right to the last, you know, minute.  But I think it's got to  happen or they're going to be ousted from their hallowed political seats.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  You could argue in the three years you've been away from the  NBR anchor desk Congress hasn't done a whole heck of a lot to address the  fiscal situation.  </p><p>  KANGAS:   No it's just ridiculous.  I mean these are our elected  representatives and they have got to pay a little more attention to those  that got them in the office.  And they're arguing amongst themselves  without much care about the people they represent.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  A lot of those folks are retirees, we do have a question  about retirement from Anita asking what is the investing or financial  planning lesson Paul uses most during retirement?  </p><p>  KANGAS:   Well, the number one is hope I can live my life to the last  and still have enough capital to keep me going.  And a lot of investors are  running up against the same thing.  They're running out of capital because  yields are so low in the bond market; money markets are yielding  practically nothing.  So they have to chip into their base capital and  that's hurtful.  So what I am doing is looking for blue chip stocks with  decent dividends.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  A lot of people are wondering that in this climate, what do  you think is going to be the new investment opportunity available to all of  us in 2013?  That's a question from Fay.  </p><p>  KANGAS:  New investment opportunity.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  What is your prediction?  </p><p>  KANGAS:  They'll come up with something new just like ETF exchange- traded funds were relatively new a few years ago and now have gained such  popularity it is almost, it's staggering how much money has gone into ETFs.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  You mentioned how volatility could have the Dow see 8,000 and  18,000, maybe in the same year.  Frank sent us a tweet on Twitter asking  individual investors are afraid of the markets.  What needs to be done to  gain their confidence?  </p><p>  KANGAS:   Less regulation.  I think that investors are afraid that  they make an investment and something comes along, the rules change from  what got them into the investment in the first place.  Well you can't  change, you know, canoes in the middle of a stream.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  On this whole subject of investor confidence, we do have a  question from Billy who says what's the greatest changes that you've seen  in the market today?  You've had some perspective three years being away  from it on a day-to-day basis.  What do you see as the biggest change?  </p><p>  KANGAS:  Well, Billy, I'll tell you that the computer is a wonderful  thing, but it's not the greatest thing for investing.  And for investors  who don't have a high speed capability and have large box of stock at their  arm's length.  I think that that is -- it's taken away the idea that long- term, long-term investing is a good thing.  I think that's one of the  changes that I don't like.  Too much computer meddling.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Well, Paul, as much as the markets have changed, you haven't.   It's great to see and hear from you again.  Susie, we have to say good  night but I think it's only proper to ask Paul.  </p><p>  KANGAS:  I'm Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Tom Hudson. Stocks fall on fresh signs that even the Federal Reserve is not sure how much is enough when it comes to boosting the economy, by buying government bonds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Susie Gharib. Can two weaklings become strong by teaming up? That's what Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are hoping for, as they decide to merge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: And a bit of a mixed picture on American housing, contractors break ground on more single family homes, but pull back on building apartments and condos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: We have that and more tonight on NBR. How much longer should the Federal Reserve continue to stimulate the economy? That question was intensely debated at the central bank's policy meeting in January according to the minutes that were released today. Stocks sold off on that news, as investors worry the Fed might taper off its stimulus program sooner than expected and before its goal of seeing a big pick up in the job market.</p><p>Now the Fed has been buying $85 billion of mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries every month to pump up the economy. Here's what those Fed minutes revealed. Many policymakers voiced concerns about potential costs and risks from more bond buying. Others said that the easy money policies might encourage excessive risk-taking and that could have adverse consequences for financial stability. Policymakers also noted positive developments in the economy, as more businesses are optimistic about the economic outlook. But nervousness about the Fed's next moves pulled down stocks. On Wall Street the Dow lost 108 points, closing below the critical 14,000 level. The NASDAQ was down about 50, the S&amp;P lost 19 points.</p><p>HUDSON: Before the Federal Reserve's notes on its last meeting were released this afternoon, we saw a mixed report this morning on the American housing market. Construction starts on new homes fell 8.5 percent in January. But that drop in the headline number was pulled down by a drop in apartment and condominium construction. The number of single family homes that began going up last month rose 0.8 of a percent up to its highest level since the great recession. Darren Gersh digs deeper.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In housing, one month does not a trend make. Analysts shrugged off the news that housing starts fell last month. Instead they're looking to encouraging trends on home prices, rents and overall demand.</p><p>JED SMITH, MANAGING DIR., NATL ASSN. OF REALTORS: There are going to be these squiggles, blips in the market as things happen, just because they happen from month to month -- snow storms, weather, holidays, whatever, but right now we are in a recovering market.</p><p>GERSH: Homes sales are up more than 10 percent over last year and builders are picking up the pace. They are now on track to build around 900,000 homes this year, but by the end of the year, the National Association of Realtors expects the pace to pick up to an annual rate of 1.1 million starts. That's great, but keep in mind a normal year for home construction is closer to 1.8 million. The outlook for apartments and other multi-family construction is also good, even though those starts dropped last month. Rents rose 4.5 percent last year and researchers at Zillow expect a similar increase this year. That's why investors are pouring into the market and building new apartments.</p><p>STAN HUMPHRIES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ZILLOW: Assuming you can buy the property cheaply or build it cheaply and you can rent it out, then you're seeing 4.5 percent growth in your top line numbers for what you are able to rent it out for looks pretty attractive.</p><p>GERSH: But the outlook varies depending on where you live and how strong the job market is in your area.</p><p>SMITH: The market will be up a lot more in Texas than it will be in parts of the east coast. Of course, on the west coast we've got a bit of a housing shortage. Inventory is tightest there. So I think there we will continue to see starts and see more starts in the future, simply because we've got tight inventory.</p><p>GERSH: Economists say housing is far from normal but it is now strong enough that it's once again playing its traditional supporting role for the economy following a tough recession. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Joe Davis joins us now. He's chief economist at Vanguard. That's the giant mutual fund company. Joe, nice to have you with us on this important day. Let me start by asking you, do you think the Fed is taking on too much risk?</p><p>JOE DAVIS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VANGUARD GROUP: I think there is an argument that can be made. We've had a concern for more than a year that there are both costs as well as benefits with respect to very aggressive monetary policy. And just some of the behavior we've seen in the financial markets. I know the earlier report talked about excessive risk taking. So I've had a concern that those costs associated with monetary policy may not have been given the sort of credence they should have been. So a positive development in my mind, to today's minutes was that Federal Reserve policymakers were more aggressively talking about both the pros and cons with respect to aggressive monetary policy.</p><p>GHARIB: One thing that we've been hearing repeatedly from the Federal Reserve is that they're not going to make any change in this policy, raising interest rates or anything like that, until the economy is stronger. Most notably that the job market picks up, that the unemployment rate gets to the 6.5 percent level. So given today's numbers that we've had on housing and given that we're seeing that gasoline prices are going up, is the economy really strong enough to even begin talking about raising interest rates?</p><p>DAVIS: I don't know about that, but I think it is important to start talking about the beginning of the end in terms of how aggressively the Federal Reserve has purchased certain securities, particularly fixed-income securities. And so I think in that regard, I would make the case that the economy is markedly stronger today than it was just a year or two ago. You mentioned housing. The business sector, consumers are less debt-burdened than they were two or three years ago. And so by those measures, I'm hard- pressed to find the reason why six months from now, the Federal Reserve would have the pedal to the floor of the car so to speak as they have had for the past two or three years.</p><p>GHARIB: What is going to be the time table on this? To some extent, we saw with the gold prices today and oil prices that commodities are already responding to some changes in the marketplace. But when do you think that the Fed realistically will be acting on an exit strategy?</p><p>DAVIS: I think the exit strategy will be over the next six to 12 months in terms of more vocal conversations and guidance with respect to the amount and the frequency of their purchases. I think a later stage is then contemplation of raising interest rates, raising the Fed funds rate, which is effectively at zero. I think there it will be much more important on the labor market front in terms of job progress. I think all the other conditions are in place to see a modest acceleration in job growth, but it is going to take some time to bring that unemployment rate down, if I'm correct, that some Americans return to the labor force.</p><p>GHARIB: One concern for a lot of people as investors is what do I do now? A lot of people started putting money in the market. I know you're an economist, but you also are at Vanguard with all of the mutual funds. What is the view at Vanguard about what investors should be doing right now, given the uncertainty about this and things going on in Washington?</p><p>DAVIS: I think the hardest thing to do but I think what many investors actually are doing is to actually look through some of these headlines, to embrace that long-term orientation, look at the balance and risks and what you're trying to achieve with your portfolio. And if that ascertation (ph) of that plan is the same today as it was two, five, 10 years ago, it is really critical to stick with that plan. I think even going back three years ago, our message to clients was, listen, the economic environment may be challenging, but you can still have decent portfolio returns. And actually since that time, we've had decent portfolio returns, both on the equity market as well as in bond portfolios. So continuing to reaffirm that message and for investors to stay invested in markets. Because we are going to have ups and downs as the economy just muddles through some of this.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot more to talk about and we'll continue this conversation, but we have to wrap it up for now. Thanks so much, Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard.</p><p>DAVIS: Thank you, Susie.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Still ahead, Martha's in the middle of a courtroom showdown between two major retailers. What's at stake for the stores and her brand?</p><p>HUDSON: There is progress to report tonight from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on the battery issue plaguing its 787 Dreamliner. Still the planes remain grounded this evening. The aircraft maker may have found a fix for the plane's battery problems, by making bigger gaps between battery cells, that's according to Reuters. Boeing's head of commercial engines is expected to meet with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration Friday to present a 10-point plan to prevent battery fires or meltdowns. Neither Boeing (NYSE:BA) nor the FAA are commenting. Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose slightly today to close at $74.78 per share.</p><p>GHARIB: Two big and struggling office supply companies are teaming up. Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) is merging with Office Max in a stock deal valued at more than $1 billion. A union of the two companies has been rumored for years, given trouble in the office supply sector. But investors didn't buy in to the concept. Shares of Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tumbled 16 percent; Office Max fell 7 percent and even rival Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) was down today on the news, off 7 percent. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you want a good read on the economy, it helps to watch demand for office supplies. When the economy is booming, businesses need more pens, paper and printers. But growth has been weak since the great recession and that has meant less demand for office products. Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max have been struggling behind industry leader Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS).</p><p>LIANG FENG, SPECIALTY RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is just -- their retail store is about 25-30 percent more productive than comparable locations. And they also have much more attractive business customer mix. They have the mid-size customers, compared to Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max which are dependent on the lower margin large customers.</p><p>MILLER: Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max hope by merging, they will be able to save big bucks by closing stores, combining operations, cutting advertising costs and negotiating better prices from suppliers. But office supply stores are also facing stiff competition from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those retailers have lower cost structures which often means lower prices. What's worse, the office supply stores are losing their most lucrative customers.</p><p>FENG: Your highest margin customers are your small business customers or somebody who just wants to buy something for the home office. And what we've seen is that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are targeting these higher margin small business customers.</p><p>MILLER: Those struggles are reflected in the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max stock prices. Shares of both companies have plunged more than 70 percent from their highs back in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tried to merge in 1997, but the deal was blocked by regulators because of fear it would lead to higher prices. But most industry experts give this deal a high probability of going through. Longer-term, this deal is expected to be good for Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max, but also their biggest competitor. If Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max close stores, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) will face competition. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Combined these two companies have about 2,000 retail stores in North America. And as Erika just mentioned, some of those stores are expected to close, if the deal happens. That potentially could leave vacant millions of square feet of commercial real estate. Brian Jones is a portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman real estate fund. He joins us tonight from the NASDAQ. Brian, what kind of shape is retail real estate in as it faces what could be a pretty big consolidation?</p><p>BRIAN JONES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE FUND: Well, thank you for having me tonight. I think retail real estate is in a very good situation right now. What we've seen over the past two years have been improving occupancies and in many of the better markets, we're beginning to see rental rate growth. This is largely driven by the fact that there is very little new construction of retail centers going on in the United States currently. And thus, any retailers looking to grow have to find space in the existing centers in order to fund and continue their growth efforts.</p><p>HUDSON: Let's assume that Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are successful in combining their resources. Does this square footage, presumably that would become vacant in the years ahead, actually help relieve some of the pressure that you're seeing today?</p><p>JONES: Well, what we would say is that these two tenants are still relatively small when compared to the total pie of retail real estate. When we looked at the REITs in our coverage universe, we found that combined, Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max were in every case at less than 2 percent of the rental revenues for the REITs in our coverage universe. So together, they're relatively small tenants for the overall retail REIT universe and the retail space in general. What it will provide is the opportunity for some of the retailers that have growth plans to actually find centers to grow in. And so we think that over time, a lot of the stores that are closed will be released to stronger tenants. And in many cases, that will end up strengthening the underlying center, where the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) or the Office Max have gone out.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned your coverage universe and you did bring along one kind of outdoor shopping real estate investment trust that you do like here, Federal reality investment trust, ticker on this one is FRT. What make this on stand out in a crowded market?</p><p>JONES: One thing I would like to point out is that this highlights one of the benefits of investing in REITs, as opposed to a single piece of direct real estate. Most of the retail REITs in our coverage universe own dozens, if not hundreds, of retail centers. So they're generally diversified by geography or by tenant mix and by product type. So Federal realty is an excellent example of a retail REIT that owns high quality centers in areas that have high population densities and above average incomes. And these are the locations where many of the growing retailers, such as TJ Max and Marshal's, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Rack, Five Guys Burgers, Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) -- the retailers that are looking to grow are focused on these higher income, higher density markets. And this is where Federal is positioned. And we think that they are positioned to do well in the future.</p><p>HUDSON: OK.</p><p>JONES: Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are not within their top 25 tenants.</p><p>HUDSON: Gotcha. And that's something you like at this point for FRT. Do you have a position in the fund in that stock?</p><p>JONES: Yes, we do own Federal reality in our mutual funds, the Neuberger Berman real estate fund.</p><p>HUDSON: And you help manage it. It is Brian Jones along with us tonight from Neuberger Berman. Thanks Brian.</p><p>JONES: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: It's Macy's (NYSE:M) versus JC Penney in a high stakes fight over bed linens, cocktail napkins and kitchen tools. At issue here, who will be allowed to carry products with Martha Stewart's name on them? Macy's (NYSE:M) has been selling Stewart's merchandise since 2007. It claims it owns the exclusive rights to carry her home furnishings. But rival JC Penney argues it has the right to sell other Stewart-branded products that Macy's (NYSE:M) doesn't carry. Ruben Ramirez reports.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Martha's in the middle, as two of the nation's best-known department stores fight in New York State Supreme Court over just who can carry the domestic diva's home products.</p><p>GREG LITTLE, PARTNER, WHITE &amp; CASE: Two different companies are looking at the same agreement and are interpreting it different ways. Macys is interpreting it very broadly; Penney's is interpreting it very narrowly.</p><p>RAMIREZ: There's no denying the appeal of carrying Martha Stewart's brand. Macy's (NYSE:M) says it has billions of dollars on the line.</p><p>MICHAEL APPEL, FOUNDER, APPEL &amp; ASSOCIATES: For Macys, having a differentiated exclusive brand is critical to their competitive strategy and they've invested a lot of time and effort in building up the Martha Stewart brand, giving her exposure in the stores and it's a linchpin of their home strategy.</p><p>RAMIREZ: For, JCP, Martha is a key part of its store within a store turnaround plan.</p><p>APPEL: She can appeal to the kind of customer that Penney's has and the customer whom they want to get which is more I think a little more upscale than what they have right now.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Penney's is counting on a clause in Stewart's original contract with Macy's (NYSE:M), which allowed her to open stand-alone stores, arguing the clause never said that stand alone shops could not be inside a bigger store. If JCP is successful, Appel says it opens up another retail channel for Stewart's company.</p><p>APPEL: The merchandising end of her business is the only part of her business right now that is growing and is profitable and for her to be able to increase her distribution is critical to her business strategy.</p><p>RAMIREZ: The trial got underway in a Manhattan Federal courtroom today and now that it's begun, attorneys say a settlement could be coming.</p><p>LITTLE: There is something about a trial that forces parties to look at the facts a little bit differently than they do when they're not at trial and it may well be that they reach a compromise at that point.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Martha Stewart, along and the CEOs of both Macy's (NYSE:M) and JC Penney are expected to take the stand. The trial is slated to last about two-and-a-half weeks. But unlike other courtroom cases which are decided by a jury, one judge will decide the outcome of this one. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: In the \"Market Focus\" here today, what started out as just some mild selling picked up this afternoon with some Federal Reserve officials worrying about how long to keep buying bonds to help the economy. Here's the daily trade for the S&amp;P 500. Now the news from the Federal Reserve came out just after 2:00 Eastern time. That's when the index starting seeing some selling momentum. The index finished down by 1.2 percent. Remember though, it was at a five and a half year high at yesterday's close. Trading volume though did pick up, 815 million shares moving on the big board, two billion traded on the NASDAQ.</p><p>All 10 of the major stock sectors were lower today. The materials sector seeing the biggest loss, down 2.8 percent followed by the selling that we saw in energy and consumer discretionary sectors.</p><p>Two gold and copper miners saw the heaviest selling among those material stocks. Gold and copper metal prices were down sharply today. Freeport McMoran falling 6 percent. This is a two-and-a-half month low for FCX. Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) falling 5.5 percent, NEM tonight at a new 52-week low. AA, aluminum maker Alcoa (NYSE:AA) hit too, falling 3.3 percent. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been seeing aluminum prices stabilize.</p><p>In addition to the drop in new home construction last month, we heard from home builder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL). It earned $0.03 per share in the last quarter, certainly an improvement from the loss a year ago, but considerably less than estimates. The company reported that average selling prices were lower. Shares were lower as well, falling 9 percent. The stock has lost 10 percent in less than a week after staging a big rally over the past year. Other homebuilder stocks getting hit. Pulte Group falling 6.8 percent, DR Horton off by 5.8 percent.</p><p>Foxconn is not a household name in the U.S., but if you use an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) computer or many other dozens of other electronic devices, Foxconn is the Taiwanese company that assembles it. Today Foxconn said it has frozen the hiring of assembly line workers in China after the lunar holiday there. That fed speculation about demand for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and HP products. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares falling 2.2 percent since the plant affected makes iPhone fives, but Foxconn said its decision is not related to making the iPhone. An analyst at investment banking firm UBS thinks it could be instead because of less demand for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) desktop computers. HPQ shares down by 1.1 percent. HPs quarterly earnings are due tomorrow after the closing bell, one to watch.</p><p>Independent energy companies Devon and Anadarko updated their shareholders on their latest strategies. Both though were greeted today with selling. APC is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), down 4.5 percent. Its energy production outlook was less than expected while its forecast for capital spending was more than anticipated. Anadarko says it expects to be among the most active deepwater drillers this year. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) falling 6.6 percent after saying it may try again to spin off its pipeline and processing businesses. It tried that six years ago, but stopped after the economy weakened.</p><p>Four of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were lower on the broad market sell-off. The S&amp;P 500 volatility note though jumped 8.6 percent. It usually moves in the opposite direction of the broad market as it did today. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Whether it's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram or Pinterest, there always seems to be a hot start-up in the tech pipeline. But as tonight's commentator explains, the next big tech company might not be as original as you think. He's Harry Lin, executive-in-residence at Idealab. It's a technology incubator in Pasadena, California.</p><p>HARRY LIN, EXECUTIVE-IN-RESIDENCE, IDEALAB: An irony in the world of technology start-ups is that we tend to copy each other a lot. I call this ironic because the image of tech start-ups is that they're all about innovation and risk taking. Yet, venture capital investors and tech entrepreneurs all know that for every Instagram that gets launched, there are at least 10 other start-ups that pretty much are Instagram, just with a different name. Did you know that there are at least three well-funded startups? I'm talking more than $10 million of investor capital, that match dog owners with dog sitters? The number of me-too start-ups goes crazy when you look at other types of products and services: project management software, call ordering food online, music streaming, cloud file storage and I can't even keep track of all the fashion and clothing sale sites duking it out on the Internet. There are scores of them! Even Pinterest has at least half a dozen straight up clones.</p><p>So why is an industry that's supposedly about innovation and disruption so quick to copy itself? Investors may call their capital venture, but they're looking for safe bets. So when something seems to be working, why not invest in the same thing? We also know that in some niches, there's space for several winners, so maybe investing in the me-too will work out. The entrepreneurial myth is that we invent new stuff, when, much of the time, we engineer twists or slants on old stuff. It's really, really hard to come up with a brand-new idea that's never been tried. So this copy-catting will continue and I'll continue to call it ironic. I'm Harry Lin.</p><p>HUDSON: Whether copy cats or not, all entrepreneurs certainly face difficulty at one time or another staying motivated. Our NBRU partners at Vanderbilt University have eight steps for staying motivated to reach long- term goals. Just head to nbr.com and look for that NBRU tab.</p><p>GHARIB: And let's take a look at what's coming up tomorrow on NBR. Ford is hiring. It's adding jobs at its Cleveland plant that builds the eco-boost engines. But it's not alone. We look at job creation in the U.S. auto industry.</p><p>HUDSON: That's it for the broadcast here on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Wednesday night, February 20. Have a great evening, you too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you Tom. Thanks for watching everyone and we'll see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Tom Hudson.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Hi, Tom. It's great to be here. Good evening everyone. I'm Susie Gharib.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) says it will bring some computer production back to the United States, but why has the stock dropped more than 20 percent this fall?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: The fiscal cliff moves to the kitchen table. President Obama visits a Virginia family and tells them how the cliff could impact their budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: And a very special conversation tonight with Paul Kangas. NBR's founding co-anchor joins us to answer your questions.</p><p>GHARIB: We have that and more right here tonight on NBR.</p><p>HUDSON: Millions and millions of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) brag they were designed in California, but admit they were built in China. Next year, some of those Macs will be built in the U.S. too. CEO Tim Cook made the pledge to return to U.S. manufacturing in two media interviews. It marks a return for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which transferred most of its technology building to Asia more than a decade ago. It's more of a symbolic move though than a big financial investment. After all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) spends more than $9 billion a year on manufacturing and the U.S. commitment is expected to be about $100 million or 1 percent of its global factory investments. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't say where in the U.S. the line of Mac computers would be built or how many jobs might be included. Now the return of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to U.S. manufacturing comes as shareholders have experienced a very rocky ride in the past few months. The stock is down 22 percent from its all-time high in September. Suzanne Pratt reports.</p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A peak inside this Manhattan Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and it looks like everything is a- OK, plenty of customers, plenty of purchases. So why has the shine come off Apple's shares? Within a word, actually two, profit-taking.</p><p>BRIAN COSTELLO, SR. EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: I think the biggest reason for the selling going back to when it was priced $700 in September has been pure profit-taking. If you look from the beginning of the year to September, the stock was up 74 percent. So I think you had some natural profit-taking.</p><p>PRATT: But this isn't ordinary year-end selling by institutions looking to record nice numbers. This supposedly is fiscal cliff related selling as shareholders worry that capital gains tax rates will be higher next year. Still, financial planner Sharon Appelman says selling stock solely for tax reasons isn't the best idea.</p><p>SHARON APPELMAN, FINANCIAL PLANNER: I definitely think it's a legitimate concern and can be an opportunity. And I would say if somebody was interested in reducing a position anyway, that can certainly be a great time to do it. You know, why pay higher taxes in a few months time when you can pay a lower tax now?</p><p>PRATT: And some analysts say, before unloading the shares, consider that fundamentals for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven't really changed. Sure, revenue growth may slow and there are worries the tech giant will have trouble fending off competition from increasingly popular Android products. But to some analysts, the shares look especially cheap today, especially considering their move south since the September high.</p><p>COSTELLO: We think the smart phone trend is still in the early to middle innings. It is not in the late innings yet. So we think, to the extent that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can maintain its share of the premium smart phone market, we think they'll do quite well. You throw the iPad on top of it and how it's cannibalizing PCs, that's another great growth driver.</p><p>PRATT: It is worth noting that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are still up more than 30 percent this year. Even with more tax-related selling, it will be tough to erase all of those profits in the next few weeks. Suzanne Pratt, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose more than 1.5 percent today and that gave a boost to stocks. Also better than expected job news encouraged investors. New claims for jobless benefits fell by 25,000 in the week ending December 1 to a lower than expected 370,000 requests and that could be a good sign for the November jobs report that comes out tomorrow and we'll have more on that in just a moment. Separately, American companies announced 57,000 job cuts in November. That's accord to employment firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, says that's 20 percent higher from October's levels. On Wall Street today, the Dow rose 39 points, the NASDAQ added 15, the S&amp;P up nearly five.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I'm Erika Miller in New York. Coming up tonight, we'll talk to the CEO of kitchen store Sur la Table and get his outlook for holiday sales.</p><p>HUDSON: Lots of theatrics today, but few visible signs of progress in Washington towards a fix for the fiscal cliff. The only hopeful sign is that Republicans and Democrats are talking privately again. There remains a lot of work ahead certainly including what to do about the nation's debt limit. Washington will hit its borrowing limit early next year. Darren Gersh has the latest.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Sitting around the kitchen table with a middle class family in Virginia, the president once again pressed for Congress to avoid the fiscal cliff.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If this family has a couple of thousand dollars less to spend, that translates into $200 billion of less consumer spending next year. And that's bad for businesses, large and small.</p><p>GERSH: Behind the scenes, the two sides are talking again. But there was no progress in public. Senators today fought over the debt limit and ended up deadlocked over a bill to allow the president to automatically increase borrowing.</p><p>SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, MINORITY LEADER: He's shown what he is really after is assuming unprecedented power to spend taxpayer dollars without any limit at all.</p><p>GERSH: If the debt limit isn't raised, the country can't pay for the spending Congress has already approved. And economists say the nation pays a high price for this kind of brinkmanship.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Business people aren't going to engage unless they have clarity with respect to this thing.</p><p>GERSH: But few insiders expect to find much clarity from Washington in the coming weeks. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Investors will be searching for more clarity on those fiscal cliff talks and they will also be studying tomorrow's important jobs report. But Josh Feinman says the November numbers won't give an accurate picture of the labor market. He's chief economist at DB Advisors. Hi, Josh, so you're talking about distortions in that report. Tell us more.</p><p>JOSH FEINMAN, CHIEF GLOBAL ECONOMIST, DB ADVISORS: Yes, hi, Susie. I think that the hurricane Sandy may distort the numbers. We've seen it in some of the other high frequency data in the last couple of weeks. Keep in mind tomorrow's labor market report will report on a snapshot of the labor market that was taken in the middle of last month. And that's when the hurricane and its aftermath were having their effects.</p><p>GHARIB: So the consensus numbers from a survey of economists, they're expecting American businesses added 110,000 jobs to their payroll. Their unemployment rate staying around 7.9 percent. Does that sit right with you? Is that what you are seeing?</p><p>FEINMAN: Probably somewhere around that, maybe a little less. One of the problems is it is hard to gauge exactly what the impact of the storm will have. We know it's transitory but it's hard to say exactly how much numerically it will subtract. The thing is, if the number comes in lower than that I think a lot of people will say oh, it was probably the effect of the hurricane and they'll wait until the following month to see what kind of a rebound we get.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's talk a little bit about what we can expect from the job market going forward. I don't know if you saw Alan Blinder's op/ed piece in \"The Wall Street Journal.\" The former Fed governor saying that if we go over the fiscal cliff, the unemployment rate will jump to 11 percent because we'll be a recession and customarily when you are in a recession, the unemployment rate goes up 3 percentage points. Does that sound right to you? And if that is the case, what does this mean for consumers and for businesses?</p><p>FEINMAN: Well, it would be seriously bad news. But I think what is important is not just whether we go over the cliff but how long we stay over there. I mean if it turns out that they need a couple more days to hammer out an accord, I don't think that's going to have a big lasting effect. But if we go over the cliff and all those spending cuts and all those tax hikes go into effect and stay in effect for the whole year, then you would be talking about a very high likelihood of a recession and a rising unemployment, a substantial rise, we can quibble about how much. But it would be seriously bad news for consumers and businesses.</p><p>GHARIB: As you know Josh, the Federal Reserve is going to be meeting next week on Tuesday. Certainly this is all going to be a topic around the table. Is there a role for the Federal Reserve in this fiscal cliff back and forth?</p><p>FEINMAN: There really isn't a direct role that they can play. This is fiscal policy. The Fed does not make fiscal policy. It makes monetary policy. I think Chairman Bernanke and others have been very clear to stay out of the battle that has to be resolved by the Congress and the administration. Look, I think at the end of the day, they are going to reach some sort of an accord to avert the most draconian aspects of the fiscal cliff. Maybe the 11th, or 12th or maybe even the 13th hour, but I think they are going to reach that because I think they recognize that the consequences of not doing so are so severe.</p><p>GHARIB: But let's face it, that even if there is a deal, we're talking about an economy that is going to have to deal with people having higher taxes and dealing with spending cuts. What are you projecting for 2013 real quickly? We have a little time left, for economic growth and unemployment.</p><p>FEINMAN: Sure. I think the economy is going to be facing some fiscal drag from the Federal side, but if it is phased in slowly, it's not really austere and abrupt, I think it can handle it because I think the private sector is healing and I'm looking for some improvement in growth by the second half of the year provided that we don't hit a landmine here on the fiscal side.</p><p>GHARIB: All right, Josh, thanks so much, great talking with you. We've been speaking with Josh Feinman of DB Advisors.</p><p>HUDSON: Nearly a month and a half after super storm Sandy wreaked havoc along the New Jersey shore, President Obama met today with Governor Chris Christie at the White House. The topic was Federal aid for storm recovery. The president is expected to ask Congress for about $50 billion in additional emergency help. Ruben Ramirez is in Seaside Heights, New Jersey tonight, where business owners are still trying to recover. Ruben?</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Tom. Yes, nearly six weeks after super storm Sandy devastated this barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, there's still a curfew in place. A lot of the traffic you see behind me is a lot of those longtime residents from the island and business owners who have been going back day in and day out, trying to recover and repair whatever's left. Some of those business owners we had a chance to speak to today. They say they'll reopen come next summer. You've been in business 33 years. Have you seen this sort of devastation before?</p><p>SAM HAMMER, OWNER, CRAB's CLAW INN: No, nothing like this. We -- that's the reason we stayed because they were explaining that there was going to be a terrible storm. But we, of this magnitude we had no idea. This is just like -- hard to believe.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Here we are almost six weeks after the storm hit. How soon until you get the business open and up and running again?</p><p>JIM BOEKHOLT, OWNER, BEN FRANKLIN: There's a few problems -- electrical and structural. But hopefully in the next maybe two months, we might be able to get open again. But definitely we will be open for the summer season.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Tom, some of those small business owners we spoke to say they didn't have flood insurance because they say the summer season is short here and the insurance is just too expensive. Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Thanks, Ruben. You'll have more from Seaside Heights tomorrow. We have more on how insurance companies manage risk when it comes to natural disasters Learn about the modeling on our web site, nbr.com. Look for that nbr-u tab.</p><p>GHARIB: Americans were feeling a little richer recently, thanks to gains in real estate and the stock market. The Federal Reserve said today that household net worth rose to nearly $65 trillion between July and September. That's up nearly $2 trillion from the previous quarter. Net worth is total assets, like homes and stock portfolios, minus liabilities like mortgages and credit card debt. That wealth effect could make consumers feel more comfortable about shopping this holiday season. There are still 20 days to go before Christmas and the rush is on. Toys are always popular items of course, but there's one category that's expected to do even better and no, it's not electronics. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>MILLER: For many families, the holidays are all about the home. Few retailers know that better than Sur la Table, a 104-store chain selling kitchenware and tabletop items. CEO Jack Schwefel says sales are off to a strong start, and credits changing American values.</p><p>JACK SCHWEFEL, PRES &amp; CEO, SUR LA TABLE: I think Americans are realizing the importance of the family meal, where people get together. No matter how crazy the day is, you can have that moment every day where it becomes the most important moment of the day and you share it with the people you love the most.</p><p>MILLER: Unlike many retailers, Sur la Table says it hasn't had a problem with showrooming this holiday season. That's when people come in to browse, but purchase cheaper versions online. Part of the reason is that 40 percent of the store's products are exclusive.</p><p>SCHWEFEL: One of the things that we are most proud of is the fact that we still import more product from Europe than we do from China. So you are talking about artisan product, product that has a story to it, that's special. You just don't see that in retailing in America.</p><p>MILLER: Stores like Sur la Table are expected to be one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster holiday season. In fact, some analyst think home goods will be hotter than toys this holiday year. IBM projects home goods will see the strongest sales growth this year, up over 6 percent. That's far more than toys and electronics.</p><p>JILL PUFERI, GLOBAL RETAIL LEADER, IBM: You might ask yourself, why home, right? And we think home is up because of a lot of things -- things like the changing demographic of the home itself. There's one stat that says 41 percent of those between 25 and 29 are living back at home.</p><p>MILLER: But there also a second reason.</p><p>PUFERI: We think that this holiday people are buying what they need versus what they want.</p><p>MILLER: Which had me wondering what's on Jack Schwefel's wish list this holiday season. It wasn't this $5,500 coffee maker.</p><p>SCHWEFEL: There are some new knives in our store that I'm actually pretty excited about, so probably those. They're cutting board material is actually used in the handle of the knives.</p><p>MILLER: And there's no denying it will look good sur la table during the holidays. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>GHARIB: I know what's on your wish list. A lot of people are buying new housewares. You love cooking.</p><p>HUDSON: I do love cooking. Listen I think is great that the house goods category is seeing some good growth here. It says that there is a lot of confidence in the housing market number one. But let's face it, just because it's home goods doesn't mean it's cheap Susie or inexpensive. A $5500 coffeemaker, some of these home appliance blenders can be $500.</p><p>GHARIB: If you are looking for discounts Tom, now there is green Monday. We have black Friday. We've had cyber Monday. Green Monday is the second Monday in December and that's when there is a lots of discounts online. So it will be good for consumers.</p><p>HUDSON: We've been talking a lot about the fiscal cliff, but I think there is the holiday cliff almost every year which is that game of chicken between stores. Are they going have to discount as we get closer to the holidays or are consumers, shoppers going to spend the money that the stores are asking for right now? Clearly another indication that stores perhaps may be getting a little bit nervous now.</p><p>GHARIB: Speaking of green, there was some green on Wall Street today.</p><p>HUDSON: There was some buying on Wall Street. Let's take a look at our \"Market Focus\" here Susie and we saw some better than expected data on first-time unemployment claims leading to a bit of a choppy start for the S&amp;P 500. After Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) went positive in the 10:00 a.m. Eastern time hour, so did the index. Tech stocks turned solidly higher, so did the market, finishing up a third of a percent. Trading volume still moderate, 616 million shares on the big board, just over 1.7 trading on the NASDAQ.</p><p>It was the tech sector that led the way, up 0.8 of a percent. Consumer discretionary sector added 0.6 of 1 percent on the session. Now the big tech names in the Dow industrials weren't left out in the rally. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had the biggest percentage gains of the Dow 30 stocks. Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) up 1.6 percent. The CEO said the company could manufacture semiconductors for other chip makers quote, for the right types of products, end quote. So, queue the rumors today that hint about maybe Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) possibly making chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>How about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems moving up 1.4 percent. The move takes Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to its highest price since September. The top tech sector stock was Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM). It helps speed up and manage online content and traffic. A new partnership announced today with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) led to the rally. Shares jumping 10 percent on heavy volume. Analysts say the deal turns AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) from a competitor to Akamai's customer, eliminating rival business for Akamai.</p><p>On the consumer side, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) red hot. The company said it will pay more taxes in Britain in the next two years. Yesterday, it also announced plans to open at least 1,500 new stores in the U.S. over the next five years. Shares of SBUX jumping 5.7 percent. Volume tripled today with the stock closing tonight at five-month highs.</p><p>How about tax prep giant H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB)? It sits at a new 52- week high tonight. It lost less money than feared last quarter. That was seen as good news. H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) has been cutting costs to focus on its core tax preparation business, especially drilling down to the digital tax prep business.</p><p>Even satellite radio operator Sirius/XM radio can't resist returning some cash to shareholders this season. It announced a one-time dividend of a nickel per share and a $2 billion stock buyback plan. Sirius shares are consistently among the most actively traded issues on the NASDAQ. Volume was very heavy as you'd expect today. The stock didn't move a whole lot though, up just $0.02. But there was a bigger stock move in Liberty Media Capital. Why Liberty Media? Well, it's the biggest shareholder of Sirius/XM stock. It stands to get $160 million thanks to the special dividend.</p><p>Online social gaming company Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has struggled to repeat the success of its Farmville game. It's going after a gaming license now in Nevada. Don't look it on the strip though. It wants customers to use real money, bet real money on Internet poker. Shares rallying 7.1 percent, volume doubled. Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has lost more than 70 percent of its value since becoming a publicly traded company.</p><p>All of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were higher with the emerging markets fund up the most, up 0.8 of a percent. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: And also with some market news, one of the hedge funds embroiled in the FBI's crackdown on insider trading is closing its doors. Diamondback Capital Management is shutting down and that's after clients pulled more than half a billion dollars from the fund. Federal agents raided the Connecticut firm two years ago as part of a nation-wide sweep that resulted in the arrest of one of the firm's former portfolio managers on insider trading charges. Since then, Diamondback's assets have dwindled to just over $1.5 billion, down from $5 billion.</p><p>GHARIB: Our viewers have been waiting and he's finally here. Paul Kangas, NBR co-founding anchor. Welcome home, it's so nice to have you back here.</p><p>PAUL KANGAS, NBR CO-FOUNDING ANCHOR: Well, it is like home and it's great to hear that I'm still welcome.</p><p>GHARIB: Actually, speaking of welcome. We got -- Tom and I got so many viewer questions for you and comments saying that they want to hear from the Walter Cronkite of financial news. A little bit of your wisdom in these confusing time, right, Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: Absolutely there is so much going on in the market and you've seen so much market cycles. We got a lot to talk about, but what we have got to ask ,what do you make of the stock market today?</p><p>KANGAS: It's sort of a stop and go affair. We get good news one day, better building permits and building news and on that front. And inflation is down a little bit. And then the next day it's all countered by new uprisings in Egypt and one thing or another. So the market tries to step higher and is countered by bad news. So stop and go all the way.</p><p>HUDSON: We got a great question from Eric P. Edson. You saw the Dow Industrials move from 1,000 to over 10,000 in your career. He asks, will the Dow Jones see 8,000 or 18,000 first?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, there's not that much volatility but it could see both in the same year. But I intend, I'm actually a little on the bullish bias because corporations continue to make money and the American people are basically optimistic. And a lot of stocks are under priced, particularly blue chips even though the Dow Industrial Average has more than doubled since 2009. But there's a reason for that and that's good earnings and that's good dividends.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, there's a lot of questions about if that is going to continue. And one of our viewers has a question for you about the fiscal cliff. You know all about the back and forth and the drama about the fiscal cliff and Delores Kile wants your thoughts on where do you stand on this whole fiscal cliff? How can it play out?</p><p>KANGAS: Congress better get off its duff and do something. And I think that finally the pressure is going to be enough (ph). But they always do it right to the last, you know, minute. But I think it's got to happen or they're going to be ousted from their hallowed political seats.</p><p>HUDSON: You could argue in the three years you've been away from the NBR anchor desk Congress hasn't done a whole heck of a lot to address the fiscal situation.</p><p>KANGAS: No it's just ridiculous. I mean these are our elected representatives and they have got to pay a little more attention to those that got them in the office. And they're arguing amongst themselves without much care about the people they represent.</p><p>HUDSON: A lot of those folks are retirees, we do have a question about retirement from Anita asking what is the investing or financial planning lesson Paul uses most during retirement?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, the number one is hope I can live my life to the last and still have enough capital to keep me going. And a lot of investors are running up against the same thing. They're running out of capital because yields are so low in the bond market; money markets are yielding practically nothing. So they have to chip into their base capital and that's hurtful. So what I am doing is looking for blue chip stocks with decent dividends.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot of people are wondering that in this climate, what do you think is going to be the new investment opportunity available to all of us in 2013? That's a question from Fay.</p><p>KANGAS: New investment opportunity.</p><p>GHARIB: What is your prediction?</p><p>KANGAS: They'll come up with something new just like ETF exchange- traded funds were relatively new a few years ago and now have gained such popularity it is almost, it's staggering how much money has gone into ETFs.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned how volatility could have the Dow see 8,000 and 18,000, maybe in the same year. Frank sent us a tweet on Twitter asking individual investors are afraid of the markets. What needs to be done to gain their confidence?</p><p>KANGAS: Less regulation. I think that investors are afraid that they make an investment and something comes along, the rules change from what got them into the investment in the first place. Well you can't change, you know, canoes in the middle of a stream.</p><p>GHARIB: On this whole subject of investor confidence, we do have a question from Billy who says what's the greatest changes that you've seen in the market today? You've had some perspective three years being away from it on a day-to-day basis. What do you see as the biggest change?</p><p>KANGAS: Well, Billy, I'll tell you that the computer is a wonderful thing, but it's not the greatest thing for investing. And for investors who don't have a high speed capability and have large box of stock at their arm's length. I think that that is -- it's taken away the idea that long- term, long-term investing is a good thing. I think that's one of the changes that I don't like. Too much computer meddling.</p><p>HUDSON: Well, Paul, as much as the markets have changed, you haven't. It's great to see and hear from you again. Susie, we have to say good night but I think it's only proper to ask Paul.</p><p>KANGAS: I'm Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Fresh data show that as the recession deepens, Americans are  buying only what`s needed and stashing the rest of their cash. Coming up, a  look at what could ignite new spending. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Macy`s joins the  parade of layoffs as the latest major company to cut jobs. As the nation`s  employment picture darkens, we begin a month-long focus on jobs. Tonight,  our interview with employment expert John Challenger. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  KANGAS: Fixing the economy will come down to fixing the housing mess.  That`s the word from Republicans as the Senate debates the president`s  massive stimulus spending plan. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  PRATT: Then, we continue to \"Get Your Finances Ready for Retirement\"  with a look at long-term care. With Americans living a lot longer, it could  be key to your retirement plans. </p><p>  KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas. </p><p>  PRATT: And I`m Suzanne Pratt. Susie Gharib is on assignment. This is  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February 2. </p><p>  Good evening, everyone. Concerned consumers are cutting back on  consumption in a big way. Personal spending fell by 1 percent in December,  the sixth straight monthly decline. Worries about jobs as well as tightened  credit conditions were key reasons people kept their wallets shut. As Erika  Miller reports, with consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of  economic activity, experts worry this trend could prolong the recession. </p><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For many  Americans, the shopping spree is over. Outside Macy`s Herald Square today,  we found many shoppers buying only necessities. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m shopping for the essential items, clothes for  work and stuff like that. So it`s not like anything I don`t need. It`s  things that I need. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At work, we`re all frightened, a little bit. We`re  all more or less scared that at some point we will get laid off, maybe. But  until then, there`s really nothing you can do. </p><p>  MILLER: But there is some good news. Less spending is helping boost  the national savings rate. The average American household saved about $0.03  of every dollar in December, compared to next to nothing at the start of  last year. Still, economists see these trends as a challenge to overcoming  recession, because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of  economic growth. Economist Cary Leahey says the key to reviving consumer  spending is stabilizing the labor market. </p><p>  CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS:   The most important  single determinant of consumer spending is how people feel about the labor  market, whether or not they have a job, are they worried about their job or  they know someone well enough that they know what their job prospects are. </p><p>  MILLER: He and others expect President Obama`s economic stimulus plan  and efforts to support banks will help eventually. Economist Bob Brusca  thinks the government should also encourage banks to lower lending  standards. That way, more Americans could take advantage of record low  interest rates to borrow and refinance. </p><p>  ROBERT BRUSCA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FACT &amp; OPINION ECONOMICS:  It`s about  banks. It`s about getting banks that have taken Federal money to loosen up  and use it for the purpose of digging the economy out of a ditch, instead  of trying to win some banking balance sheet beauty contest. </p><p>  MILLER: Some economists believe the pullback in consumer spending will  last longer than the economic downturn. They say people are changing their  shopping habits and the changes could stick. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT, New York.    </p><p>  PRATT: We`re starting off the new month with new layoffs. Macy`s  announced today it`s cutting 7,000 employees or about 4 percent of the  workforce. The layoffs will be in stores, offices and other locations.  Since January, U.S. companies have slashed nearly 200,000 jobs. With so  many people worried about becoming unemployed, tonight we kick off a month- long series \"Reviving the Economy: Jobs.\"  Each week night, we`ll tackle an  employment-related topic, everything from coping with losing your job to  what sectors are hiring. Tonight, John Challenger joins me to talk more  about the nation`s employment picture. He is CEO of the outplacement firm,  Challenger, Gray and Christmas. John, welcome back to NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT.</p><p>       JOHN CHALLENGER, CEO, CHALLENGER, GRAY &amp; CHRISTMAS:  Nice to be here,  Suzanne.  </p><p>  PRATT:  The economy lost about 2.5 million jobs last year so we`re not  off to a good start this year. Lots of companies as you just heard with  Macy`s have already announced big layoffs. What is your outlook for 2009? </p><p>  CHALLENGER:  Well, certainly in the near term over this first quarter,  maybe second quarter, we`re going to continue to see these job losses, more  than likely, maybe not at the pace we have seen in the last three months  which has just been devastating. But I am more confident as we go into the  summer months we`ll start to see some improvement. </p><p>  PRATT:  So Friday we get the employment report, the monthly employment  report. There is a lot of fear in the market about that report. We see the  unemployment rate is already up to 7.2 percent. What is your expectation  for that report on Friday?  Is it going to be really dismal? </p><p>  CHALLENGER:  Seems highly likely it is going to take another big jump  as it has for the last two months. November and December almost half point  jumps a month. And this January we see just a steady run of layoffs, not  just from the companies that have -- the types of companies that have lead  the way in this recession like banks and housing companies and automotive  companies, but now we are seeing layoffs come from really almost every  corner of the economy, heavy equipment companies, retailers like in today`s  Macy`s, pharmaceutical companies, telecom companies. And that has been  what`s so difficult about this, been what has been so difficult about this  January. </p><p>  PRATT:  A lot of people may not realize it, but employment is a  lagging indicator. And in previous recessions, it takes a long time for the  employment picture to pick up even though the recession may end, it could  be many months before we start to see a lot of new jobs added to the  economy. What do you think is going to be the likely scenario this time? Do  you think there`s going to be a very big lag in terms of when the  employment`s ultimately going to pick up in a strong way? </p><p>  CHALLENGER:  Well, after this last recession in 2001 after the dotcom  and technology collapse, it did take 18 months after the economy started to  improve from a GDP standpoint for jobs to start getting created. It didn`t  mean unemployment kept going up, that at least too much. But it did stay  flat for quite a while. It seems likely coming out of this period we will  see a similar period of jobless recovery because business owners are just  going to be super cautious after this devastating recession we`ve been in  about hiring too many people. So it is likely we`ll continue to see people  going to back to work in part-time jobs and using those as auditions for  full-time jobs and then companies being very selective in their hiring. </p><p>  PRATT:  What about the stimulus package? How hopeful are you that in  its current form it is going to do a lot to create jobs? </p><p>  CHALLENGER:  Well, it`s being revised right now so we don`t know what  it is going to end up as. But certainly fiscal stimulus job creation by  putting people back to work on projects, buildings, roads, ports as well as  building schools and hospitals, say information systems, I`m positive about  the fact that that is going to create jobs. We don`t want to see pork  barrel. I think you want to get money in terms of tax cuts back into people  who are going to spend that money. That means middle class and people, you  know, who have had a hard time holding on to their jobs at the low wage  level. That`s I think the key to making this recovery. </p><p>  PRATT:  One last question. We don`t have a lot of time left. But what  is your best advice to those who may have recently lost their job? </p><p>  CHALLENGER:  Well, you`ve got to get back to work, so don`t be too  picky about what you find. Better to take the job now, might even be a  part-time job. Get some money coming in. Show them what you can do. Keep  looking if you need to do that. In fact, you might put together several  jobs, even extra ones right now.  If you are in work, hold on to that job  tight. Show them you know, the work you can do, the quality what it is, the  long hours you work. And prove that you just need to be there. </p><p>  PRATT:  Some very good advice, thank you for joining me this evening. </p><p>  CHALLENGER:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>  PRATT: Our guest: John Challenger of Challenger, Gray and Christmas. </p><p>  KANGAS: Tomorrow as we continue \"Reviving the Economy: Jobs,\" the best  advice for all employees may be to adopt the boy scout motto: be prepared. </p><p>       Investors greeted Wall Street with an opening sell off on that drop  in consumer spending. The Dow tumbled about 100 points at the opening while  the NASDAQ fell 10 points. Then strength in big tech stocks like Microsoft  and Apple helped the Dow trim its loss to just 15 points at 1:00 p.m. with  the NASDAQ actually up 18 points. The afternoon brought more selling on the  Dow, down 125 points at one stage, but that tech strength helped the blue  chips recover part of their losses, so the Dow Industrial Average ended  down 64.03 at 7936.83.  The tech-laden NASDAQ was up 18.01 at 1494.43,  while the Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 lost .44, ending at 825.44.  Over in the  bond market, the 10-year note climbed 1 4/32 to 108 24/32, putting the  yield at 2.72 percent.</p><p>  PRATT: The Senate opened debate today on an economic stimulus package  that is getting closer to the $1 trillion mark. President Obama met with  lawmakers today to try to keep the massive effort on track. But as Darren  Gersh reports, there`s a growing debate about changing the bill to make it  more effective. </p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The president is  optimistic a stimulus bill could be on his desk in a matter of weeks. </p><p>   BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   What we can`t do is  let very modest differences get in the way of the overall package moving  forward swiftly. </p><p>  GERSH: But it really depends on your definition of modest. As the  debate started in the Senate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell was pushing  for a greater focus on tax cuts over spending and he also offered a new  suggestion. </p><p>  SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, MINORITY LEADER:  We believe, Republicans, that  a stimulus bill must fix the main problem first and that`s housing. That`s  how all of this began. We think you ought to go right at housing first. </p><p>  GERSH: The Republican plan calls for government financing to bring  home mortgage rates down to 4 percent. The authors of the plan figure 40  million homeowners would qualify, saving each an average of $424 a month.  Republicans believe taxpayers might come out ahead on the deal, since the  government can now borrow at 2.5 percent. But independent estimates say it  could cost the government $20 billion a year or more. Barney Frank, the  chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, gave the idea a cool  reception. </p><p>   REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE:  An  absolute subsidy for every borrower in America regardless of income, I  think is a very expensive program. </p><p>  GERSH: There is a very good reason the stimulus is attracting so many  proposals both extremely large and small. As budget hawk Maya Macguineas  points out, this may be many a lobbyist`s last hope. </p><p>   MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL  BUDGET:  There are not going to be that many vehicles which will actually  bring taxes down or spending up, because we`re just going to have run out  of fiscal space to pay for all of these things. So everybody and their  lobbyist is fighting to get their favorite items on to the stimulus train  before it leaves because who knows when the next chance will be. </p><p>  GERSH: It is widely expected the stimulus plan will top $900 billion  as it moves through the Senate. Likely additions include a patch for the  alternative minimum tax and a doubling of the home buyer tax credit to  $15,000. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. </p><p>  KANGAS: Now, let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.    </p><p>  Most active big board issue on 51.4 million shares, Bank of America  (BAC) losing $0.58. That stock is now down 85 percent on the last 12  months. The \"New York Post\" today reported some angry shareholders are  anxious to oust CEO Kenneth Lewis.</p><p>       Citigroup (C) in there with a $0.10 gain.</p><p>       Then General Electric (GE), $0.51 loss.</p><p>  Pfizer (PFE) gained $0.31.</p><p>       While Wells Fargo (WFC) was up $0.33.</p><p>  JPMorgan Chase (JPM) down $0.31, narrow movement here.</p><p>  ExxonMobil (XOM) up $0.21.</p><p>Dow Chemical (DOW) $0.54 drop.</p><p>  And Qwest Communications (Q) an $0.08 gain.</p><p>  Macy*s (M) down $0.36.

Americans are living longer. But the older you  get, the more likely it is that you won`t be able to live independently.  That`s why long-term care is something everyone should consider in their  retirement planning. So tonight, as we continue our series \"Get Your  Finances Ready for Retirement,\" Joe Collum looks at the many forms of long- term care. </p><p>  JOE COLLUM, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  At age 88, Leo  Gerber is still the life of the party and although he suffers from  emphysema and cardiac problems, he says life has never been better for him  and his wife Nettie. </p><p>   LEO GERBER/RETIREE:  You can`t live here unless you`re happy. If you  want to live a happy life, this is the place. </p><p>  COLLUM: This place is the Court at Palm Aire in Pompano, Florida, a  long-term care facility.  Although many associate long-term care only with  nursing homes, it can also include being cared for at home by a health aide  or a relative; an adult day-care program; or living in an alternate  setting, like an assisted-living facility. Seniors reach the point of  needing long-term care at different times, says Pernille Ostberg, president  and CEO of Matrix Home Care. </p><p>   PERNILLE OSTBERG, PRES. &amp; CEO OF MATRIX HOME CARE:  Typically it`s the  70s, 80s, when one isn`t as capable of taking care of everything in their  home as they used to be, cutting the lawn, cleaning the pool, all the  grocery shopping, all the maintenance, all these things to think about. </p><p>  COLLUM: Long-term care can be an expensive proposition and many people  think that when the times comes, it will be paid for by Medicare. But if  you are one of those people, think again. </p><p>   KATHRYN VOTAVA, PRES. &amp; FOUNDER, GOODCARE.COM:  Medicare generally  does not cover nursing home costs with the exception being a rehabilitation  stay. So sometimes people get a little confused and say, well, my  grandmother went into a nursing home and Medicare covered it. Well that was  short-term for a month or two after she broke her hip. But for long-term  chronic care in a nursing home, you`re absolutely right, Medicare does not  cover that. </p><p>  COLLUM: Medicare also does not cover many other long-term care costs,  which can be daunting. The average price to have a home health aide come to  your home is about $19 per hour. Assisted living and nursing home care are  far more expensive, says Emily Brandon of \"U.S. News &amp; World Report.\" </p><p>   EMILY BRANDON, BUSINESS REPORTER, U.S. NEWS &amp; WORLD REPORT:  A private  room in a nursing home is likely to cost about $76,000 a year. That`s the  national average. It varies from state to state, but that`s about $209 a  day for a nursing home. </p><p>  COLLUM:  Finding a good long-term care facility on short notice may  not be easy. For that reason, many people who expect to need long-term care  at some point choose to live in a continuing care community which  guarantees them care at various levels, sometimes at no extra cost. Alan  and Joy Turner went that route by moving into an apartment at one such  community, La Posada, in Palm Beach Gardens. To get in, they paid a lump  sum of $500,000, 90 percent of which will eventually be returned to their  estate. They also pay a monthly charge of $4,700 for their apartment, meals  and a variety of programs. Because Alan has Parkinson`s disease, Joy Turner  says it`s worth the price. </p><p>   JOY TURNER/RETIREE:  If, for instance, my husband were to have to go  to assisted living, I could still keep my apartment and it wouldn`t be any  more. </p><p>  COLLUM: The Turners and the Gerbers were able to cover their costs by  selling their previous homes. But if a home sale does not generate enough  cash, long-term care expenses can quickly deplete a person`s retirement  savings. Having long-term care insurance is one way to avoid that, but it`s  not cheap. And in our next segment, we`ll see what you need to consider  before buying a policy. Joe Collum, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Palm Beach  Gardens, Florida. </p><p>  KANGAS: Tomorrow, \"Of Mutual Interest\" guests Jim Lowell and Dan  Wiener tell us how Vanguard and Fidelity are faring during the recession. </p><p>  PRATT: Steelcase, the world`s largest office furniture maker, today  announced broad cost-cutting measures. They include reducing salaried  workers` pay by 5 percent. Top managers are also taking a pay cut. The  salaries of the firms` CEO and CFO will be slashed by 12 percent and 10  percent respectively. Steelcase is also implementing previously announced  layoffs of 300 hourly workers. </p><p>  KANGAS: General Motors and Chrysler are offering a new round of  buyouts and retirement incentives for hourly workers. GM will not comment,  but officials with the United Auto workers say that the plan includes  worker buyouts. Chrysler is offering $50,000 in cash and a $25,000 new car  voucher. Both auto makers must submit viability plans to the government by  February 17th as part of their bailout funding. </p><p>  PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. January auto sales  are released and we`ll see quarterly results from Dow Chemical, Marathon  Oil, Merck, UPS and Walt Disney. </p><p>       As we continue our month-long focus on employment, tonight`s  commentator says creating more jobs and fixing the financial system aren`t  separate goals. Here`s Alice Rivlin, senior fellow at Brookings and former  vice chair of the Federal Reserve. </p><p>  ALICE RIVLIN, SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS:  It is not fair that millions  of wage earners are losing their jobs and homes because overpaid financial  hotshots made stupid mistakes. This crisis was caused by financial  innovation gone wild, excessive greed and inadequate regulation. So why not  let the high-flyers slide into oblivion, while the government concentrates  on putting people back to work and saving their homes? </p><p>        Unfortunately, it isn`t that simple. The economy can`t function  without healthy banks and financial markets. When businesses and  individuals can`t get credit, jobs disappear really fast. That is happening  as we speak. The huge injection of government capital into the banks kept  the system from imploding and eased credit a little, but we still need to  remove toxic assets and restore bank viability, so that credit can flow  normally. </p><p>        More help for the banks doesn`t sound like a job creation program,  but unless it succeeds, no economic stimulus will turn the downward spiral  around. The financial hot shots should forget the perks and bonuses and  work hard to use the taxpayers` money to fuel the economic engine. After  that, we need their clever minds to help figure out how to make the  capitalist system less to prone to excesses followed by collapses that  destroy the livelihoods of average workers. I`m Alice Rivlin. </p><p>  KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision for Wall  Street. The Dow dropped 64 points while the NASDAQ Composite gained 18  points.

Fresh data show that as the recession deepens, Americans are buying only what`s needed and stashing the rest of their cash. Coming up, a look at what could ignite new spending.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Macy`s joins the parade of layoffs as the latest major company to cut jobs. As the nation`s employment picture darkens, we begin a month-long focus on jobs. Tonight, our interview with employment expert John Challenger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KANGAS: Fixing the economy will come down to fixing the housing mess. That`s the word from Republicans as the Senate debates the president`s massive stimulus spending plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PRATT: Then, we continue to \"Get Your Finances Ready for Retirement\" with a look at long-term care. With Americans living a lot longer, it could be key to your retirement plans.</p><p>KANGAS: I`m Paul Kangas.</p><p>PRATT: And I`m Suzanne Pratt. Susie Gharib is on assignment. This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February 2.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. Concerned consumers are cutting back on consumption in a big way. Personal spending fell by 1 percent in December, the sixth straight monthly decline. Worries about jobs as well as tightened credit conditions were key reasons people kept their wallets shut. As Erika Miller reports, with consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of economic activity, experts worry this trend could prolong the recession.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For many Americans, the shopping spree is over. Outside Macy`s Herald Square today, we found many shoppers buying only necessities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m shopping for the essential items, clothes for work and stuff like that. So it`s not like anything I don`t need. It`s things that I need.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At work, we`re all frightened, a little bit. We`re all more or less scared that at some point we will get laid off, maybe. But until then, there`s really nothing you can do.</p><p>MILLER: But there is some good news. Less spending is helping boost the national savings rate. The average American household saved about $0.03 of every dollar in December, compared to next to nothing at the start of last year. Still, economists see these trends as a challenge to overcoming recession, because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic growth. Economist Cary Leahey says the key to reviving consumer spending is stabilizing the labor market.</p><p>CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS: The most important single determinant of consumer spending is how people feel about the labor market, whether or not they have a job, are they worried about their job or they know someone well enough that they know what their job prospects are.</p><p>MILLER: He and others expect President Obama`s economic stimulus plan and efforts to support banks will help eventually. Economist Bob Brusca thinks the government should also encourage banks to lower lending standards. That way, more Americans could take advantage of record low interest rates to borrow and refinance.</p><p>ROBERT BRUSCA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FACT &amp; OPINION ECONOMICS: It`s about banks. It`s about getting banks that have taken Federal money to loosen up and use it for the purpose of digging the economy out of a ditch, instead of trying to win some banking balance sheet beauty contest.</p><p>MILLER: Some economists believe the pullback in consumer spending will last longer than the economic downturn. They say people are changing their shopping habits and the changes could stick. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>PRATT: We`re starting off the new month with new layoffs. Macy`s announced today it`s cutting 7,000 employees or about 4 percent of the workforce. The layoffs will be in stores, offices and other locations. Since January, U.S. companies have slashed nearly 200,000 jobs. With so many people worried about becoming unemployed, tonight we kick off a month- long series \"Reviving the Economy: Jobs.\" Each week night, we`ll tackle an employment-related topic, everything from coping with losing your job to what sectors are hiring. Tonight, John Challenger joins me to talk more about the nation`s employment picture. He is CEO of the outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray and Christmas. John, welcome back to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>JOHN CHALLENGER, CEO, CHALLENGER, GRAY &amp; CHRISTMAS: Nice to be here, Suzanne.</p><p>PRATT: The economy lost about 2.5 million jobs last year so we`re not off to a good start this year. Lots of companies as you just heard with Macy`s have already announced big layoffs. What is your outlook for 2009?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, certainly in the near term over this first quarter, maybe second quarter, we`re going to continue to see these job losses, more than likely, maybe not at the pace we have seen in the last three months which has just been devastating. But I am more confident as we go into the summer months we`ll start to see some improvement.</p><p>PRATT: So Friday we get the employment report, the monthly employment report. There is a lot of fear in the market about that report. We see the unemployment rate is already up to 7.2 percent. What is your expectation for that report on Friday? Is it going to be really dismal?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Seems highly likely it is going to take another big jump as it has for the last two months. November and December almost half point jumps a month. And this January we see just a steady run of layoffs, not just from the companies that have -- the types of companies that have lead the way in this recession like banks and housing companies and automotive companies, but now we are seeing layoffs come from really almost every corner of the economy, heavy equipment companies, retailers like in today`s Macy`s, pharmaceutical companies, telecom companies. And that has been what`s so difficult about this, been what has been so difficult about this January.</p><p>PRATT: A lot of people may not realize it, but employment is a lagging indicator. And in previous recessions, it takes a long time for the employment picture to pick up even though the recession may end, it could be many months before we start to see a lot of new jobs added to the economy. What do you think is going to be the likely scenario this time? Do you think there`s going to be a very big lag in terms of when the employment`s ultimately going to pick up in a strong way?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, after this last recession in 2001 after the dotcom and technology collapse, it did take 18 months after the economy started to improve from a GDP standpoint for jobs to start getting created. It didn`t mean unemployment kept going up, that at least too much. But it did stay flat for quite a while. It seems likely coming out of this period we will see a similar period of jobless recovery because business owners are just going to be super cautious after this devastating recession we`ve been in about hiring too many people. So it is likely we`ll continue to see people going to back to work in part-time jobs and using those as auditions for full-time jobs and then companies being very selective in their hiring.</p><p>PRATT: What about the stimulus package? How hopeful are you that in its current form it is going to do a lot to create jobs?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, it`s being revised right now so we don`t know what it is going to end up as. But certainly fiscal stimulus job creation by putting people back to work on projects, buildings, roads, ports as well as building schools and hospitals, say information systems, I`m positive about the fact that that is going to create jobs. We don`t want to see pork barrel. I think you want to get money in terms of tax cuts back into people who are going to spend that money. That means middle class and people, you know, who have had a hard time holding on to their jobs at the low wage level. That`s I think the key to making this recovery.</p><p>PRATT: One last question. We don`t have a lot of time left. But what is your best advice to those who may have recently lost their job?</p><p>CHALLENGER: Well, you`ve got to get back to work, so don`t be too picky about what you find. Better to take the job now, might even be a part-time job. Get some money coming in. Show them what you can do. Keep looking if you need to do that. In fact, you might put together several jobs, even extra ones right now. If you are in work, hold on to that job tight. Show them you know, the work you can do, the quality what it is, the long hours you work. And prove that you just need to be there.</p><p>PRATT: Some very good advice, thank you for joining me this evening.</p><p>CHALLENGER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>PRATT: Our guest: John Challenger of Challenger, Gray and Christmas.</p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow as we continue \"Reviving the Economy: Jobs,\" the best advice for all employees may be to adopt the boy scout motto: be prepared.</p><p>Investors greeted Wall Street with an opening sell off on that drop in consumer spending. The Dow tumbled about 100 points at the opening while the NASDAQ fell 10 points. Then strength in big tech stocks like Microsoft and Apple helped the Dow trim its loss to just 15 points at 1:00 p.m. with the NASDAQ actually up 18 points. The afternoon brought more selling on the Dow, down 125 points at one stage, but that tech strength helped the blue chips recover part of their losses, so the Dow Industrial Average ended down 64.03 at 7936.83. The tech-laden NASDAQ was up 18.01 at 1494.43, while the Standard &amp; Poor`s 500 lost .44, ending at 825.44. Over in the bond market, the 10-year note climbed 1 4/32 to 108 24/32, putting the yield at 2.72 percent.</p><p>PRATT: The Senate opened debate today on an economic stimulus package that is getting closer to the $1 trillion mark. President Obama met with lawmakers today to try to keep the massive effort on track. But as Darren Gersh reports, there`s a growing debate about changing the bill to make it more effective.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The president is optimistic a stimulus bill could be on his desk in a matter of weeks.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What we can`t do is let very modest differences get in the way of the overall package moving forward swiftly.</p><p>GERSH: But it really depends on your definition of modest. As the debate started in the Senate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell was pushing for a greater focus on tax cuts over spending and he also offered a new suggestion.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, MINORITY LEADER: We believe, Republicans, that a stimulus bill must fix the main problem first and that`s housing. That`s how all of this began. We think you ought to go right at housing first.</p><p>GERSH: The Republican plan calls for government financing to bring home mortgage rates down to 4 percent. The authors of the plan figure 40 million homeowners would qualify, saving each an average of $424 a month. Republicans believe taxpayers might come out ahead on the deal, since the government can now borrow at 2.5 percent. But independent estimates say it could cost the government $20 billion a year or more. Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, gave the idea a cool reception.</p><p>REP. BARNEY FRANK, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: An absolute subsidy for every borrower in America regardless of income, I think is a very expensive program.</p><p>GERSH: There is a very good reason the stimulus is attracting so many proposals both extremely large and small. As budget hawk Maya Macguineas points out, this may be many a lobbyist`s last hope.</p><p>MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET: There are not going to be that many vehicles which will actually bring taxes down or spending up, because we`re just going to have run out of fiscal space to pay for all of these things. So everybody and their lobbyist is fighting to get their favorite items on to the stimulus train before it leaves because who knows when the next chance will be.</p><p>GERSH: It is widely expected the stimulus plan will top $900 billion as it moves through the Senate. Likely additions include a patch for the alternative minimum tax and a doubling of the home buyer tax credit to $15,000. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>KANGAS: Now, let`s take a look at some stocks in the news tonight.</p><p>Most active big board issue on 51.4 million shares, Bank of America (BAC) losing $0.58. That stock is now down 85 percent on the last 12 months. The \"New York Post\" today reported some angry shareholders are anxious to oust CEO Kenneth Lewis.</p><p>Citigroup (C) in there with a $0.10 gain.</p><p>Then General Electric (GE), $0.51 loss.</p><p>Pfizer (PFE) gained $0.31.</p><p>While Wells Fargo (WFC) was up $0.33.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase (JPM) down $0.31, narrow movement here.</p><p>ExxonMobil (XOM) up $0.21.</p><p>Dow Chemical (DOW) $0.54 drop.</p><p>And Qwest Communications (Q) an $0.08 gain.</p><p>Macy*s (M) down $0.36. The low today was $7.50. As you heard, it`s cutting 7000 jobs. It also says fiscal 2010 same store sales will be 7, let`s make it 6 to 8 percent lower than this year and the company sees earnings of $0.40 to $0.55. The Street estimate was up there at $0.79 and it is indeed cutting its quarterly dividend from $0.13 down to only a nickel a share.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) down $1.45.

Goldman Sachs downgraded it from \"neutral\" to \"sell.\" Last Thursday the company reported sharply lower fourth quarter earnings of $0.21, down from the previous year`s $0.69.</p><p>Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG), there`s a good gain, up $1.96. This week`s \"Barron`s\" financial magazine has a positive article saying this stock is a compelling buy and should do particularly well as bonds begin to recover.</p><p>Humana (HUM) up $2.20. Fourth quarter earnings, $1.07, a penny more than the Street expected. The company sees 2009 earnings as high as $6.10 a share. Street estimate down there at $5.91.</p><p>Mattel (MAT) down $2.29. Fourth quarter earnings came in at $0.49. That`s way down from $0.89 a year ago. The Street estimate was up there at $0.71.

Americans are living longer. But the older you get, the more likely it is that you won`t be able to live independently. That`s why long-term care is something everyone should consider in their retirement planning. So tonight, as we continue our series \"Get Your Finances Ready for Retirement,\" Joe Collum looks at the many forms of long- term care.</p><p>JOE COLLUM, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: At age 88, Leo Gerber is still the life of the party and although he suffers from emphysema and cardiac problems, he says life has never been better for him and his wife Nettie.</p><p>LEO GERBER/RETIREE: You can`t live here unless you`re happy. If you want to live a happy life, this is the place.</p><p>COLLUM: This place is the Court at Palm Aire in Pompano, Florida, a long-term care facility. Although many associate long-term care only with nursing homes, it can also include being cared for at home by a health aide or a relative; an adult day-care program; or living in an alternate setting, like an assisted-living facility. Seniors reach the point of needing long-term care at different times, says Pernille Ostberg, president and CEO of Matrix Home Care.</p><p>PERNILLE OSTBERG, PRES. &amp; CEO OF MATRIX HOME CARE: Typically it`s the 70s, 80s, when one isn`t as capable of taking care of everything in their home as they used to be, cutting the lawn, cleaning the pool, all the grocery shopping, all the maintenance, all these things to think about.</p><p>COLLUM: Long-term care can be an expensive proposition and many people think that when the times comes, it will be paid for by Medicare. But if you are one of those people, think again.</p><p>KATHRYN VOTAVA, PRES. &amp; FOUNDER, GOODCARE.COM: Medicare generally does not cover nursing home costs with the exception being a rehabilitation stay. So sometimes people get a little confused and say, well, my grandmother went into a nursing home and Medicare covered it. Well that was short-term for a month or two after she broke her hip. But for long-term chronic care in a nursing home, you`re absolutely right, Medicare does not cover that.</p><p>COLLUM: Medicare also does not cover many other long-term care costs, which can be daunting. The average price to have a home health aide come to your home is about $19 per hour. Assisted living and nursing home care are far more expensive, says Emily Brandon of \"U.S. News &amp; World Report.\"</p><p>EMILY BRANDON, BUSINESS REPORTER, U.S. NEWS &amp; WORLD REPORT: A private room in a nursing home is likely to cost about $76,000 a year. That`s the national average. It varies from state to state, but that`s about $209 a day for a nursing home.</p><p>COLLUM: Finding a good long-term care facility on short notice may not be easy. For that reason, many people who expect to need long-term care at some point choose to live in a continuing care community which guarantees them care at various levels, sometimes at no extra cost. Alan and Joy Turner went that route by moving into an apartment at one such community, La Posada, in Palm Beach Gardens. To get in, they paid a lump sum of $500,000, 90 percent of which will eventually be returned to their estate. They also pay a monthly charge of $4,700 for their apartment, meals and a variety of programs. Because Alan has Parkinson`s disease, Joy Turner says it`s worth the price.</p><p>JOY TURNER/RETIREE: If, for instance, my husband were to have to go to assisted living, I could still keep my apartment and it wouldn`t be any more.</p><p>COLLUM: The Turners and the Gerbers were able to cover their costs by selling their previous homes. But if a home sale does not generate enough cash, long-term care expenses can quickly deplete a person`s retirement savings. Having long-term care insurance is one way to avoid that, but it`s not cheap. And in our next segment, we`ll see what you need to consider before buying a policy. Joe Collum, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.</p><p>KANGAS: Tomorrow, \"Of Mutual Interest\" guests Jim Lowell and Dan Wiener tell us how Vanguard and Fidelity are faring during the recession.</p><p>PRATT: Steelcase, the world`s largest office furniture maker, today announced broad cost-cutting measures. They include reducing salaried workers` pay by 5 percent. Top managers are also taking a pay cut. The salaries of the firms` CEO and CFO will be slashed by 12 percent and 10 percent respectively. Steelcase is also implementing previously announced layoffs of 300 hourly workers.</p><p>KANGAS: General Motors and Chrysler are offering a new round of buyouts and retirement incentives for hourly workers. GM will not comment, but officials with the United Auto workers say that the plan includes worker buyouts. Chrysler is offering $50,000 in cash and a $25,000 new car voucher. Both auto makers must submit viability plans to the government by February 17th as part of their bailout funding.</p><p>PRATT: Here`s a look at what`s happening tomorrow. January auto sales are released and we`ll see quarterly results from Dow Chemical, Marathon Oil, Merck, UPS and Walt Disney.</p><p>As we continue our month-long focus on employment, tonight`s commentator says creating more jobs and fixing the financial system aren`t separate goals. Here`s Alice Rivlin, senior fellow at Brookings and former vice chair of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>ALICE RIVLIN, SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS: It is not fair that millions of wage earners are losing their jobs and homes because overpaid financial hotshots made stupid mistakes. This crisis was caused by financial innovation gone wild, excessive greed and inadequate regulation. So why not let the high-flyers slide into oblivion, while the government concentrates on putting people back to work and saving their homes?</p><p>Unfortunately, it isn`t that simple. The economy can`t function without healthy banks and financial markets. When businesses and individuals can`t get credit, jobs disappear really fast. That is happening as we speak. The huge injection of government capital into the banks kept the system from imploding and eased credit a little, but we still need to remove toxic assets and restore bank viability, so that credit can flow normally.</p><p>More help for the banks doesn`t sound like a job creation program, but unless it succeeds, no economic stimulus will turn the downward spiral around. The financial hot shots should forget the perks and bonuses and work hard to use the taxpayers` money to fuel the economic engine. After that, we need their clever minds to help figure out how to make the capitalist system less to prone to excesses followed by collapses that destroy the livelihoods of average workers. I`m Alice Rivlin.</p><p>KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a split decision for Wall Street. The Dow dropped 64 points while the NASDAQ Composite gained 18 points.

We saw ups  and big slides down.  But now that the nerve-wracking week is over, what  happens next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Sentenced reduced.   He was the man at the center of one of the most notorious financial  scandals in U.S. history.  And today, the former CEO of Enron was told  he'll get out of jail early. </p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Age of insourcing.  After years of seeing jobs go overseas,  companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are reversing  the trend and keeping some jobs right here in the U.S.</p><p/><p>       All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June  21st </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p/><p>       Sue Herera joins me tonight.  Susie Gharib has the evening off. </p><p/><p>       Well, you couldn't really call it a come back day, not after  Thursday's 350-point Dow infarction.  But the patient was stabilized,  despite some wild swings on the so-called quadruple winching day when  certain options and future contracts expire. </p><p/><p>       On heavy volume, the Dow rocked and rolled and finished 41 points  higher at 14,799.  The NASDAQ was dragged lower, especially by Oracle  (NASDAQ:ORCL), which fell 9 percent on an earnings miss last quarter  reported yesterday.  NASDAQ dipped more than seven points, to $33.57.  The  S&amp;P 500 gained mere four points, to 1,592.  The yield on the benchmark 10- year treasury note, hitting 2.59 percent, the highest in nearly two years. </p><p/><p>       Overall, the week answered some questions: no, stocks don't always go  up; yes, the Fed will stop buying bonds sometimes.  But it also left some  queries hanging in the winds. </p><p/><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN (voice-over):  For most of us, thoughts about our  investments this week were unnerving, to say the least. </p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is a lot of uncertainty out there. </p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If you take a few bruises, you got to put your  best game in there.  What do you do?  That's the stock market.  That's how  it works.</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  At the start of the week a two-day run-up on the Dow and  S&amp;P put May's record highs back in sight. </p><p/><p>       Then came Wednesday, and a 200-point drop after Federal Chairman Ben  Bernanke put investors on notice with word the Fed may trim its bond-buying  before the end of the year and end it not long after that. </p><p/><p>       BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  We will continue to reduce  the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next  year, ending purchases around mid year. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  With the end of the Fed's asset buying program in sight,  stocks dropped another 300 points Thursday before stabilizing today.  Of  course, that plan depends on whether the economy continues to improve. </p><p/><p>       Gone in two days were the last two months of gains in the stock  market.  For the year, though, stocks are still up more than 12 percent,  even if a lot of us have doubts about the health of the economy.</p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Unemployment needs to be fixed, it's horrible.   The housing market still isn't really good.</p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm worried about the economy. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  So, what's next?  The year is almost half way down.   Corporate reports will come out soon, even experts are nervous.  That  housing recovery, well, mortgage rates are inching up. </p><p/><p>       BRAD HUNTER:  Everyone is getting a little spooked.</p><p/><p>       MEGAN MCGRATH:  These stocks are going to be very volatile until we  get some clarity around what the Feds doing. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  There is no shortage of opinions even inside the Fed  itself. </p><p/><p>St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, still worried about the economy  today said the announcement of a bond-buying pullback was, quote,  \"inappropriate time\".</p><p/><p>       Others say Bernanke and Fed got just what they wanted.</p><p/><p>       SCOTT WREN, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS:  I think the Fed was purposely  trying to take some air out of the housing market and stock market.  They  don't want the stock market going up 20 percent every six months.  They  don't want house prices rising 10-plus percent year over year for the next  five years.</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  But others took Bernanke at his word, that the economy is  recovering, that a policy charge is just a short-term shock to the system.</p><p/><p>       DAVID KELLY:  We're bating over medicating this economy.  This  economy is like a 12-year-old sitting on a bicycle with training wheels.   It can cycle forward on its own. </p><p/><p>       DAVID SEABURG, COWEN &amp; COMPANY:  Where are you going to put your  money right now?  In cash?  I don't think so.</p><p/><p>       Are you going to put it in the 30-year?  I don't have an interest in  having that duration risk.  I'm going to put it in equity.</p><p/><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  And with the quarter ending next week, market watchers say  they expect professional investors to buy blue chips to dress up their  portfolios. </p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Some burned investors in bankrupt energy giant Enron may  have a little bit more to be upset about today.  A shortened prison  sentenced for the jailed one-time chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling. </p><p/><p>       Scott Cohn was in the courtroom for this controversial decision today  and he joins us live from Houston.</p><p/><p>       So, Scott, why the more lenient resentencing and why right now? </p><p/><p>       SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know,  since, Sue, it makes sense for a guy in charge of an energy trading  company, this was basically a trade off.  A federal appeals court had  already said that the original sentence, 24 years, was too harsh.  It  should be more like 15 or 16 years. </p><p/><p>       Skilling wasn't willing to settle for that initially.  He was going  to charge the government committed misconduct in prosecuting the case.   That would drag it out for a whole lot longer. </p><p/><p>       So, ultimately, the government and Skilling came to this agreement,  where Skilling would drop the remaining appeals, $40 million would be  returned to the investors, the convictions would stand but he would get out  of prison early, basically 14 years.  But time out for good behavior, he'll  be out in about 11 or in 2017.  </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  Give us a sense, Scott, if you would, of the atmosphere in  the courtroom today and how did Skilling look?  You've been working this  story for years.</p><p/><p>       COHN:  Skilling is 59 years old and he looks every bit of that.  He's  grown a beard since he's been in prison.  He looks like he's aged somewhat.   He was in prison garb.  In handcuffs initially and then they took them off.</p><p/><p>       This courtroom was packed with Skilling supporters.  The judge said  250 people had written in support of Jeff Skilling.  Among the people in  the courtroom, Skilling's family, his wife Rebecca, members of Ken Lay's  family.  Remember, Ken Lay passed away in 2006, shortly after he was  convicted, then those convictions wiped out. </p><p/><p>       One victim spoke for those who are victimized by this scandal, Dianna  Peters, a former Enron employee, who said that Skilling betrayed the  employees' trust.</p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Talk more about that, Scott.  What exactly does this mean  for Enron's victims?</p><p/><p>       COHN:  Well, for one thing, they will get this $20 million held in  escrow since the trial in 2006.  All of that money will go to the victims. </p><p/><p>       Now, that's pittance in terms of the $60 billion or so that was lost  and there have been some big settlements in the order of about $7 billion  mainly with some of the banks that were involved.  But they will get some  money back and that's something that the Justice Department is emphasizing  in all of this, that they didn't come down that much from what the appeals  court wanted.  People will get their money back and most important, they  say, Skilling will not be able to challenge his convictions.  </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  Scott Cohn, an honorary citizen of Houston after all the  type you spent down there -- Scott, have a good weekend.  </p><p/><p>       Good news about jobs to tell you about.  Unemployment rates fell in  about half in all states in May led by big declines on the jobless rolls in  California, West Virginia, New York and Hawaii.  California's unemployment  rate is now 8.6 percent, higher than average.  But it is at its lowest in  five years. </p><p/><p>       Overall, North Dakota has the lowest of unemployment, 3.2 percent,  and Nevada, the highest at 9.3 percent.  The rates rose in 17 states and  remained the same in eight more. </p><p/><p>       HERERA:  And there was also good news, about autos sales, but this  time, used auto sales.  Car Max, the nation's biggest used car dealership  chain with 120 stores nationwide, reported a 21 percent rise in profits  last quarter on a 22 percent jump in sales.  Prices on those used cars were  also up about 1 percent from a year ago. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  If you're flying instead of driving, there may be some  relief on board that plane.  The Federal Aviation Administration is  expected to relax the ban on using some personal electronic devices during  taxiing, take-offs and landings and low altitude flying.  The ban of making  cell phone calls, however, will likely remain in effect but passengers may  soon be allowed to use e-readers, tablets and MP3 players without  admonishment from airline staff. </p><p/><p>       The actor Alec Baldwin who was famously thrown off an American  Airlines flight in 2011 for refusing to stop playing the game \"Words with  Friends\" on his smartphone during take off tweeted this reaction, \"If  you're flying first class on American Air, I'd still apply an extra measure  of restraint.\"</p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Well, the easing back of those airline rules may have turned  the initial public stock offering for Gogo into more of a no-no.  Shares of  the airline Internet service provider tumbled on their first day of trading  today.  After pricing last night at $17 a share, Gogo shares closed nearly  6 percent lower, at exactly $16 a piece.</p><p/><p>       Another big tech company is on the move.  The company that makes  smartphones for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Mac Pros for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is making efforts to move manufacturing back to the U.S.  It's called  onshoring.</p><p/><p>       And Jon Fortt has our story tonight.  </p><p/><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's  become an article of faith in America these days, manufacturing jobs that  have gone overseas can't come back.  American workers cost too much and  don't have the cutting-edge skills to build the latest gadgets. </p><p/><p>       But what if that is wrong?  In just the past month, Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) have both announced products they  plan to make here.  Apple's, a high end computer. </p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is designed by brilliant engineers in  California and assembled here in the USA. </p><p/><p>       (CHEERS)</p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a fantastic device we want to get in the  hands.</p><p/><p>       FORTT:  Google's, a risky new smartphone we haven't seen yet. </p><p/><p>       (on camera):  For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's a major gamble.  If it  succeeds, made in America is a major selling point for a cutting-edge  phone.  If it fails, American dreams and real American jobs are at stake.</p><p/><p>       ROBERT REICH, UNIV. OF CA (NASDAQ:CA)., BERKELEY:  Certainly, it will  boost morale.  I mean, I think a lot of people for a long time were kind of  economic determinist.  They assumed that our jobs, particular our low-skill  jobs would go abroad to the lowest waged countries, and that was never  wholly the case, but when manufacturing does start coming back, people's  hopes will get up.</p><p/><p>       FORTT (voice-over):  Flextronics, the contract manufacturer, will be  building both Apple's Mac Pro and Google's Motorola X phone, both later  this year.  Why make them in the U.S.?  The cost of labor is raising in  China and Malaysia, for one.</p><p/><p>       And as innovators like Tesla have shown, when there is a brand-new  high margin product that needs close attention, sometimes, it's worth it to  have it crafted close to home. </p><p/><p>       MIKE MCNAMARA, FLEXTRONICS CEO:  We're seeing a lot of work move into  places like Texas where we put up the Moto X factory and as well into North  Carolina, South Carolina.  These kinds of places, the governments are very  aggressive at improving regulation so it's pro-business and keeping taxes  down and really working to stimulate jobs. </p><p/><p>       FORTT (on camera):  It will probably take years for this story to  play out for us to see if tech really can bring American manufacturing jobs  back long-term.  But this initial chapter is key.  If names as big as Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can't succeed at this, chances are  the others won't be about to, either. </p><p/><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt. </p><p/><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Coming up, how big American companies are taking advantage  of an even bigger trend, urbanization, especially in China.  But, first, a  look at the best performing stocks of the S&amp;P this week. </p><p/><p>       (MUSIC)</p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Violent protests continue to rock the streets of Brazil's  biggest cities for the second week running.  As an estimated 1 million  people rallied against the government for raising prices on public service  last night, some cities even cancelled the transit fair hikes that set off  those demonstrations a week ago.  But that didn't stop the protest.  More  unrest is expected tonight in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, and other major  cities.</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  Two U.S. senators say a Chinese company's purchase of  Smithfield Foods (NYSE:SFD) is quote difficult to square, but the Chinese's  government's restrictions on U.S. pork and beef exports.  Senators Max  Baucus and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and a Republican, say the interest of  U.S. farmers and ranchers must be protected, calling for a full review of  Shuanghui group's planned acquisition of Smithfield.   That's the world's  largest pork producer.  </p><p/><p>       HERERA:  And in China, the government is pushing ahead with a  sweeping plan to move millions of rural residents into more populated areas  and this growth and urbanization has not gone unnoticed by some of  America's biggest companies.</p><p/><p>       Eunice Yoon reports.</p><p/><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  All  over the world, people are heading to the cities.  Nowhere of that more  true than in China.  By 2030, one in eight people on the planet will live  in a Chinese city. </p><p/><p>       That's good for companies like Honeywell. </p><p/><p>       STEPHEN SHANG, HONEYWELL CHINA CEO:  The wealth of these people is  increasing at a tremendous peak. </p><p/><p>       YOON:  Honeywell is betting big on China's plans to build up its  cities.  The American industrial giant has opened up new factories like  this one in a midwestern city of Chongqing, expecting its urbanization  expertise in the U.S. and Europe to translate here. </p><p/><p>       SHANG:  Urbanization is really, if you look at it, it's a building of  the mega, mega movement and not in one location but all across China, new  towns, new subways, new trains, new planes, new hospitals and they are all  in the Honeywell scope. </p><p/><p>       YOON (on camera):  If China wasn't urbanizing at this fast a pace,  would your growth be as strong? </p><p/><p>       SHANG:  Of course not. </p><p/><p>       YOON (voice-over):  Honeywell is making and selling brake pads here.   It's targeting sales growth about double the country's growth rate, which  is currently above 7 percent. </p><p/><p>       To build it cities, China needs everything, Australian iron for steel  beams to American bulldozers. </p><p/><p>       (on camera):  At shopping plazas like this one, you can see all sorts  of international brands, with more and more for Chinese moving into the  city, companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), H&amp;M, and Gucci can make more  consumers here than ever before. </p><p/><p>       SHANG:  They create jobs for us in China, but also create jobs for  U.S.  Many of this product know-how (ph) is in the foreign countries.  As  in the process of localization, you actually create for jobs for these  foreign countries, whether it's the U.S., Germany or U.K.  So everybody  benefits.</p><p/><p>       YOON (voice-over):  Welcomed news with economy so weak back at home.  </p><p/><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon.</p><p/><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  And tonight in \"Market Focus\", some bargain hunting on the  day after the big Dow dipper. </p><p/><p>       Bristol-Myers gaining back most of its Thursday's loss as investors  cheered FDA labeling approval for leukemia treatment.  Shares of Bristol- Myers up 2.5 percent on above average volume.  It closed at $45.73. </p><p/><p>       DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) meanwhile, touching a new five-year high  as it abandoned its efforts to acquire Sprint.  DISH took on more than $2.6  billion in debt and interest to finance the Sprint deal.  They're not going  to be spending it now.  That didn't matter to the market today as DISH  network gained more than 3 percent to close at $41.40.  DISH up 7 percent  since it lost that Sprint bid back in April. </p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Archer Daniels Midland gained after saying that it's in  talks to sell its coco business, about 4 percent of its overall sales.  ADM  shares were up almost 1 1/2 percent, closing at $33.09.</p><p/><p>       And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also gained today on an upgrade to buy from  neutral over at UBS.  And some astonishing stats on Instagram video.  One  year of video was uploaded in the first eight hours.  In other words, it  would take a year to watch all of those videos and remember, they are only  15 seconds long. </p><p/><p>       Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) acquired Instagram in September of 2012.  And in  today's trade, shares tacked on 2 1/2 percent, closing at $24.53. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  And time now to turn our attention to this week's market  monitor guest who says she is positive on equities both over the short and  the long-term.  She's Judy Saryan, portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN)  Vance.</p><p/><p>       Judy, welcome.  What a week, great week to have you here with us. </p><p/><p>       Explain why you think this is not just -- not a fatally wounded bull  market. </p><p/><p>       JUDY SARYAN, EATON VANCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Well, I'm very happy to  be here, Tyler.</p><p/><p>       I think that the move by the Fed and the comments by Bernanke  indicate that the economy is growing.  It's not growing too rapidly.  It's  not growing too slowly.  It's just right. </p><p/><p>       And I think that is really the key underpin of the market. </p><p/><p>       So, we're very positive about the market, both near term and long  term.  The Fed is basically on the track that they set.  There is really  nothing new in what they said. </p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Judy, though, we did see a lot of volatility this week and  we've seen interest rates move quite a bit higher than they were a couple  weeks ago.  Does that worry you at all?  I mean, it's good for savers  certainly.  But does it worry you about the market's ability to move  forward in the market?</p><p/><p>       SARYAN:  The interest level has moved up.  It was pretty dramatic in  the last couple weeks.  But at this current level, the 10-year Treasury 2.5  percent, that's still a very reasonable interest rate.  I believe the  economy can grow with that rate.  It's not a problem for the housing  market.</p><p/><p>       And, of course, the housing market is key for the growth in the  economy but housing is still extremely affordable at record rates in terms  of affordability.  It would take rates going much higher before we saw  that, you know, really affect or impact the housing market.</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  I think our viewers have their pencils ready, Judy, for a  couple of your stocks picks.  And a couple of stocks on your list this week  are banks -- one big, one somewhat smaller.  Let's start with the big one,  which is Citigroup (NYSE:C).</p><p/><p>       SARYAN:  OK.  Well, at Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance, where you focus on  fundamentals and the fundamentals are very positive for Citigroup (NYSE:C).   There are several positive factors favoring Citigroup (NYSE:C).  There's an  improvement in the capital market's activity. </p><p/><p>       Also, Citigroup (NYSE:C) benefits from the real estate market.  In  fact, they are going to be releasing $8.5 billion in reserves from the  North American Mortgage business.  So that will be a strong tail wind to  earnings looking out this year. </p><p/><p>       On top of that, the evaluation is very attractive.  The stock is  selling at 63 percent of book, a low P/E ratio and I think the stock could  get up to book value.</p><p/><p>       HERERA:  I would assume housing would help the next pick, which is  Regions. </p><p/><p>       SARYAN:  Absolutely.  Regions Financial is a regional bank.  About 55  percent of their portfolio is in loans so they benefit from the real estate  market.  They are selling at a very attractive valuation.  They have a  reasonable yield and we're expecting dividend growth out of Regions as  well. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  Let's see if we can squeeze in two more very quickly, 15  seconds for each.  One is Sanofi and the other is Phillips 66. </p><p/><p>       SARYAN:  OK.  On Sanofi, it's a French-based company.  Great  pharmaceutical company.  Very strong position in the diabetes market place.   They've got one of the strong insulin drugs and that business is doing very  well.  They've also got some very strong positions in the vaccine business.</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  And Phillips. </p><p/><p>       SARYAN:  And on Phillips, they are -- became independent about a year  ago from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).  Strong free cash flow, over $4 billion  we project this year and potential to grow that dividend at a very nice  clip, very inexpensive stock, selling at a 7 multiple on P/E.  Great stuff.</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  I assume, Judy, that your funds own all of these companies  or your business does.  Any other disclosures? </p><p/><p>       SARYAN:  No, that would be the primary disclosure. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  All right. Judy, thank you very much.  Judy Saryan is  portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance. </p><p/><p>       And still ahead, after falling, excuse me, to the bottom of the pizza  food chain, we'll show you how Domino's turned things around and delivered  for shareholders. </p><p/><p>       But, first, a look at some of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P  this week. </p><p/><p>       (MUSIC)</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is raising its prices.  The java  giant plans to jack up prices on some of its drinks but only by an average  of 1 percent.  For some markets, the company say it will be the first price  hike in about two years.</p><p/><p>       Even though coffee bean prices have been dropping, Starbucks  (NASDAQ:SBUX) blames the increase on higher rents, labor costs and raising  prices milk and sugar.</p><p/><p>       HERERA:  And those rising material costs and changing consumer tastes  are some of the biggest challenges for eateries.  And there is one chain  that's worked very hard to figure out what its customers want and has  succeeded, delivering for both diners and investors.</p><p/><p>       Jackie DeAngelis has the latest in NBR series on \"Comeback Companies\"  with a look at pizza giant, Domino's.</p><p/><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDNT (voice-over):   In 2009, Domino's ranked at the bottom of a consumer survey on pizza taste  preferences, tied with Chuck E. Cheese's -- particularly galling for the  company that virtually invented the pizza delivery chain business. </p><p/><p>       The situation was desperate. </p><p/><p>       PATRICK DOYLE, DOMINO'S PIZZA PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  The combination of  poor results for a couple of years in our domestic business and then, you  know, some surveys coming out that were not particularly kind to us and the  quality of our pizza, it sent us into a room one day.  We made the decision  that it was time to really fix this. </p><p/><p>       DEANGELIS:  But, now, four years later, Domino's is at the top of the  latest rankings and people love their pizza. </p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Their food is really delicious.  It's really  savoring.  It really feels in your taste buds.</p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Domino's is a good place to come because it's  cheap and you get a lot of food for like money and have a lot of good  deals. </p><p/><p>       DEANGELIS:  How did Domino's do it?  First, they fixed the pizza. </p><p/><p>       DOYLE:  Brought the team in and said, look, everything is on the  table.  You can chance anything and we just simply want to have the best  pizza out there. </p><p/><p>       DEANGELIS:  Then they stream lined business, adding online ordering  for convenience and to drive sales. </p><p/><p>       DOYLE:  Digital orders have been growing about 5 percent a year as a  mix of our total sales.  So we're now in the 35 percent to 45 percent  range.  Customer satisfaction is higher, order accuracy is higher.  The  ticket on those orders is a little bit higher.  The labor cost is slightly  little lower.  So everything is better. </p><p/><p>       DEANGELIS:  Those who invested in Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) has seen  a sweet return, after hitting a low of $3.30 a share in November of 2008,  the stock has run up nearly 1,800 percent. </p><p/><p>       The turnaround has been good for investors and also employees. </p><p/><p>       DOYLE:  Over 90 percent of our franchises in the U.S. started as  hourly workers in our stores, either as delivery drivers or customer  service representatives.  They worked their way up through -- to become a  manager and then bought their first store. </p><p/><p>       DEANGELIS (on camera):  But there are challenges ahead for Domino's:  one is growing the international business, especially in China, to keep up  with the competition. </p><p/><p>       STEPHEN ANDERSON, MILLER TABAK SENIOR RESTAUTRANT ANALYST:  I think  one of the ways that Domino's can succeed in China is having a broad menu  approach or maybe specializing in chicken, which is a very popular fast  food staple in China. </p><p/><p>       DEANGELIS:  So, the stock that has doubled since last year at this  time still have room to run? </p><p/><p>       ANDERSON:  I don't think it moves much higher right now.  I think the  challenge that Domino's faces in the next 12 months.  It will be up against  a tougher year of comparisons, particularly in the U.S. coming off the  introduction of pan pizza very late in the third quarter.</p><p/><p>       DEANGELIS:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p/><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, an appropriate end of what must  inevitably be called a roller costar week on Wall Street and it comes just  in time for the start of summer. </p><p/><p>       Take a look at the full throttle rollercoaster debuting today at Six  Flags Magic Mountain outside Los Angeles. </p><p/><p>       I bet, Sue, you grew up going there. </p><p/><p>       HERERA:  I went to Magic Mountain. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  It is the world's tallest and fastest looping roller  coaster top speed 70 miles per hour through a 160-foot high loop.</p><p/><p>       HERERA:  Mercifully, they didn't have that when I went to Magic  Mountain.</p><p/><p>       That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera, in for  Susie Gharbi.  Thanks for joining us. </p><p/><p>       MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen have a great weekend, everybody.

The nays are 30.  The  nomination is confirmed. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Ben Bernanke wins a  second term as Fed chairman despite some harsh criticism from lawmakers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  A look at what this vote  means for the nation`s top banker tonight.  You`re watching NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 28. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  Good evening everyone.  Ben Bernanke got the OK from the  Senate today; he gets to keep his job. Tom as you know, there was plenty of  drama and debate before the vote. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HUDSON:  There sure was Susie and when the dust finally had settled on  Capitol Hill, lawmakers did vote 70 to 30 to re-appoint Bernanke to another  four years now as chairman of the Federal Reserve. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Tom, the controversy over Bernanke`s policies and what they  mean for jobs, inflation and the economy won`t go away.  He`s still under  pressure.  As Darren Gersh reports, many politicians will be watching  Bernanke now more closely than ever. </p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Ben Bernanke`s  supporters consider him the indispensable man of the financial crisis.  As  Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke pumped more than $1 trillion into the  banking system, hoping to prevent another great depression.  Sometime this  year Bernanke is expected to reverse course, raising interest rates and  winding down many of the crisis programs he put in place.  Rhode Island`s  Jack Reed called that a delicate task and a good reason to give Bernanke a  second term. </p><p>   SEN. JACK REED, (D) RHODE ISLAND:  We need someone that understands  these programs and understands them not just theoretically, but literally  from trial and error, understanding what worked, what didn`t work, what the  consequences are. </p><p>  GERSH:  One consequence of waiting too long to take that money out of  the banking system could be a burst of inflation.  New Hampshire`s Judd  Gregg said Bernanke won`t let that happen. </p><p>   SEN. JUDD GREGG, (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE:  As we all know, inflation is the  cruelest tax of all.  Because it devalues peoples savings and it undermines  the productivity of a nation. </p><p>  GERSH:  Other conservatives argued Bernanke`s low interest rate  policies created those very inflation risks.  And Kentucky`s Jim Bunning  reminded his colleagues of what he sees as the Bernanke Fed`s lasting  legacy. </p><p>   SEN. JIM BUNNING, (R) KENTUCKY:  A vote for Ben Bernanke is a vote for  bailouts.  Chairman Bernanke has been in the middle of all the financial  bailouts during the crisis.</p><p>  GERSH:  From the left, Democrats pushed the Fed to put Main Street  ahead of Wall Street. And Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said it  wasn`t just Bernanke who needed to change course. </p><p>   SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, (D) RHODE ISLAND:  The leaders of President  Obama`s economic team must pivot from the necessary rescue of our major  financial institutions to equally, if not more necessary, help to America`s  families. </p><p>  GERSH: But today`s confirmation vote was partly about reassuring  investors on Wall Street.  Some of Bernanke`s strongest supporters argued a  no vote would undermine confidence just as the economy and financial  markets are finding solid footing.  Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,  Washington. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Let`s take a look at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel  for you.  Tech stocks leading the way lower on Wall Street.  Poor outlooks  from Qualcomm and Motorola churned up new worries about the economy.  At  the close, there it is, the Dow Industrials down 115 points, the NASDAQ  down 42 and the S&amp;P 500 off nearly 13. All three now are at new lows for  the year. </p><p>       Results from Microsoft may help set the tone for tomorrow`s trading.  The software giant turning in strong fiscal second quarter results with  earnings up 60 percent on strong demand for Windows 7.  Meanwhile online,  amazon.com, huge profits, up 71 percent on robust holiday sales.   The  company says it`s upbeat about its Kindle e-reader, even with Apple`s iPad  launch.  We`ll have more specifics on Amazon and Apple coming up in  tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>  GHARIB:  Something different at Ford, the auto maker says it made  money last year.  In fact, it`s the first full year profit since 2005.   Ford earned almost $3 billion last year, reversing a loss of more than $14  billion in 2008.  CEO Alan Mulally expects the profit streak to continue  over the next two years, at least before taxes.  Driving those profits,  sales of Ford`s popular Fusion cars and a turnaround in its finance  business.  Ford also hopes to take advantage of a competitor`s weakness and  win over Toyota buyers.  It`s offering $1,000 to customers trading in a  late-model Toyota. </p><p>  HUDSON:  As for Toyota tonight, it is waiting for Federal safety  regulators to sign off on the fix for its gas pedal problems.  With the  recall growing, the auto maker known for quality faces some tough  questions.  Jeffrey Liker is an engineering professor at the University of  Michigan and author of the book \"The Toyota Way.\"  Professor, welcome to  NBR.  Has Toyota lost its way with this six million vehicle recall? </p><p>  JEFFREY LIKER, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:  I don`t think so.   Six million sounds like six million problems, but it`s actually two  problems that they`ve been able to identify, a problem with carpets when  they are loose and a problem with sticky pedals after a few years that has  happened in a relatively small number of cars. So I don`t think you could  say that.  n my experience looking, visiting their plants, visiting their  engineering offices, their quality is actually better than ever.  For  example, 10 JD Power awards for initial quality, the most of any auto maker  last year. </p><p>  HUDSON:  But this is certainly front and center in most consumers and  investors` minds.  Is the recall and how Toyota has been handling it here  do you think any indication that the culture of quality perhaps is changing  on the edges? </p><p>  LIKER:  I think it`s certainly an indication about the interest of the  press and the Internet and how quickly news gets blown up so that you  forget it is the pedal and it`s carpet and it becomes the whole company.   So I think that gives a very unrealistic impression of what is happening  within Toyota. </p><p>  HUDSON:  But certainly isn`t this representative of what Toyota does,  which is build cars and perhaps there is nothing more central to a car  other than its gas pedal? </p><p>  LIKER:  The gas pedal works in almost every case but after a few years  it gets sticky.  And it feels sort of awkward.  So that also happens in  every other car in the world in certain cases.  It is not unique to Toyota,  but they did find that there is a particular material and a little piece of  metal that interacts with moisture and one supplier used that particular  material and that is generating all the millions of recalls. It is not  certainly indicative of quality in the company.  It is not really evidence  that...  </p><p>  HUDSON:   You`ve studied Toyota for years.  You visited plants both in  the United States and globally.  How prepared do you think the company is  to deal with this size of recall, both from the perspective of customers  and drivers but as well as shareholders. </p><p>  LIKER:  Well, actually they are probably more prepared than before the  recession.  One of the things Toyota did in the recession was to keep all  their people employed, train them, solve quality problems in the plant.    They launched new vehicles. They move vehicles from plant to plant so they  are probably more flexible and more prepared than they have ever been  before. </p><p>  HUDSON:  In 2001 as you know, Toyota set out to become the world`s  biggest auto maker. It did succeed. Do you think that appetite for growth  played any role in this recall at all?  Those questions are being asked  now, I imagine. </p><p>  LIKER:  I know those questions are being asked, again, I think by  uninformed people that aren`t realizing this is a supplier and a pedal.   And it`s a carpet that if it is not fastened down causes a problem.  I  don`t know what that tells you about the company, when a company is  consistently winning quality awards from JD Power, consistently at the tops  of consumer reports. </p><p>  HUDSON:  With all those -- </p><p>  LIKER:  The measures are getting better every year. </p><p>  HUDSON:  So with all those awards recognized, why do you think Toyota  took the step to actually issue a massive recall as opposed to just deal  with these problems as they came in? </p><p>  LIKER:  If you have a pedal, yeah, if you have a pedal that can stick  and you meet with NTSA and you decide a recall --</p><p>       HUDSON:  NTSA is the National Transportation Safety Administration.</p><p>       LIKER:  The national, yes, exactly and they meet and they don`t know  which of those other cars has that problem.  They have no way of knowing.   It could be one, it could be 10, it could be 50.  So they obviously have to  take action.  And that`s also the responsible thing to do.  But that  doesn`t tell you anything about what is going on in their Georgetown,  Kentucky plant or the Indiana plant or their engineering office. It is  still this one problem that the pedal in one plant that made, in a supplier  plant and the designed decision was made 10 years ago. </p><p>  HUDSON:  We have to leave it there. We appreciate you answering  questions. </p><p>  LIKER:  You have to go back 10 years. </p><p>  HUDSON:    There we go.  Jeffrey Liker along with us, University of  Michigan professor, author of \"The Toyota Way.\"</p><p>  GHARIB:  Still ahead, how Toyota is responding to customers on the  web.  And when it comes to social networking, what your company needs to  know about crisis management. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Continuing just a bit with Toyota, it is in tonight`s \"Market  Focus.\"  With the recall expanding, the company that makes the gas pedal  assemblies the professor referred to at the heart of this problem says  don`t blame it.  That didn`t necessarily help the shares of the company.   CTS (CTS), we talked about it last night, again here, after staging a bit  of a recovery on Wednesday, today another tough day as you can see, usually  about 100,000 CTS shares trade hands.  Today more than a million and a half  traded and the company said Toyota (TM) is responsible for the bad pedal  design, not it. Meantime, CTS says it`s adding extra shifts at three of its  factories to make replacement parts.  And the company says none of the  pedals it sends to Toyota are used by other auto makers. Competing supplier  Denso already is Toyota`s biggest parts maker.  A spokeswoman tells NBR  their Toyota pedals are made in Japan and that it will support Toyota as  much as possible, but she would not be specific. </p><p>       Earlier we did mention today`s big tech earnings from Microsoft  (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN).  Let`s take a look at some of the details here.  To get the $0.74 a share profit last quarter that you see from Microsoft,  it added in deferred revenue.  This all relates to the October release of  its Windows 7.  It sold the software to computer makers two quarters ago  before the software was officially released.  Those sales are now included  in this quarterly report.  After hours, Microsoft stock up about $0.40  after dropping almost 2 percent on double normal volume. </p><p>       Amazon shares certainly catching a bit after the close, up $3 at one  point, hitting close to $130 a share, up almost $3 ahead of these results.   Santa very kind to amazon.com, a big blow away quarter here.   It`s not  expected to stop.  The company predicts sales to be at least 32 percent  higher this quarter.  Barclays thinks that Amazon`s Kindle will remain hot  even with the new iPad from Apple. </p><p>       Some of the big movers in the world of mobile phones are moving in  different directions. On the downside, Qualcomm (QCOM) after lowering its  sales forecast, the stock dropping 14 percent, very active, almost 10 times  volume.  Motorola (MOT) stock meantime hitting fresh six month lows  tonight.   The fourth quarter profit not enough to impress buyers because a  warning came.  Fewer devices from Motorola will be shipped this quarter.   The biggest competitor, Nokia  (NOK) saw its stock hit three-month highs on  six times normal volume.  Better than expected results and a bigger slice  of the cell phone market helping push shares of Nokia higher.  </p><p>       Let`s catching up on a couple or rather a trio of the Dow components  that did report results today, pushing the market around.  Pampers maker  P&amp;G, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) did its best to put some green on the board.  It  was the biggest percentage gainer today, up almost 2 percent for the Dow.   Profits beat the Street, thanks in part to price cuts as well as higher  priced new products. </p><p>       Post-it note maker 3M (MMM) was able to show growing profits, pushed  up its prediction for the year, not enough though for the stock. Take a  look. The shares wane on the index slipping to an early December low.  </p><p>       Let me tell you quickly about AT&amp;T (T) shares, down by only $0.06 in  the day, this after matching estimates thanks to its wireless business  certainly with Apple`s iPhone.  </p><p>       And a former Dow component turned in a big day of buying.  Eastman  Kodak (EK), take a look at the stock, 54 million shares, nine times average  and at a six-month high, close to a six-month high, its highest price at  least since September.  Now the Dow Industrials only 120 points above  10,000.  Investors here unimpressed with earnings and earnings will  continue to be in the \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>  GHARIB:  More on the Toyota recall, as we know, it`s a big story for  the news media.  But it`s also a big topic of discussion on social media.   Toyota has an active social networking presence on Facebook, Twitter and  Youtube. It`s answering customer concerns on those sites and on its own web  page it has a list of frequently asked questions and answers.  This kind of  proactive response is exactly what the doctor ordered, according to Scott  Gurvey`s guide to social networking.  Scott wraps up his series tonight  with a look at how businesses should approach these new media platforms. </p><p>  SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you think the  people around you spend a lot of time on social networking sites, you are  probably right.  And if you are a business hoping to expand through social  networking, digital strategy guru Stephanie Agresta says you should plan on  making it a part of your regular routine. </p><p>   STEPHANIE AGRESTA, VP DIGITAL STRATEGY, PORTER NOVELLI:  As a  business, if you`re making the investment to be there, then you need to be  there consistently.  It`s not something you can jump into, post, let days  go by and then post again.  Your customers need to know that you are really  committed to the medium. </p><p>  GURVEY:  So, our first take-away tonight is devote time.  Nicole  Romagnoll spends an hour each day maintaining her pet care company`s  Facebook page. </p><p>   NICOLE ROMAGNOLL, FETCH! PET CARE OF STATEN ISLAND:  It`s not work for  me. It`s fun.  You`re socializing.  It`s exciting when you post a picture  of a new client and then you get people commenting underneath about how  cute.  I look forward to seeing that stuff so when I want a break from my  day, I`ll go on to my fan page. </p><p>  GURVEY:  One thing to be aware of with social networking is a  multiplier effect. Columbia Professor Sree Sreenivasan says it`s both a  blessing and a curse. </p><p>   SREE SREENIVASAN, DIGITAL MEDIA PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIV.:  The power  of twitter is really in the re-tweet.  As in, somebody takes the post you  made and then re-tweets it and sends it out.  So instead of someone just  saying something at the water cooler they`re saying it at the digital water  cooler which has this effect of this echo that can make things that are not  true seem true and things that are true, they can amplify it in a good way  or in a bad way. </p><p>  GURVEY:  Lev Ekster says knowing how quickly a negative comment about  his cupcake company can spread keeps everyone on their toes. </p><p>   LEV EKSTER, FOUNDER, CUPCAKESTOP.COM:  All it takes is one  dissatisfied customer to send a tweet about you to really hurt the  business, so that`s why we try so hard.  And we know we have this immense  exposure on Twitter now with 9,000 people following us, so it`s important  to maintain quality and make sure all those 9,000 people are pleased with  you. </p><p>  GURVEY:  Which brings us to our final take-away.  Don`t panic.  If you  get a complaint, social media adviser Jennifer Jacobson says, meet it head  on. </p><p>   JENNIFER JACOBSON, AUTHOR &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT:  It`s probably not  that they just don`t like you and want to say bad things about your  business.  They probably have a legitimate concern.  So step back.  Sort of  take the emotion out of it and really look at what it is they`re saying and  address it honestly. Because if you can have that kind of conversation even  over Twitter, your other customers that are following you are going to see  that and they`re going to see the tact and the skill and the sincerity with  which you addressed that person`s complaint or issue.  And hopefully they  will respect that. </p><p>  GURVEY:  Our guide to social networking doesn`t end here.  There`s  more on our web site, NBR on pbs.org and we hope the next chapter in the  guide will be written by you.  Add your comments and tips for businesses  going online to our blog and we`ll keep the dialogue going.  Scott Gurvey,  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow.  We`ll see earnings  from Chevron, Fortune Brands, Honeywell and Mattel.  And we also get our  first look at how the economy did in the final three months of last year.   The prediction?  Up over 4 percent.  And, our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest  says the economic recovery is the real deal.  He`s John Dorfman, chairman  of Thunderstorm Capital looking for double digit growth in the year 2010. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Case dismissed against Broadcom founder Henry Nicholas.  A  Federal judge today threw out drug charges and two civil cases against the  former CEO.  He had faced the possibility of decades in prison.  Last  month, Nicholas was cleared of insider trading charges after the judge  accused prosecutors of misconduct.  Lawyers for the SEC still plan to re- file a lawsuit related to those charges. </p><p>  HUDSON:  If you`re an at-risk homeowner and want help modifying your  mortgage from the government, you`ll have to prove your income up front  with recent pay stubs and tax returns. Previously, borrowers could provide  their income verbally and supply documentation later. That caused problems  because many homeowners never got around to doing it.  Out of 900,000 trial  modifications, only 7 percent or 66,000 have become permanent. The  paperwork change begins June 1st. </p><p>  GHARIB:  As we said, Ben Bernanke will be running the Fed for the next  four years.  But he might not have as much free reign this time around.    Some members of Congress want to audit the Fed`s activities.  Our  commentator tonight thinks that`s a bad idea and he ought to know.  He`s  Alan Blinder, former vice chair of the Fed and professor of economics at  Princeton. </p><p>  ALAN BLINDER, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY:  Do you ever  get the feeling that this country is over-lawyered?  Well, here`s another  example. Ron Paul, the libertarian congressman who wants to abolish the  Federal Reserve, has long promoted a first step in that direction.  The so- called Paul bill would subject the Fed`s monetary policy decisions to GAO  audits.  Like most economists, I find the idea, well, appalling.  But I  breathed a sigh of relief when a modified version was appended to the  House`s financial reform bill late last year.  The Paul-Grayson amendment  added what I thought was an important clause. Let me read it to you.   Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as interference in or  dictation of monetary policy to the Federal Reserve System by the Congress  or the GAO.  </p><p>        That sounds like a strong affirmation of the Fed`s independence,  right?  I certainly read it that way and so did my students.  Then I talked  to a lawyer. So put on your lawyers glasses and read it again  Nothing in  this subsection shall be construed as interference and so on.  Read  literally, the sentence does not instruct Congress to keep its nose out of  monetary policy.  Instead, it asserts that the proposed law does not  interfere with monetary policy even if you think it does.  Orwell`s big  brother would have been proud.  He gave us war is peace, freedom is  slavery.  Now the House thought police give us interference is not  interference.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, could we please fix this?   I`m Alan Blinder. </p><p>  HUDSON:  Finally tonight, when it comes to music, what`s old is now  new.  Vinyl records once considered obsolete are making a big comeback.    Jeff Yastine reports tonight, that`s music to the ears of many fans. </p><p>  JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A busy afternoon  at Sweat Records. Amid the re-stocking of vegetarian jerky treats, you`ll  find other hints of what`s really for sale here.  Record adapters?  What  are those? And along one side of the store, a mother load of vinyl.  These  are new pressings, not used records.  Lauren Reskin presides over this  vinyl paradise. </p><p>   LAUREN RESKIN OWNER, SWEAT RECORDS:  Most people are really surprised  when they come in, you guys sell records?  We get that from older folks are  most surprised and then young kids come in and they`re just like ooh vinyl.    It`s neat that the perspectives are kind of changing on that. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Some of the albums are iconic, reissues of classic Beatles,  Beach Boys, Miles Davis.  But right alongside those, you`ll find new  releases, from bands you`ve likely never heard of, yet.  Reskin says vinyl  and digital can peacefully co-exist.  In many cases, if you buy a vinyl  record, you get the digital download for free.  And for the iPod  generation, those records come with a new appreciation of cover art. </p><p>   RESKIN:  Like this, on CD it looks like a big jumble of just stuff.  But when you blow it up this big, there`s a street scene and some cool  graphics and this one comes with a 32-page booklet, liner notes and a comic  book and graffiti and downloads.  That`s a lot more bang for your buck than  just a normal CD. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Vinyl record sales have soared, nearly tripling to 2.5  million records in the last three years.  Not bad for a format long  declared dead.  And here is one of the few places where vinyl records are  still made.   Linford Ellis is one of the few engineers who still knows how  to turn raw vinyl into music.  There are only a dozen pressing plants still  operating in the U.S., half of what existed 20 years ago. </p><p>   LINFORD ELLIS, PLANT MANAGER, ALPHA MUSIC MFG.:  And most of those  people now, they can`t do this job anymore.  They`ve forgotten what they`ve  learned, so the few people around, the few pressing plants that are around,  are still going. We`re like gold dust. </p><p>  YASTINE:  To give you a sense of how much the vinyl record business  has taken off, this machine pumps out about 800 vinyl records a day.  This  is actually a 45 but with a small hole.  But now they have a second  machine, this one here.  It`s also pumping out 800 records as well.   Business is so good these days that Alpha is bringing in a third, a fourth  and a fifth machine.  But these machines are so old that they`re having to  scrounge for parts to get them up and running again.  That`s a good problem  to have, if you`re Jeffrey Collins, CEO of Alpha Music Manufacturing.  He`s  as surprised as anyone about vinyl`s resurgence. </p><p>   JEFFREY COLLINS, CEO, ALPHA MUSIC MFG.:  It`s exciting. I didn`t think  that vinyl was going to continue and last as long as it did.  I don`t think  vinyl will ever die. </p><p>  YASTINE:  Not everyone agrees.  Some think it`s a fad or a love of all  things retro.  Then again, back at Sweat Records... </p><p>   RESKIN:  In the first year we were around, we expanded our vinyl  immensely. And in that first year is when I realized we`re going to sell  more vinyl than I anticipated. </p><p>  YASTINE:  That was five years ago.  And vinyl, like Reskin`s store is  still going strong. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami. </p><p>  HUDSON:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday,  January 28.  I`m Tom Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you  too, Susie. </p><p>  GHARIB:  See you tomorrow Tom.  I`m Susie Gharib.  Good night  everyone, hope to see all of you again tomorrow night right here.   </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

We saw ups and big slides down. But now that the nerve-wracking week is over, what happens next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Sentenced reduced. He was the man at the center of one of the most notorious financial scandals in U.S. history. And today, the former CEO of Enron was told he`ll get out of jail early.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Age of insourcing. After years of seeing jobs go overseas, companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are reversing the trend and keeping some jobs right here in the U.S.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 21st</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone. And welcome. I`m Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>Sue Herera joins me tonight. Susie Gharib has the evening off.</p><p>Well, you couldn`t really call it a come back day, not after Thursday`s 350-point Dow infarction. But the patient was stabilized, despite some wild swings on the so-called quadruple winching day when certain options and future contracts expire.</p><p>On heavy volume, the Dow rocked and rolled and finished 41 points higher at 14,799. The NASDAQ was dragged lower, especially by Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which fell 9 percent on an earnings miss last quarter reported yesterday. NASDAQ dipped more than seven points, to $33.57. The S&amp;P 500 gained mere four points, to 1,592. The yield on the benchmark 10- year treasury note, hitting 2.59 percent, the highest in nearly two years.</p><p>Overall, the week answered some questions: no, stocks don`t always go up; yes, the Fed will stop buying bonds sometimes. But it also left some queries hanging in the winds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): For most of us, thoughts about our investments this week were unnerving, to say the least.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a lot of uncertainty out there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you take a few bruises, you got to put your best game in there. What do you do? That`s the stock market. That`s how it works.</p><p>MATHISEN: At the start of the week a two-day run-up on the Dow and S&amp;P put May`s record highs back in sight.</p><p>Then came Wednesday, and a 200-point drop after Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke put investors on notice with word the Fed may trim its bond-buying before the end of the year and end it not long after that.</p><p>BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: We will continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid year.</p><p>MATHISEN: With the end of the Fed`s asset buying program in sight, stocks dropped another 300 points Thursday before stabilizing today. Of course, that plan depends on whether the economy continues to improve.</p><p>Gone in two days were the last two months of gains in the stock market. For the year, though, stocks are still up more than 12 percent, even if a lot of us have doubts about the health of the economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unemployment needs to be fixed, it`s horrible. The housing market still isn`t really good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m worried about the economy.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what`s next? The year is almost half way down. Corporate reports will come out soon, even experts are nervous. That housing recovery, well, mortgage rates are inching up.</p><p>BRAD HUNTER: Everyone is getting a little spooked.</p><p>MEGAN MCGRATH: These stocks are going to be very volatile until we get some clarity around what the Feds doing.</p><p>MATHISEN: There is no shortage of opinions even inside the Fed itself.</p><p>St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, still worried about the economy today said the announcement of a bond-buying pullback was, quote, \"inappropriate time\".</p><p>Others say Bernanke and Fed got just what they wanted.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: I think the Fed was purposely trying to take some air out of the housing market and stock market. They don`t want the stock market going up 20 percent every six months. They don`t want house prices rising 10-plus percent year over year for the next five years.</p><p>MATHISEN: But others took Bernanke at his word, that the economy is recovering, that a policy charge is just a short-term shock to the system.</p><p>DAVID KELLY: We`re bating over medicating this economy. This economy is like a 12-year-old sitting on a bicycle with training wheels. It can cycle forward on its own.</p><p>DAVID SEABURG, COWEN &amp; COMPANY: Where are you going to put your money right now? In cash? I don`t think so.</p><p>Are you going to put it in the 30-year? I don`t have an interest in having that duration risk. I`m going to put it in equity.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And with the quarter ending next week, market watchers say they expect professional investors to buy blue chips to dress up their portfolios.</p><p>HERERA: Some burned investors in bankrupt energy giant Enron may have a little bit more to be upset about today. A shortened prison sentenced for the jailed one-time chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling.</p><p>Scott Cohn was in the courtroom for this controversial decision today and he joins us live from Houston.</p><p>So, Scott, why the more lenient resentencing and why right now?</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, since, Sue, it makes sense for a guy in charge of an energy trading company, this was basically a trade off. A federal appeals court had already said that the original sentence, 24 years, was too harsh. It should be more like 15 or 16 years.</p><p>Skilling wasn`t willing to settle for that initially. He was going to charge the government committed misconduct in prosecuting the case. That would drag it out for a whole lot longer.</p><p>So, ultimately, the government and Skilling came to this agreement, where Skilling would drop the remaining appeals, $40 million would be returned to the investors, the convictions would stand but he would get out of prison early, basically 14 years. But time out for good behavior, he`ll be out in about 11 or in 2017.</p><p>MATHISEN: Give us a sense, Scott, if you would, of the atmosphere in the courtroom today and how did Skilling look? You`ve been working this story for years.</p><p>COHN: Skilling is 59 years old and he looks every bit of that. He`s grown a beard since he`s been in prison. He looks like he`s aged somewhat. He was in prison garb. In handcuffs initially and then they took them off.</p><p>This courtroom was packed with Skilling supporters. The judge said 250 people had written in support of Jeff Skilling. Among the people in the courtroom, Skilling`s family, his wife Rebecca, members of Ken Lay`s family. Remember, Ken Lay passed away in 2006, shortly after he was convicted, then those convictions wiped out.</p><p>One victim spoke for those who are victimized by this scandal, Dianna Peters, a former Enron employee, who said that Skilling betrayed the employees` trust.</p><p>HERERA: Talk more about that, Scott. What exactly does this mean for Enron`s victims?</p><p>COHN: Well, for one thing, they will get this $20 million held in escrow since the trial in 2006. All of that money will go to the victims.</p><p>Now, that`s pittance in terms of the $60 billion or so that was lost and there have been some big settlements in the order of about $7 billion mainly with some of the banks that were involved. But they will get some money back and that`s something that the Justice Department is emphasizing in all of this, that they didn`t come down that much from what the appeals court wanted. People will get their money back and most important, they say, Skilling will not be able to challenge his convictions.</p><p>MATHISEN: Scott Cohn, an honorary citizen of Houston after all the type you spent down there -- Scott, have a good weekend.</p><p>Good news about jobs to tell you about. Unemployment rates fell in about half in all states in May led by big declines on the jobless rolls in California, West Virginia, New York and Hawaii. California`s unemployment rate is now 8.6 percent, higher than average. But it is at its lowest in five years.</p><p>Overall, North Dakota has the lowest of unemployment, 3.2 percent, and Nevada, the highest at 9.3 percent. The rates rose in 17 states and remained the same in eight more.</p><p>HERERA: And there was also good news, about autos sales, but this time, used auto sales. Car Max, the nation`s biggest used car dealership chain with 120 stores nationwide, reported a 21 percent rise in profits last quarter on a 22 percent jump in sales. Prices on those used cars were also up about 1 percent from a year ago.</p><p>MATHISEN: If you`re flying instead of driving, there may be some relief on board that plane. The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to relax the ban on using some personal electronic devices during taxiing, take-offs and landings and low altitude flying. The ban of making cell phone calls, however, will likely remain in effect but passengers may soon be allowed to use e-readers, tablets and MP3 players without admonishment from airline staff.</p><p>The actor Alec Baldwin who was famously thrown off an American Airlines flight in 2011 for refusing to stop playing the game \"Words with Friends\" on his smartphone during take off tweeted this reaction, \"If you`re flying first class on American Air, I`d still apply an extra measure of restraint.\"</p><p>HERERA: Well, the easing back of those airline rules may have turned the initial public stock offering for Gogo into more of a no-no. Shares of the airline Internet service provider tumbled on their first day of trading today. After pricing last night at $17 a share, Gogo shares closed nearly 6 percent lower, at exactly $16 a piece.</p><p>Another big tech company is on the move. The company that makes smartphones for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Mac Pros for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is making efforts to move manufacturing back to the U.S. It`s called onshoring.</p><p>And Jon Fortt has our story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It`s become an article of faith in America these days, manufacturing jobs that have gone overseas can`t come back. American workers cost too much and don`t have the cutting-edge skills to build the latest gadgets.</p><p>But what if that is wrong? In just the past month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) have both announced products they plan to make here. Apple`s, a high end computer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is designed by brilliant engineers in California and assembled here in the USA.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s a fantastic device we want to get in the hands.</p><p>FORTT: Google`s, a risky new smartphone we haven`t seen yet.</p><p>(on camera): For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it`s a major gamble. If it succeeds, made in America is a major selling point for a cutting-edge phone. If it fails, American dreams and real American jobs are at stake.</p><p>ROBERT REICH, UNIV. OF CA (NASDAQ:CA)., BERKELEY: Certainly, it will boost morale. I mean, I think a lot of people for a long time were kind of economic determinist. They assumed that our jobs, particular our low-skill jobs would go abroad to the lowest waged countries, and that was never wholly the case, but when manufacturing does start coming back, people`s hopes will get up.</p><p>FORTT (voice-over): Flextronics, the contract manufacturer, will be building both Apple`s Mac Pro and Google`s Motorola X phone, both later this year. Why make them in the U.S.? The cost of labor is raising in China and Malaysia, for one.</p><p>And as innovators like Tesla have shown, when there is a brand-new high margin product that needs close attention, sometimes, it`s worth it to have it crafted close to home.</p><p>MIKE MCNAMARA, FLEXTRONICS CEO: We`re seeing a lot of work move into places like Texas where we put up the Moto X factory and as well into North Carolina, South Carolina. These kinds of places, the governments are very aggressive at improving regulation so it`s pro-business and keeping taxes down and really working to stimulate jobs.</p><p>FORTT (on camera): It will probably take years for this story to play out for us to see if tech really can bring American manufacturing jobs back long-term. But this initial chapter is key. If names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can`t succeed at this, chances are the others won`t be about to, either.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, how big American companies are taking advantage of an even bigger trend, urbanization, especially in China. But, first, a look at the best performing stocks of the S&amp;P this week.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Violent protests continue to rock the streets of Brazil`s biggest cities for the second week running. As an estimated 1 million people rallied against the government for raising prices on public service last night, some cities even cancelled the transit fair hikes that set off those demonstrations a week ago. But that didn`t stop the protest. More unrest is expected tonight in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, and other major cities.</p><p>MATHISEN: Two U.S. senators say a Chinese company`s purchase of Smithfield Foods (NYSE:SFD) is quote difficult to square, but the Chinese`s government`s restrictions on U.S. pork and beef exports. Senators Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and a Republican, say the interest of U.S. farmers and ranchers must be protected, calling for a full review of Shuanghui group`s planned acquisition of Smithfield. That`s the world`s largest pork producer.</p><p>HERERA: And in China, the government is pushing ahead with a sweeping plan to move millions of rural residents into more populated areas and this growth and urbanization has not gone unnoticed by some of America`s biggest companies.</p><p>Eunice Yoon reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): All over the world, people are heading to the cities. Nowhere of that more true than in China. By 2030, one in eight people on the planet will live in a Chinese city.</p><p>That`s good for companies like Honeywell.</p><p>STEPHEN SHANG, HONEYWELL CHINA CEO: The wealth of these people is increasing at a tremendous peak.</p><p>YOON: Honeywell is betting big on China`s plans to build up its cities. The American industrial giant has opened up new factories like this one in a midwestern city of Chongqing, expecting its urbanization expertise in the U.S. and Europe to translate here.</p><p>SHANG: Urbanization is really, if you look at it, it`s a building of the mega, mega movement and not in one location but all across China, new towns, new subways, new trains, new planes, new hospitals and they are all in the Honeywell scope.</p><p>YOON (on camera): If China wasn`t urbanizing at this fast a pace, would your growth be as strong?</p><p>SHANG: Of course not.</p><p>YOON (voice-over): Honeywell is making and selling brake pads here. It`s targeting sales growth about double the country`s growth rate, which is currently above 7 percent.</p><p>To build it cities, China needs everything, Australian iron for steel beams to American bulldozers.</p><p>(on camera): At shopping plazas like this one, you can see all sorts of international brands, with more and more for Chinese moving into the city, companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), H&amp;M, and Gucci can make more consumers here than ever before.</p><p>SHANG: They create jobs for us in China, but also create jobs for U.S. Many of this product know-how (ph) is in the foreign countries. As in the process of localization, you actually create for jobs for these foreign countries, whether it`s the U.S., Germany or U.K. So everybody benefits.</p><p>YOON (voice-over): Welcomed news with economy so weak back at home.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And tonight in \"Market Focus\", some bargain hunting on the day after the big Dow dipper.</p><p>Bristol-Myers gaining back most of its Thursday`s loss as investors cheered FDA labeling approval for leukemia treatment. Shares of Bristol- Myers up 2.5 percent on above average volume. It closed at $45.73.</p><p>DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) meanwhile, touching a new five-year high as it abandoned its efforts to acquire Sprint. DISH took on more than $2.6 billion in debt and interest to finance the Sprint deal. They`re not going to be spending it now. That didn`t matter to the market today as DISH network gained more than 3 percent to close at $41.40. DISH up 7 percent since it lost that Sprint bid back in April.</p><p>HERERA: Archer Daniels Midland gained after saying that it`s in talks to sell its coco business, about 4 percent of its overall sales. ADM shares were up almost 1 1/2 percent, closing at $33.09.</p><p>And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also gained today on an upgrade to buy from neutral over at UBS. And some astonishing stats on Instagram video. One year of video was uploaded in the first eight hours. In other words, it would take a year to watch all of those videos and remember, they are only 15 seconds long.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) acquired Instagram in September of 2012. And in today`s trade, shares tacked on 2 1/2 percent, closing at $24.53.</p><p>MATHISEN: And time now to turn our attention to this week`s market monitor guest who says she is positive on equities both over the short and the long-term. She`s Judy Saryan, portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance.</p><p>Judy, welcome. What a week, great week to have you here with us.</p><p>Explain why you think this is not just -- not a fatally wounded bull market.</p><p>JUDY SARYAN, EATON VANCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Well, I`m very happy to be here, Tyler.</p><p>I think that the move by the Fed and the comments by Bernanke indicate that the economy is growing. It`s not growing too rapidly. It`s not growing too slowly. It`s just right.</p><p>And I think that is really the key underpin of the market.</p><p>So, we`re very positive about the market, both near term and long term. The Fed is basically on the track that they set. There is really nothing new in what they said.</p><p>HERERA: Judy, though, we did see a lot of volatility this week and we`ve seen interest rates move quite a bit higher than they were a couple weeks ago. Does that worry you at all? I mean, it`s good for savers certainly. But does it worry you about the market`s ability to move forward in the market?</p><p>SARYAN: The interest level has moved up. It was pretty dramatic in the last couple weeks. But at this current level, the 10-year Treasury 2.5 percent, that`s still a very reasonable interest rate. I believe the economy can grow with that rate. It`s not a problem for the housing market.</p><p>And, of course, the housing market is key for the growth in the economy but housing is still extremely affordable at record rates in terms of affordability. It would take rates going much higher before we saw that, you know, really affect or impact the housing market.</p><p>MATHISEN: I think our viewers have their pencils ready, Judy, for a couple of your stocks picks. And a couple of stocks on your list this week are banks -- one big, one somewhat smaller. Let`s start with the big one, which is Citigroup (NYSE:C).</p><p>SARYAN: OK. Well, at Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance, where you focus on fundamentals and the fundamentals are very positive for Citigroup (NYSE:C). There are several positive factors favoring Citigroup (NYSE:C). There`s an improvement in the capital market`s activity.</p><p>Also, Citigroup (NYSE:C) benefits from the real estate market. In fact, they are going to be releasing $8.5 billion in reserves from the North American Mortgage business. So that will be a strong tail wind to earnings looking out this year.</p><p>On top of that, the evaluation is very attractive. The stock is selling at 63 percent of book, a low P/E ratio and I think the stock could get up to book value.</p><p>HERERA: I would assume housing would help the next pick, which is Regions.</p><p>SARYAN: Absolutely. Regions Financial is a regional bank. About 55 percent of their portfolio is in loans so they benefit from the real estate market. They are selling at a very attractive valuation. They have a reasonable yield and we`re expecting dividend growth out of Regions as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s see if we can squeeze in two more very quickly, 15 seconds for each. One is Sanofi and the other is Phillips 66.</p><p>SARYAN: OK. On Sanofi, it`s a French-based company. Great pharmaceutical company. Very strong position in the diabetes market place. They`ve got one of the strong insulin drugs and that business is doing very well. They`ve also got some very strong positions in the vaccine business.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Phillips.</p><p>SARYAN: And on Phillips, they are -- became independent about a year ago from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Strong free cash flow, over $4 billion we project this year and potential to grow that dividend at a very nice clip, very inexpensive stock, selling at a 7 multiple on P/E. Great stuff.</p><p>MATHISEN: I assume, Judy, that your funds own all of these companies or your business does. Any other disclosures?</p><p>SARYAN: No, that would be the primary disclosure.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Judy, thank you very much. Judy Saryan is portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance.</p><p>And still ahead, after falling, excuse me, to the bottom of the pizza food chain, we`ll show you how Domino`s turned things around and delivered for shareholders.</p><p>But, first, a look at some of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P this week.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is raising its prices. The java giant plans to jack up prices on some of its drinks but only by an average of 1 percent. For some markets, the company say it will be the first price hike in about two years.</p><p>Even though coffee bean prices have been dropping, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) blames the increase on higher rents, labor costs and raising prices milk and sugar.</p><p>HERERA: And those rising material costs and changing consumer tastes are some of the biggest challenges for eateries. And there is one chain that`s worked very hard to figure out what its customers want and has succeeded, delivering for both diners and investors.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has the latest in NBR series on \"Comeback Companies\" with a look at pizza giant, Domino`s.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDNT (voice-over): In 2009, Domino`s ranked at the bottom of a consumer survey on pizza taste preferences, tied with Chuck E. Cheese`s -- particularly galling for the company that virtually invented the pizza delivery chain business.</p><p>The situation was desperate.</p><p>PATRICK DOYLE, DOMINO`S PIZZA PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: The combination of poor results for a couple of years in our domestic business and then, you know, some surveys coming out that were not particularly kind to us and the quality of our pizza, it sent us into a room one day. We made the decision that it was time to really fix this.</p><p>DEANGELIS: But, now, four years later, Domino`s is at the top of the latest rankings and people love their pizza.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Their food is really delicious. It`s really savoring. It really feels in your taste buds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Domino`s is a good place to come because it`s cheap and you get a lot of food for like money and have a lot of good deals.</p><p>DEANGELIS: How did Domino`s do it? First, they fixed the pizza.</p><p>DOYLE: Brought the team in and said, look, everything is on the table. You can chance anything and we just simply want to have the best pizza out there.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Then they stream lined business, adding online ordering for convenience and to drive sales.</p><p>DOYLE: Digital orders have been growing about 5 percent a year as a mix of our total sales. So we`re now in the 35 percent to 45 percent range. Customer satisfaction is higher, order accuracy is higher. The ticket on those orders is a little bit higher. The labor cost is slightly little lower. So everything is better.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Those who invested in Domino`s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) has seen a sweet return, after hitting a low of $3.30 a share in November of 2008, the stock has run up nearly 1,800 percent.</p><p>The turnaround has been good for investors and also employees.</p><p>DOYLE: Over 90 percent of our franchises in the U.S. started as hourly workers in our stores, either as delivery drivers or customer service representatives. They worked their way up through -- to become a manager and then bought their first store.</p><p>DEANGELIS (on camera): But there are challenges ahead for Domino`s: one is growing the international business, especially in China, to keep up with the competition.</p><p>STEPHEN ANDERSON, MILLER TABAK SENIOR RESTAUTRANT ANALYST: I think one of the ways that Domino`s can succeed in China is having a broad menu approach or maybe specializing in chicken, which is a very popular fast food staple in China.</p><p>DEANGELIS: So, the stock that has doubled since last year at this time still have room to run?</p><p>ANDERSON: I don`t think it moves much higher right now. I think the challenge that Domino`s faces in the next 12 months. It will be up against a tougher year of comparisons, particularly in the U.S. coming off the introduction of pan pizza very late in the third quarter.</p><p>DEANGELIS: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, an appropriate end of what must inevitably be called a roller costar week on Wall Street and it comes just in time for the start of summer.</p><p>Take a look at the full throttle rollercoaster debuting today at Six Flags Magic Mountain outside Los Angeles.</p><p>I bet, Sue, you grew up going there.</p><p>HERERA: I went to Magic Mountain.</p><p>MATHISEN: It is the world`s tallest and fastest looping roller coaster top speed 70 miles per hour through a 160-foot high loop.</p><p>HERERA: Mercifully, they didn`t have that when I went to Magic Mountain.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera, in for Susie Gharbi. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen have a great weekend, everybody. We`ll see you back here Monday night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

You`re watching NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: Good evening everyone. <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>got the OK from the Senate today; he gets to keep his job. Tom as you know, there was plenty of drama and debate before the vote.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: There sure was Susie and when the dust finally had settled on Capitol Hill, lawmakers did vote 70 to 30 to re-appoint <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>to another four years now as chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>GHARIB: Tom, the controversy over Bernanke`s policies and what they mean for jobs, inflation and the economy won`t go away. He`s still under pressure. As Darren Gersh reports, many politicians will be watching <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>now more closely than ever.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Ben Bernanke`s supporters consider him the indispensable man of the financial crisis. As <person><nameText>Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke </nameText></person>pumped more than $1 trillion into the banking system, hoping to prevent another great depression. Sometime this year <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>is expected to reverse course, raising interest rates and winding down many of the crisis programs he put in place. Rhode Island`s Jack Reed called that a delicate task and a good reason to give <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>a second term.</p><p>SEN. JACK REED, (D) RHODE ISLAND: We need someone that understands these programs and understands them not just theoretically, but literally from trial and error, understanding what worked, what didn`t work, what the consequences are.</p><p>GERSH: One consequence of waiting too long to take that money out of the banking system could be a burst of inflation. New Hampshire`s Judd Gregg said <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won`t let that happen.</p><p>SEN. JUDD GREGG, (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE: As we all know, inflation is the cruelest tax of all. Because it devalues peoples savings and it undermines the productivity of a nation.</p><p>GERSH: Other conservatives argued Bernanke`s low interest rate policies created those very inflation risks. And Kentucky`s Jim Bunning reminded his colleagues of what he sees as the <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>Fed`s lasting legacy.</p><p>SEN. JIM BUNNING, (R) KENTUCKY: A vote for <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>is a vote for bailouts. Chairman <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>has been in the middle of all the financial bailouts during the crisis.</p><p>GERSH: From the left, Democrats pushed the Fed to put Main Street ahead of Wall Street. And Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said it wasn`t just <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>who needed to change course.</p><p>SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, (D) RHODE ISLAND: The leaders of President Obama`s economic team must pivot from the necessary rescue of our major financial institutions to equally, if not more necessary, help to America`s families.</p><p>GERSH: But today`s confirmation vote was partly about reassuring investors on Wall Street. Some of Bernanke`s strongest supporters argued a no vote would undermine confidence just as the economy and financial markets are finding solid footing. Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s take a look at the stories in tonight`s NBR news wheel for you. Tech stocks leading the way lower on Wall Street. Poor outlooks from Qualcomm and Motorola churned up new worries about the economy. At the close, there it is, the Dow Industrials down 115 points, the NASDAQ down 42 and the S&amp;P 500 off nearly 13. All three now are at new lows for the year.</p><p>Results from Microsoft may help set the tone for tomorrow`s trading. The software giant turning in strong fiscal second quarter results with earnings up 60 percent on strong demand for Windows 7. Meanwhile online, amazon.com, huge profits, up 71 percent on robust holiday sales. The company says it`s upbeat about its Kindle e-reader, even with Apple`s iPad launch. We`ll have more specifics on Amazon and Apple coming up in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Something different at Ford, the auto maker says it made money last year. In fact, it`s the first full year profit since 2005. Ford earned almost $3 billion last year, reversing a loss of more than $14 billion in 2008. CEO Alan Mulally expects the profit streak to continue over the next two years, at least before taxes. Driving those profits, sales of Ford`s popular Fusion cars and a turnaround in its finance business. Ford also hopes to take advantage of a competitor`s weakness and win over Toyota buyers. It`s offering $1,000 to customers trading in a late-model Toyota.</p><p>HUDSON: As for Toyota tonight, it is waiting for Federal safety regulators to sign off on the fix for its gas pedal problems. With the recall growing, the auto maker known for quality faces some tough questions. Jeffrey Liker is an engineering professor at the University of Michigan and author of the book \"The Toyota Way.\" Professor, welcome to NBR. Has Toyota lost its way with this six million vehicle recall?</p><p>JEFFREY LIKER, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: I don`t think so. Six million sounds like six million problems, but it`s actually two problems that they`ve been able to identify, a problem with carpets when they are loose and a problem with sticky pedals after a few years that has happened in a relatively small number of cars. So I don`t think you could say that. n my experience looking, visiting their plants, visiting their engineering offices, their quality is actually better than ever. For example, 10 JD Power awards for initial quality, the most of any auto maker last year.</p><p>HUDSON: But this is certainly front and center in most consumers and investors` minds. Is the recall and how Toyota has been handling it here do you think any indication that the culture of quality perhaps is changing on the edges?</p><p>LIKER: I think it`s certainly an indication about the interest of the press and the Internet and how quickly news gets blown up so that you forget it is the pedal and it`s carpet and it becomes the whole company. So I think that gives a very unrealistic impression of what is happening within Toyota.</p><p>HUDSON: But certainly isn`t this representative of what Toyota does, which is build cars and perhaps there is nothing more central to a car other than its gas pedal?</p><p>LIKER: The gas pedal works in almost every case but after a few years it gets sticky. And it feels sort of awkward. So that also happens in every other car in the world in certain cases. It is not unique to Toyota, but they did find that there is a particular material and a little piece of metal that interacts with moisture and one supplier used that particular material and that is generating all the millions of recalls. It is not certainly indicative of quality in the company. It is not really evidence that...</p><p>HUDSON: You`ve studied Toyota for years. You visited plants both in the United States and globally. How prepared do you think the company is to deal with this size of recall, both from the perspective of customers and drivers but as well as shareholders.</p><p>LIKER: Well, actually they are probably more prepared than before the recession. One of the things Toyota did in the recession was to keep all their people employed, train them, solve quality problems in the plant. They launched new vehicles. They move vehicles from plant to plant so they are probably more flexible and more prepared than they have ever been before.</p><p>HUDSON: In 2001 as you know, Toyota set out to become the world`s biggest auto maker. It did succeed. Do you think that appetite for growth played any role in this recall at all? Those questions are being asked now, I imagine.</p><p>LIKER: I know those questions are being asked, again, I think by uninformed people that aren`t realizing this is a supplier and a pedal. And it`s a carpet that if it is not fastened down causes a problem. I don`t know what that tells you about the company, when a company is consistently winning quality awards from JD Power, consistently at the tops of consumer reports.</p><p>HUDSON: With all those --</p><p>LIKER: The measures are getting better every year.</p><p>HUDSON: So with all those awards recognized, why do you think Toyota took the step to actually issue a massive recall as opposed to just deal with these problems as they came in?</p><p>LIKER: If you have a pedal, yeah, if you have a pedal that can stick and you meet with NTSA and you decide a recall --</p><p>HUDSON: NTSA is the National Transportation Safety Administration.</p><p>LIKER: The national, yes, exactly and they meet and they don`t know which of those other cars has that problem. They have no way of knowing. It could be one, it could be 10, it could be 50. So they obviously have to take action. And that`s also the responsible thing to do. But that doesn`t tell you anything about what is going on in their Georgetown, Kentucky plant or the Indiana plant or their engineering office. It is still this one problem that the pedal in one plant that made, in a supplier plant and the designed decision was made 10 years ago.</p><p>HUDSON: We have to leave it there. We appreciate you answering questions.</p><p>LIKER: You have to go back 10 years.</p><p>HUDSON: There we go. Jeffrey Liker along with us, University of Michigan professor, author of \"The Toyota Way.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead, how Toyota is responding to customers on the web. And when it comes to social networking, what your company needs to know about crisis management.</p><p>HUDSON: Continuing just a bit with Toyota, it is in tonight`s \"Market Focus.\" With the recall expanding, the company that makes the gas pedal assemblies the professor referred to at the heart of this problem says don`t blame it. That didn`t necessarily help the shares of the company. CTS (CTS), we talked about it last night, again here, after staging a bit of a recovery on Wednesday, today another tough day as you can see, usually about 100,000 CTS shares trade hands. Today more than a million and a half traded and the company said Toyota (TM) is responsible for the bad pedal design, not it. Meantime, CTS says it`s adding extra shifts at three of its factories to make replacement parts. And the company says none of the pedals it sends to Toyota are used by other auto makers. Competing supplier Denso already is Toyota`s biggest parts maker. A spokeswoman tells NBR their Toyota pedals are made in Japan and that it will support Toyota as much as possible, but she would not be specific.</p><p>Earlier we did mention today`s big tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN). Let`s take a look at some of the details here. To get the $0.74 a share profit last quarter that you see from Microsoft, it added in deferred revenue. This all relates to the October release of its Windows 7. It sold the software to computer makers two quarters ago before the software was officially released. Those sales are now included in this quarterly report. After hours, Microsoft stock up about $0.40 after dropping almost 2 percent on double normal volume.</p><p>Amazon shares certainly catching a bit after the close, up $3 at one point, hitting close to $130 a share, up almost $3 ahead of these results. Santa very kind to amazon.com, a big blow away quarter here. It`s not expected to stop. The company predicts sales to be at least 32 percent higher this quarter. Barclays thinks that Amazon`s Kindle will remain hot even with the new iPad from Apple.</p><p>Some of the big movers in the world of mobile phones are moving in different directions. On the downside, Qualcomm (QCOM) after lowering its sales forecast, the stock dropping 14 percent, very active, almost 10 times volume. Motorola (MOT) stock meantime hitting fresh six month lows tonight. The fourth quarter profit not enough to impress buyers because a warning came. Fewer devices from Motorola will be shipped this quarter. The biggest competitor, Nokia (NOK) saw its stock hit three-month highs on six times normal volume. Better than expected results and a bigger slice of the cell phone market helping push shares of Nokia higher.</p><p>Let`s catching up on a couple or rather a trio of the Dow components that did report results today, pushing the market around. Pampers maker P&amp;G, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) did its best to put some green on the board. It was the biggest percentage gainer today, up almost 2 percent for the Dow. Profits beat the Street, thanks in part to price cuts as well as higher priced new products.</p><p>Post-it note maker 3M (MMM) was able to show growing profits, pushed up its prediction for the year, not enough though for the stock. Take a look. The shares wane on the index slipping to an early December low.</p><p>Let me tell you quickly about AT&amp;T (T) shares, down by only $0.06 in the day, this after matching estimates thanks to its wireless business certainly with Apple`s iPhone.</p><p>And a former Dow component turned in a big day of buying. Eastman Kodak (EK), take a look at the stock, 54 million shares, nine times average and at a six-month high, close to a six-month high, its highest price at least since September. Now the Dow Industrials only 120 points above 10,000. Investors here unimpressed with earnings and earnings will continue to be in the \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: More on the Toyota recall, as we know, it`s a big story for the news media. But it`s also a big topic of discussion on social media. Toyota has an active social networking presence on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. It`s answering customer concerns on those sites and on its own web page it has a list of frequently asked questions and answers. This kind of proactive response is exactly what the doctor ordered, according to Scott Gurvey`s guide to social networking. Scott wraps up his series tonight with a look at how businesses should approach these new media platforms.</p><p>SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you think the people around you spend a lot of time on social networking sites, you are probably right. And if you are a business hoping to expand through social networking, digital strategy guru Stephanie Agresta says you should plan on making it a part of your regular routine.</p><p>STEPHANIE AGRESTA, VP DIGITAL STRATEGY, PORTER NOVELLI: As a business, if you`re making the investment to be there, then you need to be there consistently. It`s not something you can jump into, post, let days go by and then post again. Your customers need to know that you are really committed to the medium.</p><p>GURVEY: So, our first take-away tonight is devote time. Nicole Romagnoll spends an hour each day maintaining her pet care company`s Facebook page.</p><p>NICOLE ROMAGNOLL, FETCH! PET CARE OF STATEN ISLAND: It`s not work for me. It`s fun. You`re socializing. It`s exciting when you post a picture of a new client and then you get people commenting underneath about how cute. I look forward to seeing that stuff so when I want a break from my day, I`ll go on to my fan page.</p><p>GURVEY: One thing to be aware of with social networking is a multiplier effect. Columbia Professor Sree Sreenivasan says it`s both a blessing and a curse.</p><p>SREE SREENIVASAN, DIGITAL MEDIA PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIV.: The power of twitter is really in the re-tweet. As in, somebody takes the post you made and then re-tweets it and sends it out. So instead of someone just saying something at the water cooler they`re saying it at the digital water cooler which has this effect of this echo that can make things that are not true seem true and things that are true, they can amplify it in a good way or in a bad way.</p><p>GURVEY: Lev Ekster says knowing how quickly a negative comment about his cupcake company can spread keeps everyone on their toes.</p><p>LEV EKSTER, FOUNDER, CUPCAKESTOP.COM: All it takes is one dissatisfied customer to send a tweet about you to really hurt the business, so that`s why we try so hard. And we know we have this immense exposure on Twitter now with 9,000 people following us, so it`s important to maintain quality and make sure all those 9,000 people are pleased with you.</p><p>GURVEY: Which brings us to our final take-away. Don`t panic. If you get a complaint, social media adviser Jennifer Jacobson says, meet it head on.</p><p>JENNIFER JACOBSON, AUTHOR &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT: It`s probably not that they just don`t like you and want to say bad things about your business. They probably have a legitimate concern. So step back. Sort of take the emotion out of it and really look at what it is they`re saying and address it honestly. Because if you can have that kind of conversation even over Twitter, your other customers that are following you are going to see that and they`re going to see the tact and the skill and the sincerity with which you addressed that person`s complaint or issue. And hopefully they will respect that.</p><p>GURVEY: Our guide to social networking doesn`t end here. There`s more on our web site, NBR on pbs.org and we hope the next chapter in the guide will be written by you. Add your comments and tips for businesses going online to our blog and we`ll keep the dialogue going. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Here`s what we`re watching for tomorrow. We`ll see earnings from Chevron, Fortune Brands, Honeywell and Mattel. And we also get our first look at how the economy did in the final three months of last year. The prediction? Up over 4 percent. And, our Friday \"Market Monitor\" guest says the economic recovery is the real deal. He`s John Dorfman, chairman of Thunderstorm Capital looking for double digit growth in the year 2010.</p><p>GHARIB: Case dismissed against Broadcom founder Henry Nicholas. A Federal judge today threw out drug charges and two civil cases against the former CEO. He had faced the possibility of decades in prison. Last month, Nicholas was cleared of insider trading charges after the judge accused prosecutors of misconduct. Lawyers for the SEC still plan to re- file a lawsuit related to those charges.</p><p>HUDSON: If you`re an at-risk homeowner and want help modifying your mortgage from the government, you`ll have to prove your income up front with recent pay stubs and tax returns. Previously, borrowers could provide their income verbally and supply documentation later. That caused problems because many homeowners never got around to doing it. Out of 900,000 trial modifications, only 7 percent or 66,000 have become permanent. The paperwork change begins June 1st.</p><p>GHARIB: As we said, <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>will be running the Fed for the next four years. But he might not have as much free reign this time around. Some members of Congress want to audit the Fed`s activities. Our commentator tonight thinks that`s a bad idea and he ought to know. He`s Alan Blinder, former vice chair of the Fed and professor of economics at Princeton.</p><p>ALAN BLINDER, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Do you ever get the feeling that this country is over-lawyered? Well, here`s another example. Ron Paul, the libertarian congressman who wants to abolish the Federal Reserve, has long promoted a first step in that direction. The so- called Paul bill would subject the Fed`s monetary policy decisions to GAO audits. Like most economists, I find the idea, well, appalling. But I breathed a sigh of relief when a modified version was appended to the House`s financial reform bill late last year. The Paul-Grayson amendment added what I thought was an important clause. Let me read it to you. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as interference in or dictation of monetary policy to the Federal Reserve System by the Congress or the GAO.</p><p>That sounds like a strong affirmation of the Fed`s independence, right? I certainly read it that way and so did my students. Then I talked to a lawyer. So put on your lawyers glasses and read it again Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as interference and so on. Read literally, the sentence does not instruct Congress to keep its nose out of monetary policy. Instead, it asserts that the proposed law does not interfere with monetary policy even if you think it does. Orwell`s big brother would have been proud. He gave us war is peace, freedom is slavery. Now the House thought police give us interference is not interference. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, could we please fix this? I`m Alan Blinder.</p><p>HUDSON: Finally tonight, when it comes to music, what`s old is now new. Vinyl records once considered obsolete are making a big comeback. Jeff Yastine reports tonight, that`s music to the ears of many fans.</p><p>JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A busy afternoon at Sweat Records. Amid the re-stocking of vegetarian jerky treats, you`ll find other hints of what`s really for sale here. Record adapters? What are those? And along one side of the store, a mother load of vinyl. These are new pressings, not used records. Lauren Reskin presides over this vinyl paradise.</p><p>LAUREN RESKIN OWNER, SWEAT RECORDS: Most people are really surprised when they come in, you guys sell records? We get that from older folks are most surprised and then young kids come in and they`re just like ooh vinyl. It`s neat that the perspectives are kind of changing on that.</p><p>YASTINE: Some of the albums are iconic, reissues of classic Beatles, Beach Boys, Miles Davis. But right alongside those, you`ll find new releases, from bands you`ve likely never heard of, yet. Reskin says vinyl and digital can peacefully co-exist. In many cases, if you buy a vinyl record, you get the digital download for free. And for the iPod generation, those records come with a new appreciation of cover art.</p><p>RESKIN: Like this, on CD it looks like a big jumble of just stuff. But when you blow it up this big, there`s a street scene and some cool graphics and this one comes with a 32-page booklet, liner notes and a comic book and graffiti and downloads. That`s a lot more bang for your buck than just a normal CD.</p><p>YASTINE: Vinyl record sales have soared, nearly tripling to 2.5 million records in the last three years. Not bad for a format long declared dead. And here is one of the few places where vinyl records are still made. Linford Ellis is one of the few engineers who still knows how to turn raw vinyl into music. There are only a dozen pressing plants still operating in the U.S., half of what existed 20 years ago.</p><p>LINFORD ELLIS, PLANT MANAGER, ALPHA MUSIC MFG.: And most of those people now, they can`t do this job anymore. They`ve forgotten what they`ve learned, so the few people around, the few pressing plants that are around, are still going. We`re like gold dust.</p><p>YASTINE: To give you a sense of how much the vinyl record business has taken off, this machine pumps out about 800 vinyl records a day. This is actually a 45 but with a small hole. But now they have a second machine, this one here. It`s also pumping out 800 records as well. Business is so good these days that Alpha is bringing in a third, a fourth and a fifth machine. But these machines are so old that they`re having to scrounge for parts to get them up and running again. That`s a good problem to have, if you`re Jeffrey Collins, CEO of Alpha Music Manufacturing. He`s as surprised as anyone about vinyl`s resurgence.</p><p>JEFFREY COLLINS, CEO, ALPHA MUSIC MFG.: It`s exciting. I didn`t think that vinyl was going to continue and last as long as it did. I don`t think vinyl will ever die.</p><p>YASTINE: Not everyone agrees. Some think it`s a fad or a love of all things retro. Then again, back at Sweat Records...</p><p>RESKIN: In the first year we were around, we expanded our vinyl immensely. And in that first year is when I realized we`re going to sell more vinyl than I anticipated.</p><p>YASTINE: That was five years ago. And vinyl, like Reskin`s store is still going strong. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Miami.</p><p>HUDSON: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, January 28. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night to everybody and good night to you too, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: See you tomorrow Tom. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night everyone, hope to see all of you again tomorrow night right here.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

I'm Tom  Hudson.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Hi, Tom.  It's great to  be here.  Good evening everyone.  I'm Susie Gharib.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) says it will bring some computer  production back to the United States, but why has the stock dropped more  than 20 percent this fall?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  The fiscal cliff moves to the kitchen table.  President Obama  visits a Virginia family and tells them how the cliff could impact their  budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  And a very special conversation tonight with Paul Kangas.   NBR's founding co-anchor joins us to answer your questions.</p><p>GHARIB:  We have that and more right here tonight on NBR.</p><p>HUDSON:  Millions and millions of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers  from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) brag they were designed in California, but admit  they were built in China.  Next year, some of those Macs will be built in  the U.S. too.  CEO Tim Cook made the pledge to return to U.S. manufacturing  in two media interviews.  It marks a return for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which  transferred most of its technology building to Asia more than a decade ago.   It's more of a symbolic move though than a big financial investment.  After  all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) spends more than $9 billion a year on  manufacturing and the U.S. commitment is expected to be about $100 million  or 1 percent of its global factory investments.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't  say where in the U.S. the line of Mac computers would be built or how many  jobs might be included.  Now the return of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to U.S.  manufacturing comes as shareholders have experienced a very rocky ride in  the past few months.  The stock is down 22 percent from its all-time high  in September.  Suzanne Pratt reports.    </p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   A peak inside  this Manhattan Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and it looks like everything is a- OK, plenty of customers, plenty of purchases.  So why has the shine come  off Apple's shares?  Within a word, actually two, profit-taking.  </p><p>BRIAN COSTELLO, SR. EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:   I think the biggest  reason for the selling going back to when it was priced $700 in September  has been pure profit-taking.  If you look from the beginning of the year to  September, the stock was up 74 percent.  So I think you had some natural  profit-taking.  </p><p>PRATT:  But this isn't ordinary year-end selling by institutions  looking to record nice numbers.  This supposedly is fiscal cliff related  selling as shareholders worry that capital gains tax rates will be higher  next year.  Still, financial planner Sharon Appelman says selling stock  solely for tax reasons isn't the best idea.  </p><p>SHARON APPELMAN, FINANCIAL PLANNER:  I definitely think it's a  legitimate concern and can be an opportunity.  And I would say if somebody  was interested in reducing a position anyway, that can certainly be a great  time to do it.  You know, why pay higher taxes in a few months time when  you can pay a lower tax now?  </p><p>PRATT:  And some analysts say, before unloading the shares, consider  that fundamentals for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven't really changed.  Sure,  revenue growth may slow and there are worries the tech giant will have  trouble fending off competition from increasingly popular Android products.   But to some analysts, the shares look especially cheap today, especially  considering their move south since the September high.  </p><p>COSTELLO:  We think the smart phone trend is still in the early to  middle innings.  It is not in the late innings yet.  So we think, to the  extent that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can maintain its share of the premium smart  phone market, we think they'll do quite well.  You throw the iPad on top of  it and how it's cannibalizing PCs, that's another great growth driver.  </p><p>PRATT:  It is worth noting that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are still  up more than 30 percent this year.  Even with more tax-related selling, it  will be tough to erase all of those profits in the next few weeks.  Suzanne  Pratt, NBR, New York.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose more than 1.5 percent today  and that gave a boost to stocks.  Also better than expected job news  encouraged investors.  New claims for jobless benefits fell by 25,000 in  the week ending December 1 to a lower than expected 370,000 requests and  that could be a good sign for the November jobs report that comes out  tomorrow and we'll have more on that in just a moment.   Separately,  American companies announced 57,000 job cuts in November.  That's accord to  employment firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, says that's 20 percent  higher from October's levels.  On Wall Street today, the Dow rose 39  points, the NASDAQ added 15, the S&amp;P up nearly five.  </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Erika Miller  in New York.  Coming up tonight, we'll talk to the CEO of kitchen store Sur  la Table and get his outlook for holiday sales.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Lots of theatrics today, but few visible signs of progress in  Washington towards a fix for the fiscal cliff.  The only hopeful sign is  that Republicans and Democrats are talking privately again.  There remains  a lot of work ahead certainly including what to do about the nation's debt  limit.  Washington will hit its borrowing limit early next year.  Darren  Gersh has the latest.  </p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Sitting around  the kitchen table with a middle class family in Virginia, the president  once again pressed for Congress to avoid the fiscal cliff.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If this family has a  couple of thousand dollars less to spend, that translates into $200 billion  of less consumer spending next year.  And that's bad for businesses, large  and small.  </p><p>GERSH:  Behind the scenes, the two sides are talking again.  But there  was no progress in public.  Senators today fought over the debt limit and  ended up deadlocked over a bill to allow the president to automatically  increase borrowing.  </p><p>SEN. MITCH McCONNELL, MINORITY  LEADER:  He's shown what he is really  after is assuming unprecedented power to spend taxpayer dollars without any  limit at all.  </p><p>GERSH:  If the debt limit isn't raised, the country can't pay for the  spending Congress has already approved.  And economists say the nation pays  a high price for this kind of brinkmanship.  </p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  Business people  aren't going to engage unless they have clarity with respect to this thing.  </p><p>GERSH:  But few insiders expect to find much clarity from Washington  in the coming weeks.  Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Investors will be searching for more clarity on those fiscal  cliff talks and they will also be studying tomorrow's important jobs  report.  But Josh Feinman says the November numbers won't give an accurate  picture of the labor market.  He's chief economist at DB Advisors.   Hi,  Josh, so you're talking about distortions in that report.  Tell us more.  </p><p>JOSH FEINMAN, CHIEF GLOBAL ECONOMIST, DB ADVISORS:   Yes, hi, Susie.   I think that the hurricane Sandy may distort the numbers.  We've seen it in  some of the other high frequency data in the last couple of weeks.  Keep in  mind tomorrow's labor market report will report on a snapshot of the labor  market that was taken in the middle of last month.  And that's when the  hurricane and its aftermath were having their effects.  </p><p>GHARIB:   So the consensus numbers from a survey of economists,  they're expecting American businesses added 110,000 jobs to their payroll.   Their unemployment rate staying around 7.9 percent.  Does that sit right  with you? Is that what you are seeing?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Probably somewhere around that, maybe a little less.  One of  the problems is it is hard to gauge exactly what the impact of the storm  will have.  We know it's transitory but it's hard to say exactly how much  numerically it will subtract.  The thing is, if the number comes in lower  than that I think a lot of people will say oh, it was probably the effect  of the hurricane and they'll wait until the following month to see what  kind of a rebound we get.  </p><p>GHARIB:   Let's talk a little bit about what we can expect from the  job market going forward.  I don't know if you saw Alan Blinder's op/ed  piece in \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  The former Fed governor saying that if  we go over the fiscal cliff, the unemployment rate will jump to 11 percent  because we'll be a recession and customarily when you are in a recession,  the unemployment rate goes up 3 percentage points.  Does that sound right  to you?  And if that is the case, what does this mean for consumers and for  businesses?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Well, it would be seriously bad news.  But I think what is  important is not just whether we go over the cliff but how long we stay  over there.  I mean if it turns out that they need a couple more days to  hammer out an accord, I don't think that's going to have a big lasting  effect.  But if we go over the cliff and all those spending cuts and all  those tax hikes go into effect and stay in effect for the whole year, then  you would be talking about a very high likelihood of a recession and a  rising unemployment, a substantial rise, we can quibble about how much.   But it would be seriously bad news for consumers and businesses.  </p><p>GHARIB:   As you know Josh, the Federal Reserve is going to be meeting  next week on Tuesday.  Certainly this is all going to be a topic around the  table.  Is there a role for the Federal Reserve in this fiscal cliff back  and forth?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  There really isn't a direct role that they can play.  This  is fiscal policy.  The Fed does not make fiscal policy. It makes monetary  policy.  I think Chairman Bernanke and others have been very clear to stay  out of the battle that has to be resolved by the Congress and the  administration.  Look, I think at the end of the day, they are going to  reach some sort of an accord to avert the most draconian aspects of the  fiscal cliff.  Maybe the 11th, or 12th or maybe even the 13th hour, but I  think they are going to reach that because I think they recognize that the  consequences of not doing so are so severe.  </p><p>GHARIB:   But let's face it, that even if there is a deal, we're  talking about an economy that is going to have to deal with people having  higher taxes and dealing with spending cuts.  What are you projecting for  2013 real quickly?  We have a little time left, for economic growth and  unemployment.  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Sure.  I think the economy is going to be facing some fiscal  drag from the Federal side, but if it is phased in slowly, it's not really  austere and abrupt, I think it can handle it because I think the private  sector is healing and I'm looking for some improvement in growth by the  second half of the year provided that we don't hit a landmine here on the  fiscal side.  </p><p>GHARIB:   All right, Josh, thanks so much, great talking with you.   We've been speaking with Josh Feinman of DB Advisors. </p><p>HUDSON:  Nearly a month and a half after super storm Sandy wreaked  havoc along the New Jersey shore, President Obama met today with Governor  Chris Christie at the White House.  The topic was Federal aid for storm  recovery.  The president is expected to ask Congress for about $50 billion  in additional emergency help.  Ruben Ramirez is in Seaside Heights, New  Jersey tonight, where business owners are still trying to recover.  Ruben?  </p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks, Tom.   Yes, nearly six weeks after super storm Sandy devastated this barrier  island off the coast of New Jersey, there's still a curfew in place.  A lot  of the traffic you see behind me is a lot of those longtime residents from  the island and business owners who have been going back day in and day out,  trying to recover and repair whatever's left.  Some of those business  owners we had a chance to speak to today.  They say they'll reopen come  next summer.  You've been in business 33 years.  Have you seen this sort of  devastation before?  </p><p>SAM HAMMER, OWNER, CRAB's CLAW INN:  No, nothing like this.  We --  that's the reason we stayed because they were explaining that there was  going to be a terrible storm.  But we, of this magnitude we had no idea.   This is just like -- hard to believe.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  Here we are almost six weeks after the storm hit.  How soon  until you get the business open and up and running again?  </p><p>JIM BOEKHOLT, OWNER, BEN FRANKLIN:  There's a few problems --  electrical and structural.  But hopefully in the next maybe two months, we  might be able to get open again.  But definitely we will be open for the  summer season.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  Tom, some of those small business owners we spoke to say  they didn't have flood insurance because they say the summer season is  short here and the insurance is just too expensive.  Tom.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Thanks, Ruben.  You'll have more from Seaside Heights  tomorrow.  We have more on how insurance companies manage risk when it  comes to natural disasters  Learn about the modeling on our web site,  nbr.com.  Look for that nbr-u tab.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Americans were feeling a little richer recently, thanks to  gains in real estate and the stock market.  The Federal Reserve said today  that household net worth rose to nearly $65 trillion between July and  September.  That's up nearly $2 trillion from the previous quarter.  Net  worth is total assets, like homes and stock portfolios, minus liabilities  like mortgages and credit card debt.  That wealth effect could make  consumers feel more comfortable about shopping this holiday season.  There  are still 20 days to go before Christmas and the rush is on.  Toys are  always popular items of course, but there's one category that's expected to  do even better and no, it's not electronics.  Erika Miller reports.    </p><p>MILLER:  For many families, the holidays are all about the home.  Few  retailers know that better than Sur la Table, a 104-store chain selling  kitchenware and tabletop items.  CEO Jack Schwefel says sales are off to a  strong start, and credits changing American values.  </p><p>JACK SCHWEFEL, PRES &amp; CEO, SUR LA TABLE:  I think Americans are  realizing the importance of the family meal, where people get together.  No  matter how crazy the day is, you can have that moment every day where it  becomes the most important moment of the day and you share it with the  people you love the most.  </p><p>MILLER:  Unlike many retailers, Sur la Table says it hasn't had a  problem with showrooming this holiday season.  That's when people come in  to browse, but purchase cheaper versions online.  Part of the reason is  that 40 percent of the store's products are exclusive.  </p><p>SCHWEFEL:  One of the things that we are most proud of is the fact  that we still import more product from Europe than we do from China.  So  you are talking about artisan product, product that has a story to it,  that's special.  You just don't see that in retailing in America.  </p><p>MILLER:  Stores like Sur la Table are expected to be one of the few  bright spots in an otherwise lackluster holiday season.  In fact, some  analyst think home goods will be hotter than toys this holiday year.  IBM  projects home goods will see the strongest sales growth this year, up over  6 percent.  That's far more than toys and electronics.  </p><p>JILL PUFERI, GLOBAL RETAIL LEADER, IBM:  You might ask yourself, why  home, right?  And we think home is up because of a lot of things -- things  like the changing demographic of the home itself.  There's one stat that  says 41 percent of those between 25 and 29 are living back at home.  </p><p>MILLER:  But there also a second reason.  </p><p>PUFERI:  We think that this holiday people are buying what they need  versus what they want.  </p><p>MILLER:  Which had me wondering what's on Jack Schwefel's wish list  this holiday season.  It wasn't this $5,500 coffee maker.  </p><p>SCHWEFEL:  There are some new knives in our store that I'm actually  pretty excited about, so probably those.  They're cutting board material is  actually used in the handle of the knives.  </p><p>MILLER:  And there's no denying it will look good sur la table during  the holidays.  Erika Miller, NBR, New York.  </p><p>GHARIB:  I know what's on your wish list.  A lot of people are buying  new housewares. You love cooking.  </p><p>HUDSON:  I do love cooking.  Listen I think is great that the house  goods category is seeing some good growth here.  It says that there is a  lot of confidence in the housing market number one.  But let's face it,  just because it's home goods doesn't mean it's cheap Susie or inexpensive.   A $5500 coffeemaker, some of these home appliance blenders can be $500.  </p><p>GHARIB:  If you are looking for discounts Tom, now there is green  Monday.  We have black Friday.  We've had cyber Monday. Green Monday is the  second Monday in December and that's when there is a lots of discounts  online.  So it will be good for consumers.  </p><p>HUDSON:  We've been talking a lot about the fiscal cliff, but I think  there is the holiday cliff almost every year which is that game of chicken  between stores.  Are they going have to discount as we get closer to the  holidays or are consumers, shoppers going to spend the money that the  stores are asking for right now?  Clearly another indication that stores  perhaps may be getting a little bit nervous now.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Speaking of green, there was some green on Wall Street today.  </p><p>HUDSON:  There was some buying on Wall Street.  Let's take a look at  our \"Market Focus\" here Susie and we saw some better than expected data on  first-time unemployment claims leading to a bit of a choppy start for the  S&amp;P 500.  After Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) went positive in the 10:00 a.m. Eastern  time hour, so did the index.  Tech stocks turned solidly higher, so did the  market, finishing up a third of a percent.  Trading volume still moderate,  616 million shares on the big board, just over 1.7 trading on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>It was the tech sector that led the way, up 0.8 of a percent.   Consumer discretionary sector added 0.6 of 1 percent on the session.  Now  the big tech names in the Dow industrials weren't left out in the rally.   Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had the biggest percentage gains of the Dow 30 stocks.   Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) up 1.6 percent.  The CEO said the company  could manufacture semiconductors for other chip makers quote, for the right  types of products, end quote.  So, queue the rumors today that hint about  maybe Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) possibly making chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>How about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems moving up 1.4 percent.  The move  takes Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to its highest price since September.  The top  tech sector stock was Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM).  It helps speed up  and manage online content and traffic.  A new partnership announced today  with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) led to the rally.  Shares jumping 10 percent on heavy  volume.  Analysts say the deal turns AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) from a competitor to  Akamai's customer, eliminating rival business for Akamai.  </p><p>On the consumer side, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) red hot.  The company  said it will pay more taxes in Britain in the next two years.  Yesterday,  it also announced plans to open at least 1,500 new stores in the U.S. over  the next five years.  Shares of SBUX jumping 5.7 percent.  Volume tripled  today with the stock closing tonight at five-month highs.  </p><p>How about tax prep giant H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB)?  It sits at a new 52- week high tonight.  It lost less money than feared last quarter.  That was  seen as good news.  H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) has been cutting costs to focus on  its core tax preparation business, especially drilling down to the digital  tax prep business.  </p><p>Even satellite radio operator Sirius/XM radio can't resist returning  some cash to shareholders this season.  It announced a one-time dividend of  a nickel per share and a $2 billion stock buyback plan.  Sirius shares are  consistently among the most actively traded issues on the NASDAQ.  Volume  was very heavy as you'd expect today.  The stock didn't move a whole lot  though, up just $0.02.  But there was a bigger stock move in Liberty Media  Capital.  Why Liberty Media?  Well, it's the biggest shareholder of  Sirius/XM stock. It stands to get $160 million thanks to the special  dividend.  </p><p>Online social gaming company Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has struggled to  repeat the success of its Farmville game.  It's going after a gaming  license now in Nevada.  Don't look it on the strip though.  It wants  customers to use real money, bet real money on Internet poker.  Shares  rallying 7.1 percent, volume doubled.  Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) has lost more  than 70 percent of its value since becoming a publicly traded company.  </p><p>All of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were  higher with the emerging markets fund up the most, up 0.8 of a percent.   And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>GHARIB:  And also with some market news, one of the hedge funds  embroiled in the FBI's crackdown on insider trading is closing its doors.   Diamondback Capital Management is shutting down and that's after clients  pulled more than half a billion dollars from the fund.  Federal agents  raided the Connecticut firm two years ago as part of a nation-wide sweep  that resulted in the arrest of one of the firm's former portfolio managers  on insider trading charges.  Since then, Diamondback's assets have dwindled  to just over $1.5 billion, down from $5 billion.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Our viewers have been waiting and he's finally here.  Paul  Kangas, NBR co-founding anchor.  Welcome home, it's so nice to have you  back here.  </p><p>PAUL KANGAS, NBR CO-FOUNDING ANCHOR:   Well, it is like home and it's  great to hear that I'm still welcome.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Actually, speaking of welcome.  We got -- Tom and I got so  many viewer questions for you and comments saying that they want to hear  from the Walter Cronkite of financial news.  A little bit of your wisdom in  these confusing time, right, Tom.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Absolutely there is so much going on in the market and you've  seen so much market cycles.  We got a lot to talk about, but what we have  got to ask ,what do you make of the stock market today?  </p><p>KANGAS:  It's sort of a stop and go affair.  We get good news one day,  better building permits and building news and on that front.  And inflation  is down a little bit.  And then the next day it's all countered by new  uprisings in Egypt and one thing or another.  So the market tries to step  higher and is countered by bad news.  So stop and go all the way.  </p><p>HUDSON:  We got a great question from Eric P. Edson.  You saw the Dow  Industrials move from 1,000 to over 10,000 in your career.  He asks, will  the Dow Jones see 8,000 or 18,000 first?  </p><p>KANGAS:  Well, there's not that much volatility but it could see both  in the same year.  But I intend, I'm actually a little on the bullish bias  because corporations continue to make money and the American people are  basically optimistic.  And a lot of stocks are under priced, particularly  blue chips even though the Dow Industrial Average has more than doubled  since 2009.  But there's a reason for that and that's good earnings and  that's good dividends.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, there's a lot of questions about if that is going to  continue.  And one of our viewers has a question for you about the fiscal  cliff.  You know all about the back and forth and the drama about the  fiscal cliff and Delores Kile wants your thoughts on where do you stand on  this whole fiscal cliff?  How can it play out?  </p><p>KANGAS:   Congress better get off its duff and do something.  And I  think that finally the pressure is going to be enough (ph).  But they  always do it right to the last, you know, minute.  But I think it's got to  happen or they're going to be ousted from their hallowed political seats.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You could argue in the three years you've been away from the  NBR anchor desk Congress hasn't done a whole heck of a lot to address the  fiscal situation.  </p><p>KANGAS:   No it's just ridiculous.  I mean these are our elected  representatives and they have got to pay a little more attention to those  that got them in the office.  And they're arguing amongst themselves  without much care about the people they represent.  </p><p>HUDSON:  A lot of those folks are retirees, we do have a question  about retirement from Anita asking what is the investing or financial  planning lesson Paul uses most during retirement?  </p><p>KANGAS:   Well, the number one is hope I can live my life to the last  and still have enough capital to keep me going.  And a lot of investors are  running up against the same thing.  They're running out of capital because  yields are so low in the bond market; money markets are yielding  practically nothing.  So they have to chip into their base capital and  that's hurtful.  So what I am doing is looking for blue chip stocks with  decent dividends.  </p><p>GHARIB:  A lot of people are wondering that in this climate, what do  you think is going to be the new investment opportunity available to all of  us in 2013?  That's a question from Fay.  </p><p>KANGAS:  New investment opportunity.  </p><p>GHARIB:  What is your prediction?  </p><p>KANGAS:  They'll come up with something new just like ETF exchange- traded funds were relatively new a few years ago and now have gained such  popularity it is almost, it's staggering how much money has gone into ETFs.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You mentioned how volatility could have the Dow see 8,000 and  18,000, maybe in the same year.  Frank sent us a tweet on Twitter asking  individual investors are afraid of the markets.  What needs to be done to  gain their confidence?  </p><p>KANGAS:   Less regulation.  I think that investors are afraid that  they make an investment and something comes along, the rules change from  what got them into the investment in the first place.  Well you can't  change, you know, canoes in the middle of a stream.  </p><p>GHARIB:  On this whole subject of investor confidence, we do have a  question from Billy who says what's the greatest changes that you've seen  in the market today?  You've had some perspective three years being away  from it on a day-to-day basis.  What do you see as the biggest change?  </p><p>KANGAS:  Well, Billy, I'll tell you that the computer is a wonderful  thing, but it's not the greatest thing for investing.  And for investors  who don't have a high speed capability and have large box of stock at their  arm's length.  I think that that is -- it's taken away the idea that long- term, long-term investing is a good thing.  I think that's one of the  changes that I don't like.  Too much computer meddling.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Well, Paul, as much as the markets have changed, you haven't.   It's great to see and hear from you again.  Susie, we have to say good  night but I think it's only proper to ask Paul.  </p><p>KANGAS:  I'm Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Tom  Hudson.  Stocks fall on fresh signs that even the Federal Reserve is not  sure how much is enough when it comes to boosting the economy, by buying  government bonds.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Good evening.  I'm  Susie Gharib.  Can two weaklings become strong by teaming up?  That's what  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are hoping for, as they decide to  merge.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  And a bit of a mixed picture on American housing, contractors  break ground on more single family homes, but pull back on building  apartments and condos.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  We have that and more tonight on NBR.  How much longer should  the Federal Reserve continue to stimulate the economy?  That question was  intensely debated at the central bank's policy meeting in January according  to the minutes that were released today.  Stocks sold off on that news, as  investors worry the Fed might taper off its stimulus program sooner than  expected and before its goal of seeing a big pick up in the job market.  </p><p>Now the Fed has been buying $85 billion of mortgage-backed securities  and Treasuries every month to pump up the economy.  Here's what those Fed  minutes revealed.  Many policymakers voiced concerns about potential costs  and risks from more bond buying.  Others said that the easy money policies  might encourage excessive risk-taking and that could have adverse  consequences for financial stability.  Policymakers also noted positive  developments in the economy, as more businesses are optimistic about the  economic outlook.  But nervousness about the Fed's next moves pulled down  stocks.  On Wall Street the Dow lost 108 points, closing below the critical  14,000 level.  The NASDAQ was down about 50, the S&amp;P lost 19 points.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Before the Federal Reserve's notes on its last meeting were  released this afternoon, we saw a mixed report this morning on the American  housing market.  Construction starts on new homes fell 8.5 percent in  January.  But that drop in the headline number was pulled down by a drop in  apartment and condominium construction.  The number of single family homes  that began going up last month rose 0.8 of a percent up to its highest  level since the great recession.  Darren Gersh digs deeper.  </p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  In housing, one  month does not a trend make.  Analysts shrugged off the news that housing  starts fell last month.  Instead they're looking to encouraging trends on  home prices, rents and overall demand.  </p><p>JED SMITH, MANAGING DIR., NATL ASSN. OF REALTORS:  There are going to  be these squiggles, blips in the market as things happen, just because they  happen from month to month -- snow storms, weather, holidays, whatever, but  right now we are in a recovering market.  </p><p>GERSH:  Homes sales are up more than 10 percent over last year and  builders are picking up the pace.  They are now on track to build around  900,000 homes this year, but by the end of the year, the National  Association of Realtors expects the pace to pick up to an annual rate of  1.1 million starts.  That's great, but keep in mind a normal year for home  construction is closer to 1.8 million.  The outlook for apartments and  other multi-family construction is also good, even though those starts  dropped last month.  Rents rose 4.5 percent last year and researchers at  Zillow expect a similar increase this year.  That's why investors are  pouring into the market and building new apartments.  </p><p>STAN HUMPHRIES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ZILLOW:  Assuming you can buy the  property cheaply or build it cheaply and you can rent it out, then you're  seeing 4.5 percent growth in your top line numbers for what you are able to  rent it out for looks pretty attractive.  </p><p>GERSH:  But the outlook varies depending on where you live and how  strong the job market is in your area.  </p><p>SMITH:  The market will be up a lot more in Texas than it will be in  parts of the east coast.  Of course, on the west coast we've got a bit of a  housing shortage.  Inventory is tightest there.  So I think there we will  continue to see starts and see more starts in the future, simply because  we've got tight inventory.  </p><p>GERSH:  Economists say housing is far from normal but it is now strong  enough that it's once again playing its traditional supporting role for the  economy following a tough recession.  Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Joe Davis joins us now.  He's chief economist at Vanguard.   That's the giant mutual fund company.    Joe, nice to have you with us on  this important day.  Let me start by asking you, do you think the Fed is  taking on too much risk?  </p><p>JOE DAVIS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VANGUARD GROUP:  I think there is an  argument that can be made.  We've had a concern for more than a year that  there are both costs as well as benefits with respect to very aggressive  monetary policy.  And just some of the behavior we've seen in the financial  markets.  I know the earlier report talked about excessive risk taking.  So  I've had a concern that those costs associated with monetary policy may not  have been given the sort of credence they should have been.  So a positive  development in my mind, to today's minutes was that Federal Reserve  policymakers were more aggressively talking about both the pros and cons  with respect to aggressive monetary policy.  </p><p>GHARIB:  One thing that we've been hearing repeatedly from the Federal  Reserve is that they're not going to make any change in this policy,  raising interest rates or anything like that, until the economy is  stronger.  Most notably that the job market picks up, that the unemployment  rate gets to the 6.5 percent level.  So given today's numbers that we've  had on housing and given that we're seeing that gasoline prices are going  up, is the economy really strong enough to even begin talking about raising  interest rates?  </p><p>DAVIS:   I don't know about that, but I think it is important to start  talking about the beginning of the end in terms of how aggressively the  Federal Reserve has purchased certain securities, particularly fixed-income  securities.  And so I think in that regard, I would make the case that the  economy is markedly stronger today than it was just a year or two ago.  You  mentioned housing.  The business sector, consumers are less debt-burdened  than they were two or three years ago.  And so by those measures, I'm hard- pressed to find the reason why six months from now, the Federal Reserve  would have the pedal to the floor of the car so to speak as they have had  for the past two or three years.  </p><p>GHARIB:  What is going to be the time table on this?  To some extent,  we saw with the gold prices today and oil prices that commodities are  already responding to some changes in the marketplace.  But when do you  think that the Fed realistically will be acting on an exit strategy?  </p><p>DAVIS:   I think the exit strategy will be over the next six to 12  months in terms of more vocal conversations and guidance with respect to  the amount and the frequency of their purchases.  I think a later stage is  then contemplation of raising interest rates, raising the Fed funds rate,  which is effectively at zero.  I think there it will be much more important  on the labor market front in terms of job progress.  I think all the other  conditions are in place to see a modest acceleration in job growth, but it  is going to take some time to bring that unemployment rate down, if I'm  correct, that some Americans return to the labor force.  </p><p>GHARIB:  One concern for a lot of people as investors is what do I do  now?  A lot of people started putting money in the market.  I know you're  an economist, but you also are at Vanguard with all of the mutual funds.   What is the view at Vanguard about what investors should be doing right  now, given the uncertainty about this and things going on in Washington?  </p><p>DAVIS:   I think the hardest thing to do but I think what many  investors actually are doing is to actually look through some of these  headlines, to embrace that long-term orientation, look at the balance and  risks and what you're trying to achieve with your portfolio.  And if that  ascertation (ph) of that plan is the same today as it was two, five, 10  years ago, it is really critical to stick with that plan.  I think even  going back three years ago, our message to clients was, listen, the  economic environment may be challenging, but you can still have decent  portfolio returns.  And actually since that time, we've had decent  portfolio returns, both on the equity market as well as in bond portfolios.   So continuing to reaffirm that message and for investors to stay invested  in markets.  Because we are going to have ups and downs as the economy just  muddles through some of this.  </p><p>GHARIB:  A lot more to talk about and we'll continue this  conversation, but we have to wrap it up for now.  Thanks so much, Joe  Davis, chief economist at Vanguard.  </p><p>DAVIS:   Thank you, Susie.  </p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Still ahead,  Martha's in the middle of a courtroom showdown between two major retailers.   What's at stake for the stores and her brand?  </p><p>HUDSON:  There is progress to report tonight from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on  the battery issue plaguing its 787 Dreamliner.  Still the planes remain  grounded this evening.  The aircraft maker may have found a fix for the  plane's battery problems, by making bigger gaps between battery cells,  that's according to Reuters.  Boeing's head of commercial engines is  expected to meet with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration  Friday to present a 10-point plan to prevent battery fires or meltdowns.   Neither Boeing (NYSE:BA) nor the FAA are commenting.  Boeing (NYSE:BA)  shares rose slightly today to close at $74.78 per share.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Two big and struggling office supply companies are teaming  up.  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) is merging with Office Max in a stock deal  valued at more than $1 billion.  A union of the two companies has been  rumored for years, given trouble in the office supply sector.  But  investors didn't buy in to the concept.  Shares of Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  tumbled 16 percent; Office Max fell 7 percent and even rival Staples  (NASDAQ:SPLS) was down today on the news, off 7 percent.  Erika Miller  reports.  </p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you want a  good  read on the economy, it helps to watch demand for office supplies.  When  the economy is booming, businesses need more pens, paper and printers.  But  growth has been weak since the great recession and that has meant less  demand for office products.  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max have  been struggling behind industry leader Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS).  </p><p>LIANG FENG, SPECIALTY RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:  Staples  (NASDAQ:SPLS) is just -- their retail store is about 25-30 percent more  productive than comparable locations.  And they also have much more  attractive business customer mix.  They have the mid-size customers,  compared to Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max which are dependent on  the lower margin large customers.  </p><p>MILLER:  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max hope by merging, they  will be able to save big bucks by closing stores, combining operations,  cutting advertising costs and negotiating better prices from suppliers.   But office supply stores are also facing stiff competition from Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  Those retailers  have lower cost structures which often means lower prices.  What's worse,  the office supply stores are losing their most lucrative customers.  </p><p>FENG:  Your highest margin customers are your small business customers  or somebody who just wants to buy something for the home office.  And what  we've seen is that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are  targeting these higher margin small business customers.  </p><p>MILLER:  Those struggles are reflected in the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  and Office Max stock prices.  Shares of both companies have plunged more  than 70 percent from their highs back in 2006 and 2007, respectively.   Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tried to merge in 1997,  but the deal was blocked by regulators because of fear it would lead to  higher prices.  But most industry experts give this deal a high probability  of going through.  Longer-term, this deal is expected to be good for Office  Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max, but also their biggest competitor.  If  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max close stores, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS)  will face competition.  Erika Miller, NBR, New York.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Combined these two companies have about 2,000 retail stores  in North America.  And as Erika just mentioned, some of those stores are  expected to close, if the deal happens.  That potentially could leave  vacant millions of square feet of commercial real estate.  Brian Jones is a  portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman real estate fund.   He joins us  tonight from the NASDAQ.  Brian, what kind of shape is retail real estate  in as it faces what could be a pretty big consolidation?</p><p>BRIAN JONES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE FUND:   Well, thank you for having me tonight.  I think retail real estate is in a  very good situation right now.  What we've seen over the past two years  have been improving occupancies and in many of the better markets, we're  beginning to see rental rate growth.  This is largely driven by the fact  that there is very little new construction of retail centers going on in  the United States currently.  And thus, any retailers looking to grow have  to find space in the existing centers in order to fund and continue their  growth efforts.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Let's assume that Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are  successful in combining their resources.  Does this square footage,  presumably that would become vacant in the years ahead, actually help  relieve some of the pressure that you're seeing today?  </p><p>JONES:   Well, what we would say is that these two tenants are still  relatively small when compared to the total pie of retail real estate.   When we looked at the REITs in our coverage universe, we found that  combined, Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max were in every case at less  than 2 percent of the rental revenues for the REITs in our coverage  universe.  So together, they're relatively small tenants for the overall  retail REIT universe and the retail space in general.  What it will provide  is the opportunity for some of the retailers that have growth plans to  actually find centers to grow in.  And so we think that over time, a lot of  the stores that are closed will be released to stronger tenants.  And in  many cases, that will end up strengthening the underlying center, where the  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) or the Office Max have gone out.  </p><p>HUDSON:  You mentioned your coverage universe and you did bring along  one kind of outdoor shopping real estate investment trust that you do like  here, Federal reality investment trust, ticker on this one is FRT.  What  make this on stand out in a crowded market?  </p><p>JONES:   One thing I would like to point out is that this highlights  one of the benefits of investing in REITs, as opposed to a single piece of  direct real estate.  Most of the retail REITs in our coverage universe own  dozens, if not hundreds, of retail centers.  So they're generally  diversified by geography or by tenant mix and by product type.  So Federal  realty is an excellent example of a retail REIT that owns high quality  centers in areas that have high population densities and above average  incomes.  And these are the locations where many of the growing retailers,  such as TJ Max and Marshal's, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Rack, Five Guys Burgers,  Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) -- the retailers that are looking to grow are  focused on these higher income, higher density markets.  And this is where  Federal is positioned.  And we think that they are positioned to do well in  the future.  </p><p>HUDSON:  OK.  </p><p>JONES:   Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are not within their  top 25 tenants.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Gotcha.  And that's something you like at this point for FRT.   Do you have a position in the fund in that stock?  </p><p>JONES:   Yes, we do own Federal reality in our mutual funds, the  Neuberger Berman real estate fund.  </p><p>HUDSON:  And you help manage it.  It is Brian Jones along with us  tonight from Neuberger Berman.  Thanks Brian.</p><p>JONES:   Thank you.  </p><p>GHARIB:  It's Macy's (NYSE:M) versus JC Penney in a high stakes fight  over bed linens, cocktail napkins and kitchen tools.  At issue here, who  will be allowed to carry products with Martha Stewart's name on them?   Macy's (NYSE:M) has been selling Stewart's merchandise since 2007.  It  claims it owns the exclusive rights to carry her home furnishings.  But  rival JC Penney argues it has the right to sell other Stewart-branded  products that Macy's (NYSE:M) doesn't carry.  Ruben Ramirez reports.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  Martha's in the middle, as two of the nation's best-known  department stores fight in New York State Supreme Court over just who can  carry the domestic diva's home products.  </p><p>GREG LITTLE, PARTNER, WHITE &amp; CASE:  Two different companies are  looking at the same agreement and are interpreting it different ways.   Macys is interpreting it very broadly; Penney's is interpreting it very  narrowly.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  There's no denying the appeal of carrying Martha Stewart's  brand.  Macy's (NYSE:M) says it has billions of dollars on the line.  </p><p>MICHAEL APPEL, FOUNDER, APPEL &amp; ASSOCIATES:  For Macys, having a  differentiated exclusive brand is critical to their competitive strategy  and they've invested a lot of time and effort in building up the Martha  Stewart brand, giving her exposure in the stores and it's a linchpin of  their home strategy.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  For, JCP, Martha is a key part of its store within a store  turnaround plan.  </p><p>APPEL:  She can appeal to the kind of customer that Penney's has and  the customer whom they want to get which is more I think a little more  upscale than what they have right now.</p><p>RAMIREZ:  Penney's is counting on a clause in Stewart's original  contract with Macy's (NYSE:M), which allowed her to open stand-alone  stores, arguing the clause never said that stand alone shops could not be  inside a bigger store.  If JCP is successful, Appel says it opens up  another retail channel for Stewart's company.  </p><p>APPEL:  The merchandising end of her business is the only part of her  business right now that is growing and is profitable and for her to be able  to increase her distribution is critical to her business strategy.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  The trial got underway in a Manhattan Federal courtroom  today and now that it's begun, attorneys say a settlement could be coming.  </p><p>LITTLE:  There is something about a trial that forces parties to look  at the facts a little bit differently than they do when they're not at  trial and it may well be that they reach a compromise at that point.  </p><p>RAMIREZ:  Martha Stewart, along and the CEOs of both Macy's (NYSE:M)  and JC Penney are expected to take the stand.  The trial is slated to last  about two-and-a-half weeks.  But unlike other courtroom cases which are  decided by a jury, one judge will decide the outcome of this one.  Ruben  Ramirez, NBR, New York.  </p><p>HUDSON:  In the \"Market Focus\" here today, what started out as just  some mild selling picked up this afternoon with some Federal Reserve  officials worrying about how long to keep buying bonds to help the economy.   Here's the daily trade for the S&amp;P 500.  Now the news from the Federal  Reserve came out just after 2:00 Eastern time. That's when the index  starting seeing some selling momentum.  The index finished down by 1.2  percent.  Remember though, it was at a five and a half year high at  yesterday's close.  Trading volume though did pick up, 815 million shares  moving on the big board, two billion traded on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>All 10 of the major stock sectors were lower today.  The materials  sector seeing the biggest loss, down 2.8 percent followed by the selling  that we saw in energy and consumer discretionary sectors.  </p><p>Two gold and copper miners saw the heaviest selling among those  material stocks.  Gold and copper metal prices were down sharply today.   Freeport McMoran falling 6 percent.  This is a two-and-a-half month low for  FCX.  Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) falling 5.5 percent, NEM tonight at a new  52-week low.  AA, aluminum maker Alcoa (NYSE:AA) hit too, falling 3.3  percent.  Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been seeing aluminum prices stabilize.  </p><p>In addition to the drop in new home construction last month, we heard  from home builder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL).  It earned $0.03 per share in  the last quarter, certainly an improvement from the loss a year ago, but  considerably less than estimates.  The company reported that average  selling prices were lower.  Shares were lower as well, falling 9 percent.   The stock has lost 10 percent in less than a week after staging a big rally  over the past year.  Other homebuilder stocks getting hit.  Pulte Group  falling 6.8 percent, DR Horton off by 5.8 percent.  </p><p>Foxconn is not a household name in the U.S., but if you use an Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) computer or many other  dozens of other electronic devices, Foxconn is the Taiwanese company that  assembles it.  Today Foxconn said it has frozen the hiring of assembly line  workers in China after the lunar holiday there.  That fed speculation about  demand for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and HP products.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares  falling 2.2 percent since the plant affected makes iPhone fives, but  Foxconn said its decision is not related to making the iPhone.  An analyst  at investment banking firm UBS thinks it could be instead because of less  demand for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) desktop computers.  HPQ shares down  by 1.1 percent.  HPs quarterly earnings are due tomorrow after the closing  bell, one to watch.  </p><p>Independent energy companies Devon and Anadarko updated their  shareholders on their latest strategies.  Both though were greeted today  with selling.  APC is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), down 4.5 percent.  Its  energy production outlook was less than expected while its forecast for  capital spending was more than anticipated.  Anadarko says it expects to be  among the most active deepwater drillers this year.  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) falling 6.6 percent after saying it may try again to spin off  its pipeline and processing businesses.  It tried that six years ago, but  stopped after the economy weakened.  </p><p>Four of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were  lower on the broad market sell-off.  The S&amp;P 500 volatility note though  jumped 8.6 percent.  It usually moves in the opposite direction of the  broad market as it did today.  And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>GHARIB:  Whether it's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram or Pinterest,  there always seems to be a hot start-up in the tech pipeline.  But as  tonight's commentator explains, the next big tech company might not be as  original as you think.  He's Harry Lin, executive-in-residence at Idealab.  It's a technology incubator in Pasadena, California.  </p><p>HARRY LIN, EXECUTIVE-IN-RESIDENCE, IDEALAB:  An irony in the world of  technology start-ups is that we tend to copy each other a lot.  I call this  ironic because the image of tech start-ups is that they're all about  innovation and risk taking.  Yet, venture capital investors and tech  entrepreneurs all know that for every Instagram that gets launched, there  are at least 10 other start-ups that pretty much are Instagram, just with a  different name.  Did you know that there are at least three well-funded  startups?  I'm talking more than $10 million of investor capital, that  match dog owners with dog sitters?  The number of me-too start-ups goes  crazy when you look at other types of products and services:  project  management software, call ordering food online, music streaming, cloud file  storage and I can't even keep track of all the fashion and clothing sale  sites duking it out on the Internet.  There are scores of them! Even  Pinterest has at least half a dozen straight up clones.  </p><p>So why is an industry that's supposedly about innovation and  disruption so quick to copy itself?  Investors may call their capital  venture, but they're looking for safe bets.  So when something seems to be  working, why not invest in the same thing?  We also know that in some  niches, there's space for several winners, so maybe investing in the me-too  will work out.  The entrepreneurial myth is that we invent new stuff, when,  much of the time, we engineer twists or slants on old stuff.  It's really,  really hard to come up with a brand-new idea that's never been tried.  So  this copy-catting will continue and I'll continue to call it ironic.  I'm  Harry Lin.  </p><p>HUDSON:  Whether copy cats or not, all entrepreneurs certainly face  difficulty at one time or another staying motivated.  Our NBRU partners at  Vanderbilt University have eight steps for staying motivated to reach long- term goals.  Just head to nbr.com and look for that NBRU tab.  </p><p>GHARIB:  And let's take a look at what's coming up tomorrow on NBR.   Ford is hiring.  It's adding jobs at its Cleveland plant that builds the  eco-boost engines.  But it's not alone. We look at job creation in the U.S.  auto industry.  </p><p>HUDSON:  That's it for the broadcast here on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,  Wednesday night, February 20.  Have a great evening, you too Susie.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Same to you Tom.

I'm Tom Hudson. Stocks fall on fresh signs that even the Federal Reserve is not sure how much is enough when it comes to boosting the economy, by buying government bonds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Susie Gharib. Can two weaklings become strong by teaming up? That's what Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are hoping for, as they decide to merge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: And a bit of a mixed picture on American housing, contractors break ground on more single family homes, but pull back on building apartments and condos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: We have that and more tonight on NBR. How much longer should the Federal Reserve continue to stimulate the economy? That question was intensely debated at the central bank's policy meeting in January according to the minutes that were released today. Stocks sold off on that news, as investors worry the Fed might taper off its stimulus program sooner than expected and before its goal of seeing a big pick up in the job market.</p><p>Now the Fed has been buying $85 billion of mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries every month to pump up the economy. Here's what those Fed minutes revealed. Many policymakers voiced concerns about potential costs and risks from more bond buying. Others said that the easy money policies might encourage excessive risk-taking and that could have adverse consequences for financial stability. Policymakers also noted positive developments in the economy, as more businesses are optimistic about the economic outlook. But nervousness about the Fed's next moves pulled down stocks. On Wall Street the Dow lost 108 points, closing below the critical 14,000 level. The NASDAQ was down about 50, the S&amp;P lost 19 points.</p><p>HUDSON: Before the Federal Reserve's notes on its last meeting were released this afternoon, we saw a mixed report this morning on the American housing market. Construction starts on new homes fell 8.5 percent in January. But that drop in the headline number was pulled down by a drop in apartment and condominium construction. The number of single family homes that began going up last month rose 0.8 of a percent up to its highest level since the great recession. Darren Gersh digs deeper.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In housing, one month does not a trend make. Analysts shrugged off the news that housing starts fell last month. Instead they're looking to encouraging trends on home prices, rents and overall demand.</p><p>JED SMITH, MANAGING DIR., NATL ASSN. OF REALTORS: There are going to be these squiggles, blips in the market as things happen, just because they happen from month to month -- snow storms, weather, holidays, whatever, but right now we are in a recovering market.</p><p>GERSH: Homes sales are up more than 10 percent over last year and builders are picking up the pace. They are now on track to build around 900,000 homes this year, but by the end of the year, the National Association of Realtors expects the pace to pick up to an annual rate of 1.1 million starts. That's great, but keep in mind a normal year for home construction is closer to 1.8 million. The outlook for apartments and other multi-family construction is also good, even though those starts dropped last month. Rents rose 4.5 percent last year and researchers at Zillow expect a similar increase this year. That's why investors are pouring into the market and building new apartments.</p><p>STAN HUMPHRIES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ZILLOW: Assuming you can buy the property cheaply or build it cheaply and you can rent it out, then you're seeing 4.5 percent growth in your top line numbers for what you are able to rent it out for looks pretty attractive.</p><p>GERSH: But the outlook varies depending on where you live and how strong the job market is in your area.</p><p>SMITH: The market will be up a lot more in Texas than it will be in parts of the east coast. Of course, on the west coast we've got a bit of a housing shortage. Inventory is tightest there. So I think there we will continue to see starts and see more starts in the future, simply because we've got tight inventory.</p><p>GERSH: Economists say housing is far from normal but it is now strong enough that it's once again playing its traditional supporting role for the economy following a tough recession. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Joe Davis joins us now. He's chief economist at Vanguard. That's the giant mutual fund company. Joe, nice to have you with us on this important day. Let me start by asking you, do you think the Fed is taking on too much risk?</p><p>JOE DAVIS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VANGUARD GROUP: I think there is an argument that can be made. We've had a concern for more than a year that there are both costs as well as benefits with respect to very aggressive monetary policy. And just some of the behavior we've seen in the financial markets. I know the earlier report talked about excessive risk taking. So I've had a concern that those costs associated with monetary policy may not have been given the sort of credence they should have been. So a positive development in my mind, to today's minutes was that Federal Reserve policymakers were more aggressively talking about both the pros and cons with respect to aggressive monetary policy.</p><p>GHARIB: One thing that we've been hearing repeatedly from the Federal Reserve is that they're not going to make any change in this policy, raising interest rates or anything like that, until the economy is stronger. Most notably that the job market picks up, that the unemployment rate gets to the 6.5 percent level. So given today's numbers that we've had on housing and given that we're seeing that gasoline prices are going up, is the economy really strong enough to even begin talking about raising interest rates?</p><p>DAVIS: I don't know about that, but I think it is important to start talking about the beginning of the end in terms of how aggressively the Federal Reserve has purchased certain securities, particularly fixed-income securities. And so I think in that regard, I would make the case that the economy is markedly stronger today than it was just a year or two ago. You mentioned housing. The business sector, consumers are less debt-burdened than they were two or three years ago. And so by those measures, I'm hard- pressed to find the reason why six months from now, the Federal Reserve would have the pedal to the floor of the car so to speak as they have had for the past two or three years.</p><p>GHARIB: What is going to be the time table on this? To some extent, we saw with the gold prices today and oil prices that commodities are already responding to some changes in the marketplace. But when do you think that the Fed realistically will be acting on an exit strategy?</p><p>DAVIS: I think the exit strategy will be over the next six to 12 months in terms of more vocal conversations and guidance with respect to the amount and the frequency of their purchases. I think a later stage is then contemplation of raising interest rates, raising the Fed funds rate, which is effectively at zero. I think there it will be much more important on the labor market front in terms of job progress. I think all the other conditions are in place to see a modest acceleration in job growth, but it is going to take some time to bring that unemployment rate down, if I'm correct, that some Americans return to the labor force.</p><p>GHARIB: One concern for a lot of people as investors is what do I do now? A lot of people started putting money in the market. I know you're an economist, but you also are at Vanguard with all of the mutual funds. What is the view at Vanguard about what investors should be doing right now, given the uncertainty about this and things going on in Washington?</p><p>DAVIS: I think the hardest thing to do but I think what many investors actually are doing is to actually look through some of these headlines, to embrace that long-term orientation, look at the balance and risks and what you're trying to achieve with your portfolio. And if that ascertation (ph) of that plan is the same today as it was two, five, 10 years ago, it is really critical to stick with that plan. I think even going back three years ago, our message to clients was, listen, the economic environment may be challenging, but you can still have decent portfolio returns. And actually since that time, we've had decent portfolio returns, both on the equity market as well as in bond portfolios. So continuing to reaffirm that message and for investors to stay invested in markets. Because we are going to have ups and downs as the economy just muddles through some of this.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot more to talk about and we'll continue this conversation, but we have to wrap it up for now. Thanks so much, Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard.</p><p>DAVIS: Thank you, Susie.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Still ahead, Martha's in the middle of a courtroom showdown between two major retailers. What's at stake for the stores and her brand?</p><p>HUDSON: There is progress to report tonight from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on the battery issue plaguing its 787 Dreamliner. Still the planes remain grounded this evening. The aircraft maker may have found a fix for the plane's battery problems, by making bigger gaps between battery cells, that's according to Reuters. Boeing's head of commercial engines is expected to meet with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration Friday to present a 10-point plan to prevent battery fires or meltdowns. Neither Boeing (NYSE:BA) nor the FAA are commenting. Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose slightly today to close at $74.78 per share.</p><p>GHARIB: Two big and struggling office supply companies are teaming up. Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) is merging with Office Max in a stock deal valued at more than $1 billion. A union of the two companies has been rumored for years, given trouble in the office supply sector. But investors didn't buy in to the concept. Shares of Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tumbled 16 percent; Office Max fell 7 percent and even rival Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) was down today on the news, off 7 percent. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you want a good read on the economy, it helps to watch demand for office supplies. When the economy is booming, businesses need more pens, paper and printers. But growth has been weak since the great recession and that has meant less demand for office products. Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max have been struggling behind industry leader Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS).</p><p>LIANG FENG, SPECIALTY RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is just -- their retail store is about 25-30 percent more productive than comparable locations. And they also have much more attractive business customer mix. They have the mid-size customers, compared to Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max which are dependent on the lower margin large customers.</p><p>MILLER: Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max hope by merging, they will be able to save big bucks by closing stores, combining operations, cutting advertising costs and negotiating better prices from suppliers. But office supply stores are also facing stiff competition from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those retailers have lower cost structures which often means lower prices. What's worse, the office supply stores are losing their most lucrative customers.</p><p>FENG: Your highest margin customers are your small business customers or somebody who just wants to buy something for the home office. And what we've seen is that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are targeting these higher margin small business customers.</p><p>MILLER: Those struggles are reflected in the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max stock prices. Shares of both companies have plunged more than 70 percent from their highs back in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tried to merge in 1997, but the deal was blocked by regulators because of fear it would lead to higher prices. But most industry experts give this deal a high probability of going through. Longer-term, this deal is expected to be good for Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max, but also their biggest competitor. If Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max close stores, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) will face competition. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Combined these two companies have about 2,000 retail stores in North America. And as Erika just mentioned, some of those stores are expected to close, if the deal happens. That potentially could leave vacant millions of square feet of commercial real estate. Brian Jones is a portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman real estate fund. He joins us tonight from the NASDAQ. Brian, what kind of shape is retail real estate in as it faces what could be a pretty big consolidation?</p><p>BRIAN JONES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE FUND: Well, thank you for having me tonight. I think retail real estate is in a very good situation right now. What we've seen over the past two years have been improving occupancies and in many of the better markets, we're beginning to see rental rate growth. This is largely driven by the fact that there is very little new construction of retail centers going on in the United States currently. And thus, any retailers looking to grow have to find space in the existing centers in order to fund and continue their growth efforts.</p><p>HUDSON: Let's assume that Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are successful in combining their resources. Does this square footage, presumably that would become vacant in the years ahead, actually help relieve some of the pressure that you're seeing today?</p><p>JONES: Well, what we would say is that these two tenants are still relatively small when compared to the total pie of retail real estate. When we looked at the REITs in our coverage universe, we found that combined, Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max were in every case at less than 2 percent of the rental revenues for the REITs in our coverage universe. So together, they're relatively small tenants for the overall retail REIT universe and the retail space in general. What it will provide is the opportunity for some of the retailers that have growth plans to actually find centers to grow in. And so we think that over time, a lot of the stores that are closed will be released to stronger tenants. And in many cases, that will end up strengthening the underlying center, where the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) or the Office Max have gone out.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned your coverage universe and you did bring along one kind of outdoor shopping real estate investment trust that you do like here, Federal reality investment trust, ticker on this one is FRT. What make this on stand out in a crowded market?</p><p>JONES: One thing I would like to point out is that this highlights one of the benefits of investing in REITs, as opposed to a single piece of direct real estate. Most of the retail REITs in our coverage universe own dozens, if not hundreds, of retail centers. So they're generally diversified by geography or by tenant mix and by product type. So Federal realty is an excellent example of a retail REIT that owns high quality centers in areas that have high population densities and above average incomes. And these are the locations where many of the growing retailers, such as TJ Max and Marshal's, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Rack, Five Guys Burgers, Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) -- the retailers that are looking to grow are focused on these higher income, higher density markets. And this is where Federal is positioned. And we think that they are positioned to do well in the future.</p><p>HUDSON: OK.</p><p>JONES: Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are not within their top 25 tenants.</p><p>HUDSON: Gotcha. And that's something you like at this point for FRT. Do you have a position in the fund in that stock?</p><p>JONES: Yes, we do own Federal reality in our mutual funds, the Neuberger Berman real estate fund.</p><p>HUDSON: And you help manage it. It is Brian Jones along with us tonight from Neuberger Berman. Thanks Brian.</p><p>JONES: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: It's Macy's (NYSE:M) versus JC Penney in a high stakes fight over bed linens, cocktail napkins and kitchen tools. At issue here, who will be allowed to carry products with Martha Stewart's name on them? Macy's (NYSE:M) has been selling Stewart's merchandise since 2007. It claims it owns the exclusive rights to carry her home furnishings. But rival JC Penney argues it has the right to sell other Stewart-branded products that Macy's (NYSE:M) doesn't carry. Ruben Ramirez reports.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Martha's in the middle, as two of the nation's best-known department stores fight in New York State Supreme Court over just who can carry the domestic diva's home products.</p><p>GREG LITTLE, PARTNER, WHITE &amp; CASE: Two different companies are looking at the same agreement and are interpreting it different ways. Macys is interpreting it very broadly; Penney's is interpreting it very narrowly.</p><p>RAMIREZ: There's no denying the appeal of carrying Martha Stewart's brand. Macy's (NYSE:M) says it has billions of dollars on the line.</p><p>MICHAEL APPEL, FOUNDER, APPEL &amp; ASSOCIATES: For Macys, having a differentiated exclusive brand is critical to their competitive strategy and they've invested a lot of time and effort in building up the Martha Stewart brand, giving her exposure in the stores and it's a linchpin of their home strategy.</p><p>RAMIREZ: For, JCP, Martha is a key part of its store within a store turnaround plan.</p><p>APPEL: She can appeal to the kind of customer that Penney's has and the customer whom they want to get which is more I think a little more upscale than what they have right now.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Penney's is counting on a clause in Stewart's original contract with Macy's (NYSE:M), which allowed her to open stand-alone stores, arguing the clause never said that stand alone shops could not be inside a bigger store. If JCP is successful, Appel says it opens up another retail channel for Stewart's company.</p><p>APPEL: The merchandising end of her business is the only part of her business right now that is growing and is profitable and for her to be able to increase her distribution is critical to her business strategy.</p><p>RAMIREZ: The trial got underway in a Manhattan Federal courtroom today and now that it's begun, attorneys say a settlement could be coming.</p><p>LITTLE: There is something about a trial that forces parties to look at the facts a little bit differently than they do when they're not at trial and it may well be that they reach a compromise at that point.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Martha Stewart, along and the CEOs of both Macy's (NYSE:M) and JC Penney are expected to take the stand. The trial is slated to last about two-and-a-half weeks. But unlike other courtroom cases which are decided by a jury, one judge will decide the outcome of this one. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: In the \"Market Focus\" here today, what started out as just some mild selling picked up this afternoon with some Federal Reserve officials worrying about how long to keep buying bonds to help the economy. Here's the daily trade for the S&amp;P 500. Now the news from the Federal Reserve came out just after 2:00 Eastern time. That's when the index starting seeing some selling momentum. The index finished down by 1.2 percent. Remember though, it was at a five and a half year high at yesterday's close. Trading volume though did pick up, 815 million shares moving on the big board, two billion traded on the NASDAQ.</p><p>All 10 of the major stock sectors were lower today. The materials sector seeing the biggest loss, down 2.8 percent followed by the selling that we saw in energy and consumer discretionary sectors.</p><p>Two gold and copper miners saw the heaviest selling among those material stocks. Gold and copper metal prices were down sharply today. Freeport McMoran falling 6 percent. This is a two-and-a-half month low for FCX. Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) falling 5.5 percent, NEM tonight at a new 52-week low. AA, aluminum maker Alcoa (NYSE:AA) hit too, falling 3.3 percent. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been seeing aluminum prices stabilize.</p><p>In addition to the drop in new home construction last month, we heard from home builder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL). It earned $0.03 per share in the last quarter, certainly an improvement from the loss a year ago, but considerably less than estimates. The company reported that average selling prices were lower. Shares were lower as well, falling 9 percent. The stock has lost 10 percent in less than a week after staging a big rally over the past year. Other homebuilder stocks getting hit. Pulte Group falling 6.8 percent, DR Horton off by 5.8 percent.</p><p>Foxconn is not a household name in the U.S., but if you use an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) computer or many other dozens of other electronic devices, Foxconn is the Taiwanese company that assembles it. Today Foxconn said it has frozen the hiring of assembly line workers in China after the lunar holiday there. That fed speculation about demand for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and HP products. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares falling 2.2 percent since the plant affected makes iPhone fives, but Foxconn said its decision is not related to making the iPhone. An analyst at investment banking firm UBS thinks it could be instead because of less demand for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) desktop computers. HPQ shares down by 1.1 percent. HPs quarterly earnings are due tomorrow after the closing bell, one to watch.</p><p>Independent energy companies Devon and Anadarko updated their shareholders on their latest strategies. Both though were greeted today with selling. APC is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), down 4.5 percent. Its energy production outlook was less than expected while its forecast for capital spending was more than anticipated. Anadarko says it expects to be among the most active deepwater drillers this year. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) falling 6.6 percent after saying it may try again to spin off its pipeline and processing businesses. It tried that six years ago, but stopped after the economy weakened.</p><p>Four of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were lower on the broad market sell-off. The S&amp;P 500 volatility note though jumped 8.6 percent. It usually moves in the opposite direction of the broad market as it did today. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Whether it's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram or Pinterest, there always seems to be a hot start-up in the tech pipeline. But as tonight's commentator explains, the next big tech company might not be as original as you think. He's Harry Lin, executive-in-residence at Idealab. It's a technology incubator in Pasadena, California.</p><p>HARRY LIN, EXECUTIVE-IN-RESIDENCE, IDEALAB: An irony in the world of technology start-ups is that we tend to copy each other a lot. I call this ironic because the image of tech start-ups is that they're all about innovation and risk taking. Yet, venture capital investors and tech entrepreneurs all know that for every Instagram that gets launched, there are at least 10 other start-ups that pretty much are Instagram, just with a different name. Did you know that there are at least three well-funded startups? I'm talking more than $10 million of investor capital, that match dog owners with dog sitters? The number of me-too start-ups goes crazy when you look at other types of products and services: project management software, call ordering food online, music streaming, cloud file storage and I can't even keep track of all the fashion and clothing sale sites duking it out on the Internet. There are scores of them! Even Pinterest has at least half a dozen straight up clones.</p><p>So why is an industry that's supposedly about innovation and disruption so quick to copy itself? Investors may call their capital venture, but they're looking for safe bets. So when something seems to be working, why not invest in the same thing? We also know that in some niches, there's space for several winners, so maybe investing in the me-too will work out. The entrepreneurial myth is that we invent new stuff, when, much of the time, we engineer twists or slants on old stuff. It's really, really hard to come up with a brand-new idea that's never been tried. So this copy-catting will continue and I'll continue to call it ironic. I'm Harry Lin.</p><p>HUDSON: Whether copy cats or not, all entrepreneurs certainly face difficulty at one time or another staying motivated. Our NBRU partners at Vanderbilt University have eight steps for staying motivated to reach long- term goals. Just head to nbr.com and look for that NBRU tab.</p><p>GHARIB: And let's take a look at what's coming up tomorrow on NBR. Ford is hiring. It's adding jobs at its Cleveland plant that builds the eco-boost engines. But it's not alone. We look at job creation in the U.S. auto industry.</p><p>HUDSON: That's it for the broadcast here on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Wednesday night, February 20. Have a great evening, you too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you Tom. Thanks for watching everyone and we'll see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

And welcome. I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>Sue Herera joins me tonight. Susie Gharib has the evening off.</p><p>Well, you couldn't really call it a come back day, not after Thursday's 350-point Dow infarction. But the patient was stabilized, despite some wild swings on the so-called quadruple winching day when certain options and future contracts expire.</p><p>On heavy volume, the Dow rocked and rolled and finished 41 points higher at 14,799. The NASDAQ was dragged lower, especially by Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which fell 9 percent on an earnings miss last quarter reported yesterday. NASDAQ dipped more than seven points, to $33.57. The S&amp;P 500 gained mere four points, to 1,592. The yield on the benchmark 10- year treasury note, hitting 2.59 percent, the highest in nearly two years.</p><p>Overall, the week answered some questions: no, stocks don't always go up; yes, the Fed will stop buying bonds sometimes. But it also left some queries hanging in the winds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): For most of us, thoughts about our investments this week were unnerving, to say the least.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a lot of uncertainty out there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you take a few bruises, you got to put your best game in there. What do you do? That's the stock market. That's how it works.</p><p>MATHISEN: At the start of the week a two-day run-up on the Dow and S&amp;P put May's record highs back in sight.</p><p>Then came Wednesday, and a 200-point drop after Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke put investors on notice with word the Fed may trim its bond-buying before the end of the year and end it not long after that.</p><p>BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: We will continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid year.</p><p>MATHISEN: With the end of the Fed's asset buying program in sight, stocks dropped another 300 points Thursday before stabilizing today. Of course, that plan depends on whether the economy continues to improve.</p><p>Gone in two days were the last two months of gains in the stock market. For the year, though, stocks are still up more than 12 percent, even if a lot of us have doubts about the health of the economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unemployment needs to be fixed, it's horrible. The housing market still isn't really good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm worried about the economy.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what's next? The year is almost half way down. Corporate reports will come out soon, even experts are nervous. That housing recovery, well, mortgage rates are inching up.</p><p>BRAD HUNTER: Everyone is getting a little spooked.</p><p>MEGAN MCGRATH: These stocks are going to be very volatile until we get some clarity around what the Feds doing.</p><p>MATHISEN: There is no shortage of opinions even inside the Fed itself.</p><p>St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, still worried about the economy today said the announcement of a bond-buying pullback was, quote, \"inappropriate time\".</p><p>Others say Bernanke and Fed got just what they wanted.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: I think the Fed was purposely trying to take some air out of the housing market and stock market. They don't want the stock market going up 20 percent every six months. They don't want house prices rising 10-plus percent year over year for the next five years.</p><p>MATHISEN: But others took Bernanke at his word, that the economy is recovering, that a policy charge is just a short-term shock to the system.</p><p>DAVID KELLY: We're bating over medicating this economy. This economy is like a 12-year-old sitting on a bicycle with training wheels. It can cycle forward on its own.</p><p>DAVID SEABURG, COWEN &amp; COMPANY: Where are you going to put your money right now? In cash? I don't think so.</p><p>Are you going to put it in the 30-year? I don't have an interest in having that duration risk. I'm going to put it in equity.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And with the quarter ending next week, market watchers say they expect professional investors to buy blue chips to dress up their portfolios.</p><p>HERERA: Some burned investors in bankrupt energy giant Enron may have a little bit more to be upset about today. A shortened prison sentenced for the jailed one-time chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling.</p><p>Scott Cohn was in the courtroom for this controversial decision today and he joins us live from Houston.</p><p>So, Scott, why the more lenient resentencing and why right now?</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, since, Sue, it makes sense for a guy in charge of an energy trading company, this was basically a trade off. A federal appeals court had already said that the original sentence, 24 years, was too harsh. It should be more like 15 or 16 years.</p><p>Skilling wasn't willing to settle for that initially. He was going to charge the government committed misconduct in prosecuting the case. That would drag it out for a whole lot longer.</p><p>So, ultimately, the government and Skilling came to this agreement, where Skilling would drop the remaining appeals, $40 million would be returned to the investors, the convictions would stand but he would get out of prison early, basically 14 years. But time out for good behavior, he'll be out in about 11 or in 2017.</p><p>MATHISEN: Give us a sense, Scott, if you would, of the atmosphere in the courtroom today and how did Skilling look? You've been working this story for years.</p><p>COHN: Skilling is 59 years old and he looks every bit of that. He's grown a beard since he's been in prison. He looks like he's aged somewhat. He was in prison garb. In handcuffs initially and then they took them off.</p><p>This courtroom was packed with Skilling supporters. The judge said 250 people had written in support of Jeff Skilling. Among the people in the courtroom, Skilling's family, his wife Rebecca, members of Ken Lay's family. Remember, Ken Lay passed away in 2006, shortly after he was convicted, then those convictions wiped out.</p><p>One victim spoke for those who are victimized by this scandal, Dianna Peters, a former Enron employee, who said that Skilling betrayed the employees' trust.</p><p>HERERA: Talk more about that, Scott. What exactly does this mean for Enron's victims?</p><p>COHN: Well, for one thing, they will get this $20 million held in escrow since the trial in 2006. All of that money will go to the victims.</p><p>Now, that's pittance in terms of the $60 billion or so that was lost and there have been some big settlements in the order of about $7 billion mainly with some of the banks that were involved. But they will get some money back and that's something that the Justice Department is emphasizing in all of this, that they didn't come down that much from what the appeals court wanted. People will get their money back and most important, they say, Skilling will not be able to challenge his convictions.</p><p>MATHISEN: Scott Cohn, an honorary citizen of Houston after all the type you spent down there -- Scott, have a good weekend.</p><p>Good news about jobs to tell you about. Unemployment rates fell in about half in all states in May led by big declines on the jobless rolls in California, West Virginia, New York and Hawaii. California's unemployment rate is now 8.6 percent, higher than average. But it is at its lowest in five years.</p><p>Overall, North Dakota has the lowest of unemployment, 3.2 percent, and Nevada, the highest at 9.3 percent. The rates rose in 17 states and remained the same in eight more.</p><p>HERERA: And there was also good news, about autos sales, but this time, used auto sales. Car Max, the nation's biggest used car dealership chain with 120 stores nationwide, reported a 21 percent rise in profits last quarter on a 22 percent jump in sales. Prices on those used cars were also up about 1 percent from a year ago.</p><p>MATHISEN: If you're flying instead of driving, there may be some relief on board that plane. The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to relax the ban on using some personal electronic devices during taxiing, take-offs and landings and low altitude flying. The ban of making cell phone calls, however, will likely remain in effect but passengers may soon be allowed to use e-readers, tablets and MP3 players without admonishment from airline staff.</p><p>The actor Alec Baldwin who was famously thrown off an American Airlines flight in 2011 for refusing to stop playing the game \"Words with Friends\" on his smartphone during take off tweeted this reaction, \"If you're flying first class on American Air, I'd still apply an extra measure of restraint.\"</p><p>HERERA: Well, the easing back of those airline rules may have turned the initial public stock offering for Gogo into more of a no-no. Shares of the airline Internet service provider tumbled on their first day of trading today. After pricing last night at $17 a share, Gogo shares closed nearly 6 percent lower, at exactly $16 a piece.</p><p>Another big tech company is on the move. The company that makes smartphones for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Mac Pros for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is making efforts to move manufacturing back to the U.S. It's called onshoring.</p><p>And Jon Fortt has our story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's become an article of faith in America these days, manufacturing jobs that have gone overseas can't come back. American workers cost too much and don't have the cutting-edge skills to build the latest gadgets.</p><p>But what if that is wrong? In just the past month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) have both announced products they plan to make here. Apple's, a high end computer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is designed by brilliant engineers in California and assembled here in the USA.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a fantastic device we want to get in the hands.</p><p>FORTT: Google's, a risky new smartphone we haven't seen yet.</p><p>(on camera): For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's a major gamble. If it succeeds, made in America is a major selling point for a cutting-edge phone. If it fails, American dreams and real American jobs are at stake.</p><p>ROBERT REICH, UNIV. OF CA (NASDAQ:CA)., BERKELEY: Certainly, it will boost morale. I mean, I think a lot of people for a long time were kind of economic determinist. They assumed that our jobs, particular our low-skill jobs would go abroad to the lowest waged countries, and that was never wholly the case, but when manufacturing does start coming back, people's hopes will get up.</p><p>FORTT (voice-over): Flextronics, the contract manufacturer, will be building both Apple's Mac Pro and Google's Motorola X phone, both later this year. Why make them in the U.S.? The cost of labor is raising in China and Malaysia, for one.</p><p>And as innovators like Tesla have shown, when there is a brand-new high margin product that needs close attention, sometimes, it's worth it to have it crafted close to home.</p><p>MIKE MCNAMARA, FLEXTRONICS CEO: We're seeing a lot of work move into places like Texas where we put up the Moto X factory and as well into North Carolina, South Carolina. These kinds of places, the governments are very aggressive at improving regulation so it's pro-business and keeping taxes down and really working to stimulate jobs.</p><p>FORTT (on camera): It will probably take years for this story to play out for us to see if tech really can bring American manufacturing jobs back long-term. But this initial chapter is key. If names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can't succeed at this, chances are the others won't be about to, either.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, how big American companies are taking advantage of an even bigger trend, urbanization, especially in China. But, first, a look at the best performing stocks of the S&amp;P this week.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Violent protests continue to rock the streets of Brazil's biggest cities for the second week running. As an estimated 1 million people rallied against the government for raising prices on public service last night, some cities even cancelled the transit fair hikes that set off those demonstrations a week ago. But that didn't stop the protest. More unrest is expected tonight in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, and other major cities.</p><p>MATHISEN: Two U.S. senators say a Chinese company's purchase of Smithfield Foods (NYSE:SFD) is quote difficult to square, but the Chinese's government's restrictions on U.S. pork and beef exports. Senators Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and a Republican, say the interest of U.S. farmers and ranchers must be protected, calling for a full review of Shuanghui group's planned acquisition of Smithfield. That's the world's largest pork producer.</p><p>HERERA: And in China, the government is pushing ahead with a sweeping plan to move millions of rural residents into more populated areas and this growth and urbanization has not gone unnoticed by some of America's biggest companies.</p><p>Eunice Yoon reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): All over the world, people are heading to the cities. Nowhere of that more true than in China. By 2030, one in eight people on the planet will live in a Chinese city.</p><p>That's good for companies like Honeywell.</p><p>STEPHEN SHANG, HONEYWELL CHINA CEO: The wealth of these people is increasing at a tremendous peak.</p><p>YOON: Honeywell is betting big on China's plans to build up its cities. The American industrial giant has opened up new factories like this one in a midwestern city of Chongqing, expecting its urbanization expertise in the U.S. and Europe to translate here.</p><p>SHANG: Urbanization is really, if you look at it, it's a building of the mega, mega movement and not in one location but all across China, new towns, new subways, new trains, new planes, new hospitals and they are all in the Honeywell scope.</p><p>YOON (on camera): If China wasn't urbanizing at this fast a pace, would your growth be as strong?</p><p>SHANG: Of course not.</p><p>YOON (voice-over): Honeywell is making and selling brake pads here. It's targeting sales growth about double the country's growth rate, which is currently above 7 percent.</p><p>To build it cities, China needs everything, Australian iron for steel beams to American bulldozers.</p><p>(on camera): At shopping plazas like this one, you can see all sorts of international brands, with more and more for Chinese moving into the city, companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), H&amp;M, and Gucci can make more consumers here than ever before.</p><p>SHANG: They create jobs for us in China, but also create jobs for U.S. Many of this product know-how (ph) is in the foreign countries. As in the process of localization, you actually create for jobs for these foreign countries, whether it's the U.S., Germany or U.K. So everybody benefits.</p><p>YOON (voice-over): Welcomed news with economy so weak back at home.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And tonight in \"Market Focus\", some bargain hunting on the day after the big Dow dipper.</p><p>Bristol-Myers gaining back most of its Thursday's loss as investors cheered FDA labeling approval for leukemia treatment. Shares of Bristol- Myers up 2.5 percent on above average volume. It closed at $45.73.</p><p>DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) meanwhile, touching a new five-year high as it abandoned its efforts to acquire Sprint. DISH took on more than $2.6 billion in debt and interest to finance the Sprint deal. They're not going to be spending it now. That didn't matter to the market today as DISH network gained more than 3 percent to close at $41.40. DISH up 7 percent since it lost that Sprint bid back in April.</p><p>HERERA: Archer Daniels Midland gained after saying that it's in talks to sell its coco business, about 4 percent of its overall sales. ADM shares were up almost 1 1/2 percent, closing at $33.09.</p><p>And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also gained today on an upgrade to buy from neutral over at UBS. And some astonishing stats on Instagram video. One year of video was uploaded in the first eight hours. In other words, it would take a year to watch all of those videos and remember, they are only 15 seconds long.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) acquired Instagram in September of 2012. And in today's trade, shares tacked on 2 1/2 percent, closing at $24.53.</p><p>MATHISEN: And time now to turn our attention to this week's market monitor guest who says she is positive on equities both over the short and the long-term. She's Judy Saryan, portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance.</p><p>Judy, welcome. What a week, great week to have you here with us.</p><p>Explain why you think this is not just -- not a fatally wounded bull market.</p><p>JUDY SARYAN, EATON VANCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Well, I'm very happy to be here, Tyler.</p><p>I think that the move by the Fed and the comments by Bernanke indicate that the economy is growing. It's not growing too rapidly. It's not growing too slowly. It's just right.</p><p>And I think that is really the key underpin of the market.</p><p>So, we're very positive about the market, both near term and long term. The Fed is basically on the track that they set. There is really nothing new in what they said.</p><p>HERERA: Judy, though, we did see a lot of volatility this week and we've seen interest rates move quite a bit higher than they were a couple weeks ago. Does that worry you at all? I mean, it's good for savers certainly. But does it worry you about the market's ability to move forward in the market?</p><p>SARYAN: The interest level has moved up. It was pretty dramatic in the last couple weeks. But at this current level, the 10-year Treasury 2.5 percent, that's still a very reasonable interest rate. I believe the economy can grow with that rate. It's not a problem for the housing market.</p><p>And, of course, the housing market is key for the growth in the economy but housing is still extremely affordable at record rates in terms of affordability. It would take rates going much higher before we saw that, you know, really affect or impact the housing market.</p><p>MATHISEN: I think our viewers have their pencils ready, Judy, for a couple of your stocks picks. And a couple of stocks on your list this week are banks -- one big, one somewhat smaller. Let's start with the big one, which is Citigroup (NYSE:C).</p><p>SARYAN: OK. Well, at Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance, where you focus on fundamentals and the fundamentals are very positive for Citigroup (NYSE:C). There are several positive factors favoring Citigroup (NYSE:C). There's an improvement in the capital market's activity.</p><p>Also, Citigroup (NYSE:C) benefits from the real estate market. In fact, they are going to be releasing $8.5 billion in reserves from the North American Mortgage business. So that will be a strong tail wind to earnings looking out this year.</p><p>On top of that, the evaluation is very attractive. The stock is selling at 63 percent of book, a low P/E ratio and I think the stock could get up to book value.</p><p>HERERA: I would assume housing would help the next pick, which is Regions.</p><p>SARYAN: Absolutely. Regions Financial is a regional bank. About 55 percent of their portfolio is in loans so they benefit from the real estate market. They are selling at a very attractive valuation. They have a reasonable yield and we're expecting dividend growth out of Regions as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's see if we can squeeze in two more very quickly, 15 seconds for each. One is Sanofi and the other is Phillips 66.</p><p>SARYAN: OK. On Sanofi, it's a French-based company. Great pharmaceutical company. Very strong position in the diabetes market place. They've got one of the strong insulin drugs and that business is doing very well. They've also got some very strong positions in the vaccine business.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Phillips.</p><p>SARYAN: And on Phillips, they are -- became independent about a year ago from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Strong free cash flow, over $4 billion we project this year and potential to grow that dividend at a very nice clip, very inexpensive stock, selling at a 7 multiple on P/E. Great stuff.</p><p>MATHISEN: I assume, Judy, that your funds own all of these companies or your business does. Any other disclosures?</p><p>SARYAN: No, that would be the primary disclosure.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Judy, thank you very much. Judy Saryan is portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance.</p><p>And still ahead, after falling, excuse me, to the bottom of the pizza food chain, we'll show you how Domino's turned things around and delivered for shareholders.</p><p>But, first, a look at some of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P this week.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is raising its prices. The java giant plans to jack up prices on some of its drinks but only by an average of 1 percent. For some markets, the company say it will be the first price hike in about two years.</p><p>Even though coffee bean prices have been dropping, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) blames the increase on higher rents, labor costs and raising prices milk and sugar.</p><p>HERERA: And those rising material costs and changing consumer tastes are some of the biggest challenges for eateries. And there is one chain that's worked very hard to figure out what its customers want and has succeeded, delivering for both diners and investors.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has the latest in NBR series on \"Comeback Companies\" with a look at pizza giant, Domino's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDNT (voice-over): In 2009, Domino's ranked at the bottom of a consumer survey on pizza taste preferences, tied with Chuck E. Cheese's -- particularly galling for the company that virtually invented the pizza delivery chain business.</p><p>The situation was desperate.</p><p>PATRICK DOYLE, DOMINO'S PIZZA PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: The combination of poor results for a couple of years in our domestic business and then, you know, some surveys coming out that were not particularly kind to us and the quality of our pizza, it sent us into a room one day. We made the decision that it was time to really fix this.</p><p>DEANGELIS: But, now, four years later, Domino's is at the top of the latest rankings and people love their pizza.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Their food is really delicious. It's really savoring. It really feels in your taste buds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Domino's is a good place to come because it's cheap and you get a lot of food for like money and have a lot of good deals.</p><p>DEANGELIS: How did Domino's do it? First, they fixed the pizza.</p><p>DOYLE: Brought the team in and said, look, everything is on the table. You can chance anything and we just simply want to have the best pizza out there.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Then they stream lined business, adding online ordering for convenience and to drive sales.</p><p>DOYLE: Digital orders have been growing about 5 percent a year as a mix of our total sales. So we're now in the 35 percent to 45 percent range. Customer satisfaction is higher, order accuracy is higher. The ticket on those orders is a little bit higher. The labor cost is slightly little lower. So everything is better.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Those who invested in Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) has seen a sweet return, after hitting a low of $3.30 a share in November of 2008, the stock has run up nearly 1,800 percent.</p><p>The turnaround has been good for investors and also employees.</p><p>DOYLE: Over 90 percent of our franchises in the U.S. started as hourly workers in our stores, either as delivery drivers or customer service representatives. They worked their way up through -- to become a manager and then bought their first store.</p><p>DEANGELIS (on camera): But there are challenges ahead for Domino's: one is growing the international business, especially in China, to keep up with the competition.</p><p>STEPHEN ANDERSON, MILLER TABAK SENIOR RESTAUTRANT ANALYST: I think one of the ways that Domino's can succeed in China is having a broad menu approach or maybe specializing in chicken, which is a very popular fast food staple in China.</p><p>DEANGELIS: So, the stock that has doubled since last year at this time still have room to run?</p><p>ANDERSON: I don't think it moves much higher right now. I think the challenge that Domino's faces in the next 12 months. It will be up against a tougher year of comparisons, particularly in the U.S. coming off the introduction of pan pizza very late in the third quarter.</p><p>DEANGELIS: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, an appropriate end of what must inevitably be called a roller costar week on Wall Street and it comes just in time for the start of summer.</p><p>Take a look at the full throttle rollercoaster debuting today at Six Flags Magic Mountain outside Los Angeles.</p><p>I bet, Sue, you grew up going there.</p><p>HERERA: I went to Magic Mountain.</p><p>MATHISEN: It is the world's tallest and fastest looping roller coaster top speed 70 miles per hour through a 160-foot high loop.</p><p>HERERA: Mercifully, they didn't have that when I went to Magic Mountain.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Sue Herera, in for Susie Gharbi. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen have a great weekend, everybody.

I'm Susie Gharib.  Home prices head higher, as the housing recovery digs  in.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  I'm Tom Hudson.   McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) shares tumble though.  The fast food giant posts its  first monthly sales drop in nearly a decade.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  And the U.S. futures market, it's been hit by scandal, but  investors are still buying in.  We continue our look at confidence and the  markets.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HUDSON:  That and more tonight here on NBR.   </p><p>  There's more evidence tonight the housing market is recovering.  Two  reports today show home prices jumped significantly in the second quarter.   And it's a classic story of supply and demand.  Fewer homes for sale has  helped push up prices for those looking for buyers.  Here's the data.  Real  estate data firm CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) finds home prices up 6 percent.   Freddie Mac's survey has prices up 4.8 percent.  This are the largest  quarter over quarter price hikes in at least seven years.  Housing had been  a drag on the economy, but fewer homes for sale and record low mortgage  rates have really continued to repair the sector even though consumers  remain cautious.  </p><p>  And we saw the latest data that (INAUDIBLE) that caution from  McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) today.  July sales at the fast food restaurant fell  flat, surprising investors and sending its stock lower.  Sales at U.S.  stores open for more than a year fell slightly last month, down 0.1 of one  percent.  That marks the first time in almost a decade monthly sales didn't  rise.  Like other analysts, Morningstar's RJ Hottovy expects sales to slow,  but thought they'd still be positive.  </p><p>  RJ HOTTOVY, SR. RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR:  Whether it be sluggish  wage growth and an uneven housing recovery and just a lot of headlines  about a worsening global macroeconomic picture, I think a combination of  those have definitely put consumers in a more value oriented mindset and  that's something that will probably continue in the months to come.  This  may not be the last month that McDonalds puts up a slightly negative same  store sales results for the U.S.</p><p>  GHARIB:  McDonalds was one of the big losers here on the big board  today and that pressured stocks.  But the Dow still eked out a fourth day  of gains.  Here are the numbers. The blue chips rose seven points, the  NASDAQ slipped four and a half and the S&amp;P added nearly a point.  </p><p>  So get ready for a pull back in stocks.  That's what our market guest  is telling his clients.  He's Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells  Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors.  So Scott, let's talk about that pull back.   When, how big and why are you thinking that? </p><p>  SCOTT WREN, SR. EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS:  Well, Susie,  I think probably over the next couple of months, we are very susceptible to  headlines out of Europe.  I think that the ECB will certainly be in at some  point buying Spanish and Italian debt.  But I don't think it's going to be  as soon as the market wants.  Much of this rally was based on what the Fed  might do, also what the ECB might do.  So I think it's very possible the  Fed does do some easing.  I think it's very possible and very likely the  ECB does go in and buy some bonds.  I just don't think it's going to be as  soon.  I think the market's a little bit ahead of itself.  I think probably  you could see certainly a 5 percent pullback and possibly upwards of a 10  percent pullback, but really on a pullback like that, we're looking at that  as an opportunity.  We want our clients in there taking advantage of a  pullback like that and adding to positions.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Let me pick up on some of the points that you made there,  first of all, about policy action.  Investors do seem to be banking on the  Federal Reserve and the European central bank doing something.  Let's say  they do.  Is that a long term or just a temporary boost to the market?  </p><p>  WREN:  I think that -- let's look at the Federal Reserve.  If they do  a QE3, in my opinion I would have to doubt the effectiveness as that.  I  almost feel there's kind of pushing on a string.  I think there's a lot of  liquidity in the system.  It's just that there's no velocity of money.   Confidence is down and people don't want to really borrow and spend.  The  ECB is in a much more dire situation.  Spain and Italy both have a lot of  debt this year that they need to roll over and there's just not very many  investors stepping up to buy that.  So I think the ECB is in a very dire  situation.  They are likely to act sooner.  But let's be certain. If we  have sub-two percent GDP growth and 8 percent plus unemployment, the  Federal Reserve is not going to sit on its hands and do nothing.  </p><p>  GHARIB: You just tell people (ph) fundamentals there. But let me ask  you, let me make the positive case and there are a lot of market guests who  come on our program.  They point to those housing numbers, for example.   Housing is making a recovery. We just talked about that at the top of the  show, also corporate profits coming in better than expected.  They always  talk about some kind of Fed action.  But none of that resonates with you.   You're still (INAUDIBLE) on a pullback.  </p><p>  WREN:  Well I think and let me say this -- our year end target on the  S&amp;P 500 is 1400 to 1450, so we're inside at the bottom range of that  target.  And I'm very confident in that year end target.  I just think that  we came to this level a little bit too fast.  I think we came to this level  because of anticipated action by central banks.  That's probably a little  further out than what the market thinks.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  We have about 20 seconds left.  Talk to us about investor  confidence.  We're running a whole series this week about this subject.   What are your clients telling you about their confidence level?  </p><p>  WREN:  Retail investor confidence level is low.  They're fearful.   They're afraid to get back into the market no matter what the valuations  are.  So our clients have a lot of cash on the sidelines, and one of my  main jobs is to point out to people that you're going to be living longer.   You're going to need to grow your money.  You're going to need to  participate in the global and U.S.  growth and one of the best ways to do  that is going to continue to be stocks.  You need to be invested in the  stock market.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Lots of good information.  Scott, thanks a lot, Scott Wren at  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Advisors.  </p><p>  WREN:  Thanks, Susie.  </p><p>  DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Diane  Eastabrook.  Still ahead, I'll tell you why the futures market isn't what  it used to be.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Fine coffee (ph) at some Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the  future, may only take your name.  The catch is you'll have to have a  special pay with Square ap on your smart phone that announces your arrival  at the cash register.  It's part of a new partnership announced today  between Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Square.  That's the mobile payments  start-up run by one of the co-founders of Twitter.  The deal calls for  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to invest $25 million in Square.  Square will also  process all of Starbucks' credit card payments, at significant savings.   Earlier today, NBR's Erika Miller spoke with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO  Howard Schultz and Square CEO Jack Dorsey.  </p><p>  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   I would imagine  that every big tech company has been beating at your door begging for a  mobile payment deal.  What do you think that Jack and Square is the right  partnership for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)?  </p><p>  HOWARD SCHULTZ, CEO, STARBUCKS:  It's true that we have spoken to most  of the high profile blue chip tech companies, all of whom are trying to  crack the code on how to monetize mobile payments.  I think when we met  Square and then Jack, there were a few things that really stuck one.  One  was like minded values of both companies and I think Square's singular  focus on payments and their level of innovation and entrepreneurialship  (sic) and understanding of the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) experience quickly  separated them from the pack and it was a very easy choice for us.  </p><p>  MILLER: And Jack, talk about what this deal means for Square.  Is it  more than just a positive development?  Is this a game changer for your  company?  </p><p>  JACK DORSEY, CEO, SQUARE:  Absolutely.  It really proves out that the  technology we built scales from the individual and the small business all  the way up to the very largest organizations in the world.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Until this point, Square has been focused on small, even  micro businesses.  Does this partnership signal a new focus towards big  global companies?  </p><p>  DORSEY:  It's really around that scale.  We're building a technology  that should be treated as a utility, that an individual can come to or a  very large organization can come to it and use it in very similar ways.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Howard, it's one thing to encourage local payments in  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).  It's another thing to make a $25 million  investment in a company that's not yet profitable.  Why did you go that  route?  </p><p>  SCHULTZ:   I think we've all seen as consumers that the smart phone  has really become the primary device in our life.  The investment we're  making of $i25 million is a significant vote of confidence to Square and  Jack.  We think that is going to create shareholder value for our  shareholders.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Jack, this partnership comes at a time when you're facing  stiff competition from the likes of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), from the likes of  Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), big competitors.  Is it game on  now?  Are there going to be a rush to sign up big corporate partners?  </p><p>  DORSEY:  We do something very specific which is not just focus on the  mechanics of payments, but actually the experience around it.  Everything  from the point of sale all the way to what's in the consumers' pocket.  And  that bridge between the two is what is powerful and what is meaningful.  </p><p>  MILLER:  Howard, I'd like to get your assessment of the global  economy. Obviously you're a big global corporation.  What do you see in  terms of trends?  Are consumers becoming more willing to spend?  Is your  ticket price going up?  What can you tell me about Europe?  </p><p>  SCHULTZ:   I think with 18,000 stores in 60 countries, every single  day we have a window into consumer confidence and consumer behavior.  It's  no surprise that over the last few months there's been a significant level  of pressure on consumer behavior and consumer spending in Europe.  I don't  think any of us see that changing any time soon.</p><p>  GHARIB:  This deal is obviously a big vote of confidence for mobile  payments.  Do you think (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>  DORSEY: It is definitely disappearing.  I can't imagine my grandmother  leaving it at home.  But I think what's always been true about payments is  that the merchant always needs to accept whatever comes over the counter.   They always want to make the sale.  So it's important (INAUDIBLE)to that,  but at the same time recognize the technologies that are coming to make it  easier, to make it faster and improve the experience.  </p><p>  MILLER:  hank you both very much for joining us.  </p><p>  SCHULTZ:  Thank you.  </p><p>  DORSEY:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  If you live in a political swing state, chances are you've  seen a political ad, or two or 20 in the past few months.  This year's  presidential campaign season already is on pace to be the most expensive on  record.  And with the so-called super pacs able to raise unlimited amounts  of money for political advertisements, the spending is expected to rise.   Sylvia Hall reports.</p><p>  SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Summer may be  ending, but the fight for the presidency is heating up.  You just need a  remote control to see it play out.  </p><p>  DARRELL WEST, VP &amp; DIR., GOV. STUDIES, BROOKINGS:  The tide does not  rise evenly.  Some battleground states tend to get all the money and last  time around, the top 11 states got 90 percent of the spending.  </p><p>  HALL:  Television campaign spending is on pace to break records.  And  this year, super pacs are set to spend huge sums of money on advertising,  for or against the candidates.  </p><p>  JACK POOR, VP, TELEVISION BUREAU OF ADVERTISING:  Romney and his  collaborators will probably spend a billion.  Obama will be less than that,  maybe $800 million.  </p><p>  HALL:  But most of the country won't see the ads that spring from all  that cash.  So far this year, spending is concentrated in nine swing  states.  By law, campaigns pay fairly low rates for television ad space.   But for super pacs, it's a different game.  Some super pacs pay as much as  twice what a campaign pays for airtime.  </p><p>  POOR: The irony is there are a very few number of undecided voters  this year, so we're going to spend $3 billion essentially trying to  persuade 5 to 10 percent of the electorate in nine states.  </p><p>  HALL:  If you're in one of those states, you'll have a front row seat  for a presidential campaign that's shaping up to be one of the most intense  and negative on record.  Just listen to some of the most recent attack ads  to hit the airwaves.  </p><p>  CAMPAIGN AD:  Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work, you  wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.  </p><p>  CAMPAIGN AD:  I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he's done to  anyone.  And furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.  </p><p>  WEST:  It's way, way negative, somewhere north of 70 percent negative  to 30 percent positive.  We think that's going to continue and perhaps get  worse.  And one of the big reasons is the pacs, the super pacs.  They're  providing the bulk of the Republican spending right now and a significant  portion of the Democratic as well.  </p><p>  HALL:  Nobody knows yet how all this political spending could affect  the businesses who usually advertise on television year round.  The super  pac money could raise ad rates for everyone.  Sylvia Hall, NBR, Washington.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Toyota (NYSE:TM) says it's only a matter of time before it  starts building more cars in North America and you can thank its native  currency.  A strong Japanese yen is clobbering the country's bottom line or  rather the company's bottom line on U.S. exports.  Toyota's U.S. sales  chief Jim Lentz today said the auto maker's looking at moving production of  Lexus ES sedans from Japan to the U.S.  But he says before making such a  costly move, the company will keep monitoring the yen.  Lentz also re- affirmed Toyota's U.S. sales forecast at 14.3 million vehicles this year,  predicting a pick up in sales after the presidential election.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Those rising home prices we told you about a little earlier  in the program are also helping Fannie Mae.  It reported today a solid  second quarter profit just a day after Freddie Mac did the same.   The  government controlled mortgage giant earned $5 billion.  That works out to  $0.37 a share.  The gains mark Fannie Mae's best quarter in a decade.  So  as a result, the company didn't need to ask for more taxpayer help and Tom,  that's kind of significant because since the financial crisis, Fannie Mae  has relied on loans from American taxpayers something along the lines of  $116 billion.  </p><p>  HUDSON: A good development there, positive news in housing here  tonight.  And that's got a little bit of the market going here today Susie.   In our \"Market Focus\"  the major stock indices really kind of meandered  around for most of the day before closing essentially flat.  The S&amp;P 500  did have a choppy session, trading in a very narrow range.  The index saw  its worst and best levels of the day this morning, creating only an eight  point trading range, very narrow.  It ended higher by a fraction, still  enough though for yes a new three-month high tonight.  Trading volume  moderate, 636 million shares on the big board, just under 1.9 billion  moving on the NASDAQ.  Then the consumer was in focus for the markets.  The  consumer staples sector had the best gains, up 0.6 of a percent, while the  consumer discretionary sector was the biggest drag, down 0.4 of one  percent.  </p><p>  Now consumer staples are those things we tend to buy because we need  them.  And Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock saw a big pop as the company plans to  spin off its Horizon organic and Silk soy milk business.  Lots of folks  wanting Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) stock today, shooting up 40.6 percent.  Volume  more than -- jumped seven fold with the stock up to its highest price in  two and a half years tonight.  The firm has hinted for some time about a  possible spin-off, wanting to separate its faster growing business from its  traditional dairy operations.  That news came after the company reported a  stronger than expected second quarter helped out by lower costs.  Earnings  at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) a nickel better than estimates.  The company also  raised its guidance for the year.  And despite the U.S. drought's impact on  grain prices for dairy producers, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) does not think the  impact on dairy prices will be as bad as some predict.  </p><p>  Meantime, consumer discretionary companies, firms selling things we  want but may not need, were under some pressure thanks to travel websites.   Priceline.com topped the losers in this area, down 17.3 percent.  Among S&amp;P  500 traded stocks, the lowest price since February after the company's  financial forecast came in short of expectations.  Fellow online travel  site Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) saw even bigger loss, losing more than a  quarter of its value. Its outlook is below expectations as well.   Tripadvisor lost 4.9 percent as the sector moved lower.  </p><p>  Meantime, homebuilding stocks - here we go -- higher prices thanks to  the two reports we mentioned at the beginning of the program tonight  showing that home prices were climbing.  This exchange-traded fund in made  up for homebuilding stocks.  With today's 0.8 of a percent gain, it's at  its highest price since May and less than $0.50 away from a four-year high.  </p><p>  On HP, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), ticker HPQ, been struggling for a  couple of years, hit by CEO turnover and its traditional computer business  really under pressure by tablets and smart phones.  The company warned it  will take an $8 billion write down due to a drop in its stock and business  in its services unit.  But excluding that massive charge, it raised its  adjusted earnings forecast for the third quarter.  That positive news in  shares certainly responded positively, rising 2.4 percent, heavy traded HPQ  today.  Shares coming off an eight-year low earlier hit this month.  </p><p>  After closing just below a five-year high, media giant News Corp  (NASDAQ:NWS) may be one to watch tomorrow.  After the closing bell, shares  sank rather 2.5 percent from this closing price.  The company reported  disappointing revenues.  The company is preparing to spin off its newspaper  publishing business from its television and film operations.  </p><p>  It was a mixed day for the five most actively traded ETFs.  Only the  S&amp;P 500 and emerging markets exchange-traded funds eked out some very small  gains.  And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>  All this week on NBR, we're talking about investor confidence in the  markets.  In the futures market, that confidence has been hit by the  bankruptcy of MF Global and the admitted fraud at PFG Best.  Farmers  started trading futures in Chicago in the middle of the 19th century.   Today, pension funds, hedge funds, individual investors have millions of  dollars s on the line in corn, soybeans and other products.  As Diane  Eastabrook reports, some old-style market participants say these newer  players are making it tougher for them to trade.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  For 164 years farmers, grain elevators and food companies  have used futures contracts traded in Chicago's commodity pits to hedge  risk.  Alpha Baking Company uses them to lock in prices for the wheat and  natural gas used to make its breads and rolls.  President Larry Marcucci's  been trading futures for 30 years.  About eight years ago he noticed it  changed.  </p><p>  LARRY MARCUCCI, PRESIDENT, ALPHA BAKING:  It used to be if the market  went up a couple of cents or down a couple of cents a day that was a big  deal.  Then it started bouncing around double digits, $0.10, $0.20 a day.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  Marcucci thinks so called financial participants are the  reason.  They include pension funds, commodity pool advisors and swap  dealers who are trading futures as a way to make money.  Together they can  comprise anywhere from a quarter to nearly half of the market.  </p><p>  MARCUCCI:  They add liquidity, but they can drive the market up and  they can certainty drive the market down.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  Speculators have always been crucial to the futures  market, buying a grain contract a hedger is trying to sell.  David Lehman  is the managing director of commodity research and development at the CME  Group (NASDAQ:CME).  He says these new financial participants are improving  the market for hedgers like Marcucci.  </p><p>  DAVID LEHMAN, MANAGING DIR., CME GROUP:  Bringing a much broader array  of participants into the market globally, as well as bringing more  liquidity into the markets from investors has actually dampened volatility  as you look at it statistically.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  Lehman says what makes markets volatile is uncertainty.   The current drought is a good example.  And today hedgers and speculators  have instant access to information and can trade electronically 24-7.   University of Illinois agriculture economist Scott Irwin says that can make  for faster moving markets.  </p><p>  SCOTT IRWIN, AGRICULTURE ECONOMIST, UNIV. OF ILLINOIS:  But overall  you'd have to say on net it likely means just simply, more efficient,  quicker reacting markets to even more relevant information.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  For Marcucci it now means spending a little less time on  the plant floor and a bit more time monitoring commodity prices.  </p><p>  MARCUCCI: I've gone from maybe watching it maybe monthly, to weekly,  to daily, to hourly.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK: Marcucci is still hedging.  He says he thinks that future  provide great assurance for his company.  He's just being a little bit more  cautious about how he uses them in the future.  Tom?  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Diane a lot of folks may be looking at the futures industry a  little bit more cautiously now because of the bankruptcy of MF Global that  we mentioned last fall and of course the fraud this summertime of PFG Best.   How has that impacted the trusts of the futures industry?  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  Well, I think from a customer standpoint, where people  like Marcucci, he trusts the markets.  He thinks the markets are  functioning as they should be.  But I think there is some concern that  there needs to be a bit more oversight, particularly of these futures  commission merchants or FCMs like Peregrine and MF Global and regulators  are doing more to look into those companies. They're doing more electronic  audits and are also making extra sure that these companies are not co- mingling their money with customer money.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  That's a key point and of course the MF Global collapse was  just a trade that went wrong of course.  With PFG, you've got admitted  fraud.  In fact after the MF Global failure, you sat in the same room with  Russell Wasendorf, Sr.  (ph)  (INAUDIBLE) who is now at the center of the  alleged fraud and he said that it was sacrosanct to keep separate customer  money -- not to co-mingle it. But allegedly now we've learned he was  ripping off customers.  </p><p>  EASTABROOK:  Yeah.  That's what took a lot of people -- it really  stunned a lot of people, particularly me.  I had interviewed him many times  in the past.  He was a very trusted member of the futures industry.  And I  think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier.  There just needs  to be more oversight and hopefully that's what we'll be seeing.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Looking at investor trust in the futures market here tonight.   It's our Midwest bureau chief, Diane Eastabrook reporting for the CME Group  (NASDAQ:CME) in Chicago.  Thanks, Diane.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  When it comes to confidence in the markets, tonight's  commentator says market makers like Knight Capital have a great  responsibility.  Here's Joseph Cotterill, editor at the \"Financial Times.\" </p><p>  JOSEPH COTTERILL, EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Is it so terrifying that  you should gut your 401(k) of stocks?  You could say that the market itself  absorbed Knight's problem trades pretty well last week.  Those weird prices  died down after that wild half hour.  Even if you trade stocks day to day,  that seems like better resilience than the big flash crash of two years  ago.  If you hold stocks for months or years, you could be feeling pretty  insulated.  Instead, the only downer on your confidence would be the merely  atrocious economy.  </p><p>  But that can't be the whole story.  Investors (INAUDIBLE) would be  justified to have second thoughts over the bewildering pace of change in  technology.  These algorithms aren't space invaders or black swans.   They're put in place by market makers locked in an arms race to be the  fastest.  They go fast to get you a tight stock quote.  But weigh that  against the unease when it goes wrong, or, as with Knight, there is no kill  switch.  It needs to be stoppable before it goes live.  Otherwise, it's a  dead market.  I'm Joseph Cotterill.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  Tomorrow on NBR, we're going to have some more details about  the appetites of consumers, from the every day shopper to the higher end,  more big retailers report results and outlooks.  Second quarter earnings  due in tomorrow from Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).  </p><p>  GHARIB:  And finally, Bond, James Bond has always been a box office  hit and now British pay TV service BSkyB is banking on it.  It announced  the launch of a new 24 hour channel dedicated solely to what else, films  featuring the one and only James Bond.  The new channel will launch in  October to mark the 50th anniversary of the franchise and will put the 007  films on (INAUDIBLE) Tom, these guys, they recently bought the rights to  the Britain film franchise from MGM Studios.  </p><p>  HUDSON:  I'll see if I can get that channel in the office.  I'm a  sucker any time those films are on.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  I love them. But (INAUDIBLE) watch them in the middle of the  report, of the movie.   Anyway, that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for us for  Wednesday this August 8.  Have a great evening everyone and you too Tom.  Take in a movie, a Bond movie.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Report, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, ergo (ph) online, nbr.com,  back here tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I`m Tom Hudson. Stocks fall on fresh signs that even the Federal Reserve is not sure how much is enough when it comes to boosting the economy, by buying government bonds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Good evening. I`m Susie Gharib. Can two weaklings become strong by teaming up? That`s what Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are hoping for, as they decide to merge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON: And a bit of a mixed picture on American housing, contractors break ground on more single family homes, but pull back on building apartments and condos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: We have that and more tonight on NBR. How much longer should the Federal Reserve continue to stimulate the economy? That question was intensely debated at the central bank`s policy meeting in January according to the minutes that were released today. Stocks sold off on that news, as investors worry the Fed might taper off its stimulus program sooner than expected and before its goal of seeing a big pick up in the job market.</p><p>Now the Fed has been buying $85 billion of mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries every month to pump up the economy. Here`s what those Fed minutes revealed. Many policymakers voiced concerns about potential costs and risks from more bond buying. Others said that the easy money policies might encourage excessive risk-taking and that could have adverse consequences for financial stability. Policymakers also noted positive developments in the economy, as more businesses are optimistic about the economic outlook. But nervousness about the Fed`s next moves pulled down stocks. On Wall Street the Dow lost 108 points, closing below the critical 14,000 level. The NASDAQ was down about 50, the S&amp;P lost 19 points.</p><p>HUDSON: Before the Federal Reserve`s notes on its last meeting were released this afternoon, we saw a mixed report this morning on the American housing market. Construction starts on new homes fell 8.5 percent in January. But that drop in the headline number was pulled down by a drop in apartment and condominium construction. The number of single family homes that began going up last month rose 0.8 of a percent up to its highest level since the great recession. Darren Gersh digs deeper.</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In housing, one month does not a trend make. Analysts shrugged off the news that housing starts fell last month. Instead they`re looking to encouraging trends on home prices, rents and overall demand.</p><p>JED SMITH, MANAGING DIR., NATL ASSN. OF REALTORS: There are going to be these squiggles, blips in the market as things happen, just because they happen from month to month -- snow storms, weather, holidays, whatever, but right now we are in a recovering market.</p><p>GERSH: Homes sales are up more than 10 percent over last year and builders are picking up the pace. They are now on track to build around 900,000 homes this year, but by the end of the year, the National Association of Realtors expects the pace to pick up to an annual rate of 1.1 million starts. That`s great, but keep in mind a normal year for home construction is closer to 1.8 million. The outlook for apartments and other multi-family construction is also good, even though those starts dropped last month. Rents rose 4.5 percent last year and researchers at Zillow expect a similar increase this year. That`s why investors are pouring into the market and building new apartments.</p><p>STAN HUMPHRIES, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ZILLOW: Assuming you can buy the property cheaply or build it cheaply and you can rent it out, then you`re seeing 4.5 percent growth in your top line numbers for what you are able to rent it out for looks pretty attractive.</p><p>GERSH: But the outlook varies depending on where you live and how strong the job market is in your area.</p><p>SMITH: The market will be up a lot more in Texas than it will be in parts of the east coast. Of course, on the west coast we`ve got a bit of a housing shortage. Inventory is tightest there. So I think there we will continue to see starts and see more starts in the future, simply because we`ve got tight inventory.</p><p>GERSH: Economists say housing is far from normal but it is now strong enough that it`s once again playing its traditional supporting role for the economy following a tough recession. Darren Gersh, NBR, Washington.</p><p>GHARIB: Joe Davis joins us now. He`s chief economist at Vanguard. That`s the giant mutual fund company. Joe, nice to have you with us on this important day. Let me start by asking you, do you think the Fed is taking on too much risk?</p><p>JOE DAVIS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VANGUARD GROUP: I think there is an argument that can be made. We`ve had a concern for more than a year that there are both costs as well as benefits with respect to very aggressive monetary policy. And just some of the behavior we`ve seen in the financial markets. I know the earlier report talked about excessive risk taking. So I`ve had a concern that those costs associated with monetary policy may not have been given the sort of credence they should have been. So a positive development in my mind, to today`s minutes was that Federal Reserve policymakers were more aggressively talking about both the pros and cons with respect to aggressive monetary policy.</p><p>GHARIB: One thing that we`ve been hearing repeatedly from the Federal Reserve is that they`re not going to make any change in this policy, raising interest rates or anything like that, until the economy is stronger. Most notably that the job market picks up, that the unemployment rate gets to the 6.5 percent level. So given today`s numbers that we`ve had on housing and given that we`re seeing that gasoline prices are going up, is the economy really strong enough to even begin talking about raising interest rates?</p><p>DAVIS: I don`t know about that, but I think it is important to start talking about the beginning of the end in terms of how aggressively the Federal Reserve has purchased certain securities, particularly fixed-income securities. And so I think in that regard, I would make the case that the economy is markedly stronger today than it was just a year or two ago. You mentioned housing. The business sector, consumers are less debt-burdened than they were two or three years ago. And so by those measures, I`m hard- pressed to find the reason why six months from now, the Federal Reserve would have the pedal to the floor of the car so to speak as they have had for the past two or three years.</p><p>GHARIB: What is going to be the time table on this? To some extent, we saw with the gold prices today and oil prices that commodities are already responding to some changes in the marketplace. But when do you think that the Fed realistically will be acting on an exit strategy?</p><p>DAVIS: I think the exit strategy will be over the next six to 12 months in terms of more vocal conversations and guidance with respect to the amount and the frequency of their purchases. I think a later stage is then contemplation of raising interest rates, raising the Fed funds rate, which is effectively at zero. I think there it will be much more important on the labor market front in terms of job progress. I think all the other conditions are in place to see a modest acceleration in job growth, but it is going to take some time to bring that unemployment rate down, if I`m correct, that some Americans return to the labor force.</p><p>GHARIB: One concern for a lot of people as investors is what do I do now? A lot of people started putting money in the market. I know you`re an economist, but you also are at Vanguard with all of the mutual funds. What is the view at Vanguard about what investors should be doing right now, given the uncertainty about this and things going on in Washington?</p><p>DAVIS: I think the hardest thing to do but I think what many investors actually are doing is to actually look through some of these headlines, to embrace that long-term orientation, look at the balance and risks and what you`re trying to achieve with your portfolio. And if that ascertation (ph) of that plan is the same today as it was two, five, 10 years ago, it is really critical to stick with that plan. I think even going back three years ago, our message to clients was, listen, the economic environment may be challenging, but you can still have decent portfolio returns. And actually since that time, we`ve had decent portfolio returns, both on the equity market as well as in bond portfolios. So continuing to reaffirm that message and for investors to stay invested in markets. Because we are going to have ups and downs as the economy just muddles through some of this.</p><p>GHARIB: A lot more to talk about and we`ll continue this conversation, but we have to wrap it up for now. Thanks so much, Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard.</p><p>DAVIS: Thank you, Susie.</p><p>RUBEN RAMIREZ, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Still ahead, Martha`s in the middle of a courtroom showdown between two major retailers. What`s at stake for the stores and her brand?</p><p>HUDSON: There is progress to report tonight from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on the battery issue plaguing its 787 Dreamliner. Still the planes remain grounded this evening. The aircraft maker may have found a fix for the plane`s battery problems, by making bigger gaps between battery cells, that`s according to Reuters. Boeing`s head of commercial engines is expected to meet with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration Friday to present a 10-point plan to prevent battery fires or meltdowns. Neither Boeing (NYSE:BA) nor the FAA are commenting. Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose slightly today to close at $74.78 per share.</p><p>GHARIB: Two big and struggling office supply companies are teaming up. Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) is merging with Office Max in a stock deal valued at more than $1 billion. A union of the two companies has been rumored for years, given trouble in the office supply sector. But investors didn`t buy in to the concept. Shares of Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tumbled 16 percent; Office Max fell 7 percent and even rival Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) was down today on the news, off 7 percent. Erika Miller reports.</p><p>ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you want a good read on the economy, it helps to watch demand for office supplies. When the economy is booming, businesses need more pens, paper and printers. But growth has been weak since the great recession and that has meant less demand for office products. Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max have been struggling behind industry leader Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS).</p><p>LIANG FENG, SPECIALTY RETAIL ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR: Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is just -- their retail store is about 25-30 percent more productive than comparable locations. And they also have much more attractive business customer mix. They have the mid-size customers, compared to Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max which are dependent on the lower margin large customers.</p><p>MILLER: Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max hope by merging, they will be able to save big bucks by closing stores, combining operations, cutting advertising costs and negotiating better prices from suppliers. But office supply stores are also facing stiff competition from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those retailers have lower cost structures which often means lower prices. What`s worse, the office supply stores are losing their most lucrative customers.</p><p>FENG: Your highest margin customers are your small business customers or somebody who just wants to buy something for the home office. And what we`ve seen is that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are targeting these higher margin small business customers.</p><p>MILLER: Those struggles are reflected in the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max stock prices. Shares of both companies have plunged more than 70 percent from their highs back in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) tried to merge in 1997, but the deal was blocked by regulators because of fear it would lead to higher prices. But most industry experts give this deal a high probability of going through. Longer-term, this deal is expected to be good for Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max, but also their biggest competitor. If Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max close stores, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) will face competition. Erika Miller, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: Combined these two companies have about 2,000 retail stores in North America. And as Erika just mentioned, some of those stores are expected to close, if the deal happens. That potentially could leave vacant millions of square feet of commercial real estate. Brian Jones is a portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman real estate fund. He joins us tonight from the NASDAQ. Brian, what kind of shape is retail real estate in as it faces what could be a pretty big consolidation?</p><p>BRIAN JONES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE FUND: Well, thank you for having me tonight. I think retail real estate is in a very good situation right now. What we`ve seen over the past two years have been improving occupancies and in many of the better markets, we`re beginning to see rental rate growth. This is largely driven by the fact that there is very little new construction of retail centers going on in the United States currently. And thus, any retailers looking to grow have to find space in the existing centers in order to fund and continue their growth efforts.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s assume that Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are successful in combining their resources. Does this square footage, presumably that would become vacant in the years ahead, actually help relieve some of the pressure that you`re seeing today?</p><p>JONES: Well, what we would say is that these two tenants are still relatively small when compared to the total pie of retail real estate. When we looked at the REITs in our coverage universe, we found that combined, Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max were in every case at less than 2 percent of the rental revenues for the REITs in our coverage universe. So together, they`re relatively small tenants for the overall retail REIT universe and the retail space in general. What it will provide is the opportunity for some of the retailers that have growth plans to actually find centers to grow in. And so we think that over time, a lot of the stores that are closed will be released to stronger tenants. And in many cases, that will end up strengthening the underlying center, where the Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) or the Office Max have gone out.</p><p>HUDSON: You mentioned your coverage universe and you did bring along one kind of outdoor shopping real estate investment trust that you do like here, Federal reality investment trust, ticker on this one is FRT. What make this on stand out in a crowded market?</p><p>JONES: One thing I would like to point out is that this highlights one of the benefits of investing in REITs, as opposed to a single piece of direct real estate. Most of the retail REITs in our coverage universe own dozens, if not hundreds, of retail centers. So they`re generally diversified by geography or by tenant mix and by product type. So Federal realty is an excellent example of a retail REIT that owns high quality centers in areas that have high population densities and above average incomes. And these are the locations where many of the growing retailers, such as TJ Max and Marshal`s, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Rack, Five Guys Burgers, Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) -- the retailers that are looking to grow are focused on these higher income, higher density markets. And this is where Federal is positioned. And we think that they are positioned to do well in the future.</p><p>HUDSON: OK.</p><p>JONES: Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Office Max are not within their top 25 tenants.</p><p>HUDSON: Gotcha. And that`s something you like at this point for FRT. Do you have a position in the fund in that stock?</p><p>JONES: Yes, we do own Federal reality in our mutual funds, the Neuberger Berman real estate fund.</p><p>HUDSON: And you help manage it. It is Brian Jones along with us tonight from Neuberger Berman. Thanks Brian.</p><p>JONES: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: It`s Macy`s (NYSE:M) versus JC Penney in a high stakes fight over bed linens, cocktail napkins and kitchen tools. At issue here, who will be allowed to carry products with Martha Stewart`s name on them? Macy`s (NYSE:M) has been selling Stewart`s merchandise since 2007. It claims it owns the exclusive rights to carry her home furnishings. But rival JC Penney argues it has the right to sell other Stewart-branded products that Macy`s (NYSE:M) doesn`t carry. Ruben Ramirez reports.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Martha`s in the middle, as two of the nation`s best-known department stores fight in New York State Supreme Court over just who can carry the domestic diva`s home products.</p><p>GREG LITTLE, PARTNER, WHITE &amp; CASE: Two different companies are looking at the same agreement and are interpreting it different ways. Macys is interpreting it very broadly; Penney`s is interpreting it very narrowly.</p><p>RAMIREZ: There`s no denying the appeal of carrying Martha Stewart`s brand. Macy`s (NYSE:M) says it has billions of dollars on the line.</p><p>MICHAEL APPEL, FOUNDER, APPEL &amp; ASSOCIATES: For Macys, having a differentiated exclusive brand is critical to their competitive strategy and they`ve invested a lot of time and effort in building up the Martha Stewart brand, giving her exposure in the stores and it`s a linchpin of their home strategy.</p><p>RAMIREZ: For, JCP, Martha is a key part of its store within a store turnaround plan.</p><p>APPEL: She can appeal to the kind of customer that Penney`s has and the customer whom they want to get which is more I think a little more upscale than what they have right now.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Penney`s is counting on a clause in Stewart`s original contract with Macy`s (NYSE:M), which allowed her to open stand-alone stores, arguing the clause never said that stand alone shops could not be inside a bigger store. If JCP is successful, Appel says it opens up another retail channel for Stewart`s company.</p><p>APPEL: The merchandising end of her business is the only part of her business right now that is growing and is profitable and for her to be able to increase her distribution is critical to her business strategy.</p><p>RAMIREZ: The trial got underway in a Manhattan Federal courtroom today and now that it`s begun, attorneys say a settlement could be coming.</p><p>LITTLE: There is something about a trial that forces parties to look at the facts a little bit differently than they do when they`re not at trial and it may well be that they reach a compromise at that point.</p><p>RAMIREZ: Martha Stewart, along and the CEOs of both Macy`s (NYSE:M) and JC Penney are expected to take the stand. The trial is slated to last about two-and-a-half weeks. But unlike other courtroom cases which are decided by a jury, one judge will decide the outcome of this one. Ruben Ramirez, NBR, New York.</p><p>HUDSON: In the \"Market Focus\" here today, what started out as just some mild selling picked up this afternoon with some Federal Reserve officials worrying about how long to keep buying bonds to help the economy. Here`s the daily trade for the S&amp;P 500. Now the news from the Federal Reserve came out just after 2:00 Eastern time. That`s when the index starting seeing some selling momentum. The index finished down by 1.2 percent. Remember though, it was at a five and a half year high at yesterday`s close. Trading volume though did pick up, 815 million shares moving on the big board, two billion traded on the NASDAQ.</p><p>All 10 of the major stock sectors were lower today. The materials sector seeing the biggest loss, down 2.8 percent followed by the selling that we saw in energy and consumer discretionary sectors.</p><p>Two gold and copper miners saw the heaviest selling among those material stocks. Gold and copper metal prices were down sharply today. Freeport McMoran falling 6 percent. This is a two-and-a-half month low for FCX. Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) falling 5.5 percent, NEM tonight at a new 52-week low. AA, aluminum maker Alcoa (NYSE:AA) hit too, falling 3.3 percent. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been seeing aluminum prices stabilize.</p><p>In addition to the drop in new home construction last month, we heard from home builder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL). It earned $0.03 per share in the last quarter, certainly an improvement from the loss a year ago, but considerably less than estimates. The company reported that average selling prices were lower. Shares were lower as well, falling 9 percent. The stock has lost 10 percent in less than a week after staging a big rally over the past year. Other homebuilder stocks getting hit. Pulte Group falling 6.8 percent, DR Horton off by 5.8 percent.</p><p>Foxconn is not a household name in the U.S., but if you use an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) computer or many other dozens of other electronic devices, Foxconn is the Taiwanese company that assembles it. Today Foxconn said it has frozen the hiring of assembly line workers in China after the lunar holiday there. That fed speculation about demand for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and HP products. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares falling 2.2 percent since the plant affected makes iPhone fives, but Foxconn said its decision is not related to making the iPhone. An analyst at investment banking firm UBS thinks it could be instead because of less demand for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) desktop computers. HPQ shares down by 1.1 percent. HPs quarterly earnings are due tomorrow after the closing bell, one to watch.</p><p>Independent energy companies Devon and Anadarko updated their shareholders on their latest strategies. Both though were greeted today with selling. APC is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), down 4.5 percent. Its energy production outlook was less than expected while its forecast for capital spending was more than anticipated. Anadarko says it expects to be among the most active deepwater drillers this year. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) falling 6.6 percent after saying it may try again to spin off its pipeline and processing businesses. It tried that six years ago, but stopped after the economy weakened.</p><p>Four of the five most actively traded exchange-traded products were lower on the broad market sell-off. The S&amp;P 500 volatility note though jumped 8.6 percent. It usually moves in the opposite direction of the broad market as it did today. And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>GHARIB: Whether it`s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram or Pinterest, there always seems to be a hot start-up in the tech pipeline. But as tonight`s commentator explains, the next big tech company might not be as original as you think. He`s Harry Lin, executive-in-residence at Idealab. It`s a technology incubator in Pasadena, California.</p><p>HARRY LIN, EXECUTIVE-IN-RESIDENCE, IDEALAB: An irony in the world of technology start-ups is that we tend to copy each other a lot. I call this ironic because the image of tech start-ups is that they`re all about innovation and risk taking. Yet, venture capital investors and tech entrepreneurs all know that for every Instagram that gets launched, there are at least 10 other start-ups that pretty much are Instagram, just with a different name. Did you know that there are at least three well-funded startups? I`m talking more than $10 million of investor capital, that match dog owners with dog sitters? The number of me-too start-ups goes crazy when you look at other types of products and services: project management software, call ordering food online, music streaming, cloud file storage and I can`t even keep track of all the fashion and clothing sale sites duking it out on the Internet. There are scores of them! Even Pinterest has at least half a dozen straight up clones.</p><p>So why is an industry that`s supposedly about innovation and disruption so quick to copy itself? Investors may call their capital venture, but they`re looking for safe bets. So when something seems to be working, why not invest in the same thing? We also know that in some niches, there`s space for several winners, so maybe investing in the me-too will work out. The entrepreneurial myth is that we invent new stuff, when, much of the time, we engineer twists or slants on old stuff. It`s really, really hard to come up with a brand-new idea that`s never been tried. So this copy-catting will continue and I`ll continue to call it ironic. I`m Harry Lin.</p><p>HUDSON: Whether copy cats or not, all entrepreneurs certainly face difficulty at one time or another staying motivated. Our NBRU partners at Vanderbilt University have eight steps for staying motivated to reach long- term goals. Just head to nbr.com and look for that NBRU tab.</p><p>GHARIB: And let`s take a look at what`s coming up tomorrow on NBR. Ford is hiring. It`s adding jobs at its Cleveland plant that builds the eco-boost engines. But it`s not alone. We look at job creation in the U.S. auto industry.</p><p>HUDSON: That`s it for the broadcast here on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Wednesday night, February 20. Have a great evening, you too Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you Tom.

We saw ups and big slides down. But now that the nerve-wracking week is over, what happens next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Sentenced reduced. He was the man at the center of one of the most notorious financial scandals in U.S. history. And today, the former CEO of Enron was told he'll get out of jail early.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Age of insourcing. After years of seeing jobs go overseas, companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are reversing the trend and keeping some jobs right here in the U.S.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 21st</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone. And welcome. I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>Sue Herera joins me tonight. Susie Gharib has the evening off.</p><p>Well, you couldn't really call it a come back day, not after Thursday's 350-point Dow infarction. But the patient was stabilized, despite some wild swings on the so-called quadruple winching day when certain options and future contracts expire.</p><p>On heavy volume, the Dow rocked and rolled and finished 41 points higher at 14,799. The NASDAQ was dragged lower, especially by Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which fell 9 percent on an earnings miss last quarter reported yesterday. NASDAQ dipped more than seven points, to $33.57. The S&amp;P 500 gained mere four points, to 1,592. The yield on the benchmark 10- year treasury note, hitting 2.59 percent, the highest in nearly two years.</p><p>Overall, the week answered some questions: no, stocks don't always go up; yes, the Fed will stop buying bonds sometimes. But it also left some queries hanging in the winds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): For most of us, thoughts about our investments this week were unnerving, to say the least.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a lot of uncertainty out there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you take a few bruises, you got to put your best game in there. What do you do? That's the stock market. That's how it works.</p><p>MATHISEN: At the start of the week a two-day run-up on the Dow and S&amp;P put May's record highs back in sight.</p><p>Then came Wednesday, and a 200-point drop after Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke put investors on notice with word the Fed may trim its bond-buying before the end of the year and end it not long after that.</p><p>BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: We will continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid year.</p><p>MATHISEN: With the end of the Fed's asset buying program in sight, stocks dropped another 300 points Thursday before stabilizing today. Of course, that plan depends on whether the economy continues to improve.</p><p>Gone in two days were the last two months of gains in the stock market. For the year, though, stocks are still up more than 12 percent, even if a lot of us have doubts about the health of the economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unemployment needs to be fixed, it's horrible. The housing market still isn't really good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm worried about the economy.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what's next? The year is almost half way down. Corporate reports will come out soon, even experts are nervous. That housing recovery, well, mortgage rates are inching up.</p><p>BRAD HUNTER: Everyone is getting a little spooked.</p><p>MEGAN MCGRATH: These stocks are going to be very volatile until we get some clarity around what the Feds doing.</p><p>MATHISEN: There is no shortage of opinions even inside the Fed itself.</p><p>St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, still worried about the economy today said the announcement of a bond-buying pullback was, quote, \"inappropriate time\".</p><p>Others say Bernanke and Fed got just what they wanted.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS: I think the Fed was purposely trying to take some air out of the housing market and stock market. They don't want the stock market going up 20 percent every six months. They don't want house prices rising 10-plus percent year over year for the next five years.</p><p>MATHISEN: But others took Bernanke at his word, that the economy is recovering, that a policy charge is just a short-term shock to the system.</p><p>DAVID KELLY: We're bating over medicating this economy. This economy is like a 12-year-old sitting on a bicycle with training wheels. It can cycle forward on its own.</p><p>DAVID SEABURG, COWEN &amp; COMPANY: Where are you going to put your money right now? In cash? I don't think so.</p><p>Are you going to put it in the 30-year? I don't have an interest in having that duration risk. I'm going to put it in equity.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And with the quarter ending next week, market watchers say they expect professional investors to buy blue chips to dress up their portfolios.</p><p>HERERA: Some burned investors in bankrupt energy giant Enron may have a little bit more to be upset about today. A shortened prison sentenced for the jailed one-time chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling.</p><p>Scott Cohn was in the courtroom for this controversial decision today and he joins us live from Houston.</p><p>So, Scott, why the more lenient resentencing and why right now?</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, since, Sue, it makes sense for a guy in charge of an energy trading company, this was basically a trade off. A federal appeals court had already said that the original sentence, 24 years, was too harsh. It should be more like 15 or 16 years.</p><p>Skilling wasn't willing to settle for that initially. He was going to charge the government committed misconduct in prosecuting the case. That would drag it out for a whole lot longer.</p><p>So, ultimately, the government and Skilling came to this agreement, where Skilling would drop the remaining appeals, $40 million would be returned to the investors, the convictions would stand but he would get out of prison early, basically 14 years. But time out for good behavior, he'll be out in about 11 or in 2017.</p><p>MATHISEN: Give us a sense, Scott, if you would, of the atmosphere in the courtroom today and how did Skilling look? You've been working this story for years.</p><p>COHN: Skilling is 59 years old and he looks every bit of that. He's grown a beard since he's been in prison. He looks like he's aged somewhat. He was in prison garb. In handcuffs initially and then they took them off.</p><p>This courtroom was packed with Skilling supporters. The judge said 250 people had written in support of Jeff Skilling. Among the people in the courtroom, Skilling's family, his wife Rebecca, members of Ken Lay's family. Remember, Ken Lay passed away in 2006, shortly after he was convicted, then those convictions wiped out.</p><p>One victim spoke for those who are victimized by this scandal, Dianna Peters, a former Enron employee, who said that Skilling betrayed the employees' trust.</p><p>HERERA: Talk more about that, Scott. What exactly does this mean for Enron's victims?</p><p>COHN: Well, for one thing, they will get this $20 million held in escrow since the trial in 2006. All of that money will go to the victims.</p><p>Now, that's pittance in terms of the $60 billion or so that was lost and there have been some big settlements in the order of about $7 billion mainly with some of the banks that were involved. But they will get some money back and that's something that the Justice Department is emphasizing in all of this, that they didn't come down that much from what the appeals court wanted. People will get their money back and most important, they say, Skilling will not be able to challenge his convictions.</p><p>MATHISEN: Scott Cohn, an honorary citizen of Houston after all the type you spent down there -- Scott, have a good weekend.</p><p>Good news about jobs to tell you about. Unemployment rates fell in about half in all states in May led by big declines on the jobless rolls in California, West Virginia, New York and Hawaii. California's unemployment rate is now 8.6 percent, higher than average. But it is at its lowest in five years.</p><p>Overall, North Dakota has the lowest of unemployment, 3.2 percent, and Nevada, the highest at 9.3 percent. The rates rose in 17 states and remained the same in eight more.</p><p>HERERA: And there was also good news, about autos sales, but this time, used auto sales. Car Max, the nation's biggest used car dealership chain with 120 stores nationwide, reported a 21 percent rise in profits last quarter on a 22 percent jump in sales. Prices on those used cars were also up about 1 percent from a year ago.</p><p>MATHISEN: If you're flying instead of driving, there may be some relief on board that plane. The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to relax the ban on using some personal electronic devices during taxiing, take-offs and landings and low altitude flying. The ban of making cell phone calls, however, will likely remain in effect but passengers may soon be allowed to use e-readers, tablets and MP3 players without admonishment from airline staff.</p><p>The actor Alec Baldwin who was famously thrown off an American Airlines flight in 2011 for refusing to stop playing the game \"Words with Friends\" on his smartphone during take off tweeted this reaction, \"If you're flying first class on American Air, I'd still apply an extra measure of restraint.\"</p><p>HERERA: Well, the easing back of those airline rules may have turned the initial public stock offering for Gogo into more of a no-no. Shares of the airline Internet service provider tumbled on their first day of trading today. After pricing last night at $17 a share, Gogo shares closed nearly 6 percent lower, at exactly $16 a piece.</p><p>Another big tech company is on the move. The company that makes smartphones for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Mac Pros for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is making efforts to move manufacturing back to the U.S. It's called onshoring.</p><p>And Jon Fortt has our story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's become an article of faith in America these days, manufacturing jobs that have gone overseas can't come back. American workers cost too much and don't have the cutting-edge skills to build the latest gadgets.</p><p>But what if that is wrong? In just the past month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) have both announced products they plan to make here. Apple's, a high end computer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is designed by brilliant engineers in California and assembled here in the USA.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a fantastic device we want to get in the hands.</p><p>FORTT: Google's, a risky new smartphone we haven't seen yet.</p><p>(on camera): For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's a major gamble. If it succeeds, made in America is a major selling point for a cutting-edge phone. If it fails, American dreams and real American jobs are at stake.</p><p>ROBERT REICH, UNIV. OF CA (NASDAQ:CA)., BERKELEY: Certainly, it will boost morale. I mean, I think a lot of people for a long time were kind of economic determinist. They assumed that our jobs, particular our low-skill jobs would go abroad to the lowest waged countries, and that was never wholly the case, but when manufacturing does start coming back, people's hopes will get up.</p><p>FORTT (voice-over): Flextronics, the contract manufacturer, will be building both Apple's Mac Pro and Google's Motorola X phone, both later this year. Why make them in the U.S.? The cost of labor is raising in China and Malaysia, for one.</p><p>And as innovators like Tesla have shown, when there is a brand-new high margin product that needs close attention, sometimes, it's worth it to have it crafted close to home.</p><p>MIKE MCNAMARA, FLEXTRONICS CEO: We're seeing a lot of work move into places like Texas where we put up the Moto X factory and as well into North Carolina, South Carolina. These kinds of places, the governments are very aggressive at improving regulation so it's pro-business and keeping taxes down and really working to stimulate jobs.</p><p>FORTT (on camera): It will probably take years for this story to play out for us to see if tech really can bring American manufacturing jobs back long-term. But this initial chapter is key. If names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can't succeed at this, chances are the others won't be about to, either.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, how big American companies are taking advantage of an even bigger trend, urbanization, especially in China. But, first, a look at the best performing stocks of the S&amp;P this week.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Violent protests continue to rock the streets of Brazil's biggest cities for the second week running. As an estimated 1 million people rallied against the government for raising prices on public service last night, some cities even cancelled the transit fair hikes that set off those demonstrations a week ago. But that didn't stop the protest. More unrest is expected tonight in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, and other major cities.</p><p>MATHISEN: Two U.S. senators say a Chinese company's purchase of Smithfield Foods (NYSE:SFD) is quote difficult to square, but the Chinese's government's restrictions on U.S. pork and beef exports. Senators Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and a Republican, say the interest of U.S. farmers and ranchers must be protected, calling for a full review of Shuanghui group's planned acquisition of Smithfield. That's the world's largest pork producer.</p><p>HERERA: And in China, the government is pushing ahead with a sweeping plan to move millions of rural residents into more populated areas and this growth and urbanization has not gone unnoticed by some of America's biggest companies.</p><p>Eunice Yoon reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): All over the world, people are heading to the cities. Nowhere of that more true than in China. By 2030, one in eight people on the planet will live in a Chinese city.</p><p>That's good for companies like Honeywell.</p><p>STEPHEN SHANG, HONEYWELL CHINA CEO: The wealth of these people is increasing at a tremendous peak.</p><p>YOON: Honeywell is betting big on China's plans to build up its cities. The American industrial giant has opened up new factories like this one in a midwestern city of Chongqing, expecting its urbanization expertise in the U.S. and Europe to translate here.</p><p>SHANG: Urbanization is really, if you look at it, it's a building of the mega, mega movement and not in one location but all across China, new towns, new subways, new trains, new planes, new hospitals and they are all in the Honeywell scope.</p><p>YOON (on camera): If China wasn't urbanizing at this fast a pace, would your growth be as strong?</p><p>SHANG: Of course not.</p><p>YOON (voice-over): Honeywell is making and selling brake pads here. It's targeting sales growth about double the country's growth rate, which is currently above 7 percent.</p><p>To build it cities, China needs everything, Australian iron for steel beams to American bulldozers.</p><p>(on camera): At shopping plazas like this one, you can see all sorts of international brands, with more and more for Chinese moving into the city, companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), H&amp;M, and Gucci can make more consumers here than ever before.</p><p>SHANG: They create jobs for us in China, but also create jobs for U.S. Many of this product know-how (ph) is in the foreign countries. As in the process of localization, you actually create for jobs for these foreign countries, whether it's the U.S., Germany or U.K. So everybody benefits.</p><p>YOON (voice-over): Welcomed news with economy so weak back at home.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And tonight in \"Market Focus\", some bargain hunting on the day after the big Dow dipper.</p><p>Bristol-Myers gaining back most of its Thursday's loss as investors cheered FDA labeling approval for leukemia treatment. Shares of Bristol- Myers up 2.5 percent on above average volume. It closed at $45.73.</p><p>DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) meanwhile, touching a new five-year high as it abandoned its efforts to acquire Sprint. DISH took on more than $2.6 billion in debt and interest to finance the Sprint deal. They're not going to be spending it now. That didn't matter to the market today as DISH network gained more than 3 percent to close at $41.40. DISH up 7 percent since it lost that Sprint bid back in April.</p><p>HERERA: Archer Daniels Midland gained after saying that it's in talks to sell its coco business, about 4 percent of its overall sales. ADM shares were up almost 1 1/2 percent, closing at $33.09.</p><p>And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also gained today on an upgrade to buy from neutral over at UBS. And some astonishing stats on Instagram video. One year of video was uploaded in the first eight hours. In other words, it would take a year to watch all of those videos and remember, they are only 15 seconds long.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) acquired Instagram in September of 2012. And in today's trade, shares tacked on 2 1/2 percent, closing at $24.53.</p><p>MATHISEN: And time now to turn our attention to this week's market monitor guest who says she is positive on equities both over the short and the long-term. She's Judy Saryan, portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance.</p><p>Judy, welcome. What a week, great week to have you here with us.</p><p>Explain why you think this is not just -- not a fatally wounded bull market.</p><p>JUDY SARYAN, EATON VANCE PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Well, I'm very happy to be here, Tyler.</p><p>I think that the move by the Fed and the comments by Bernanke indicate that the economy is growing. It's not growing too rapidly. It's not growing too slowly. It's just right.</p><p>And I think that is really the key underpin of the market.</p><p>So, we're very positive about the market, both near term and long term. The Fed is basically on the track that they set. There is really nothing new in what they said.</p><p>HERERA: Judy, though, we did see a lot of volatility this week and we've seen interest rates move quite a bit higher than they were a couple weeks ago. Does that worry you at all? I mean, it's good for savers certainly. But does it worry you about the market's ability to move forward in the market?</p><p>SARYAN: The interest level has moved up. It was pretty dramatic in the last couple weeks. But at this current level, the 10-year Treasury 2.5 percent, that's still a very reasonable interest rate. I believe the economy can grow with that rate. It's not a problem for the housing market.</p><p>And, of course, the housing market is key for the growth in the economy but housing is still extremely affordable at record rates in terms of affordability. It would take rates going much higher before we saw that, you know, really affect or impact the housing market.</p><p>MATHISEN: I think our viewers have their pencils ready, Judy, for a couple of your stocks picks. And a couple of stocks on your list this week are banks -- one big, one somewhat smaller. Let's start with the big one, which is Citigroup (NYSE:C).</p><p>SARYAN: OK. Well, at Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance, where you focus on fundamentals and the fundamentals are very positive for Citigroup (NYSE:C). There are several positive factors favoring Citigroup (NYSE:C). There's an improvement in the capital market's activity.</p><p>Also, Citigroup (NYSE:C) benefits from the real estate market. In fact, they are going to be releasing $8.5 billion in reserves from the North American Mortgage business. So that will be a strong tail wind to earnings looking out this year.</p><p>On top of that, the evaluation is very attractive. The stock is selling at 63 percent of book, a low P/E ratio and I think the stock could get up to book value.</p><p>HERERA: I would assume housing would help the next pick, which is Regions.</p><p>SARYAN: Absolutely. Regions Financial is a regional bank. About 55 percent of their portfolio is in loans so they benefit from the real estate market. They are selling at a very attractive valuation. They have a reasonable yield and we're expecting dividend growth out of Regions as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's see if we can squeeze in two more very quickly, 15 seconds for each. One is Sanofi and the other is Phillips 66.</p><p>SARYAN: OK. On Sanofi, it's a French-based company. Great pharmaceutical company. Very strong position in the diabetes market place. They've got one of the strong insulin drugs and that business is doing very well. They've also got some very strong positions in the vaccine business.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Phillips.</p><p>SARYAN: And on Phillips, they are -- became independent about a year ago from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Strong free cash flow, over $4 billion we project this year and potential to grow that dividend at a very nice clip, very inexpensive stock, selling at a 7 multiple on P/E. Great stuff.</p><p>MATHISEN: I assume, Judy, that your funds own all of these companies or your business does. Any other disclosures?</p><p>SARYAN: No, that would be the primary disclosure.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Judy, thank you very much. Judy Saryan is portfolio manager with Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance.</p><p>And still ahead, after falling, excuse me, to the bottom of the pizza food chain, we'll show you how Domino's turned things around and delivered for shareholders.</p><p>But, first, a look at some of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P this week.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is raising its prices. The java giant plans to jack up prices on some of its drinks but only by an average of 1 percent. For some markets, the company say it will be the first price hike in about two years.</p><p>Even though coffee bean prices have been dropping, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) blames the increase on higher rents, labor costs and raising prices milk and sugar.</p><p>HERERA: And those rising material costs and changing consumer tastes are some of the biggest challenges for eateries. And there is one chain that's worked very hard to figure out what its customers want and has succeeded, delivering for both diners and investors.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has the latest in NBR series on \"Comeback Companies\" with a look at pizza giant, Domino's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDNT (voice-over): In 2009, Domino's ranked at the bottom of a consumer survey on pizza taste preferences, tied with Chuck E. Cheese's -- particularly galling for the company that virtually invented the pizza delivery chain business.</p><p>The situation was desperate.</p><p>PATRICK DOYLE, DOMINO'S PIZZA PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: The combination of poor results for a couple of years in our domestic business and then, you know, some surveys coming out that were not particularly kind to us and the quality of our pizza, it sent us into a room one day. We made the decision that it was time to really fix this.</p><p>DEANGELIS: But, now, four years later, Domino's is at the top of the latest rankings and people love their pizza.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Their food is really delicious. It's really savoring. It really feels in your taste buds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Domino's is a good place to come because it's cheap and you get a lot of food for like money and have a lot of good deals.</p><p>DEANGELIS: How did Domino's do it? First, they fixed the pizza.</p><p>DOYLE: Brought the team in and said, look, everything is on the table. You can chance anything and we just simply want to have the best pizza out there.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Then they stream lined business, adding online ordering for convenience and to drive sales.</p><p>DOYLE: Digital orders have been growing about 5 percent a year as a mix of our total sales. So we're now in the 35 percent to 45 percent range. Customer satisfaction is higher, order accuracy is higher. The ticket on those orders is a little bit higher. The labor cost is slightly little lower. So everything is better.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Those who invested in Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) has seen a sweet return, after hitting a low of $3.30 a share in November of 2008, the stock has run up nearly 1,800 percent.</p><p>The turnaround has been good for investors and also employees.</p><p>DOYLE: Over 90 percent of our franchises in the U.S. started as hourly workers in our stores, either as delivery drivers or customer service representatives. They worked their way up through -- to become a manager and then bought their first store.</p><p>DEANGELIS (on camera): But there are challenges ahead for Domino's: one is growing the international business, especially in China, to keep up with the competition.</p><p>STEPHEN ANDERSON, MILLER TABAK SENIOR RESTAUTRANT ANALYST: I think one of the ways that Domino's can succeed in China is having a broad menu approach or maybe specializing in chicken, which is a very popular fast food staple in China.</p><p>DEANGELIS: So, the stock that has doubled since last year at this time still have room to run?</p><p>ANDERSON: I don't think it moves much higher right now. I think the challenge that Domino's faces in the next 12 months. It will be up against a tougher year of comparisons, particularly in the U.S. coming off the introduction of pan pizza very late in the third quarter.</p><p>DEANGELIS: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, an appropriate end of what must inevitably be called a roller costar week on Wall Street and it comes just in time for the start of summer.</p><p>Take a look at the full throttle rollercoaster debuting today at Six Flags Magic Mountain outside Los Angeles.</p><p>I bet, Sue, you grew up going there.</p><p>HERERA: I went to Magic Mountain.</p><p>MATHISEN: It is the world's tallest and fastest looping roller coaster top speed 70 miles per hour through a 160-foot high loop.</p><p>HERERA: Mercifully, they didn't have that when I went to Magic Mountain.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Sue Herera, in for Susie Gharbi. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen have a great weekend, everybody. We'll see you back here Monday night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I think  we're going to get more of the same.  We're going to get a lot of volatile  markets and I think we're going to continue to trade off headlines.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUDSON:  2011 ends with the major stock averages pretty much where  they were one year ago.  From oil to IPOs, what to expect from the year  ahead.  It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 30th.  </p><p>Good evening and thanks for joining us. Susie is off tonight.  Investors say good bye to a year of wild market swings and lots of economic  worries but also a year that ends very close to where it began for the  major stock averages. With today's fractional losses for those averages,  the broad market ended the year virtually unchanged. The blue chip Dow  Jones Industrial Average managed to end the year on the upside rising 5.5  percent. The NASDAQ closed down this year almost 2 percent. How about the  S&amp;P 500, finishing with a loss of 4/100 of a percent, essentially in the  same place it was at the end of last year. But for the 11th straight year,  gold prices rallied, closing at $1,566 an ounce.  That marks a 10 percent  gain this year. After this roller coaster ride for investors, 2012 is set  to begin with many of the same concerns and uncertainties. Suzanne Pratt  reports from New York. </p><p>SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   Tomorrow  evening New York's famed Times Square will be filled with thousands of  people celebrating the New Year.  On Wall Street, however there will be far  less partying as stock investors say good riddance to a tough year.  2011  has been volatile due to Europe's debt crisis, slow economic growth here at  home and political uncertainty around the globe. And there's little  unanimity among financial pros as to whether 2012 will be an up or down  year for the major averages. Still most do agree trading will be sloppy and  choppy. </p><p>MIKE RYAN, CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  I think  we're going to get more of the same. We're going get a lot of volatile  markets and I think we're going to continue to trade off headlines. </p><p>PRATT:   And those headlines are likely to come out of Europe, at  least in the first half of the year. </p><p>VADIM ZLOTINIKOV, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN:  You  have uncertainty as to what is the path that Europe is going to choose.  If  it is a path of extreme austerity, you could actually depress the U.S.  companies earnings and the U.S. economic growth. If on the other hand it's  some combination of monetary easing in a framework for reducing the  deficit, that would be viewed by the market as more popular. </p><p>PRATT:   No matter what happens in the Eurozone, U.S. economic growth  is likely to be muted next year. Yes, there are signs the recovery is  gaining momentum. But headwinds are still plentiful.   Not only are job  prospects for millions of Americans bleak, but the housing market remains  in the cellar and there is one more factor likely to create uncertainty for  investors in 2012, call it a global changing of the guard. </p><p>RYAN:  Think about the countries that potentially face a change in  leadership. The United States, China, France, India, Iran, Korea, you know,  this is, these are countries that represent about half the world's GDP. So  those leadership changes can also be add to the volatility of the markets. </p><p>PRATT:  Before you head for the exits permanently, there are at least  a few reasons to be positive about stocks in 2012. Corporate profits are  expected to remain decent.  Companies can still borrow at very low rates  and don't forget the oodles of money in corporate coffers. </p><p>ZLOTINIKOV: Companies that are generating a lot of cash and are likely  to increase the payout, likely to increase dividends, I want to be clear.  This is not a new theme. It is actually an extremely crowded theme.  It has  been recommended by every single person in the world, doesn't make it  wrong. </p><p>PRATT: Investor sentiment is still a big wild card for next year.  Trading volume in the last few months has been very low, suggesting a  serious lack of conviction. And that is unlikely to change until there's  better clarity on Europe.  Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New  York. </p><p>HUDSON:   All that uncertainty has lead for one of the best place for  investors this year, it's the bond market. Most bond mutual funds did  better than stock mutual fund funds in 2011. Mutual funds focused on U.S.  government bonds gained 9 percent on the year while the average large-cap  core stock fund lost 0.3 of 1 percent. What to do after those gains?    Well, bond expert Larry Swedroe of Buckingham Asset Management shares a  portfolio suggestion for the New Year. </p><p>LARRY SWEDROE, RESEARCH DIR., BUCKINGHAM ASSET MANAGEMENT:  I think  you should have a well thought out plan, an asset allocation, maybe 60  percent stock, 40 percent bonds or if you are older maybe it is 40 percent  bonds and 60 percent stocks. And then you want to have the discipline to  stay the course.  And that means after a bond run, you are going to be  selling bonds at high prices, meaning you are going to have a nice profit,  you get to sell high. And you should be buying stocks at low prices when  expected returns are high. </p><p>HUDSON:   You can hear more of what Larry says about investing in  2012. The full interview is on our web site, just go to nbr.com. </p><p>On the eve of the New Year and new tension between the west and Iran.  The country has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow  waterway linking the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea.  Seventeen million  barrels of oil move through the strait every day. And it's about 20 percent  of all oil traded worldwide.  Iran has threatened to close the strait if it  faces new sanctions over its nuclear program. John Kilduff is with us,  founding partner at Again Capital with us at the NASDAQ.  John, you've been  following the oil market for years. How serious is the oil market taking  this new threat?   </p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, FOUNDING PARTNER, AGAIN CAPITAL:  It's taking it  relatively seriously. And it's certainly ratcheted up here over the past  several weeks. To the western countries' credit, for once, the sanctions  are biting in Iran. And that's why you are seeing a reaction by the  Iranians to them. And while though I think that they are certainly capable  of causing trouble in the strait, we're not there yet in terms of being on  the precipice. There's a lot of diplomatic dancing work to go on before  that occurs. </p><p>HUDSON:   It hasn't impacted global supply yet. Most of that oil that  runs through the Strait of Hormuz heads to Asia.  We know that China has  slowed down a little bit. But does this threaten the Asian economies?   </p><p>KILDUFF:  Well, it will. It will threaten all our economies if it were  to get blocked, even momentarily, even if it is just a single barge let's  say in the one of the two shipping lanes. The headline is going to hit the  tape. We're all going to buy it and not sort out the details until much  later. Because look, it's most of the Saudi oil.  It's Iraq's southern  production which is half of that country's output that goes through that  narrow strait, UAE and Iranian oil for that matter. So it will be a  shortage of oil that can't be made up by anyone so that is why the stakes  are so high. </p><p>HUDSON:   John, what about the ability to reroute some of that Persian  Gulf oil to pipelines and take it up to the north?   </p><p>KILDUFF:  It really is not an option. It's not going to be a  sufficient ability. Like I said, the (INAUDIBLE) oil facility off Saudi  Arabia's coast which I like to call the world's oil aorta really is  irreplaceable, just too much of a volume of oil to displace in any fashion. </p><p>HUDSON:   John, we know it is a global market for crude. U.S. crude,  domestic oil, meantime, just shy of $100 a barrel as we wind up this year.  How about the impact if this threat continues to raise tensions with the  Mideast? </p><p>KILDUFF:  Yeah, like you said, it is a global market. And the price  reverberates around the world no matter where the shortage is. We saw what  the Libyan outage did to the Brent crude oil prices and what it did to the  west Texas prices as well.  It kept it sustained at levels much higher than  we otherwise would have been. And even this Iranian situation has probably  added a good $15 to $20 a barrel in geo-political premium right now. </p><p>HUDSON:  And finally what about the demand picture in the first  quarter with Europe still in question? </p><p>KILDUFF:  It's going to be very much in doubt. Not only here we're  seeing gasoline demand consistently down about 5 percent week in and week  out and the Chinese economy is a big question mark. The data we're getting  from there is pointing to a slowdown. And whether or not it's going to be  significant or not, what remains to be seen. But they are the swing demand  center. So the way we talk about Saudi Arabia's oil being so precious to  supply, China's demand is equally as precious on the demand side of the  equation. </p><p>HUDSON:   That's the outlook as we move into the New Year for oil.  John, happy New Year to you.  </p><p>KILDUFF: Happy New Year to you.</p><p>HUDSON:  John Kilduff with us tonight from Again Capital. </p><p>From oil to IPOs this year saw the return of the Internet initial  public offering and lots of hype surrounding the trading debuts of stocks  like Linkedin and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA).  But investors did not always buy  into the hype. Joya Dass tonight looks back at the year's newest stocks and  the IPO everybody is waiting for next year. </p><p>JOYA DASS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  While the markets  renewed their appetite for companies going public in 2011, it wasn't the  blockbuster year as some had hoped. </p><p>JAMES KRAPFEL, IPO STRATEGIST, MORNINGSTAR:  The companies that went  public in 2011, on average under performed the S&amp;P 500 by 12 percentage  points. </p><p>DASS:   Big tech IPOs Linkedin, Groupon and game maker Zynga  (NASDAQ:ZNGA) started off with a bang, but finished the year in some cases  with a dull thud. </p><p>KRAPFEL:  Groupon was the second one. They were up about 25, 30  percent on the first day, immediately in the first couple of weeks fell  about 40 percent. But it has shot back up above its IPO price, which is  why, we along with others are very skeptical of that company and their  business model. </p><p>DASS:   This year's top IPO performers included Imperva, a leader in  data security. GNC Holdings, a mall favorite featuring nutrition bars.  Tangoe, a telecom group and Tesoro Logistics, a refiner and marketer of  petroleum-based products. This year's worst IPO performers included China  Century Dragon Media, a Chinese television media buyer. Friendfinder  Networks, a dating web site, Imperial Holdings, a specialty finance company  and finally Kips Bay Medical, which develops products such as mesh stents  for use in bypass surgery. And that brings us to the IPO market for 2012. </p><p>DAVID MENLOW, PRESIDENT,IPOFINANCIAL.COM (BY TELEPHONE):  The balance  sheets of the companies coming public, the deleveraged aspects of those  companies that are coming public, all point to a very strong cycle for the  IPO market. And one that is going to put the individual investor or the  institutional investor in a very advantaged position because valuation  models are at historic lows. </p><p>DASS:   Companies David is watching out for include Gogo, the company  that provides Internet access aboard planes. Software company with a focus  on the TV industry NDS Group Holdings and marketing company Exact Target  (NYSE:TGT). And then there is the 800 pound gorilla in the IPO market for  2012 better known as Facebook. </p><p>KRAPFEL: They have a prospectus ready to go, could file for the first  time in January and looks like they're targeting a second quarter 2012  filing. They're targeting a $100 billion valuation and look to raise $10  billion. </p><p>DASS:  With Facebook revenues expected to top $4 billion for 2011,  investors might just like this IPO.  Joya Dass for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,  New York. </p><p>HUDSON:   Still ahead from us tonight, pain from paying into college  to paying it off.  It was one of the big issues for the \"Occupy Wall  Street\" movement. We'll take a look at the state of student loans. </p><p>A quiet ending today through the year with the major averages sinking  just a bit, capping really a volatile year for investors. Let's go ahead  and take a look at tonight's \"Market Focus.\"  Before we take a look back at  the year that was, we will look at today's trading activity with stocks  sliding in to the New Year's holiday and the long holiday weekend. The Dow  Industrials Average spent almost the entire session in the red. The index  continued dropping into the closing bell, ending the session down a little  more than one half of 1 percent. </p><p>But as we reported at the beginning of the program, blue chips were  the stocks of interest for investors. The Dow gained 5.5 percent this year,  outpacing the other major stock averages. And leading the area for the Dow,  McDonald's, MCD, shares shooting up more than 30 percent this year as its  North American business continued to strengthen even as the company raised  some menu prices making up for higher commodity prices. </p><p>On the bottom meantime, the worst Dow stock, Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) losing more than half its value as B of A continues battling the  weak housing market -- worries about its financial stability and questions  about its corporate leadership. Earlier this month, Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) shares dipped below $5 per share. Tonight they are just above  $5.50 per share. </p><p>The stocks had plenty of ups and downs clearly this year, but it was  not as volatile as some recent years.  Thirty eight percent of trading  sessions this year had swings of at least 1 percent for the S&amp;P 500. While  that is more than last year, it's actually less volatile than what we saw  in 2009. </p><p>The year end numbers for the major indices would have been worse if it  wasn't for the nice rally in the fourth quarter that we're looking at here.  The Dow Industrials popping 12 percent this quarter, S&amp;P 500 up 11 percent.   Remember it ended the year flat. The NASDAQ gained almost 8 percent over  just the past three months. </p><p>The worst sector for the past quarter though was the telecom sector,  dragged down by AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) dropping its buyout effort of T-Mobile. Today  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the telecom company canceling plans and deciding not  go through with a new $2 fee for some wireless customers paying their bills  over the phone or online. Customers and regulators complained about that.  Shares gained just a fraction. It was enough to put Verizon (NYSE:VZ) at a  new 52-week high tonight, the stock up 13 percent this year. </p><p>Two other telecom stocks rallying nicely, prepaid wireless provider  Metro PCS jumping more than 5 percent on renewed speculation it could be a  buyout target in the New Year.  And Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR)  jumping almost 3 percent. Piper Jaffray began coverage of the stock calling  it \"neutral,\" but expecting its dividend to continue in the near term. </p><p>As we mentioned earlier, bonds beat stocks this year as investors  sought safety despite the U.S. losing its AAA credit rating this summer.  The interest rate on the 10-year government note fell today down to 1.88  percent. As the rates fall of course, bond prices rise. This is the first  year on record the 10-year note has closed out a calendar year with an  interest rate below 2 percent. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>Collectively Americans owe more money on student loans now than we do  on our credit cards. Student debt is nearing $1 trillion. This was one of  the big issues when college graduates joined \"Occupy Wall Street\" rallies  across the country this fall, many of them voicing concern about rising  tuition costs and mounting student debt crisis.  Sylvia Hall tonight takes  a look at what's fueling soaring college costs and how to pay for them. </p><p>SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you went to an  \"Occupy Wall Street\" protest, you wouldn't have had to stay long before  hearing angry cries of frustrated college graduates. The frustration has  been fueled by ever-higher college tuition forcing more students to borrow  more money to afford a higher education. </p><p>MARK KANTROWITZ, PUBLISHER, FINAID.COM: I'm very pessimistic about  college affordability over the next decade. </p><p>HALL:  Mark Kantrowitz publishes an top financial aid information web  site.  He says slim government budgets have slashed college and university  funding, leading schools to have students pay a higher price. This year  alone tuition at four-year public universities is up more than 8 percent  from last year according to the College Board. The recession also has dealt  a below to financial aid grants leaving students to foot more of the bill  than ever before.  For many it's a bigger burden than they can afford. </p><p>KANTROWITZ: We see this first and foremost with the lower and moderate  income students. They're the canaries in the cage that keel over first. </p><p>HALL:  Jane Wellman heads the Delta Cost Project, a non-profit  tracking how colleges use their funds. She points to faculty benefits as  one of the largest drivers of school spending. </p><p>JANE WELLMAN, EXECUTIVE DIR., DELTA COST PROJECT: We can't expect  students to pay for all of this. We shouldn't have to.</p><p>HALL:  She says many colleges are working to minimize tuition hikes.  The school budgets aren't nimble enough to shift quickly. </p><p>WELLMAN:  The structural problems of higher education finance have  been growing for 20 years. But the depth of the recession, the 2008  recession and the slow recovery from it, no one expects this is going to  turn around any time soon. </p><p>HALL:  With prices rising, experts like Reyna Gobel say paying for  college doesn't have to become a crisis because Federal student loans carry  a variety of payment plans. </p><p>REYNA GOBEL, AUTHOR, \"GRADUATION DEBT\":  Whatever you do, don't give  up on it, these type of loans. Don't listen to its (ph) bears because you  have so much power.  You are the consumer. No matter how much money is in  your pocket right now, you are the consumer and you have options. And don't  let's anybody tell you different. </p><p>HALL:  President Obama took up the student debt issue earlier this  year by easing payback terms on some Federal student loans.  But experts  say ultimately making college more affordable must come from how states run  higher education.  Sylvia Hall, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. </p><p>HUDSON:   Here is what we are watching for next week as 2012 gets  under way. December economic data begins pouring in. We'll see auto sales,  manufacturing and the number everybody is watching on Friday of next week - - December's employment report. Now Monday with the stock markets closed,  we'll bring you an NBR special edition. Women and leadership, focus on  Pamela Newman, one of the insurance industry's most powerful women. </p><p>While we await the auto industry's December results, strong sales help  drive Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s recovery across the new milestone.  2011 sales  of Ford brand cars and trucks topped two million units this week for the  year, the first time since 2007 that any single auto brand has hit that  mark. Ford's F-series pickup trucks were the top selling vehicle in the  nation as they have been for the past three decades. As far as total sales,  Ford remains number two U.S. auto maker behind General Motors (NYSE:GM). </p><p>President Obama put his request to increase the nation's debt limit on  hold. The White House was expected today to ask for $1.2 trillion increase  in the government's ability to borrow money.  Congressional leaders though  asked for a delay saying they would like time to address the measure when  they were back in session next month. Lawmakers are not due back in  Washington until mid-January. The government is currently within about $100  billion of reaching its borrowing  limit. </p><p>Despite all the sound and fury this year over European debt problems,  quantitative easing here in the U.S. and record corporate profits, 2011  comes to an end, where it pretty much began at least for the S&amp;P 500 stock  index. Tonight's \"Market Monitor\" has one word to describe this year --   dividends. Sam Stovall is the chief investment strategist for Standard &amp;  Poor's Capital IQ with us tonight from New York.  Happy New Year to you  Samuel. </p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: Happy New Year,  Tom. </p><p>HUDSON:   Not exactly a bull market, certainly not a bear market, it  was a market where shareholders got paid to wait.  Is that the best  description?   </p><p>STOVALL:  Absolutely. Not a bull, not a bear but a blah market and the  investors who focused on quality as well as dividend yields were the ones  who were rewarded. </p><p>HUDSON:   Yeah and you can see that when you take a look at the top  three stock sectors in the S&amp;P 500, utilities, consumer staples, health  care, kind of defensive but also sectors that traditionally pay their  shareholders. What went into that kind of stock performance this year?   </p><p>STOVALL:  I think basically the reason why you had the three best  performing sectors post total returns above 13 percent each and not be  cyclical sectors in nature is because they were substitutes for bonds.   Investors were looking for nice payouts, dividend yields, some sort of a  return that was better than money markets and also that would not present  them with the potential of a bubble as some investors fear with the bond  market.  So they focused on these good total return sectors. </p><p>HUDSON:   And at least for the utilities, a sector that really wasn't  in the headlines much, not much news going on there and perhaps it  benefited from that.   </p><p>STOVALL:  Absolutely. You would have thought that telecom services  group would have done better than it did because it does have the highest  dividend yield of all 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500. But utilities beat out the  telecom group, I think mainly as you said because of static demand and very  high dividends. </p><p>HUDSON:   Of course, in the telecom group, it was the big busted deal  with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile to end the year. Meantime financials, banks  were the weakest again. You know, it's tough to get market to move forward  when the financials aren't moving forward, isn't it?   </p><p>STOVALL:  It's tough, certainly to get them moving forward for any  long-term period. We were able to establish an all-time high back in 2007  when the financials were starting their nosedive. But obviously that  advance did not last very long as we saw in 2008.  So yes, we have the  possibility for short-term advances in the market without the financials,  but nothing that I think would be very long lasting. </p><p>HUDSON:   So here we are again at the end of another year, Sam, you  and I speaking pretty much where the S&amp;P 500 was a year ago when we were  together. But corporate profits are at record levels, so what kind of  valuation does that present investors as we begin a new year? </p><p>STOVALL:  It presents investors with a very good valuation, actually a  10 percent discount to the median P/E since 1936. And history also says but  does not guarantee that you would need to see the yield on the 10-year note  rise above 7 percent in order for the P/E on the S&amp;P to be able to fall  below 11.  So we have very attractive P/E ratios and based on the yield on  the 10-year note, not a good likelihood that we'll see single digits any  time soon. </p><p>HUDSON:   With that in mind, we'll take a look at the last year of  trading for the S&amp;P 500 and despite all the ups and downs, we are pretty  much where we began the year at and we're close to the middle of the range  from the April high to the October low. So what is the outlook for the S&amp;P  500 for 2012?   </p><p>STOVALL:  Well, the outlook on a price basis is probably a very, very  low double digit advance. Corporate profits are likely to advance by more  than 8 percent according to the S&amp;P Capital IQ consensus. Valuations look  fairly attractive, no likelihood of a recession in the U.S., in our  opinion, unless we are dragged lower by Europe and the possibility of a  hard landing in China. And from a technical perspective, our belief is that  the market is sort of like a coiled spring, poised to move higher,  certainly into the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>HUDSON:  And of course that also brings up the third and fourth  quarter of 2012, big election. Could that hold back any gains?   </p><p>STOVALL:  Well, it could hold back some gains. I think the fact that  2011 the third year of the president's term in office was such a lackluster  year, historically it implies that we could end up with a blah 2012 as  well. </p><p>HUDSON:   We'll leave it there. Happy New Year to you, great to see  you. It's our \"Market Monitor\" as we wind up the year, Sam Stovall with S&amp;P  Capital IQ. </p><p>Finally tonight, when the ball drops in Times Square, New York City  tomorrow night, it will ring in more than just the New Year. It also rings  in the new energy, independence and security Act. It's a mouth full but to  mark the occasion, all 32,000 balls on the Times Square ball are energy  efficient. The bill is designed to encourage new lighting technology like  LED and halogen bulbs.  It's aimed at cutting energy consumption and saving  consumers money. Thanks to all of those new balls this year, the Times  Square ball drop will use, get this, 88 percent less electricity than  previous years. </p><p>That's it for us for this year and for tonight.  It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT for Friday December 30th, the last trading day of 2011. I'm Tom  Hudson. Thanks for joining us. From all of us at NBR, have a happy and safe  New Year.  We'll see you back here in 2012.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.

STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: I think  we're going to get more of the same.  We're going to get a lot of volatile  markets and I think we're going to continue to trade off headlines.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HUDSON:  2011 ends with the major stock averages pretty much where  they were one year ago.  From oil to IPOs, what to expect from the year  ahead.  It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 30th.  </p><p>  Good evening and thanks for joining us. Susie is off tonight.  Investors say good bye to a year of wild market swings and lots of economic  worries but also a year that ends very close to where it began for the  major stock averages. With today's fractional losses for those averages,  the broad market ended the year virtually unchanged. The blue chip Dow  Jones Industrial Average managed to end the year on the upside rising 5.5  percent. The NASDAQ closed down this year almost 2 percent. How about the  S&amp;P 500, finishing with a loss of 4/100 of a percent, essentially in the  same place it was at the end of last year. But for the 11th straight year,  gold prices rallied, closing at $1,566 an ounce.  That marks a 10 percent  gain this year. After this roller coaster ride for investors, 2012 is set  to begin with many of the same concerns and uncertainties. Suzanne Pratt  reports from New York. </p><p>  SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:   Tomorrow  evening New York's famed Times Square will be filled with thousands of  people celebrating the New Year.  On Wall Street, however there will be far  less partying as stock investors say good riddance to a tough year.  2011  has been volatile due to Europe's debt crisis, slow economic growth here at  home and political uncertainty around the globe. And there's little  unanimity among financial pros as to whether 2012 will be an up or down  year for the major averages. Still most do agree trading will be sloppy and  choppy. </p><p>  MIKE RYAN, CHIEF INVEST. STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  I think  we're going to get more of the same. We're going get a lot of volatile  markets and I think we're going to continue to trade off headlines. </p><p>  PRATT:   And those headlines are likely to come out of Europe, at  least in the first half of the year. </p><p>  VADIM ZLOTINIKOV, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN:  You  have uncertainty as to what is the path that Europe is going to choose.  If  it is a path of extreme austerity, you could actually depress the U.S.  companies earnings and the U.S. economic growth. If on the other hand it's  some combination of monetary easing in a framework for reducing the  deficit, that would be viewed by the market as more popular. </p><p>  PRATT:   No matter what happens in the Eurozone, U.S. economic growth  is likely to be muted next year. Yes, there are signs the recovery is  gaining momentum. But headwinds are still plentiful.   Not only are job  prospects for millions of Americans bleak, but the housing market remains  in the cellar and there is one more factor likely to create uncertainty for  investors in 2012, call it a global changing of the guard. </p><p>  RYAN:  Think about the countries that potentially face a change in  leadership. The United States, China, France, India, Iran, Korea, you know,  this is, these are countries that represent about half the world's GDP. So  those leadership changes can also be add to the volatility of the markets. </p><p>  PRATT:  Before you head for the exits permanently, there are at least  a few reasons to be positive about stocks in 2012. Corporate profits are  expected to remain decent.  Companies can still borrow at very low rates  and don't forget the oodles of money in corporate coffers. </p><p>  ZLOTINIKOV: Companies that are generating a lot of cash and are likely  to increase the payout, likely to increase dividends, I want to be clear.  This is not a new theme. It is actually an extremely crowded theme.  It has  been recommended by every single person in the world, doesn't make it  wrong. </p><p>  PRATT: Investor sentiment is still a big wild card for next year.  Trading volume in the last few months has been very low, suggesting a  serious lack of conviction. And that is unlikely to change until there's  better clarity on Europe.  Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New  York. </p><p>  HUDSON:   All that uncertainty has lead for one of the best place for  investors this year, it's the bond market. Most bond mutual funds did  better than stock mutual fund funds in 2011. Mutual funds focused on U.S.  government bonds gained 9 percent on the year while the average large-cap  core stock fund lost 0.3 of 1 percent. What to do after those gains?    Well, bond expert Larry Swedroe of Buckingham Asset Management shares a  portfolio suggestion for the New Year. </p><p>LARRY SWEDROE, RESEARCH DIR., BUCKINGHAM ASSET MANAGEMENT:  I think  you should have a well thought out plan, an asset allocation, maybe 60  percent stock, 40 percent bonds or if you are older maybe it is 40 percent  bonds and 60 percent stocks. And then you want to have the discipline to  stay the course.  And that means after a bond run, you are going to be  selling bonds at high prices, meaning you are going to have a nice profit,  you get to sell high. And you should be buying stocks at low prices when  expected returns are high. </p><p>  HUDSON:   You can hear more of what Larry says about investing in  2012. The full interview is on our web site, just go to nbr.com. </p><p>  On the eve of the New Year and new tension between the west and Iran.  The country has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow  waterway linking the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea.  Seventeen million  barrels of oil move through the strait every day. And it's about 20 percent  of all oil traded worldwide.  Iran has threatened to close the strait if it  faces new sanctions over its nuclear program. John Kilduff is with us,  founding partner at Again Capital with us at the NASDAQ.  John, you've been  following the oil market for years. How serious is the oil market taking  this new threat?   </p><p>  JOHN KILDUFF, FOUNDING PARTNER, AGAIN CAPITAL:  It's taking it  relatively seriously. And it's certainly ratcheted up here over the past  several weeks. To the western countries' credit, for once, the sanctions  are biting in Iran. And that's why you are seeing a reaction by the  Iranians to them. And while though I think that they are certainly capable  of causing trouble in the strait, we're not there yet in terms of being on  the precipice. There's a lot of diplomatic dancing work to go on before  that occurs. </p><p>  HUDSON:   It hasn't impacted global supply yet. Most of that oil that  runs through the Strait of Hormuz heads to Asia.  We know that China has  slowed down a little bit. But does this threaten the Asian economies?   </p><p>  KILDUFF:  Well, it will. It will threaten all our economies if it were  to get blocked, even momentarily, even if it is just a single barge let's  say in the one of the two shipping lanes. The headline is going to hit the  tape. We're all going to buy it and not sort out the details until much  later. Because look, it's most of the Saudi oil.  It's Iraq's southern  production which is half of that country's output that goes through that  narrow strait, UAE and Iranian oil for that matter. So it will be a  shortage of oil that can't be made up by anyone so that is why the stakes  are so high. </p><p>  HUDSON:   John, what about the ability to reroute some of that Persian  Gulf oil to pipelines and take it up to the north?   </p><p>  KILDUFF:  It really is not an option. It's not going to be a  sufficient ability. Like I said, the (INAUDIBLE) oil facility off Saudi  Arabia's coast which I like to call the world's oil aorta really is  irreplaceable, just too much of a volume of oil to displace in any fashion. </p><p>  HUDSON:   John, we know it is a global market for crude. U.S. crude,  domestic oil, meantime, just shy of $100 a barrel as we wind up this year.  How about the impact if this threat continues to raise tensions with the  Mideast? </p><p>  KILDUFF:  Yeah, like you said, it is a global market. And the price  reverberates around the world no matter where the shortage is. We saw what  the Libyan outage did to the Brent crude oil prices and what it did to the  west Texas prices as well.  It kept it sustained at levels much higher than  we otherwise would have been. And even this Iranian situation has probably  added a good $15 to $20 a barrel in geo-political premium right now. </p><p>  HUDSON:  And finally what about the demand picture in the first  quarter with Europe still in question? </p><p>  KILDUFF:  It's going to be very much in doubt. Not only here we're  seeing gasoline demand consistently down about 5 percent week in and week  out and the Chinese economy is a big question mark. The data we're getting  from there is pointing to a slowdown. And whether or not it's going to be  significant or not, what remains to be seen. But they are the swing demand  center. So the way we talk about Saudi Arabia's oil being so precious to  supply, China's demand is equally as precious on the demand side of the  equation. </p><p>  HUDSON:   That's the outlook as we move into the New Year for oil.  John, happy New Year to you.  </p><p>  KILDUFF: Happy New Year to you.</p><p>  HUDSON:  John Kilduff with us tonight from Again Capital. </p><p>  From oil to IPOs this year saw the return of the Internet initial  public offering and lots of hype surrounding the trading debuts of stocks  like Linkedin and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA).  But investors did not always buy  into the hype. Joya Dass tonight looks back at the year's newest stocks and  the IPO everybody is waiting for next year. </p><p>  JOYA DASS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  While the markets  renewed their appetite for companies going public in 2011, it wasn't the  blockbuster year as some had hoped. </p><p>  JAMES KRAPFEL, IPO STRATEGIST, MORNINGSTAR:  The companies that went  public in 2011, on average under performed the S&amp;P 500 by 12 percentage  points. </p><p>  DASS:   Big tech IPOs Linkedin, Groupon and game maker Zynga  (NASDAQ:ZNGA) started off with a bang, but finished the year in some cases  with a dull thud. </p><p>  KRAPFEL:  Groupon was the second one. They were up about 25, 30  percent on the first day, immediately in the first couple of weeks fell  about 40 percent. But it has shot back up above its IPO price, which is  why, we along with others are very skeptical of that company and their  business model. </p><p>  DASS:   This year's top IPO performers included Imperva, a leader in  data security. GNC Holdings, a mall favorite featuring nutrition bars.  Tangoe, a telecom group and Tesoro Logistics, a refiner and marketer of  petroleum-based products. This year's worst IPO performers included China  Century Dragon Media, a Chinese television media buyer. Friendfinder  Networks, a dating web site, Imperial Holdings, a specialty finance company  and finally Kips Bay Medical, which develops products such as mesh stents  for use in bypass surgery. And that brings us to the IPO market for 2012. </p><p>  DAVID MENLOW, PRESIDENT,IPOFINANCIAL.COM (BY TELEPHONE):  The balance  sheets of the companies coming public, the deleveraged aspects of those  companies that are coming public, all point to a very strong cycle for the  IPO market. And one that is going to put the individual investor or the  institutional investor in a very advantaged position because valuation  models are at historic lows. </p><p>  DASS:   Companies David is watching out for include Gogo, the company  that provides Internet access aboard planes. Software company with a focus  on the TV industry NDS Group Holdings and marketing company Exact Target  (NYSE:TGT). And then there is the 800 pound gorilla in the IPO market for  2012 better known as Facebook. </p><p>  KRAPFEL: They have a prospectus ready to go, could file for the first  time in January and looks like they're targeting a second quarter 2012  filing. They're targeting a $100 billion valuation and look to raise $10  billion. </p><p>  DASS:  With Facebook revenues expected to top $4 billion for 2011,  investors might just like this IPO.  Joya Dass for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT,  New York. </p><p>  HUDSON:   Still ahead from us tonight, pain from paying into college  to paying it off.  It was one of the big issues for the \"Occupy Wall  Street\" movement. We'll take a look at the state of student loans. </p><p>  A quiet ending today through the year with the major averages sinking  just a bit, capping really a volatile year for investors. Let's go ahead  and take a look at tonight's \"Market Focus.\"  Before we take a look back at  the year that was, we will look at today's trading activity with stocks  sliding in to the New Year's holiday and the long holiday weekend. The Dow  Industrials Average spent almost the entire session in the red. The index  continued dropping into the closing bell, ending the session down a little  more than one half of 1 percent. </p><p>  But as we reported at the beginning of the program, blue chips were  the stocks of interest for investors. The Dow gained 5.5 percent this year,  outpacing the other major stock averages. And leading the area for the Dow,  McDonald's, MCD, shares shooting up more than 30 percent this year as its  North American business continued to strengthen even as the company raised  some menu prices making up for higher commodity prices. </p><p>  On the bottom meantime, the worst Dow stock, Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) losing more than half its value as B of A continues battling the  weak housing market -- worries about its financial stability and questions  about its corporate leadership. Earlier this month, Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) shares dipped below $5 per share. Tonight they are just above  $5.50 per share. </p><p>  The stocks had plenty of ups and downs clearly this year, but it was  not as volatile as some recent years.  Thirty eight percent of trading  sessions this year had swings of at least 1 percent for the S&amp;P 500. While  that is more than last year, it's actually less volatile than what we saw  in 2009. </p><p>  The year end numbers for the major indices would have been worse if it  wasn't for the nice rally in the fourth quarter that we're looking at here.  The Dow Industrials popping 12 percent this quarter, S&amp;P 500 up 11 percent.   Remember it ended the year flat. The NASDAQ gained almost 8 percent over  just the past three months. </p><p>  The worst sector for the past quarter though was the telecom sector,  dragged down by AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) dropping its buyout effort of T-Mobile. Today  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the telecom company canceling plans and deciding not  go through with a new $2 fee for some wireless customers paying their bills  over the phone or online. Customers and regulators complained about that.  Shares gained just a fraction. It was enough to put Verizon (NYSE:VZ) at a  new 52-week high tonight, the stock up 13 percent this year. </p><p>  Two other telecom stocks rallying nicely, prepaid wireless provider  Metro PCS jumping more than 5 percent on renewed speculation it could be a  buyout target in the New Year.  And Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR)  jumping almost 3 percent. Piper Jaffray began coverage of the stock calling  it \"neutral,\" but expecting its dividend to continue in the near term. </p><p>  As we mentioned earlier, bonds beat stocks this year as investors  sought safety despite the U.S. losing its AAA credit rating this summer.  The interest rate on the 10-year government note fell today down to 1.88  percent. As the rates fall of course, bond prices rise. This is the first  year on record the 10-year note has closed out a calendar year with an  interest rate below 2 percent. And that is tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>  Collectively Americans owe more money on student loans now than we do  on our credit cards. Student debt is nearing $1 trillion. This was one of  the big issues when college graduates joined \"Occupy Wall Street\" rallies  across the country this fall, many of them voicing concern about rising  tuition costs and mounting student debt crisis.  Sylvia Hall tonight takes  a look at what's fueling soaring college costs and how to pay for them. </p><p>  SYLVIA HALL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you went to an  \"Occupy Wall Street\" protest, you wouldn't have had to stay long before  hearing angry cries of frustrated college graduates. The frustration has  been fueled by ever-higher college tuition forcing more students to borrow  more money to afford a higher education. </p><p>  MARK KANTROWITZ, PUBLISHER, FINAID.COM: I'm very pessimistic about  college affordability over the next decade. </p><p>  HALL:  Mark Kantrowitz publishes an top financial aid information web  site.  He says slim government budgets have slashed college and university  funding, leading schools to have students pay a higher price. This year  alone tuition at four-year public universities is up more than 8 percent  from last year according to the College Board. The recession also has dealt  a below to financial aid grants leaving students to foot more of the bill  than ever before.  For many it's a bigger burden than they can afford. </p><p>  KANTROWITZ: We see this first and foremost with the lower and moderate  income students. They're the canaries in the cage that keel over first. </p><p>  HALL:  Jane Wellman heads the Delta Cost Project, a non-profit  tracking how colleges use their funds. She points to faculty benefits as  one of the largest drivers of school spending. </p><p>  JANE WELLMAN, EXECUTIVE DIR., DELTA COST PROJECT: We can't expect  students to pay for all of this. We shouldn't have to.</p><p>  HALL:  She says many colleges are working to minimize tuition hikes.  The school budgets aren't nimble enough to shift quickly. </p><p>  WELLMAN:  The structural problems of higher education finance have  been growing for 20 years. But the depth of the recession, the 2008  recession and the slow recovery from it, no one expects this is going to  turn around any time soon. </p><p>  HALL:  With prices rising, experts like Reyna Gobel say paying for  college doesn't have to become a crisis because Federal student loans carry  a variety of payment plans. </p><p>REYNA GOBEL, AUTHOR, \"GRADUATION DEBT\":  Whatever you do, don't give  up on it, these type of loans. Don't listen to its (ph) bears because you  have so much power.  You are the consumer. No matter how much money is in  your pocket right now, you are the consumer and you have options. And don't  let's anybody tell you different. </p><p>  HALL:  President Obama took up the student debt issue earlier this  year by easing payback terms on some Federal student loans.  But experts  say ultimately making college more affordable must come from how states run  higher education.  Sylvia Hall, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. </p><p>  HUDSON:   Here is what we are watching for next week as 2012 gets  under way. December economic data begins pouring in. We'll see auto sales,  manufacturing and the number everybody is watching on Friday of next week - - December's employment report. Now Monday with the stock markets closed,  we'll bring you an NBR special edition. Women and leadership, focus on  Pamela Newman, one of the insurance industry's most powerful women. </p><p>  While we await the auto industry's December results, strong sales help  drive Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s recovery across the new milestone.  2011 sales  of Ford brand cars and trucks topped two million units this week for the  year, the first time since 2007 that any single auto brand has hit that  mark. Ford's F-series pickup trucks were the top selling vehicle in the  nation as they have been for the past three decades. As far as total sales,  Ford remains number two U.S. auto maker behind General Motors (NYSE:GM). </p><p>  President Obama put his request to increase the nation's debt limit on  hold. The White House was expected today to ask for $1.2 trillion increase  in the government's ability to borrow money.  Congressional leaders though  asked for a delay saying they would like time to address the measure when  they were back in session next month. Lawmakers are not due back in  Washington until mid-January. The government is currently within about $100  billion of reaching its borrowing  limit. </p><p>  Despite all the sound and fury this year over European debt problems,  quantitative easing here in the U.S. and record corporate profits, 2011  comes to an end, where it pretty much began at least for the S&amp;P 500 stock  index. Tonight's \"Market Monitor\" has one word to describe this year --   dividends. Sam Stovall is the chief investment strategist for Standard &amp;  Poor's Capital IQ with us tonight from New York.  Happy New Year to you  Samuel. </p><p>  SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: Happy New Year,  Tom. </p><p>  HUDSON:   Not exactly a bull market, certainly not a bear market, it  was a market where shareholders got paid to wait.  Is that the best  description?   </p><p>  STOVALL:  Absolutely. Not a bull, not a bear but a blah market and the  investors who focused on quality as well as dividend yields were the ones  who were rewarded. </p><p>  HUDSON:   Yeah and you can see that when you take a look at the top  three stock sectors in the S&amp;P 500, utilities, consumer staples, health  care, kind of defensive but also sectors that traditionally pay their  shareholders. What went into that kind of stock performance this year?   </p><p>  STOVALL:  I think basically the reason why you had the three best  performing sectors post total returns above 13 percent each and not be  cyclical sectors in nature is because they were substitutes for bonds.   Investors were looking for nice payouts, dividend yields, some sort of a  return that was better than money markets and also that would not present  them with the potential of a bubble as some investors fear with the bond  market.  So they focused on these good total return sectors. </p><p>  HUDSON:   And at least for the utilities, a sector that really wasn't  in the headlines much, not much news going on there and perhaps it  benefited from that.   </p><p>  STOVALL:  Absolutely. You would have thought that telecom services  group would have done better than it did because it does have the highest  dividend yield of all 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500. But utilities beat out the  telecom group, I think mainly as you said because of static demand and very  high dividends. </p><p>  HUDSON:   Of course, in the telecom group, it was the big busted deal  with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile to end the year. Meantime financials, banks  were the weakest again. You know, it's tough to get market to move forward  when the financials aren't moving forward, isn't it?   </p><p>  STOVALL:  It's tough, certainly to get them moving forward for any  long-term period. We were able to establish an all-time high back in 2007  when the financials were starting their nosedive. But obviously that  advance did not last very long as we saw in 2008.  So yes, we have the  possibility for short-term advances in the market without the financials,  but nothing that I think would be very long lasting. </p><p>  HUDSON:   So here we are again at the end of another year, Sam, you  and I speaking pretty much where the S&amp;P 500 was a year ago when we were  together. But corporate profits are at record levels, so what kind of  valuation does that present investors as we begin a new year? </p><p>  STOVALL:  It presents investors with a very good valuation, actually a  10 percent discount to the median P/E since 1936. And history also says but  does not guarantee that you would need to see the yield on the 10-year note  rise above 7 percent in order for the P/E on the S&amp;P to be able to fall  below 11.  So we have very attractive P/E ratios and based on the yield on  the 10-year note, not a good likelihood that we'll see single digits any  time soon. </p><p>  HUDSON:   With that in mind, we'll take a look at the last year of  trading for the S&amp;P 500 and despite all the ups and downs, we are pretty  much where we began the year at and we're close to the middle of the range  from the April high to the October low. So what is the outlook for the S&amp;P  500 for 2012?   </p><p>  STOVALL:  Well, the outlook on a price basis is probably a very, very  low double digit advance. Corporate profits are likely to advance by more  than 8 percent according to the S&amp;P Capital IQ consensus. Valuations look  fairly attractive, no likelihood of a recession in the U.S., in our  opinion, unless we are dragged lower by Europe and the possibility of a  hard landing in China. And from a technical perspective, our belief is that  the market is sort of like a coiled spring, poised to move higher,  certainly into the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>  HUDSON:  And of course that also brings up the third and fourth  quarter of 2012, big election. Could that hold back any gains?   </p><p>  STOVALL:  Well, it could hold back some gains. I think the fact that  2011 the third year of the president's term in office was such a lackluster  year, historically it implies that we could end up with a blah 2012 as  well. </p><p>  HUDSON:   We'll leave it there. Happy New Year to you, great to see  you. It's our \"Market Monitor\" as we wind up the year, Sam Stovall with S&amp;P  Capital IQ. </p><p>  Finally tonight, when the ball drops in Times Square, New York City  tomorrow night, it will ring in more than just the New Year. It also rings  in the new energy, independence and security Act. It's a mouth full but to  mark the occasion, all 32,000 balls on the Times Square ball are energy  efficient. The bill is designed to encourage new lighting technology like  LED and halogen bulbs.  It's aimed at cutting energy consumption and saving  consumers money. Thanks to all of those new balls this year, the Times  Square ball drop will use, get this, 88 percent less electricity than  previous years. </p><p>  That's it for us for this year and for tonight.  It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT for Friday December 30th, the last trading day of 2011. I'm Tom  Hudson. Thanks for joining us. From all of us at NBR, have a happy and safe  New Year.  We'll see you back here in 2012.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts are available on-line post broadcast.
