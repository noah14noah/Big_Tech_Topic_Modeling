At the time of the planned acquisition there was little talk of downsizing, streamlining or sustainability, but now the full impact of the acquisition is becoming clear. The announcement of the impending layoffs was made in a regulatory filing made recently by Motorola Mobility and was part of the preparations for the full takeover by Google.</p><p>The 800 layoffs represent around 5% of the total employee strength at Motorola Mobility and in a statement released by Motorolaspokesperson, Jennifer Weyrauch-Erickson; the layoffs were considered part of the continued effort to \"focus on improving its financial performance by taking actions to manage the company's costs.\" This of course will do little to placate the 800 workers who will now have to find jobs to look after their families.</p><p>There's some silver lining though for the 800 workers because according top the filing, over $27 million to cover severance costs associated with the acquisition. These workers may be losing their jobs, but at least they'll get something to tide them over till something crops up.</p><p>Do you think laying off 800 workers to facilitate an acquisition is immoral?

Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, said there is potential for tech companies to use the vast power of their platforms to \"drive out competition.\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, went a step further. \"Google and Facebook have misused their monopolistic powers. It's not against the law to be big. It is against the law to misuse that power in a predatory way.\" Blumenthal argued they've done just that by \"suffocating competition.\"</p><p>Hours later, Alex Stamos, a former senior executive at Facebook, made headlines at a tech conference by saying his former boss Mark Zuckerberg arguably has \"too much power\" and should \"give up\" some of it by hiring a new CEO to run the company. Stamos suggested hiring the current president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, alluding to the seasoned executive's experience guiding the company through antitrust disputes. Then, late Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that chipmaker Qualcomm had violated US antitrust law by charging exorbitant fees to phone makers that license and use its technology.</p><p>It was both an extraordinary 24-hour period for the technology industry and also the new normal. The biggest names in Silicon Valley, once hailed by politicians like former President Barack Obama as emblematic of the best of American innovation, now must contend with mounting antitrust scrutiny from state officials, federal regulators and the European Union. </p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, the chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, has called for an antitrust investigation into Facebook, with a focus on its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which now have more than a billion users. The EU has hit Google with three separate billion-dollar antitrust fines, the most recent of which was in March for abusing its dominant position in online search advertising. Even Apple, which has sharply criticized the data privacy practices of these companies, is now on antitrust alert. The Supreme Court ruled this month that iPhone owners can sue Apple for monopolizing the App Store. </p><p>Indeed, the concentration of power in tech has emerged as an early campaign issue for the US presidential election. Sen. Elizabeth Warren put out an aggressive plan in March to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon, the latter by unwinding its acquisitions of Whole Foods and online shoe retailer Zappos. Sen. Kamala Harris, another Democratic presidential candidate, said this month that \"we have to seriously take a look\" at breaking up Facebook, which she argued had \"prioritized its growth over the best interests of its consumers.\"</p><p>\"I think everyone is feeling the jitters\"</p><p>Inside the tech industry, there is predictable skepticism about the thinking behind these calls for greater antitrust enforcement. </p><p>\"You take your crown jewel companies and try to chop them up?\" said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, which represents more than 2,200 tech companies. \"This is just pure poppycock populism.\"</p><p>But some in the industry are nonetheless reconsidering how they do business in this new era of antitrust fears, even if the political rhetoric doesn't end up translating into stricter regulatory enforcement. Tech companies are said to be thinking twice about pursuing splashy acquisitions, according to interviews in recent months with venture capitalists, former tech M&amp;A execs and public policy officials.</p><p>\"Tech companies, both big and small, are thinking more about the potential\u00a0antitrust\u00a0risk in their M&amp;A activity,\" said Logan Breed, an antitrust partner at Hogan Lovells, a law firm that has advised tech companies. \"I think everyone is feeling the jitters.\"</p><p>For big companies, the perception of further consolidating power with a billion-dollar acquisition could once again turn them into lightning rods for politicians. For startups looking to get acquired, there's a fear that deals could be held up for longer, during which time employees and customers may flee.</p><p>\"If [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] blasts you on Twitter, or if Warren talks about an acquisition as dangerous, that's going to put up a speed bump, even if the regulators might approve it,\" said Stewart Verdery, a lobbyist with Monument Policy Group, which works with Amazon and Microsoft. </p><p>\"You've got antitrust by tweet as an important factor,\" he said.</p><p>Google declined to comment on this story. Representatives for Facebook, Amazon and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p>Silicon Valley tries to adapt to a new normal</p><p>This hesitation highlights a sea change for an industry known for its acquisitive streak. In 2011, Eric Schmidt was comfortable enough to joke that Google bought one company each day. (In fact, Google was then buying about one company a week.) The next year, when Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, the conversation that followed was less about Facebook consolidating power than whether it overpaid for a startup with just 13 employees. </p><p>While the dollar figure of these acquisitions may get the attention, the Instagram deal is a reminder that today's biggest tech companies have repeatedly tried to scoop up potential rivals early in their life cycles before they have a chance to become massive businesses in their own right. By some estimates, Instagram is now thought to be worth more than $100 billion on its own given its vast audience and promising ad business. Facebook has also used Instagram to clone and kneecap Snapchat, another rival that it is widely reported to have tried to buy early on.</p><p>Thanks in part to successful acquisitions, the big tech companies have only gotten bigger. Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google's parent company are the top five most valuable businesses in the world. Meanwhile, since the 2016 election, internet giants like Facebook and Google have been embroiled in a series of PR crises over data privacy, the role their platforms played in election meddling and the spread of fake news, raising concerns about the impact these powerful businesses are having on society.</p><p>David Vladeck, the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection from 2009 to 2012, said Facebook's \"debacles,\" Amazon's \"growing market power\" and the \"truly monopolistic power\" of Google \"have started to worry people.\" The concern, he said, is that \"the barriers to entry are just impossible to overcome, and we've got these tech giants that are very difficult to regulate, and may not be responding as well as they should to consumer preferences.\"</p><p>Against this backdrop, Facebook and Amazon have staffed up with antitrust officials from the Department of Justice. Internet companies are racing to prove they are putting their customers' privacy first. And top executives are forced to walk a fine line in their public messaging, acknowledging the need for greater regulation after two years of missteps while simultaneously arguing big companies need to stay big because only they have the resources to tackle the big problems they enabled. </p><p>Or else, they may deflect on the antitrust issue entirely by pointing a fearful finger at China. When asked how Facebook is prepping for an antitrust battle in one recent TV interview, COO Sheryl Sandberg said she heard from unnamed people in DC that there is concern \"about the size and power of Chinese tech companies,\" which \"are not going to be broken up.\" In short, the defense is that breaking up American companies risks empowering Chinese rivals. </p><p>Alliances within the industry appear to be shifting, too. On the one hand, you have the spectacle of a Facebook cofounder calling to break up the company he helped start in his college dorm. On the other hand, you have tech trade groups welcoming support on this issue from the conservative Koch network, even if that organization is ideologically distinct from liberal Silicon Valley and is said to have played a key role in undermining political efforts to curb climate change.</p><p>This shift could continue into the 2020 elections, as tech companies may quietly root for Republicans to hold onto power, despite their left-leaning employee base, for fear that progressive Democrats could be more aggressive in pursuing antitrust enforcement. </p><p>For tech companies looking to be acquired, or continue making big acquisitions, \"the current antitrust lineup is better,\" Verdery said. \"What 2021 looks like is an unknown at best.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The same view was expressed by Macron during an interview with The Economist, who said that within a decade it will be hard to distinguish between data-owning and processing platforms, making regulation increasingly difficult. The emerging concern about 'digital sovereignty' - control over data by individuals and companies - poses the question of reliance on US platforms. As Europe plays a relatively minor role in shaping the digital market ecosystem, the fear is that regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be of decreasing consequence. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Andrea Renda of the Brussels-baed think tank CEPS noted that 94% of data in the Western world is stored in the U.S, while six out of ten big tech companies are American. There is not a single EU firm on that list. Germany is launching an initiative called Gaia X with the objective of developing competitive, secure and trustworthy data infrastructure for Europe restoring some of the EU pool in the global digital market. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NWEU134296157433081999625876100179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEU-134296</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKC-CWX1-F03R-N4RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"239\"/><timeReceived>10:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>New Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The group, founded five years ago, helps organize workers and trains them to ask for better conditions, treatment, and pay across the booming technology industry. This particular gathering drew an Uber driver, a contractor with Apple, a former Google employee, and two people from Square, the mobile-payments system. Beth Ross, one of the Bay Area's fiercest pro-labor attorneys, and Veena Dubal, a labor-law scholar at UC Hastings, held court before the small crowd. \"There's a lot of solidarity to be built here,\" said Dubal, who was dressed in business-casual. \"A worker is a worker.\"1</p><p>Their talk was about how corporations routinely misclassify workers as \"independent contractors,\" denying them regular employment benefits and making it harder to organize-a practice that, per Ross, \"undermines workers' solidarity across industries.\" Ross, who's in her 50s, is best known for winning a multimillion-dollar settlement from a San Francisco strip club after it reclassified its dancers as free agents in 1994 and began charging them a nightly $125 stage fee. In a more recent case, the California Supreme Court narrowed the definition of what constitutes an \"independent contractor,\" which, Ross said, could present opportunities for contract tech workers to win a broader set of employment and workplace protections.2</p><p>An intense speaker with brown hair and dark-rimmed glasses, Ross has the confident bearing of a champion litigator. Bosses in every industry, she said, try to cut costs by misclassifying their employees; the only difference between strippers and tech workers is \"what they wear-or don't wear-on the job.\"3</p><p>The assembled workers peppered the lawyers with legal questions and then broke into smaller groups to discuss their motivations and swap tales of abuse. The Uber driver wanted help organizing his fellows in an industry that he said seems designed to block collective action. \"I never meet any other drivers,\" he said. \"I'm just on this app, dealing with these poverty wages alone.\"4</p><p>A coder who had just finished \"boot camp\"-where, in exchange for learning how to program, participants fork over a percentage of their earnings-wanted to know how to get out of the arrangement. \"That sounds like indentured servitude,\" someone muttered.5</p><p>The TWC meeting, while small, demonstrated some of the biggest difficulties of organizing workers in the digital economy. Work-related grievances are linked yet frustratingly atomized; disparities in pay within a company can be as extreme as the ones in the world they inhabit. And as ordinary people around the world grow disillusioned with the power of Big Tech, the workers who keep the floors clean, the cafeteria stocked, and the servers running at these companies are struggling to find a common grammar to make sense of what they owe not just to their communities, but also to each other.6</p><p> major challenge for the emerging tech-labor movement today happens to be its biggest advantage as well: The definition of a \"tech worker\" is broad, almost to the point of being meaningless. Working \"in tech\" could conceivably mean doing anything on the Internet, or with computers or smartphones or anything that plugs into a wall. This, in turn, means there are far more potential recruits for the labor movement. But while software engineers and Uber drivers may get their paychecks from the same pot of corporate money, their experiences, problems, and approaches to solving them aren't necessarily aligned.7</p><p>This is especially important today, because somewhere between the Cambridge Analytica <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline\">scandal</url>, Google's secret       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/\">plan</url> to build a censored search engine for the authoritarian Chinese government, and Amazon's recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html\">ouster</url> from the New York City borough of Queens, Silicon Valley has lost its air of invincibility, opening up new possibilities for organizing in the workplace.8</p><p>To take some recent examples: In late 2018, Somali workers at an Amazon warehouse in Minneapolis <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/technology/amazon-somali-workers-minnesota.html\">forced</url> the company to the negotiating table. The staff at Palantir       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/palantir-ice-contract-protest\">demanded</url> that their CEO stop working with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Microsoft employees       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/technology/microsoft-ice-immigration.html\">presented</url> their bosses with a petition, signed by 300,000 people, to protest the company's work facilitating immigrant detention. And the year was capped off by a massive international walkout at Google, accompanied by an aggressive       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@GoogleWalkout\">list</url> of demands that ranged from placing a workers' representative on the board to overhauling sexual-harassment protocols. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wired</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-hotel-workers-strike-reverberated-through-tech/\">called</url> it \"The Year Tech Workers Realized They Were Workers.\"9</p><p>TWC, an all-volunteer organization that lacks the structure or leadership hierarchies of a traditional labor union, is trying to ride this wave of dissent. With chapters in Seattle, New York, and Boston, its members help coordinate labor actions across companies and mobilize cadres of workers on the inside. In the Bay Area, TWC held five separate events, including an introduction to the organization, a primer on labor law, and a forum to share workplace experiences-all in the first month of 2019. TWC welcomes employees of all kinds, from coders to janitors: As Moira Weigel <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/31/coders-of-the-world-unite-can-silicon-valley-workers-curb-the-power-of-big-tech\">recounted</url> in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis>, the organization was formed in 2014 out of a friendship between a computer engineer and a cafeteria worker who set out to forge an alternative to the \"Californian Ideology,\" or the industry's long-standing ethos of individualism and self-reliance. Over coffee in San Francisco, a TWC volunteer who's worked as a product manager in Silicon Valley said the workforce he was part of is undergoing a fundamental shift away from an aspirational admiration for bosses and toward a deeper solidarity among colleagues. The volunteer-who requested anonymity in order to avoid retaliation from the companies he organizes in-believes that well-paid engineers will band together with lower-paid workers when they see the writing on the wall, noting: \"They need to be convinced that the way contract workers are treated now, that's how engineers will be treated in the future.\"10</p><p>This philosophy-that coders, drivers, and janitors can be corralled into collective action-is hard to square with the stereotypes of libertarian Googlers cavorting at Burning Man. It's also hard to put into action for the most committed activists accustomed to more contained initiatives.11</p><p>Thom Hoffman, a longtime driver for Uber and Lyft, has become one of the Bay Area's most prominent rideshare organizers. \"Collective action, unions, building workers' power-these are the things that prevent individuals from being taken advantage of,\" he told me recently by phone.12</p><p>Hoffman, who's in his 50s, has broad shoulders and speaks with a Midwestern lilt that inflects his acquired California slang. He's the kind of rideshare driver that companies like Uber and Lyft would hold up as a testament to their own virtue: that they're simply in the business of helping people make extra cash.13</p><p>Hoffman says he took up driving to supplement an unsteady job working for a costume-and-prop company. It helped that he enjoyed the work. \"Dude, I loved driving,\" he told me. \"I was pumping it up to everyone.\" That all changed in 2016, when Uber and Lyft started cutting rates in a mad scramble to eat up market share and convince would-be investors to inject cash into their still-unprofitable businesses. (Later in the year, Uber received $3.5 billion from the Saudi Arabian sovereign-wealth fund.)14</p><p>Hoffman started organizing because \"it felt like 20 to 30 percent of my paycheck was gone overnight.\" More than two years before the meeting in the San Francisco women's center, he was on the streets of the East Bay helping the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, build a list of Uber drivers. He spent most of his time knocking on car windows in the Oakland airport lot where drivers congregated, slowly helping to build up a sense of common purpose.15</p><p>Hoffman made good money-up to $4,000 a month before taxes-from a major Silicon Valley company. But he saw himself as a union man, not a tech worker: \"Dad was in the carpenters' union, and Mom was a hospital aide who worked on the union drive.\" In fact, when he moved to the Bay Area in 2008, he'd hoped to find steady work with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union he'd belonged to back home in Indiana.16</p><p>Hoffman's theory of change is old-school: If enough Uber drivers decide to band together, the company will have no choice but to take their demands seriously. And he's ambivalent about the white-collar kids identifying with-and trying to organize-the drivers' struggle. \"I wish them the best,\" he says. Still, he's focusing on mobilizing other drivers.17</p><p>n the surface, Hoffman doesn't have a lot in common with Meredith Whittaker. An expert on the social impact of artificial intelligence, Whittaker has worked at Google for over a decade, earns orders of magnitude more than the average rideshare driver, and recently co-founded her own <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/people/meredith-whittaker.html\">research institute</url> at New York University. She also happens to be one of Google's fiercest and most active critics, working tirelessly to build internal resistance at the company.18</p><p>Last year, Whittaker was one of a number of Google employees to pressure the company to stop working with the Pentagon's military artifical-intelligence program, known as <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620\">Project Maven</url>. Such protests are becoming more common: In February, Microsoft workers went public to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/22/microsoft-protest-us-army-augmented-reality-headsets\">protest</url> a $480 million contract to provide augmented-reality headsets to the US Army.19</p><p>\"You can't have a company whose ultimate rationale is shareholder value making decisions about how to automate weapons,\" Whittaker says. That applies more broadly than to Google's drones: A workers' movement inside Big Tech is necessary to inject social responsibility into the industry. At Google, Whittaker explained, the company went through the motions of listening to employees by holding town halls. Company message boards allowed employees to voice dissent internally. But to halt Project Maven, Google employees also had to go public in opposition to their bosses; some even quit in protest. \"People conflated having a voice with having power,\" she noted.20</p><p>While Hoffman speaks of struggling to make the rent and afford his health insurance, Whittaker speaks of ethics and alliances. But both efforts-Hoffman's organizing of drivers, and Whittaker's solidarity-building inside Google-challenge the radical individualism that's informed so many Silicon Valley companies and organizations. And in the absence of meaningful regulation from Washington, combining these efforts seems to be the only hope of holding the Big Tech companies accountable.21</p><p>Labor scholars say they sense changes afoot. \"It's true that a libertarian ethos has been overwhelming here,\" said Harley Shaiken, a labor scholar who teaches at UC Berkeley. Shaiken predicts a reckoning between the implicit promise of working in Silicon Valley-helping to make the world a better (or at least more efficient) place-and its reality: building censored search engines for autocracies, enriching sexual harassers, and providing logistical support for family separation. \"Many went into this field with a vision of the world, and that didn't involve helping the Pentagon build drones,\" he added.22</p><p>\"These companies made their names trying to change the world, but we examine the change and we think, 'We don't like it,'\" Whittaker said shortly after helping organize a massive walkout at Google in late 2018. The precipitating event was a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html\">story</url> about Andy Rubin, a Google executive whom the company paid $90 million to depart after he was accused of sexual harassment. \"We are not going to play whack-a-mole with every new outrage,\" Whittaker said. \"What we are going to do is to change the system.\"23</p><p>The walkout proved to be an impressive show of force: From Singapore to Dublin, thousands participated, with more than 3,000 workers in New York alone. Management quickly conceded to one of the movement's demands: to stop using binding-arbitration agreements in sexual-harassment cases. As Walker noted, \"Collective action actually works to get change when official channels don't.\"24</p><p>\"The tech workers' movement is here to stay,\" says Will Luckman, an organizer with the Democratic Socialists of America's Tech Action working group. \"The question now is: What are we going to do with it?\"25</p><p>I met Luckman in a Brooklyn cafe a few days after Amazon announced plans for a new headquarters in Long Island City, Queens. Before long, Tech Action had convened a meeting of more than 40 activists and employees-many from major tech companies-at a community center in Manhattan. \"Raise your hand if you hate Amazon,\" one of the organizers said. When it was Luckman's turn to speak, he posed a number of reasons that New Yorkers should be vigilant about an expanded Amazon presence. He also summarized just how central technology companies have become to perpetuating social and economic inequality, either through worker exploitation, gentrification, regulatory capture, or the development of invasive technologies and surveillance that tend, disproportionately, to hurt people of color.26</p><p>That's a lot to digest at once. And for workers organizing against Big Tech-not to mention casual observers and ordinary people who resent Facebook and Amazon-it can be difficult to grasp where the problem begins or ends. If Silicon Valley is responsible for high rents, loss of privacy, institutional racism, and low wages, how can ordinary people confront it?27</p><p>Luckman and his colleagues suggested several ways forward, including canvassing neighborhoods and circulating a petition opposing Amazon's anti-union stance. An explosion of activism and protests, from <url normalizedValue=\"https://licpost.com/residents-activists-demand-cb2-reject-amazon-with-no-negotiations-no-concessions\">town halls</url> to City Council       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fox5ny.com/news/amazon-city-council-hearing\">meetings</url>, followed-all organized by community groups in Queens.28</p><p>What these groups didn't expect was to see such quick results: Amazon abruptly cancelled its expansion, <url normalizedValue=\"https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/02/14/amazons-statement-on-dropping-nyc-hq-plans/\">citing</url> an insufficiently \"positive\" attitude from \"a number of state and local politicians.\"29</p><p>Amazon represented a threat to so many people that it made itself a galvanizing target, explained Sasha Wijeyeratne, the executive director of <url normalizedValue=\"https://caaav.org/\">CAAV Organizing Asian Communities</url>: \"The scope of this fight was unprecedented, and winning gives us so much hope.\" The campaign thus showcased the potential for intersectional organizing against Big Tech: Amazon's work with ICE enraged immigrant communities, its opposition to unions fired up labor organizers, and the gentrification it would provoke mobilized seniors and low-income residents in Queens.30</p><p>It's still unclear exactly why Amazon pulled out, but <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html\">reported</url> that executives were concerned that the new headquarters was inviting too much scrutiny of its business practices. \"We are changing the relationships between local officials, their communities, and tech giants,\" Luckman told me by phone after Amazon announced its withdrawal. The alliances and momentum they built could be taken further; he was particularly excited about an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/employees-at-amazon-s-new-nyc-warehouse-launch-unionization-push\">ongoing union drive</url> at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island. Some workers from that warehouse were active in Queens, too. \"The lesson learned here is that collective action does work against these major tech companies,\" Luckman said. \"A well-organized group of community members can fight back-and win.\"31</p><p>That victory resonates outside of New York as well. \"People are waking up to the impact tech has on our neighborhoods, cities, and democracy,\" said Maria Noel Fernandez, the director of Silicon Valley Rising, which has been organizing against a proposed Google expansion in San Jose. \"The current system of tech corporations subverting local democracy can't continue.\"32</p><p>he solidarity driving the new tech workers' movement can obscure some uncomfortable tensions. Engineers making six figures don't just see the world differently from their service-worker counterparts: They're treated differently, too.33</p><p>Hoffman, the Uber driver, learned this firsthand back in October. Weeks before the global Google walkout, Hoffman and a group of drivers decided to ramp things up a notch with Uber. Not only were they making a fraction of the money they'd come to expect, but the company's opaque deactivation policies were causing some drivers to lose their jobs with no redress once their ratings on the system dipped. Hoffman said that drivers who didn't speak perfect English felt especially vulnerable; riders would give them low ratings, misinterpreting the driver's weak language skills for rudeness.34</p><p>At the same time, the drivers were building a movement. When Hoffman first started organizing, the meetings would sometimes attract fewer than a dozen people. But recently, the Uber drivers began holding digital meetings that people could dial into from the road-and by late 2018, Hoffman told me, the meetings were drawing dozens of new participants each week.35</p><p>By October, the organizers planned to go to Uber's headquarters to discuss drivers losing their jobs (the company can \"deactivate\" a driver at will). Hoffman never made it through the door: he got <url normalizedValue=\"https://abc7ny.com/business/video-uber-driver-tackled-outside-company-headquarters/4481877/\">tackled</url> by a security guard and slammed to the ground as he tried to walk into the building. He was holding a petition with some 5,000 signatures asking the company to meet with drivers to hear their complaints.36</p><p>\"I went into flight-or-fight mode,\" Hoffman recalled. Pinned down under the weight of the security guard, with his shoulders and back ground into the pavement, Hoffman felt \"a lot of adrenaline, so I didn't realize until later how much it hurt.\" Months later, he was still working with a physical therapist. (Uber has tried to distance itself from the security guard, emphasizing that he was an independent contractor himself.)37</p><p>For veteran organizers, the contrast between how Google handled its walkout and how Uber dealt with the petition wasn't surprising. \"When management see coders, they're more likely to think, 'These are 'our people,'\" explained Jeff Ordower, an organizer for gig workers' rights at Silicon Valley Rising, who was there when Hoffman got tackled. \"When they see drivers, they think, 'Wow-that's scary!'\" This is precisely why there's such an effort in the tech workers' movement to link their fates-or at least build solidarity. It was also the dominant theme at the San Francisco TWC meeting, where the Uber driver sat beside the former Google worker to learn about California employment law. This kind of solidarity has already been tested, with promising results: The battle over Amazon, for example, quickly united lefty white-collar activists with union organizers in New York. But it remains to be seen if it can be sustained and nurtured over the long term, especially in the far less sexy realm of community meetings and contract negotiations.38</p><p>\"In our perfect world, we'd have Uber drivers working with Uber engineers, fighting together,\" an organizer at the meeting remarked. (There were no Uber engineers in attendance.) One optimistic TWC volunteer ticked off a series of recent collaborations between higher-paid and lower-paid workers: The group flew out organizers to help a Unite Here union drive for Facebook cafeteria workers in Seattle, and they supported a SEIU campaign to unionize security guards at Amazon.39</p><p>At Google, Whittaker and her fellow organizers have made the treatment of lower-paid Google contractors a central part of their campaign. In a December 5 <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@GoogleWalkout/invisible-no-longer-googles-shadow-workforce-speaks-up-9ea04b7bcc41\">statement</url> following the walkout, organizers demanded that Google stop treating those workers-who tend to be from marginalized groups and make up nearly half of Google's workforce-differently than full-time staff. Pointing out Google's $9.2 billion quarterly profit, Whittaker and the other organizers asked that the company put that money to good use, by ending the \"pay and opportunity inequity\" between contractors and full-time staff.40</p><p>Google has yet to make any significant concessions on the contractor front. And Whittaker is the first to admit that she and her colleagues are still working out a successful organizing model for the industry. \"In some sense, we're in uncharted territory,\" she says. \"What we are seeing are changes around the margins-and it's not surprising the lowest-hanging demands have been the focus of leadership so far.\"41</p><p>t's seductive to see tech-worker organizing as a panacea for all that ails Big Tech, from labor abuses to privacy violations. But worker power doesn't necessarily translate into progressive outcomes.42</p><p>Indeed, as David A. Banks pointed out in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/which-side-are-they-on-banks\">article</url> for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Baffler</emphasis> last year, the unionized workers at Boeing and Lockheed Martin aren't exactly DSA recruits in waiting; they're part of a union that forms a reliable node in the national-security state. What's more, in the current tight labor market, tech workers may feel emboldened to make demands on their employers, but that momentum could easily wane when the economy cools off and workers become more anxious about losing their jobs.43</p><p>Shaikan, the UC Berkeley scholar, cautions that cosmetic fixes could take the place of structural solutions. These aren't necessarily unwelcome: In the past year, Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/tech/amazon-minimum-wage/index.html\">announced</url> a $15 hourly wage for its warehouse workers; Google       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-to-end-arbitration-agreements-for-employees-1832797371\">agreed</url> to change its arbitration agreements; and a group of Facebook contractors-backed by their full-time colleagues-successfully resisted a move to fire them if they didn't consent to a contract with less vacation time and fewer benefits than full-time employees get.44</p><p>But just as Starbucks assuages public misgivings about inequities in the international-commodities market by offering a branded version of fair-trade coffee, the tech giants will try to neutralize public opposition with partial gestures toward social justice-for example, more robust diversity programs for high-paid workers. \"You always have to be on the lookout for co-option,\" Shaikan said.45</p><p>The activists in the trenches aren't dwelling on hypotheticals just yet. \"We have a strong hand, and the drivers are behind us,\" Hoffman said, noting that although they haven't successfully squeezed any concessions out of Uber, more and more drivers are dialing into the weekly organizing meetings. \"There's a rumbling of defection\" against management in Big Tech, Whittaker told me. \"They're being pushed by a growing group of concerted workers-when it's more costly to stay where they are, they will move in our direction.\"46</p><p>Back in the Women's Building in San Francisco, momentum was building as well: The Square employees realized that Uber's corporate headquarters is located in their office building. \"Let's stay in touch,\" one of the Square workers remarked to the Uber driver as they walked out. \"Let us know if you need anything.\"47</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-306983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VK5-1K61-DXR3-253K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

06, 2019( The Nation Blogs: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs\">http://www.thenation.com/blogs</url> Delivered by Newstex)  \"On a thursday night late last year a dozen or so people gathered in the women's building a community center in san francisco's mission district to attend an employment law seminar hosted by the tech workers coalition twc the group founded five years ago helps organize workers and trains them to ask for better conditions treatment and pay across the booming technology industry this particular gathering drew an uber driver a contractor with apple a former google employee and two people from square the mobile payments system beth ross one of the bay area's fiercest pro labor attorneys and veena dubal a labor law scholar at uc hastings held court before the small crowd \u201cthere's a lot of solidarity to be built here\" said dubal who was dressed in business casual \u201ca worker is a worker\" 1 their talk was about how corporations routinely misclassify workers as \u201cindependent contractors\" denying them regular employment benefits and making it harder to organize \u2014 a practice that per ross \u201cundermines workers'solidarity across industries\" ross who's in her 50s is best known for winning a multimillion dollar settlement from a san francisco strip club after it reclassified its dancers as free agents in 1994 and began charging them a nightly 125 stage fee in a more recent case the california supreme court narrowed the definition of what constitutes an \u201cindependent contractor\" which ross said could present opportunities for contract tech workers to win a broader set of employment and workplace protections 2 an intense speaker with brown hair and dark rimmed glasses ross has the confident bearing of a champion litigator bosses in every industry she said try to cut costs by misclassifying their employees the only difference between strippers and tech workers is \u201cwhat they wear \u2014 or don't wear \u2014 on the job\" 3 the assembled workers peppered the lawyers with legal questions and then broke into smaller groups to discuss their motivations and swap tales of abuse the uber driver wanted help organizing his fellows in an industry that he said seems designed to block collective action \u201ci never meet any other drivers\" he said \u201ci'm just on this app dealing with these poverty wages alone\" 4 a coder who had just finished \u201cboot camp\" \u2014 where in exchange for learning how to program participants fork over a percentage of their earnings \u2014 wanted to know how to get out of the arrangement \u201cthat sounds like indentured servitude\" someone muttered 5 the twc meeting while small demonstrated some of the biggest difficulties of organizing workers in the digital economy work related grievances are linked yet frustratingly atomized disparities in pay within a company can be as extreme as the ones in the world they inhabit and as ordinary people around the world grow disillusioned with the power of big tech the workers who keep the floors clean the cafeteria stocked and the servers running at these companies are struggling to find a common grammar to make sense of what they owe not just to their communities but also to each other 6 a major challenge for the emerging tech labor movement today happens to be its biggest advantage as well the definition of a \u201ctech worker\" is broad almost to the point of being meaningless working \u201cin tech\" could conceivably mean doing anything on the internet or with computers or smartphones or anything that plugs into a wall this in turn means there are far more potential recruits for the labor movement but while software engineers and uber drivers may get their paychecks from the same pot of corporate money their experiences problems and approaches to solving them aren't necessarily aligned 7 this is especially important today because somewhere between the cambridge analytica scandal google's secret plan to build a censored search engine for the authoritarian chinese government and amazon's recent ouster from the new york city borough of queens silicon valley has lost its air of invincibility opening up new possibilities for organizing in the workplace 8 to take some recent examples in late 2018 somali workers at an amazon warehouse in minneapolis forced the company to the negotiating table the staff at palantir demanded that their ceo stop working with the immigration and customs enforcement agency microsoft employees presented their bosses with a petition signed by 300 000 people to protest the company's work facilitating immigrant detention and the year was capped off by a massive international walkout at google accompanied by an aggressive list of demands that ranged from placing a workers'representative on the board to overhauling sexual harassment protocols wired called it \u201cthe year tech workers realized they were workers\" 9 twc an all volunteer organization that lacks the structure or leadership hierarchies of a traditional labor union is trying to ride this wave of dissent with chapters in seattlenew york and boston its members help coordinate labor actions across companies and mobilize cadres of workers on the inside in the bay area twc held five separate events including an introduction to the organization a primer on labor law and a forum to share workplace experiences \u2014 all in the first month of 2019 twc welcomes employees of all kinds from coders to janitors as moira weigel recounted in the guardian the organization was formed in 2014 out of a friendship between a computer engineer and a cafeteria worker who set out to forge an alternative to the \u201ccalifornian ideology\" or the industry's long standing ethos of individualism and self reliance over coffee in san francisco a twc volunteer who's worked as a product manager in silicon valley said the workforce he was part of is undergoing a fundamental shift away from an aspirational admiration for bosses and toward a deeper solidarity among colleagues the volunteer \u2014 who requested anonymity in order to avoid retaliation from the companies he organizes in \u2014 believes that well paid engineers will band together with lower paid workers when they see the writing on the wall noting \u201cthey need to be convinced that the way contract workers are treated now that's how engineers will be treated in the future\" 10 this philosophy \u2014 that coders drivers and janitors can be corralled into collective action \u2014 is hard to square with the stereotypes of libertarian googlers cavorting at burning man it's also hard to put into action for the most committed activists accustomed to more contained initiatives 11 thom hoffman a longtime driver for uber and lyft has become one of the bay area's most prominent rideshare organizers \u201ccollective action unions building workers'power \u2014 these are the things that prevent individuals from being taken advantage of\" he told me recently by phone 12 hoffman who's in his 50s has broad shoulders and speaks with a midwestern lilt that inflects his acquired california slang he's the kind of rideshare driver that companies like uber and lyft would hold up as a testament to their own virtue that they're simply in the business of helping people make extra cash 13 hoffman says he took up driving to supplement an unsteady job working for a costume and prop company it helped that he enjoyed the work \u201cdude i loved driving\" he told me \u201ci was pumping it up to everyone\" that all changed in 2016 when uber and lyft started cutting rates in a mad scramble to eat up market share and convince would be investors to inject cash into their still unprofitable businesses later in the year uber received 3 5 billion from the saudi arabian sovereign wealth fund 14 hoffman started organizing because \u201cit felt like 20 to 30 percent of my paycheck was gone overnight\" more than two years before the meeting in the san francisco women's center he was on the streets of the east bay helping the service employees international union or seiu build a list of uber drivers he spent most of his time knocking on car windows in the oakland airport lot where drivers congregated slowly helping to build up a sense of common purpose 15 hoffman made good money \u2014 up to 4 000 a month before taxes \u2014 from a major silicon valley company but he saw himself as a union man not a tech worker \u201cdad was in the carpenters'union and mom was a hospital aide who worked on the union drive\" in fact when he moved to the bay area in 2008 he'd hoped to find steady work with the international alliance of theatrical stage employees the union he'd belonged to back home in indiana 16 hoffman's theory of change is old school if enough uber drivers decide to band together the company will have no choice but to take their demands seriously and he's ambivalent about the white collar kids identifying with \u2014 and trying to organize \u2014 the drivers'struggle \u201ci wish them the best\" he says still he's focusing on mobilizing other drivers 17 on the surface hoffman doesn't have a lot in common with meredith whittaker an expert on the social impact of artificial intelligence whittaker has worked at google for over a decade earns orders of magnitude more than the average rideshare driver and recently co founded her own research institute at new york university she also happens to be one of google's fiercest and most active critics working tirelessly to build internal resistance at the company 18 last year whittaker was one of a number of google employees to pressure the company to stop working with the pentagon's military artifical intelligence program known as project maven such protests are becoming more common in february microsoft workers went public to protest a 480 million contract to provide augmented reality headsets to the us army 19 \u201cyou can't have a company whose ultimate rationale is shareholder value making decisions about how to automate weapons\" whittaker says that applies more broadly than to google's drones a workers'movement inside big tech is necessary to inject social responsibility into the industry at google whittaker explained the company went through the motions of listening to employees by holding town halls company message boards allowed employees to voice dissent internally but to halt project maven google employees also had to go public in opposition to their bosses some even quit in protest \u201cpeople conflated having a voice with having power\" she noted 20 while hoffman speaks of struggling to make the rent and afford his health insurance whittaker speaks of ethics and alliances but both efforts \u2014 hoffman's organizing of drivers and whittaker's solidarity building inside google \u2014 challenge the radical individualism that's informed so many silicon valley companies and organizations and in the absence of meaningful regulation from washington combining these efforts seems to be the only hope of holding the big tech companies accountable 21 labor scholars say they sense changes afoot \u201cit's true that a libertarian ethos has been overwhelming here\" said harley shaiken a labor scholar who teaches at uc berkeley shaiken predicts a reckoning between the implicit promise of working in silicon valley \u2014 helping to make the world a better or at least more efficient place \u2014 and its reality building censored search engines for autocracies enriching sexual harassers and providing logistical support for family separation \u201cmany went into this field with a vision of the world and that didn't involve helping the pentagon build drones\" he added 22 \u201cthese companies made their names trying to change the world but we examine the change and we think lsquo we don't like it &amp;'\" whittaker said shortly after helping organize a massive walkout at google in late 2018 the precipitating event was a new york times story about andy rubin a google executive whom the company paid 90 million to depart after he was accused of sexual harassment \u201cwe are not going to play whack a mole with every new outrage\" whittaker said \u201cwhat we are going to do is to change the system\" 23 the walkout proved to be an impressive show of force from singapore to dublin thousands participated with more than 3 000 workers in new york alone management quickly conceded to one of the movement's demands to stop using binding arbitration agreements in sexual harassment cases as walker noted \u201ccollective action actually works to get change when official channels don't\" 24 \u201cthe tech workers'movement is here to stay\" says will luckman an organizer with the democratic socialists of america's tech action working group \u201cthe question now is what are we going to do with it\" 25 i met luckman in a brooklyn cafe a few days after amazon announced plans for a new headquarters in long island city queens before long tech action had convened a meeting of more than 40 activists and employees \u2014 many from major tech companies \u2014 at a community center in manhattan \u201craise your hand if you hate amazon\" one of the organizers said when it was luckman's turn to speak he posed a number of reasons that new yorkers should be vigilant about an expanded amazon presence he also summarized just how central technology companies have become to perpetuating social and economic inequality either through worker exploitation gentrification regulatory capture or the development of invasive technologies and surveillance that tend disproportionately to hurt people of color 26 that's a lot to digest at once and for workers organizing against big tech \u2014 not to mention casual observers and ordinary people who resent facebook and amazon \u2014 it can be difficult to grasp where the problem begins or ends if silicon valley is responsible for high rents loss of privacy institutional racism and low wages how can ordinary people confront it 27 luckman and his colleagues suggested several ways forward including canvassing neighborhoods and circulating a petition opposing amazon's anti union stance an explosion of activism and protests from town halls to city council meetings followed \u2014 all organized by community groups in queens 28 what these groups didn't expect was to see such quick results amazon abruptly cancelled its expansion citing an insufficiently \u201cpositive\" attitude from \u201ca number of state and local politicians\" 29 amazon represented a threat to so many people that it made itself a galvanizing target explained sasha wijeyeratne the executive director of caav organizing asian communities \u201cthe scope of this fight was unprecedented and winning gives us so much hope\" the campaign thus showcased the potential for intersectional organizing against big tech amazon's work with ice enraged immigrant communities its opposition to unions fired up labor organizers and the gentrification it would provoke mobilized seniors and low income residents in queens 30 it's still unclear exactly why amazon pulled out but the new york times reported that executives were concerned that the new headquarters was inviting too much scrutiny of its business practices \u201cwe are changing the relationships between local officials their communities and tech giants\" luckman told me by phone after amazon announced its withdrawal the alliances and momentum they built could be taken further he was particularly excited about an ongoing union drive at an amazon warehouse in brooklyn some workers from that warehouse were active in queens too \u201cthe lesson learned here is that collective action does work against these major tech companies\" luckman said \u201ca well organized group of community members can fight back \u2014 and win\" 31 that victory resonates outside of new york as well \u201cpeople are waking up to the impact tech has on our neighborhoods cities and democracy\" said maria noel fernandez the director of silicon valley rising which has been organizing against a proposed google expansion in san jose \u201cthe current system of tech corporations subverting local democracy can't continue\" 32 the solidarity driving the new tech workers'movement can obscure some uncomfortable tensions engineers making six figures don't just see the world differently from their service worker counterparts they're treated differently too 33 hoffman the uber driver learned this firsthand back in october weeks before the global google walkout hoffman and a group of drivers decided to ramp things up a notch with uber not only were they making a fraction of the money they'd come to expect but the company's opaque deactivation policies were causing some drivers to lose their jobs with no redress once their ratings on the system dipped hoffman said that drivers who didn't speak perfect english felt especially vulnerable riders would give them low ratings misinterpreting the driver's weak language skills for rudeness 34 at the same time the drivers were building a movement when hoffman first started organizing the meetings would sometimes attract fewer than a dozen people but recently the uber drivers began holding digital meetings that people could dial into from the road \u2014 and by late 2018 hoffman told me the meetings were drawing dozens of new participants each week 35 by october the organizers planned to go to uber's headquarters to discuss drivers losing their jobs the company can \u201cdeactivate\" a driver at will hoffman never made it through the door he got tackled by a security guard and slammed to the ground as he tried to walk into the building he was holding a petition with some 5 000 signatures asking the company to meet with drivers to hear their complaints 36 \u201ci went into flight or fight mode\" hoffman recalled pinned down under the weight of the security guard with his shoulders and back ground into the pavement hoffman felt \u201ca lot of adrenaline so i didn't realize until later how much it hurt\" months later he was still working with a physical therapist uber has tried to distance itself from the security guard emphasizing that he was an independent contractor himself 37 for veteran organizers the contrast between how google handled its walkout and how uber dealt with the petition wasn't surprising \u201cwhen management see coders they're more likely to think lsquo these are lsquo our people &amp;'\" explained jeff ordower an organizer for gig workers'rights at silicon valley rising who was there when hoffman got tackled \u201cwhen they see drivers they think lsquo wow \u2014 that's scary &amp;'\" this is precisely why there's such an effort in the tech workers'movement to link their fates \u2014 or at least build solidarity it was also the dominant theme at the san francisco twc meeting where the uber driver sat beside the former google worker to learn about california employment law this kind of solidarity has already been tested with promising results the battle over amazon for example quickly united lefty white collar activists with union organizers in new york but it remains to be seen if it can be sustained and nurtured over the long term especially in the far less sexy realm of community meetings and contract negotiations 38 \u201cin our perfect world we'd have uber drivers working with uber engineers fighting together\" an organizer at the meeting remarked there were no uber engineers in attendance one optimistic twc volunteer ticked off a series of recent collaborations between higher paid and lower paid workers the group flew out organizers to help a unite here union drive for facebook cafeteria workers in seattle and they supported a seiu campaign to unionize security guards at amazon 39 at google whittaker and her fellow organizers have made the treatment of lower paid google contractors a central part of their campaign in a december 5 statement following the walkout organizers demanded that google stop treating those workers \u2014 who tend to be from marginalized groups and make up nearly half of google's workforce \u2014 differently than full time staff pointing out google's 9 2 billion quarterly profit whittaker and the other organizers asked that the company put that money to good use by ending the \u201cpay and opportunity inequity\" between contractors and full time staff 40 google has yet to make any significant concessions on the contractor front and whittaker is the first to admit that she and her colleagues are still working out a successful organizing model for the industry \u201cin some sense we're in uncharted territory\" she says \u201cwhat we are seeing are changes around the margins \u2014 and it's not surprising the lowest hanging demands have been the focus of leadership so far\" 41 it's seductive to see tech worker organizing as a panacea for all that ails big tech from labor abuses to privacy violations but worker power doesn't necessarily translate into progressive outcomes 42 indeed as david a banks pointed out in an article for the baffler last year the unionized workers at boeing and lockheed martin aren't exactly dsa recruits in waiting they're part of a union that forms a reliable node in the national security state what's more in the current tight labor market tech workers may feel emboldened to make demands on their employers but that momentum could easily wane when the economy cools off and workers become more anxious about losing their jobs 43 shaikan the uc berkeley scholar cautions that cosmetic fixes could take the place of structural solutions these aren't necessarily unwelcome in the past year amazon announced a 15 hourly wage for its warehouse workers google agreed to change its arbitration agreements and a group of facebook contractors \u2014 backed by their full time colleagues \u2014 successfully resisted a move to fire them if they didn't consent to a contract with less vacation time and fewer benefits than full time employees get 44 but just as starbucks assuages public misgivings about inequities in the international commodities market by offering a branded version of fair trade coffee the tech giants will try to neutralize public opposition with partial gestures toward social justice \u2014 for example more robust diversity programs for high paid workers \u201cyou always have to be on the lookout for co option\" shaikan said 45 the activists in the trenches aren't dwelling on hypotheticals just yet \u201cwe have a strong hand and the drivers are behind us\" hoffman said noting that although they haven't successfully squeezed any concessions out of uber more and more drivers are dialing into the weekly organizing meetings \u201cthere's a rumbling of defection\" against management in big tech whittaker told me \u201cthey're being pushed by a growing group of concerted workers \u2014 when it's more costly to stay where they are they will move in our direction\" 46 back in the women's building in san francisco momentum was building as well the square employees realized that uber's corporate headquarters is located in their office building \u201clet's stay in touch\" one of the square workers remarked to the uber driver as they walked out \u201clet us know if you need anything\" 4Keep on reading: Move Fast And Build

After a fall from 277p to 267p yesterday, the price has now fallen by a third from its early March high. Continued selling of Vodafone - which comes in the face of the recent recovery among many other big tech issues - has brought technical analysts out in droves, warning that this classic \"momentum stock\" (often bought by investors in the past simply because it kept going up) is breaking back down through some supposedly important chart levels.</p><p>Because of Vodafone's weight in the Footsie, this has reinforced thinking that the London market as a whole will remain under pressure over coming trading sessions.</p><p> News that European regulators have given the go-ahead to the merger between Glaxo Wellcome and Smith Kline Beecham , albeit with certain minor conditions, went down well. The shares rallied 75p to pounds 19.49 and 34p to 868p, respectively. The regulators have asked the new combine to out-license a number of products in Europe, but sales of these across the continent amount to just pounds 50m compared with pro forma group sales of pounds 4bn. The merger still needs the nod from US regulators.</p><p> With the mood infecting others in the drugs sector, AstraZeneca rose from pounds 26.15 to pounds 27.15.</p><p> Freeserve was in demand all day, following weekend reports that parent Dixons (up 6p at 278p) is looking at selling down its 80% stake - which, in turn, has prompted speculation that the internet service provider will attract a bid. The shares ended the session at 437.5p, up 30.5p, before the after-hours announcement from Dixons that it was indeed looking at the options for its holding.</p><p> Pace Micro Technology , the set-top box specialist, jumped from 750p to 947p after news that it has reached a \"far-reaching memorandum of understanding\" with Microsoft to develop applications for digital television.</p><p> Regent Street department stores group Liberty jumped 55p to 255p following reports that a pounds 68m bid is on the way from property group Marylebone Warwick Balfour (up 0.5p at 150.5p), which would value the shares at 300p if and when it arrives.</p><p> Abbey National also managed to buck the general market trend, with the shares adding 26.5p to 775.5p in the wake of weekend reports that Barclays is considering a pounds 15bn bid.</p><p> Among the day's new issues, self-storage group Big Yellow made a strong start on the Alternative Invesment Market, trading at 127.5p against a 100p sale price. On the other hand, Motion Media , a specialist in video communication technology, slipped to 130p against a 140p flotation price.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:40B8-BBT0-0051-440R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"500\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Guardian (London)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Guardian Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationDate month=\"05\" day=\"09\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>May 9, 2000</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>VODAFONE GROUP PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0ASTRAZENECA PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0PACE PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>\u00a0SANTANDER UK PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>VOD (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0VOD (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0AZN (STO)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0AZN (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0AZN (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0PIC (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>\u00a0MSFT (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517210 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

But recently, he says, he\u2019s seen a new challenge emerge: A spate of threats from companies claiming infringement on their patents. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt\u2019s just a shakedown,\u201d he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. <person><nameText>Claire McCaskill </nameText></person>of Missouri is less subtle.</p><p>\u201cThese people are pond scum,\u201d she told The Star. \u201cBottom feeders.\u201d</p><p>Critics such as Heirendt and McCaskill say these companies are making a living on litigation that stifles innovation and hurts small businesses. </p><p>McCaskill has introduced federal legislation, and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Tuesday signed into law a state measure against bad-faith patent claims.</p><p>But defenders of the practice say there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with acquiring a patent and enforcing the rights that come with it. By doing so, they say, such companies create markets where innovators can make money on inventions by selling their patents to outfits with more resources to legally enforce them.</p><p>That, in theory, frees smaller companies to do more innovating.</p><p>\u201cWe represent patent owners who may or may not have the expertise or the capital or the skill set to enforce their entrenched patents,\u201d said Marvin Key, the CEO of Acacia Research Group.</p><p>Many developers don\u2019t have the expertise or financial reserves to bring their new technologies to market, he said, or to force larger firms with the resources to compensate them for their breakthroughs.</p><p>Key said his firm puts its technical and legal know-how, combined with the capital needed to muster a credible fight, to work on behalf of patent owners. Often by suing, or threatening to sue, Acacia forces patent users to settle on licensing terms with patent owners. </p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t outlast us, and they can\u2019t stretch us out,\u201d Key said. \u201cThey have to take us seriously.\u201d</p><p>He said large high-tech firms have succeeded in painting such efforts with the same brush used to depict what he called illegitimate shakedown artists who harass businesses despite having little legal standing.</p><p>Indeed, \u201cpatent assertion entities\u201d attract little love. That\u2019s why they\u2019re known derisively and more commonly as patent trolls. (The term refers to trolls in fairy tales who live under a bridge and exact a toll on those who try to cross.)</p><p>They \u201cdon\u2019t actually produce anything themselves,\u201d President Barack Obama has said. Instead, they live on a business model \u201cto essentially leverage and hijack somebody else\u2019s idea and see if they can extort some money out of them.\u201d</p><p>Their tactics are simple and legal. Generally, they buy the rights to patents but don\u2019t use them as the basis for products. Instead, they extract payments from other companies by threatening to sue or actually suing for patent infringement.</p><p>It\u2019s sometimes faster and cheaper for companies to settle, and in many cases they do, agreeing to pay a licensing fee even if they believe the claim has no merit. </p><p>Tech giants such as Apple, Google and Yahoo have faced such lawsuits for years. But observers say a new trend has developed targeting smaller companies. Heirendt said he\u2019s received four threatening letters in recent years and has already settled one even though he believes the claims were bogus. </p><p>\u201cWhen they go after startups, they do so because they know (those fledgling companies) don\u2019t have the type of money needed to defend themselves,\u201d he said.</p><p>A report issued last year by the White House found that it isn\u2019t just tech companies that are targeted, but also the users of the technology. One alleged patent troll sent 8,000 letters to coffee shops, hotels and retailers seeking compensation for offering Wi-Fi to their customers. </p><p>In another high-profile case scheduled to go to trial this September, a man who insists he helped invent the podcast back in the 1990s \u2014 and has a patent \u2014 is suing three podcastsers, along with Fox, CBS and NBC, saying they owe him money.</p><p>A study by Boston University found that litigation instigated by patent assertion entities is rapidly expanding. Researchers estimated that in 2011, more than 2,100 companies were forced to mount 5,842 defenses in lawsuits from these companies, up from 1,401 in 2005.</p><p>McCaskill, a Democrat, is sponsoring legislation targeting the demand letters companies send out claiming infringement. It would allow the Federal Trade Commission to define what constitutes a \u201cdeceptive demand letter\u201d and bring charges against the companies that send them.</p><p>\u201cThere needs to be a deterrent,\u201d she said, \u201cand the law currently doesn\u2019t do an adequate job of prohibiting this kind of abuse.\u201d</p><p>Missouri lawmakers also took up the matter this year and passed legislation nearly unanimously. The bill Nixon signed bars letters and emails that claim in bad faith a patent has been infringed, and allows those being targeted to sue.</p><p>\u201cThis was a simple fix for lawmakers to tackle to help small businesses,\u201d said Jay Atkins, general counsel for the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \u201cIt was low-hanging fruit. Clearly this is an expense that a legitimate company shouldn\u2019t have to bear.\u201d</p><p>But while patent trolls have become a popular political target, they have defenders. </p><p>\u201cI view patent trolls as an efficient response to market conditions,\u201d said Ross Levine, a professor of business at the University of California, Berkeley, and a senior fellow at the Milken Institute.</p><p>Someone who invents something may not have the time or the expertise to enforce the patents. So they sell those patents to companies \u2014 the so-called patent trolls \u2014 to do it for them. </p><p>Levine said big tech companies such as Apple support laws curtailing patent trolls because many of their products, such as the iPhone, contain thousands of patented components. Many of those patents belong to somebody other than Apple. The company could make more money if it didn\u2019t have to negotiate for the right to use these patents. </p><p>Most of the proposed changes in patent law being pushed by lawmakers, Levine said, would shift power out of the courts and into governmental regulatory bodies subject to lobbying. That\u2019s a dangerous move, he said, especially without evidence that the current system has hindered innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><p>\u201cOver the last three years in your life, has the availability of Wi-Fi in coffee shops gone up or down?\u201d he asked, pointing to the oft-cited example of patent trolls threatening coffee shops and other establishments. \u201cWi-Fi is everywhere, and it is free.\u201d</p><p>But what constitutes a patent troll is typically in the eye of the beholder, and any overhaul designed to make patent trolling more difficult is also going to make it harder for many conventional patent holders.</p><p>\u201cWe want to stop patent trolls,\u201d said Brett Trout, an Iowa-based patent attorney. \u201cThe problem is defining what a patent troll is.\u201d</p><p>If the goal is to thwart malicious patent trolling, Trout said, one option would be to force those who pursue bogus claims to shoulder litigation costs. He pointed to a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in February that allowed judges to impose fees on the losers in patent litigation.</p><p>\u201cIf a patent troll loses a lawsuit and is forced to pay, that could discourage future lawsuits from being threatened,\u201d Trout said. </p><p>Heirendt, however, worries that small startups won\u2019t be able to survive the litigation long enough for legal fees to matter. </p><p>\u201cYou have to disclose these demand letters to potential investors and vendors, and that can make it impossible to do business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go belly up before you ever get some of the legal fees back.\u201d</p><p>Federal legislation targeting patent trolls passed the U.S. House in December but stalled when it became clear it had no chance of passage in the Senate. A coalition of opponents \u2014 universities, pharmaceutical and medical companies, and trial attorneys \u2014 argued that the new law would make it hard for them to defend their intellectual property.</p><p>McCaskill, however, remains optimistic that a compromise can be struck. </p><p>\u201cIf we do this right and draft (legislation) narrowly enough,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m bullish that we can get this done.\u201d </p><p>The Star\u2019s Scott Canon contributed to this article.To reach Jason Hancock, call 573-634-3565 or send email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jhancock@kcstar.com\">jhancock@kcstar.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KCSTAR-B971271027Z1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KCSTAR2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CM9-X261-DYTG-S45T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Kansas City Star All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Kansas City Star</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11093\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 8, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002CVC</classCode><className>ACACIA RESEARCH CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>ACTG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009X6F</classCode><className>PATENT INFRINGEMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdBMTVENTcwQTBDNDc0MkJFN0FFRjc4RkRDRUJGQTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQzRkZBQjVFNkJCNDdGOEE3MjZGQUY1NkVCRUQ1QjU</classCode><className>Infringement Actions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001624</classCode><className>STARTUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp;

But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" wrote 35-year-old Hughes, whose net worth is estimated at $430 million. </p><p>  After Hughes' piece was published, US Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) - who has repeatedly called for the breakup of Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants - promptly took to Twitter to express her support.  </p><p>  \"Today's big tech companies have too much power - over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy,\" Warren wrote. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech.\" </p><p>  Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, said Hughes was right in his assessment that Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram should never have been approved.  </p><p>  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) agreed, telling CNBC that the Department of Justice needs to look into \"appropriate antitrust remedies\" surrounding the acquisitions.  </p><p>  In response to Hughes' column, Facebook Vice President Nick Clegg said in a statement that the company welcomes accountability.  </p><p>  \"But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the break up of a successful American company,\" Clegg said. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet.\" </p><p>Hughes, who published a book about inequality last year, is married to Sean Eldridge, who in 2014 made an unsuccessful bid for a Congressional seat in upstate New York. </p><p>  Tech tycoon Hughes claimed in his Thursday piece that Facebook's board is more of \"an advisory committee than an overseer\" due to Zuckerberg's 60 percent voting share in the company, which gives him almost complete control of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, which billions of people use daily. </p><p>  \"I'm worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them,\" Hughes warned. </p><p>  Citing the US tradition of breaking up monopolies like Standard Oil and AT&amp;T, Hughes says that the government must bring Zuckerberg to heel and \"check the domination of Facebook.\" </p><p>  Shares of the social network lost 89 cents on Thursday, closing at 188.65. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nvega@nypost.com\">nvega@nypost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Trappings of tragedy: Chris Hughes (left) - who co-founded Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg (right) - appears to be turning on his old friend and ally in a way that brings to mind an infamous Shakespearean moment.

Since the GDPR kicked in last May, her office's probes into big tech firms have multiplied. But as we learned from the agency's recent annual report, one firm dominates the investigations: Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In all, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner now has 10 statutory inquiries into Facebook, representing more than a fifth of all such inquiries and two-thirds of its probes into multinational firms. These include probes into WhatsApp and Instagram, subsidiaries of the social media giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And they take into account last September's so-called 'token breach', where up to five million Irish and European users were affected with some 30 million accounts worldwide put at risk of being hacked. Under the EU's new GDPR rules, Facebook faces a fine of more than (EURO)2bn in a worst-case scenario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not just the social media giant that is under scrutiny - there are over 40 active investigations, including many into local authorities. But Facebook is the gorilla in the room.</p><p>Is this a coincidence? Or is Mark Zuckerberg's firm genuinely at the forefront of data privacy problems in our lives? I talked to Dixon about the issue, together with more general challenges faced by the Irish Data Protection Commission.</p><p>Adrian Weckler [AW]: Do you think it's significant that 10 out of 15 of your big new inquiries under GDPR relate to one company, Facebook? Helen Dixon [HD]: We have reacted to the circumstances that have arisen. We couldn't have predicted last September that Facebook was going to notify the massive token breach that they did. So that is entirely circumstantial.</p><p>Similarly, on the 25th of May 2018, the day that the GDPR applied, the new NGO, None Of Your Business, headed up by Max Schrems, launched complaints with European regulators on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp.</p><p>Those complaints were about very fundamental first principles under GDPR which raised issues for every user on the platform. And so in those circumstances, it kicked-off an inquiry on our part.</p><p>So, in large part, we've been led in that direction by the circumstances that have arisen. There are undoubtedly areas of high risk we will need to focus on outside of the internet companies. But this is what has shown up in terms of significant breaches complaints about systemic issues in the first seven months.</p><p>AW: When you're thinking of initiating an inquiry into a big multinational firm like that, what are the factors you take into account? How do you choose which ones to pursue? HD: There are lots of inputs that we consider. We're obliged to look at every complaint we receive from individuals. When they look like they relate to something that could be an issue that affects more than the one individual, that may trigger the launching of an inquiry.</p><p>The other feed that we have are breaches.</p><p>With the mandatory breach notification requirement in the GDPR, we're seeing evidence of large volumes of breaches that are now be notified to us.</p><p>In the seven months since GDPR has applied, the big tech companies in particular have notified us of very large-scale breaches that have affected tens of millions of users in some of the cases.</p><p>So a very big breach of the nature of some that have been reported may well trigger us to use the limited resources that every Data Protection Authority has and take on a full-scale inquiry.</p><p>We get leads by other means as well. Sometimes the European data protection authorities bring issues to our notice. The media, of course, is very important in digging out issues.</p><p>AW: Do you feel pressure to launch an inquiry into a company like Facebook? After all, that company has arguably been at the centre of the most criticism, especially by media companies, in the last two years. Has that played any part? HD: No. It can't influence our decision. If you look objectively at the facts, Facebook is a massive platform. So it's always going to be in scope.</p><p>As to whether it was predictable that the NGOs were going to lodge complaints in respect of Facebook companies out of the blocks, that probably was foreseeable.</p><p>But again, we have an obligation to handle complaints. And by any objective standard, when we receive a complaint that relates to issues that are going to affect, as I said, many millions of users, then it's appropriate that we apply resources to it.</p><p>So, no. I mean, there's a huge amount of Facebook coverage, as you say. If we were to make the inquiries that we open directly proportional to that, probably all of our inquiries [would be about Facebook]. We have 48 inquiries that we opened last year post application of the GDPR. So a proportion of them are Facebook, but it's less than a quarter actually.</p><p>AW: Are relationships with Facebook good? HD: We've always had a position that GDPR will never be successfully implemented unless there is a constant and evolving dialogue between regulators and the regulated entities.</p><p>It's a principles-based law that has been designed deliberately so that it can stretch to cover any sector and any scenario.</p><p>But that requires that there is dialogue.</p><p>Regulators need to understand the realworld scenarios of companies and public sector bodies and voluntary organisations and then come to solutions that are in the best interests of consumers and data subjects. So when you ask about relationships we're very focused on keeping dialogue open.</p><p>But of course, our relationship now with some of the bigger entities and the internet companies that we regulate is multifaceted in a way that it wasn't before. So while we still have meetings around potential future product launches to understand what the issues and risks for data subjects might be, equally we are having more correspondence in the context of statutory inquiries.</p><p>But the relationship still has to be there one way or the other.</p><p>AW: When big tech firms show you a product before it's launched, is it ever the case that they change or ditch it if your office says it won't fly? HD: It is. We had a consultation with a company just last week that notified us of a product implementation that they were planning for the EU for next month.</p><p>On foot of concerns we expressed about the approach they were taking to rolling it out in the EU, they have decided to delay it pending further engagement so that we can satisfy ourselves that they followed a process that has allowed them to assess the risks to subjects in the EU.</p><p>That's not an unusual occurrence. Because often what we're calling out is that they have taken shortcuts themselves.</p><p>AW: Has Facebook come back with any update on plans to share data between it and WhatsApp? HD: WhatsApp's pause on sharing data with Facebook for the purposes of friends, suggestions, and ad serving and product enhancements remains in place.</p><p>We actually have a specific statutory inquiry open, looking at the transparency that WhatsApp delivers to users.</p><p>Part of that investigation is looking at the way that they wrote up the privacy policy in anticipation of the application of the GDPR and how they've expressed the provisions around data-sharing with Facebook.</p><p>AW: There has been non-stop speculation that Facebook, or other social media firms, secretly listen to our conversations for the purposes of serving us ads. Has your office ever investigated this? HD: Nobody's ever contacted us and asked us specifically, but I have asked my technical team to look into the issue because we hear the same commentary.</p><p>We established a new technology leadership unit within the DPC. What that unit has said to me is that it would be very difficult to set up lab tests to fully test it.</p><p>So while we haven't set up such a lab test ourselves, they have looked at research done by researchers and academics who have looked at this question.</p><p>They're satisfied that there doesn't appear to be evidence to support the idea. It's an interesting one, though.</p><p>AW: Does this office have enough resources? HD: Our budget for 2019 is (EURO)15.2m. We brought on board 25 staff last year and recruited an additional 25, who started last month. So there's huge expansion in our resources.</p><p>That's commensurate with the tasks that we have, under the GDPR. With the extra budget we now have for 2019, we'll recruit a further 30 specialists, more technologists, more trained investigators, more communications and media staff and so on.</p><p>So we are now in the top tier of highly resourced data protection authorities in the EU. Of course, the reality is that any Data Protection Authority globally is limited in its resources.</p><p>AW: One recurring theme in the DPC's annual reports is privacy versus security. You're looking at CCTV and other surveillance issues in local authorities. But what about private estates and the growth of smart home products like Nest outdoor cameras or the Ring doorbell, which videos and photographs people who come to the door? HD: The Court of Justice of the European Union has clearly said that where a homeowner operates a CCTV system they can operate it under the household exemption.</p><p>This is the exemption we all have as individuals to administer to our family and friends and private life without becoming subject to obligations under data protection law.</p><p>But that's provided the CCTV is trained only within the limits of the perimeter of your own home.</p><p>Homeowners in Ireland that are operating schemes that are more expansive and which are scanning public areas outside of their homes either need to tailor where those cameras are trained or assume the obligations of a data controller.</p><p>AW: So with a Ring doorbell, if somebody is in your driveway or outside your door, that's okay. But if it activates because somebody across the road is getting into their car, then data protection law kicks in? HD: That's right. In that case, that householder is assuming the obligations of a data controller. They would have to provide clear notice that they are surveilling the public area.</p><p>They would also have to allow the neighbour across the road rights of access to their image into the personal data that they're recording and so on.</p><p>We get an awful lot of queries about this into our front-line service. Essentially, cameras should be trained within the perimeter of your own home.</p><p>AW: Is it fair to say that GDPR has made browsing websites disruptive, with so many increased pop-ups? HD: There seems to be quite a bit of melodrama around this issue.</p><p>The answer we would give is that we are supervising the most innovative companies in the world, companies that make a lot of money out of user experience on apps and the internet.</p><p>They're monetising personal data with the skills they have around innovation. We think there must be a way of integrating what is the fundamental rights of individuals to know what has been done with their personal data.</p><p>I don't think it's true that the international experience of users on apps is that they're being ruined or slowed down.</p><p>But if there is any assertion of this, we shouldn't look to the GDPR in assigning blame. We should look to innovative companies and say: 'Find us a better way of delivering on our rights and our experience'.</p><p>AW: But hasn't it defeated the purpose of trying to inform people about what they're consenting to? Don't people now just tap and click blindly to get past the constant pop-ups? HD: You bring up a good issue. Notice and consent aren't the only ways of legitimising collection and processing. Many industry groups argue that there is perhaps an overemphasis on consent being the most superior of the legal bases under GDPR, which it isn't. They're all equal. Of course, consent must be relied on, typically in cases where special categories of personal data are going to be processed, like health data, biometric data or political data.</p><p>So one of the questions that we are going to be looking at in some of the big inquiries that we've now opened under the GDPR is around this.</p><p>Is it objectively the case that an organisation must ensure that a user has read the notice, or is it sufficient that organisations meet a certain standard that it is readable and usable? And is it the concern of the organisation whether someone reads it or not, once the organisation has met that standard? I know that if any one of us was to read the full privacy notices on the average websites and apps we interact with, it would take 76 days a year. And so there are question marks there.</p><p>On the other hand, the law does provide for the new legitimisation of processing using transparency and consent.</p><p>AW: And what about the complaint that others such as former Yahoo and Facebook executive Alex Stamos makes that GDPR has actually made it smoother for the biggest corporations, with their compliance teams, and harder for small outfits and startups that aren't as well resourced? HD: I don't think there's any evidence to support that contention. As to whether the bigger internet companies with their privacy teams and all of the resources that they can bring to bear have successfully navigated the obligations of the GDPR, and that it's to their advantage, remains to be seen.</p><p>You've seen from the annual report that we launched 15 inquiries related to big tech companies looking at very fundamental principles under the GDPR.

Or no regulatory standards for medicines, electrical products and baby food? Manufacturers are free to do as they like with no responsibilities, or fear of penalties, when things go wrong. Terrible as it sounds, this unfettered state of affairs was until recently characteristic of what went on in the world of social media.</p><p> For a long while, the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter insisted they bore no responsibility for content on their platforms, as they were mere conduits, not publishers. They also claimed they could be relied on to fix the problems that arose on their own. Algorithms selecting news to be served to readers have given rise to so-called echo chambers and filter bubbles. Disinformation and fake news led to not just electoral manipulation but also hate crimes and mob lynchings; churches, mosques, synagogues and temples have been attacked; public health and social peace compromised by religious radicals and political partisans.</p><p> It is no wonder Big Tech's attempts failed: The challenge defied limited engineering tweaks by profit-driven entities. It was not simply a software problem but a social one. The search for alternative remedies has accelerated in recent weeks with Australia, Singapore and Britain proposing measures to deal with those responsible for harmful social media content. Indeed, none other than Mr Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has called for government regulation to \"hold companies such as Facebook accountable by imposing sanctions when we make mistakes\". Sceptics may question his motives, but his public pivot is a belated admission that the problem is bigger than even Facebook, beyond solving by any company, and calls for societies to act, with the authorities taking the lead.</p><p> Definitions of what is a \"falsehood\", \"political advertising\" and \"public interest\" will need to be made clear. Crucially too, who gets to define them: ministers, the courts or some other body? Concerns have been raised about ministers being empowered to make such decisions having a chilling effect on public discussion. In its representation to the Select Committee on this issue, representatives from this newspaper had proposed that a neutral body, or independent fact checking alliance, be tasked with adjudicating on online falsehoods. While accepting some of its other proposals, the legislation's drafters maintained that such decisions are best made by the domain minister in charge, as they might have to be taken speedily to protect lives and safeguard society. That is valid and understandable. Plans to make appealing against such ministerial pronouncements less onerous are welcome, as they make plain that redress can be sought readily, from the courts as the final arbiter of what is true or not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-576797</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVD-S551-JCF2-80Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The days leading up to the solstice have reverberated with a drumbeat of investigations and proposals aimed at limiting the power of Big Tech. They promise a fiery autumn \u2014 though it is hard to discern the outlines of any effective legislative or regulatory actions that will result.</p><p>In recent days, the US Department of Justice piled in behind the White House to demand the rollback of a key legal provision that limits the liability of online companies for content they carry. </p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has agreed to appear in person to answer questions at a Congressional investigation for the first time, raising the tantalising prospect in the coming weeks of a joint hearing involving the chief executives of all the top US technology companies. And while a collection of federal and state antitrust investigations into Big Tech in the US is coming to a head, the EU stole the headlines by announcing two <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c847838-ca25-43cf-a962-0d3588d8d34d\"> formal investigations into Apple.</url></p><p>The flurry of action shows that the lull in anti-tech sentiment in the depths of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\"> coronavirus</url> crisis has passed, and that the reckoning the industry\u2019s critics have long predicted is at hand. If there is a single motivation behind these and other actions, it is a desire to tackle the power of the biggest tech companies to act as digital gatekeepers \u2014 whether that involves online commerce or social discourse.</p><p>\u201cGatekeeper\u201d was the word used by regulators in Europe this week as they disclosed they were looking into how Apple\u2019s App Store is able to levy a 30 per cent fee, along with a separate review of Apple Pay. A similar attempt to limit powerful gatekeepers was implicit in the justice department\u2019s targeting of \u201conline platforms\u201d in its call to restrict section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which covers online content. The law doesn\u2019t only relate to platforms, but these are the companies in the line of fire.</p><p>If anxiety about Big Tech\u2019s power is high, it has not yet been distilled into a precise definition of the harm it is causing, or effective remedies.</p><p>In the area of online content, the DoJ\u2019s attack was supposedly motivated by a desire to limit the spread of the most abhorrent material. The real issue motivating the current administration in Washington, however, has been the power of the tech companies to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96c771f4-0527-4b41-b1a6-e0140b79cafc\"> arbitrarily decide</url> what <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> to allow on their platforms. Their power to censor has become a rallying cry for the political right.</p><p>The DoJ\u2019s answer this week was to demand Congress limit a platform\u2019s discretion by removing its legal protection for restricting content it considers \u201cobjectionable\u201d. That might appease critics who accuse Big Tech of limiting political speech. </p><p>But as one tech group in Washington pointed out, it would also take away the companies\u2019 power to block misinformation about the pandemic, limit racist comments and end foreign interference in elections \u2014 hardly things that would improve the online conversation. After the summer, with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/us-presidential-election\"> presidential election</url> in full swing, this promises to turn any debate about online content into political theatre.</p><p>The US political season also makes it hard to handicap the antitrust investigations into Big Tech, as the election calendar takes over. At the same time, regulators are grappling with thorny legal issues that have stymied previous attempts to tackle powerful tech companies \u2014 most notably, the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s eleventh-hour decision to drop a case against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9cd9624-317f-35b1-b2ae-cff861621706\">Google in 2013</url>.</p><p>There is no question that the leading tech companies now comprise a powerful digital oligopoly. But whether any of the companies individually has the power to foreclose competition in a particular market, and whether it is deliberately misusing that power to hurt competitors, are harder issues to prove.</p><p>Apple\u2019s App Store is a case in point. The iPhone is used by a minority of smartphone owners, and developers have other ways to reach a mobile audience, making monopolisation claims hard to prove. The company\u2019s success also owes much to its tight integration of hardware, software and services: prising those apart will be difficult without threatening the high-quality digital experiences that are at the heart of Apple\u2019s brand.\u00a0</p><p>The Apple case highlights a common theme, as antitrust regulators close in on the biggest tech platforms. From Amazon\u2019s treatment of other independent sellers and its promotion of its own-brand products, to Google\u2019s directing of search traffic to its own services, there is a worry that the platforms are hampering commercial rivals.</p><p>Antitrust laws, however, set a high bar. They require evidence that the platforms\u2019 practices were designed to exclude competitors, and that the companies have acted capriciously or gratuitously in ways that have no obvious benefit to consumers. A company such as Amazon \u2014 which has made a fierce dedication to customers a centrepiece of its culture \u2014 feels more than ready to take up the challenge.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Letter in response to this column</emphasis>:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e869442-9f49-4f5b-95d1-4ed7a6ae3fc4\"> Time to consider break-up of Big Tech oligopoly / From Istvan Dobozi, Former Lead Economist, World Bank, Sarasota, FL, US</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-26635c16c5bb4403abb514ef18d22457</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605H-5GF1-DXP9-9113-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"877\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

A lot depends on whether voters see businessmen as robber barons or men of enterprise. In a fascinating paper, which was first published in 2013 but has come into prominence more recently, economist Nimish Adhia has shown that the 1991 economic reforms were preceded by a shift in popular narratives about capitalism in Hindi films. His content analysis of the most popular Hindi films every year since 1955 is startling. Businessmen who were once habitually depicted as villains, gradually began to be shown in a more positive light. Movies that celebrated wealth did well at the box office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this matters at a time when there are growing concerns about the legitimacy of Indian capitalism. Is there a change in narrative on the cards? There is no general backlash as yet-but there has been ample reason for growing scepticism.</p><p>The recent events at ICICI Bank and Fortis Healthcare are a case in point. Neither the management groups nor the boards of these companies have emerged with flying colours. This was preceded by the rampant corruption when natural resources were allocated in the first years of this decade, as well as the massive loan defaults by infrastructure companies with political contacts. Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya are already seen as examples of how the rich can escape Indian law. Arvind Subramanian has described the situation well-India has moved from crony socialism to stigmatized capitalism.</p><p>In 2009, Rafael Di Tella of the Harvard Business School and Robert Macculloch of Imperial College asked why capitalism does not flow to poor countries, despite the clear evidence that it is more successful than socialism in raising living standards. The two scholars linked it to the problem of corruption. The usual assumption is that heavy regulation promotes corruption. The causality runs in the opposite direction as well. There are popular demands for regulation when voters believe that wealth is created through corruption rather than competition. Di Tella and Macculloch argue that people vote for interventionist policies because they see them as a form of punishment for corruption.</p><p>A lot thus depends on whether citizens believe that wealth has been generated through political leverage or competitive excellence-and whether the rule of the law applies equally to all. The populist backlash in the West is at least partly because of the unchecked power of Wall Street, though the big tech companies of Silicon Valley are also feeling the heat now.</p><p>The populist wave has not yet reached Indian shores, but that may not be the case for long. The danger is either the sort of investigative pressure that bankers are facing right now or new regulations that choke off new enterprises. The result could very well be a general retreat from commercial risk.</p><p>Economic reforms need to break the grip of stigmatized capitalism through more competitive markets, a reinstated fundamental right to property, greater reliance on rules rather than discretion, and a change in the way government contracts are awarded. The new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a case in point, because, for the first time, large borrowers who have defaulted on bank loans are losing control of their assets. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act is another example of power shifting from developers to home buyers.</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, Raghuram Rajan had sent out a stark warning in a speech to Mumbai businessmen: \"We are at a crossroad. With the right policies and some luck, we will become a middle income constitutional democracy in my lifetime. But inaction coupled with bad luck could make us an unequal oligarchy, or worse, perhaps far sooner than we think.\"</p><p>In the 1950s, as Adhia has argued, the rich had inherited wealth that was frittered away smoking (Jagriti), hunting (Madhumati) and drinking (Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam). Only the poor worked. It has been a long journey since to films such as Dil Chahta Hai and Guru, which celebrate wealth as well as the quest for it.</p><p>The cinematic narrative has not turned as yet, perhaps because rapid economic growth still offers hope for upward mobility. But it would be a good idea to keep a close eye on the list of box-office hits in the coming years, to get an early sense of whether there is a coming backlash against stigmatized capitalism.</p><p>What are the consequences of delegitimization of capitalism in the eyes of citizens?

President Trump and Republicans face meaningful headwinds for their respective 2020 reelections.Overall, the 2018 election illuminated a country that is largely at odds with itself on the most important policy questions it faces at the federal level. The 2016 election exposed many of these fault lines, and the 2018 election realigned some of those fault lines but reinforced others. While there is bipartisan hope Congress and President Trump can tackle the big problems facing the nation, there is little clarity on which solutions actually can garner bipartisan support amongst the American public.The following post-election assessment and forecast for the next two years in Washington is based on a deep dive into several interrelated questions:What are the priorities of the 116th Congress, and how will President Trump respond to those priorities?What demographic changes do the newly elected Senators and Representatives represent?</p><p>Who will be the leaders in the new Congress?Does a divided Congress mean gridlock, or is there evidence that a divided Congress can still pass major legislation?We have a separate memo that delves into four key questions about the election results and political conditions from today forward through the 2020 presidential election.We are available to provide more in-depth analysis of specific policy areas for those who want to have discussions on particular policy sectors or areas.The Agenda for the 116th Congress and President TrumpThe Democratic AgendaIn the 116th Congress, House Democrats will split time between (1) using their oversight powers, including the ability to subpoena, to restrain the Trump Administration, and (2) legislating on major policy priorities. On the legislative front, as we discuss below, we expect the House to focus on healthcare, environmental protections and climate change, transportation, competition and privacy, trade, education, and infrastructure development.Investigations and OversightFrom an oversight and investigations perspective, we expect House Democrats to look into a broad range of matters, including healthcare policy, environmental compliance, foreign policy, competition and antitrust, prescription drug prices, disaster relief efforts, national security policies, and election security. Already, Democrats have announced they will request that the Internal Revenue Service turn over President Trump's tax returns. Other House Committees will want to investigate President Trump's business dealings in a variety of ways. We can expect the House Judiciary Committee to delve into the resignation details of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the constitutionality of the president appointing as Acting Attorney General an official who has not been Senate-confirmed. Democrats also have made clear they intend to compel Administration officials, such as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, to testify on a variety of ethical controversies.Of course, there are a number of newly elected House Democrats who favor filing articles of impeachment against President Trump, but the expected House Democratic leadership team has consistently played down that possibility. We do not expect that to change unless the Mueller report demonstrates illegal coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign in the 2016 elections. If there are clear threats to the independence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into President Trump, House Democrats may pass legislation that limits the president's ability to fire Mueller or bury the findings of his final report.What It Means: Democrats know that a House focused on investigations and impeachments creates political risks as they set their sights on the 2020 election. Therefore, Democrats will enter the 116th Congress with an aggressive legislative agenda that prioritizes must-pass legislation and legislation that appeals directly to their base, such as immigration reform, gun reform and voting rights reform. The Democratic agenda also will place a strong emphasis on consumer protections.Democratic Legislative PrioritiesAmong the first acts of each new House is passage of the chamber's rules. The new rules may restore \"Pay-Go\" rules that require new spending and tax cuts to be paid for with new revenue or budgetary cuts elsewhere.The expected incoming House Democratic leadership team intends to pass a package of ethics and election reform legislation early in 2019. This will likely include restoring elements of the Voting Rights Act invalidated by recent Supreme Court decisions, requiring public disclosure of all donors to entities involved in political advocacy, a reversal of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision allowing political advocacy by corporations, and stricter controls over the lobbying industry. We do not expect the Senate to pass such legislation.The recent tragic mass shootings in Pittsburgh (PA) and Thousand Oaks (CA) may create pressure for the new Democratic majority to pass gun control legislation early in 2019, even if such legislation was unlikely to move in the Senate.What It Means: A new House majority always frontloads its legislative calendar with items that demonstrate how it differs from the prior majority. Ethics reform and broad gun control legislation was not going to happen under a Republican House, so quick passage of popular legislation on these issues are clear signals Democrats are headed in a different policy direction.The Return of Core Democratic Policy PrioritiesA Democratic House ends all serious legislative efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), though the Trump Administration will continue its work to disassemble the ACA via regulatory action. Despite this, Democrats will feel pressure to address the increasing premiums for individual health plans, while maintaining certain ACA provisions such as protecting pre-existing conditions. In addition, drug pricing will be on the top of Democrats' healthcare agenda. We expect both the House Energy and Commerce and the Oversight and Government Reform Committees to hold hearings to bring transparency to manufacturers' drug pricing systems, and for Democrats to introduce legislation that contrasts with the Trump Administration's drug pricing proposals. We also anticipate Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee to engage in oversight activity on pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance mergers. For more information on the coming Congressional agenda on healthcare, see the following publication from our teammates: Impact of the Mid-Term Elections on the Life Sciences Industry[2].The new House Democratic majority will prioritize climate change policy. It is possible Democrats may use the infrastructure measure to incorporate provisions related to grid modernization and efficiency into the bill. In addition, Democrats will likely introduce a package of climate change bills and engage in oversight activities over the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) dismantling of the Obama Administration's environmental regulations. It is also possible the House will use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to try and preserve some of President Obama's environmental initiatives that President Trump is now eliminating. House Democrats know the Senate is not likely to take up these measures, but using the CRA could put Senate Republicans on the defense.Immigration reform remains a priority for much of the Democratic base, and House Democrats will be staunch opponents of funding for President Trump's border wall. The new House majority will also look for ways to support the legal status of Dreamers.Criminal justice reform is one area where common ground is likely to be found. We expect it to be a perhaps surprisingly early priority of both parties and the Administration. Indeed, an optimist might even hope that cooperation on that subject could prove to be a trust-building exercise for more cooperation on tougher challenges such as infrastructure financing and immigration.What It Means: Healthcare was the top policy priority of 2018 voters and the House will deliver a consistent stream of hearings, investigations and legislation. The House will use its investigation and legislative powers to halt or slow down President Trump's deregulatory agenda in the environmental space. Further, the House will be an opposing force to President Trump's immigration actions even if major legislative solutions on this issue cannot clear Congress. On all these issues, the Democratic House will be highly visible and active compared to the last few years under Republican control of the House.Tech Policy, Especially Privacy, Will Be Under the MicroscopeDemocrats in both chambers will provide oversight and legislate on privacy. Establishing national privacy standards remains a bipartisan interest, but the two parties will diverge on how stringent the standards should be. Republicans will push for a national privacy framework that preempts state laws, particularly with the California Consumer Protection Act taking effect in 2020. While Democrats also view preemption as a measure to ensure consistent consumer protection laws across states, they do not intend to concede on preemption without the inclusion of stringent consumer data privacy protection provisions. Democrats also want to give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement power over privacy issues.We also anticipate Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to bring in tech and media companies to investigate data privacy violations and mergers. Further, House Democrats will take the liberty to increase oversight of tech industry regulators such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), particularly on net neutrality. With control of the House, Democrats may feel the pressure to work with Republicans to pass a nationwide net neutrality framework to avoid significant changes in the FCC's rules in the future.In addition to privacy, Democrats will prioritize their legislative agenda on security. Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee intend to work with Republicans to address mounting concerns with intellectual property theft and securing the supply chain by foreign entities, especially IT companies closely tied to the Chinese government. In September, the House passed the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act, authorizing only the Homeland Security Department to ban contractors that pose a cybersecurity and national security risk. The bill has stalled in the Senate and presents an opportunity for Democrats to expand the bill's scope to a government-wide solution in the 116th Congress. In the Senate, there are questions about which Democrat will take up the mantle on supply-chain security issues, given that Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) lost her seat.What It Means: Regardless of who won the elections, Congress is increasingly concerned with the level of control big tech companies have over the everyday lives of Americans. The new Democratic House will be proactive in looking for ways legislation and regulation can rein in the worst excesses of the tech sector's intrusions into individual privacy.Resetting Policy on Taxes, Appropriations, Financial Services, and TradeOn the House Ways and Means Committee, Democrats will likely work to pass technical corrections to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and tax extenders that appeal to the Democratic base, such as renewable tax credits and the deduction of college tuition. Corporate tax issues will be scrutinized for potential new federal revenue. The Committee also is expected to prioritize retirement and pension reform.Much of the appropriations process got back on track in 2018. Now, it will be critical for the seven remaining appropriations bills to be finished in the lame duck session if House Democrats want to start the Fiscal Year 2020 process on time. Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee will look to maintain the annual appropriations process and push for two-year budget agreements. As for earmarks, their return remains uncertain as there are diverse and diverging opinions on earmarks within the party.We expect the House Financial Services Committee to conduct oversight and issue subpoenas to Trump Administration officials to testify about its reorganization of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), including limiting the Bureau's enforcement actions. We also expect more oversight hearings on enforcement actions related to the big banks. The Committee's priorities will also include Congressional actions needed for regulatory reform for the financial services industry, potential reactivation of the Export-Import Bank, GSE reform, reauthorization of both the Flood Insurance Program and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Acts, fintech oversight and cybersecurity/data breach issues. For a more comprehensive review of the policy agenda of the Financial Services sector, please see the policy briefing from some of our colleagues: Impact of the 2018 Mid-Term Elections on Financial Services Regulation[3].As for trade, House Democrats will likely use their oversight authority to examine the Trump Administration's trade agenda and the adverse effects of retaliatory tariffs by other countries. While the Trump Administration is seeking to move quickly on the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, House Democrats will use their procedural tools to slow down President Trump's preferred approval timeline. President Trump cannot pass USMCA without strong support from House Democrats, giving the new House majority leverage on trade issues. Democrats may try to secure targeted concessions on Democratic priorities as a condition of supporting USMCA's passage. Both the Senate and House have procedural tools to stall the approval process for USMCA which, combined with the sheer number of new Representatives and Senators who may not yet understand trade policy, makes it challenging to predict if Congress will ultimately approve USMCA.What It Means: Any future tax cut will be focused on the middle class, but it is more likely that there simply is no major tax code change in the near term. The financial services industry will find itself under the most scrutiny since the immediate aftermath of the 2008 banking meltdown. President Trump is going to have to negotiate on fiscal priorities for the first time, and Congressional Democrats have a great record of emerging with substantial victories on spending issues, especially on nondefense discretionary spending. The same is true with trade. There is no USMCA deal possible unless President Trump offers trade concessions or grants other legislative compromises as the price for Democratic support.Infrastructure and EducationOne of the Democrats' top legislative priorities may be passing a major infrastructure package, as both parties view this as an opportunity for bipartisanship and a way to boost job creation. Congress will need to address an anticipated shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund and reauthorize surface transportation programs expiring in the current five-year authorization under the FAST Act.As for education, House Democrats will use their Aim Higher Act as a blueprint for a Higher Education Act reauthorization bill and have said they want to move forward with a bipartisan reauthorization process. However, Democrats will likely take hard stances on accountability measures, particularly for for-profit institutions, as well as preserving and expanding student financial aid programs to address concerns about college affordability and accessibility. Additionally, we expect a heavy dose of oversight of the Department of Education. Much of the Department's regulatory actions around Title IX, gainful employment, student loan servicers, for-profit institutions, student borrower defenses, and accessibility for students with disabilities will be under the microscope. House Democrats also will question the Department's handling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, as the Department has failed to approve the majority of applications.What It Means: As we discuss later, a divided Congress can achieve bipartisanship on major legislation. A major investment in infrastructure and reforms of the laws governing higher education touch pocketbook issues that affect most voters, especially swing and youth voters. These are two areas where Congressional bipartisanship, or even agreement with President Trump, could lead to major legislation becoming law.The Republican AgendaThe split control of Congress triggered by the midterm election establishes a two-track strategic approach for Republican lawmakers in the 116th Congress. Republicans in both chambers of Congress will defend the Administration and White House on a number of fronts. In the Senate, the Republican majority has a responsibility to move Trump Administration nominees quickly through the confirmation process. Meanwhile, House Republicans serving in the minority will be tasked with the unenviable job of defending the Administrationmdash;and in many cases, industry interestsmdash;as the new Democratic majority begins to press forward with an aggressive oversight and investigation agenda that we anticipate will be wide-ranging.First and foremost, the Senate Republican majority will need to shepherd through a forthcoming nomination to succeed Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. That contentious process will serve as a political flashpoint on the nominee's views on a range of issues. It may also be a referendum on the president's plans regarding Special Counsel Mueller and the future of his investigation. The president may also nominate Acting Administrator Wheeler to serve as the permanent Administrator of EPA. He may also need to appoint a nominee to replace Secretary Zinke at the Department of Interior who is under ethics scrutiny.Senate Republicans will likely devote significant floor time to approving nominations at every level of the Judiciary. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed through a near-record number of nominees for the US district and appellate courts over the past two years, in addition to two new Supreme Court nominees. And that process may well play out again in the new Congress. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas could, for instance, decide to retire at the end of the current term to ensure that a Republican president can nominate a replacement while the Senate is under Republican management. Richard Nixon was the last president with three Supreme Court nominations in a single term. And while we do not anticipate other openings on the Court, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent accident is a reminder many Supreme Court openings arrive unexpectedly.What It Means: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell knows personnel is policy, and he will focus his chamber on confirming the people needed for President Trump to transform the judicial branch in the long term, and reshape the executive branch in the near term.Other Legislative ItemsMore broadly, Senate Republicans will likely continue to press ahead on major \"must pass\" legislation in the new Congress along with other high-priority policy agenda items. Transportation and infrastructure issues jump immediately to the forefront in this scenario. Another priority may be extension of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELAR), which expires in December of 2019. Senate Republicans also appear poised to lead a bipartisan effort to establish regulations to protect consumers' online privacy in our increasingly digital ecosystem. Finally, Republicans may attempt to pass new tax reform legislation focused on a middle-class tax cut ahead of the 2020 election.We expect House Republicans to serve mostly as a messaging arm on major policy issues that will arise in the new Congress. They will serve as the loyal opposition to Democratic oversight and investigation initiatives and attempt to influence the trajectory of major \"must pass\" legislation. But ultimately, their chief objective will be thwarting what they view as objectionable legislative initiatives and efforts to derail the Administration's agenda.Turnover in the Trump AdministrationAfter two years operating at a frenetic pace, many Trump Administration top officials are expected to depart over the next few months. The exodus began a few weeks ago with UN Ambassador Nikki Haley stepping down. Now, after the election, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has departed and will need to be replaced. President Trump has said he was going to take the week after the election to consider further changes in his Cabinet, which is in keeping with the practices of his predecessors in the White House, who often used the post-election period to make changes in their Cabinet.President Trump already has a turnover rate in his Cabinet and White House that is far higher than historical norms.2 Now, there is some expectation that he is contemplating turnover for Chief of Staff (John Kelly), Defense Secretary (Jim Mattis), Homeland Security Secretary (Kirstjen Nielsen), Commerce Secretary (Wilbur Ross), and Interior Secretary (Ryan Zinke). It is possible that President Trump will seek to turn over some or all of those positions, but it is also reasonable to think that several of the existing Cabinet members who have served since the beginning of the Trump Administration will also choose to step down now.What It Means: There's high turnover in President Trump's Cabinet, which places stress on the Senate confirmation process, and creates delays in confirming the critical sub-Cabinet officials awaiting confirmation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has used every procedural tool to slow the timeline for confirming second-level Trump Administration officials, handicapping the president's ability to take control of agencies and implement major changes that match his policy preferences. While the president now has a larger Republican majority to deal with, he will have to spend more time than he would like getting top-level officials confirmed. That leaves less time for confirming second-level officials, and less Senate floor time for actual legislation to be debated.Confirmation of judges is a legacy item for President Trump, as these judges will be in place for decades after the president leaves office. A third Supreme Court nomination fight may be a possibility in the next two years, and could be another highly charged political battle.Trends Among New Senators and RepresentativesThe 116th Senate Will Be a Young and Less Experienced BodyWhile there is perception that Washington is comprised of lifelong political \"swamp creatures,\" the reality is that the level of Congressional experience has been dropping in recent years.Pending the results in Florida for Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), there will be only 15 or 16 Senators who have served more than 18 years. At least 57 Senators in 2019 will have been in the Senate less than eight years. This means they have little or no institutional memory of the bipartisan comity that used to be the hallmark of the Senate, which has been largely washed away in the last decade or so.Forty-nine Senators in office in 2019 will have previously served in the House of Representatives and thus are familiar with the more partisan legislative customs of that chamber.What It Means: It will be harder for the Senate to pass major legislation because there are fewer Senators who have led such legislation to the finish line. The high number of former House members in the Senate means new Senators are bringing more of the House's culture to the Senate, and are adopting fewer of the Senate's historical norms.House Turnover Is AcceleratingThis year's election resulted in the third-highest turnover rate in the House since 1974. Since 2010 was also the second-highest turnover rate in the House since 1974, you have a body where the vast majority of Members are inexperienced by historical standards.3Only 56 House Republicans were in office before 2011 when Republicans became the majority, meaning few of the rank-and-file are prepared for the stark realities of life in the minority.Conversely, well under 50 percent of the new Democratic majority were serving in Congress the last time their party controlled the chamber.What It Means: There are relatively few House members who have served in both the majority and minority. Some of the more progressive new Democrats elected will want rules that minimize the chances of Republicans undermining the legislative will of the new majority. But many of the Democrats elected come from districts that demand and expect bipartisan cooperation from their member, and such promises were central to their election. There is also the relatively new bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which has offered a set of procedural reforms that would reward bipartisanship, and reset the partisan mindset of the House. It will be interesting to see if any of those reforms are implemented in the transfer of power in the House.Continued Gains for Women in CongressThis is an election of firsts, especially for female candidates. As of November 14, a record 99 women have won a House seat (with some races still not called). In the House, 86 of those women are Democrats, and only 13 are Republicans, as many Republican women lost their House races. The Senate will have 23 or 24 women, depending on the final outcome of the Mississippi runoff at the end of November.4 In the last six years, voters have chosen the three youngest women ever elected to Congress. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) was 30 when elected in 2014, and while she was reelected, her record was broken by two Democrats in 2018. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) (age 29) is now the youngest woman ever elected, edging out Rep-elect Abby Finkenauer (D-IA), who will turn 30 the week before she will be sworn into office.Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) is the first black female member of Congress from Massachusetts. Veronica Escobar (D-TX) and Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) are the first Latina women elected to Congress in Texas. The first two Native American females elected to Congress are Sharice Davids (D-KS) and Deb Haaland (D-NM). Similarly, the next Congress will be the first to include Muslim female Representatives after the election of Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN).If she holds onto a very narrow lead, Young Kim (R-CA) would be the first Korean-American female elected to Congress. Nevertheless, even with Kim's potential addition, the number of Republican women in the House will be about half the number in the current Congress.The House is likely to elect Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) Speaker of the House, again making her the only female Speaker in American history. Speaker Pelosi would be the first Speaker elected to nonconsecutive terms in that position since Sam Rayburn (D-TX) and Joseph Martin (R-MA) spent 20 years trading the Speaker's gavel between 1940 and 1961.The next Congress will include 23 women in the Senate. Tennessee elected their first female Senator in Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Arizona did as well with Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). Appointed Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) will be in a runoff on November 27, and, if she wins, she will be the first woman to win a Congressional race in the state.What It Means: The election of more women to Congress will result in cultural changes big and small to the House and Senate. Women in Congress will head many of the most powerful committees for the first time, such as the House Appropriations Committee, and will be key players on virtually every committee of relevance, and every debate of consequence. Women elected in Congress have generally been more collaborative on bipartisan legislation and more interested in making even incremental progress on an issue rather than holding out for a \"perfect\" legislative solution.Veteran Influence in Congress Continues to DeclineThere has been a great deal of media attention paid to the fact that Democrats recruited a number of military veterans who won election to the House or Senate, but the reality is military service amongst Senators and Representatives will continue to fall in the next Congress. The incoming class will include at least 17 freshmen Senators and Representatives. This is slightly larger than recent classes in 2016 (14), 2014 (12) and 2012 (12), but there is much more ideological balance inside this freshman class of veterans.5 Three of the freshmen veterans are women.Overall, at least 77 veterans won election (most of them as incumbents), and there are 16 other Senators who are veterans but were not up for election in 2018.6 Nevertheless, the new Congress will have fewer veterans than the 102 that started in the current 115th Congress.7 By comparison, in the early 1970s, when Congress was populated largely by men who came of age in World War II, about 75 percent of the House and Senate were veterans.8 Aabout half of all veterans in Congress in 2019 will be those who served after 9/11.9 Republican veterans in Congress are expected to outnumber Democratic veterans by about a 2-1 margin.10What It Means: Veterans are usually touted as more likely to be bipartisan problem-solvers than other members of Congress, and most are staunch defenders of military spending and improving care at the VA. The continued decline of veterans in Congress means there are fewer policymakers with first-hand experience about policy decisions that affect troop deployments, strategic projection of forces, acquisition of complex military systems, and military responses to an ever-widening array of threats to the United States. It also means fewer members of Congress have first-hand understanding of the complex VA medical system and whether it is delivering cost-effective, high-quality medical care for enough of its patients. Finally, a majority of veterans now come from asymmetrical warfare environments, and that experience will shape their perspective on policy debates about military policy and military spending.New Congressional LeadersHouse DemocratsThe House Democratic leadership team hopes to stay intact and withstand challenges from members of the new majority who want to see some turnover at the top. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will most likely become Speaker of the House again, with both Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (D-SC) trying to move up a rung on the leadership ladder to Majority Leader and Majority Whip, respectively. But upstart challengers loom, as reflected in Rep. Diana DeGette's (D-CO) decision to challenge Rep. Clyburn for the Majority Whip position, which could lead to a broader set of candidates contesting the top three leadership candidates. Democrats will also need to elect two additional members into the open leadership positions of Assistant Democratic Leader and Democratic Caucus Chairman (now held by Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY), who lost his primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). We expect Reps. Cheri Bustos (D-IL), David Cicilline (D-RI), Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), and Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), among others, to run for these positions.Congressional Democrats are likely to view the coming Congress as a transitional period from one historic generation of leadership to another. In the House, the first woman elected Speaker, and the first African-American in leadership, will likely return to power, but perhaps only for two more years. A wide array of Democratsmdash;representing all regions, demographics and policy perspectivesmdash;are maneuvering in advance of the full-scale leadership battle that is on the horizon when the current leadership team retires.What It Means: The youth vote and first-time voters have spoken, and their voice will now give rise to the oldest-ever leadership team in the House, where all three top Democrats are approaching 80, and the median age of incoming committee chairs is 70. That dynamic can't hold for long, but Speaker Pelosi is likely to be very diligent in doling out high-profile legislative opportunities to allow the entering class of members to shine. It's good politics for 2020, but it also allows Speaker Pelosi to maximize her role in shaping the leadership team that ultimately replaces her.House Democrats have made wise use of their time in the political wilderness to build a wide array of policy initiatives and experts inside their own Caucus. They may not have campaigned on those issues because it was politically more expedient to run on an \"oppose President Trump\" platform, but the party does have the pieces to begin moving legislation right away in the House. The lack of experience in the majority for House Democrats will inevitably lead to some procedural hiccups and missteps in the near-term, but the majority has the raw materials needed to move both partisan and bipartisan legislation in 2019.House RepublicansThe Republican leadership will change with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) retiring at the end of the year, and a reduction to the minority party in the House meaning there is one less leadership position to fill. The Republican conference elected Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as the Minority Leader, Steve Scalise (R-LA) as the Minority Whip, and Liz Cheney (R-WY) as the Conference Chair (replacing the current GOP Conference chair, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-WA)). The lack of more Republican women in leadership, and as Committee Ranking Members, is something the party will continue to look to address.House Republicans face a serious brain drain in 2019 for three reasons. First, several long-serving Republicans who were committee chairs retired before the 2018 election, taking with them a generation of knowledge that stretched back to even before Republicans won the House for the first time in 1994. Many of the Republican party's biggest policy initiatives in the last 20 years stemmed from the minds of House Republicans who just retired. Second, Speaker Paul Ryan was the most influential and effective policy voice in his party, and it was his policy expertise that drove his rise to power. The Speaker's retirement is the biggest sign the Republican Party is walking away from almost 20 years of debate about how to reform the entitlements that are eating the federal budget (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security). Finally, several other Republican committee chairs, subcommittee chairs, and policy wonks were defeated in the 2018 election cycle. Republicans control the White House and the Senate, so the president and the Senate majority will set the Republican policy agenda. This covers up the fact that House Republicans have lost many of their best policy and procedural experts. Unless and until a new generation of policy experts comes forward in the House, Republicans will be heavily dependent on President Trump's agenda.What It Means: Republicans took the House in 1994 in large part because of the Contract for America. Republicans seized the House back in 2010 in part because they had a clearly articulated vision of how they wanted to roll back some of President Obama's policy initiatives. In 2020, it is much harder for the chamber to flip if Republicans don't articulate a new policy agenda that helps them emerge from the shadow of President Trump and his policy preferences. Right now, it is not clear which House Republicans will fill that role of driving new policy ideas.Massive Turnover on House CommitteesThere are many House committees that will see wholesale turnover in their membership in January. For example, the current Ways and Means Committee, which controls tax, trade and much of healthcare policy in the House, has 24 Republicans and 14 Democrats. The Democratic majority sets committee ratios and may end up with roughly the same allotment for Ways and Means as the current Congress, only with the parties flipped. Ten of the 24 Republicans on the Committee won't be in the next Congress, leaving 14 returning Republicans. It's possible then that no new Republicans are appointed to the committee. Conversely, Democrats will expect to add 10-12 seats on the Committee for their members. They have 12 of 14 current members returning to the next Congress, meaning they may have 8-10 plum committee assignments to spread amongst their caucus.What It Means: Once final committee ratios are set, we can expect to see House Democrats add several seats for their members on every committee. Key committees like Ways and Means will have a very high number of new members learning the issues. Even still, demand to be appointed to top committees will far outpace the available supply of seats on those committees. There may be very few seats for Republicans to claim on the top-level committees.SenateIn the Senate, we do not foresee changes in the Democratic leadership, but party term limits require a shift in Republican leadership under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) is term-limited in his current position, but he is likely to stay on the Senate Republican leadership team in some newly created capacity. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) is the new Majority Whip.What It Means: The Senate floor in 2019 will look like blind auditions for the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. As many as eight different Senators are seriously contemplating running for president, and they will look to use Senate committee hearings and floor debates to define their platform. In some cases, the political ambitions of these Senators may conflict with Senate Minority Leader Schumer's agenda for his party in the chamber. The Senate minority will have a harder time with votes as well, since several Senators might soon favor time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina over mundane roll call votes in Washington. One area where presidential ambitions of Democratic Senators intersects favorably with the Minority Leader's agenda is the all-out effort to slow down the process of confirming Trump Administration officials.It's going to be harder for the Democratic Senate minority to be a blocking force on legislation, even as the party doubles down on a procedural delay strategy for presidential nominations. Look for Senator Schumer to pick his spots more carefully to ensure he has the political capital to be effective when needed most.Can a Divided Congress Be a Productive Congress and Pass Major Legislation?Most political commentators present divided government as a path to legislative gridlock, but recent history demonstrates that is not true. There are three recent examples of a divided federal government, and looking at the successes and failures of those three eras is interesting to review in the context of the two years to come in Washington.Lessons Learned from the Last Three Divided Congressional SessionsPresident George W. Bush's first two years featured a divided Congress (the 107th from 2001-02), where his party controlled the House but not the Senate. Nevertheless, President Bush enjoyed an extremely productive record of success. Major success included: President Bush's tax cuts package; the Patriot Act in the wake of 9/11; the creation of the Department of Homeland Security; Sarbanes-Oxley to increase regulation of the financial services industry; the authorization for use of military force against Iraq; Trade Promotion Authority to allow future presidents to negotiate better trade deals; a fundamental rewrite of primary/secondary education in the No Child Left Behind Act; the McCain-Feingold Act to regulate political spending; a farm bill; a bill to prepare and protect the nation against bioterrorism threats; the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act; and the Help America Vote Act, which was a package to upgrade state and local-level voting technology. In short, President Bush worked with a divided Congress to pass major legislation in a broad number of sectors.President Barack Obama dealt with two consecutive Congresses where his party controlled only one chamber (112th Congress from 2011-12, and the 113th Congress from 2013-14). Like the divided Congress President Trump is about to face, President Obama's Democratic party lost the House to the opposition but retained control of the Senate. Also like President Trump following the mid-term elections, President Obama lost control of the House in the 2010 elections, after a period where the president had been able to use complete control of Congress to pass his biggest policy promises. For President Obama, those promises included the Affordable Care Act, the economic stimulus package, and the Dodd-Frank bill.President Obama's work with the divided Congress in 2013-14 still yielded passage of some major legislative items. These items included: the Budget Control Act of 2011 (which kicked off a multiyear process to try and tame the growth of the national debt); Free Trade Agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama; the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent for the middle class; the STOCK Act to limit the potential for insider trading scandals in Congress; extending the National Flood Insurance Act; a major infrastructure package (MAP-21); several bills to improve operations at the FDA; and the Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act.President Obama's second term also kicked off with a divided Congress where his party controlled the Senate, but Republicans controlled the House. With his biggest legislative accomplishments now three to four years old, President Obama had a harder time moving major legislation to the finish line. Some of what did pass includes: the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; reauthorization of laws preparing the country to deal with pandemics and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) terrorism; legislation to stabilize the student loan marketplace; a farm bill reauthorization; and reauthorized funding for medical residency training at children's hospitals.There were commonalities in the success both Presidents Bush and Obama enjoyed in facing a divided Congress. Both presidents cultivated key Congressional players in both parties, were willing to deal to get things done and had excellent White House legislative staffs handling the details of key negotiations.What It Means: A divided Congress is not a recipe for gridlock, but it does call for a change in presidential tactics to help things move through the process. President Trump values the art of the deal over the details in those deals, and he has a good legislative staff in the White House. Those are two of the key elements Presidents Bush and Obama used to deal with a divided Congress. President Trump has used his bully pulpit to create momentum for policy changes he seeks. In an all-Republican Congress, he was successful in making progress on many of his policy priorities, and he was able to openly attack his political opponents because he often did not need their votes. Now that must change if the president wants to get things done. If the president can alter his propensity for attacking political rivals, and instead look to bridge small gaps where they exist, it is possible President Trump can also get big things done in this divided Congress.The Volume and Success Rate of Legislation Drops Slightly in a Divided CongressOverall, it IS harder than ever to pass a bill through Congress, regardless of its level of division. We looked at the legislative productivity in the last three Congresses where one party controlled each chamber,11 along with the numbers for the current Congress. In those three divided Congresses, the House of Representatives passed an average of 904 bills, while the Senate passed an average of 597 bills. Those numbers are about 25 percent less than the current House has passed, and 14 percent less than what the current Senate has done in an all-Republican Washington.In President George W. Bush's first Congress (2001-02), he faced a divided Congress but 383 bills were signed into law. By President Barack Obama's second (2011-12) and third Congress (2013-14) he was facing also facing a divided Congress, and only 284 bills became law in 2011-12. By 2013-14, the president signed only 219 bills into law, a 43 percent reduction from 2001-02's divided Congress. For President Trump's first term, with a Congress totally controlled by his party, we've seen a rebound to 278 bills signed into law through the election, with reasonable expectations we might top 300 bills signed into law by the end of the session.What It Means: A divided Congress creates disparate perspectives on many issues, but it does not create gridlock in and of itself. A divided Congress is likely going to pass 750-1,300 bills in the House, 550-650 bills in the Senate, and can expect to deliver 250-375 bills to the president for signature. In fact, a divided Congress can pass major legislation when both parties have political incentive to find common ground on some issues before next asking voters for support.Outside of major legislation, a divided Congress will still pass hundreds of other bills, and a reasonable percentage of those bills will become law. At the very least, the bills that pass one chamber but not the other in a divided Congress, are often the blueprint to quickly pass similar legislation when Congress is controlled by just one party. Thus, it is a high-risk strategy for companies, coalitions, not-for-profit organizations, and associations to throttle down their advocacy efforts or sit out the process altogether because they face a divided Congress.Trump Triangulation Coming in the Next Congress?Some political commentators have talked about the prospect of President Trump engaging in some political triangulation with the opposing party. This is of course the exact playbook President Bill Clinton used in 1995-96 to deal with the first Republican House in decades. President Clinton revived his political fortunes by working with new House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) to pass legislation that angered portions of his Democratic base but appealed to the moderate, middle-class voters who would go on to reelect him in 1996. Major legislation included: welfare reform, the Defense of Marriage Act, tough crime laws, the line item veto, HIPAA, the Telecommunications Act (which included new decency standards), and Helms-Burton (Cuba embargo and sanctions).What It Means: There are going to be days that President Trump makes Congressional Democrats happy and Congressional Republicans very nervous. For President Trump, many of his policy positions are flexible, as the president prefers to \"do something\" than to do nothing on a key topic. It's quite possible he will find it appealing to find common ground with Speaker Pelosi on some major items like infrastructure reform, higher-education reform and trade, even if such a deal means angering some portions of the traditional Republican base (which is not the same as the Trump base).Footnotes1 We would define a wave election as anytime a party flips control of a chamber of Congress or gains more than 25 seats in the House.2 See \"Trump's staff turnover is the highest of any US administration in modern history[4],\" Business Insider (Mar. 28, 2018).3 See \"There Was A Lot Of Turnover In The House In The 2018 Cycle[5],\" FiveThirtyEight (Nov. 13, 2018).4 See \"Record number of women elected to the House[6],\" CBS News (Nov. 12, 2018).5 See \"U.S. House freshman class includes most veterans in nearly a decade[7],\" Reuters (Nov. 7, 2018).6 See \"U.S. House freshman class includes most veterans in nearly a decade[8],\" Reuters (Nov. 7, 2018).7 See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again[9],\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).8 See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again[10],\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).9 See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again[11],\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).10 See \"The number of vets in Congress appears headed down again[12],\" Military Times (Nov. 7, 2018).11 The three Congresses were the 107th (2001-02), 112th (2011-12), and 113th (2013-14).The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Many journalists covered this news with skepticism[2]. They countered that Zuckerberg might be angling for regulations favorable to Facebook or trying to offload Facebook's own responsibilities onto regulators.According to BuzzFeed News's Craig Silverman, journalists covering Silicon Valley have increasingly embraced the role of 'watchdog' rather than 'mascot.' Here, journalists are in a position to provide a helpful nudge. To do so, they will need to help readers understand not only Big Tech's problems, but also potential solutions to those problems.The past few years have shown a mounting rage directed towards Big Tech. </p><p>However, these past few months have seen an incipient momentum toward a vision for change. Journalists are starting to take seriously[3] the prospect of transforming the tech industry[4].Through investigation, accessible explanation, and vivid storytelling, journalists have brought critical social-technical issues to the forefront of public debate, from online disinformation campaigns[5] to the discriminatory effects of algorithms[6]. Additionally, today, digital platforms and tech companies govern important aspects of our social world. Journalists are starting to tell a different story.Further, policymakers, advocacy groups, and public-interest technologists are all developing ways to address the structural issues. But, journalists themselves also need to 'step-up.'Solutions journalism is reporting that focuses on the responses to social problems that other reporting describes and defines. Solutions stories, when done right, are not puff pieces. A reporter beginning a story on a response to a problem need not know whether the response is working, and the story should include the limitations and risks of a response[7] even if it appears to be generally effective.Hopefully, tech journalists will develop the reflexes to ask not just whether 'Zuck sucks', but what else Facebook and social media and digital technology could be, and, who outside Silicon Valley might have compelling ideas and influence.

Ha ha, no, of course you're not. It's the perennial empty threat. It's a joke proclaimed around Seattle at every presidential election in which some heinous candidate might win. </p><p>But it's never followed up on.Right? 'We haven't seen an influx of talent like this from any country to Canada since China in 1989,' Richard Kurland, a Vancouver, B.C., immigration attorney[1], told me Tuesday. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[2]Wait, China in 1989? 'Tiananmen Square, remember?' Kurland says. 'We had China's top minds, its scientists and engineers, fleeing from turmoil. Quite a few of them landed up here. That was the last time we saw a deluge of applications motivated by fear. Just as we're getting from your city and state today.' Fear?'It's all super highly educated individuals I'm hearing from \u2014 masters, Ph.D.s, doctors, senior business executives. They're foreign-born, and quite frankly they're afraid of your country now. They want out.' Being Canadian, Kurland ended our talk with a friendly 'cheers!' I had called around in British Columbia because I saw that both Microsoft and Amazon had suggested they might get around the whole mess of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>immigration travel-ban order by simply relocating a number of tech jobs to Canada[3].Also, a company called True North has sprung up overnight, in Vancouver, to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start poaching some of our top technology talent.'Got U.S. visa worries?' the company's website goads[4]. 'The solution is True North. We make it simple for you to immediately gain the necessary paperwork to set up a Canadian work and residency status similar to what you have in the US, so that you avoid disruptions or uncertainty relating to changing U.S. visa regulations.' Example: A brief filed by Amazon[5] in the federal case over Trump's order says the company has 49 workers from the affected Muslim countries, plus seven new hires who are Iranian and an untold number of engineers here on various visas. 'We are currently assessing alternatives that could include placement in countries other than the United States,' wrote Ayesha Blackwell-Hawkins, Amazon's senior manager of Mobility and Immigration.That Amazon has a senior manager of immigration is about all you need to know about what a self-inflicted wound this could end up being for America. 'Amazon has an entire staff of full-time people devoted to immigration, as do Microsoft, Google, all the big tech companies,' Michael Shutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association[6], told me. 'That's because it's part of their core mission to lure in the best and brightest in the world.'So now, the country founded by immigrants is closed, or partially closed, and instead is the kind of place that the top foreign-born talent runs away from? To Canada? C'mon.' He added: 'I can absolutely confirm that what you heard from Canada isn't hype or theoretical. The move to find a safer haven for some of our top inventors and engineers is definitely happening.' Kurland, the Canadian immigration specialist, said in the past they would all enjoy a chuckle or two over the quadrennial 'move to Canada' talk in the states. Because they knew it wasn't real. This is 'an entirely different creature,' he said. Both Microsoft and Amazon already have offices in Vancouver, for example, so shifting foreign-born software talent there is relatively easy. 'Your president is about to find out these are not so much American companies as global companies,' he said. A few weeks back when this immigration firestorm hit, I wrote[7] that the big choice in America right now is: 'Are we going to be an open society, or closed? Open to the world, to trade, to science, to foreign ideas or closed, hunkered down behind our new walls.'I didn't consider corporations when I wrote that. They have become like their own sovereign, extra-national states, and they've made their choice. They're not going to be hunkering with us. Also: Awkward that there isn't even a wall planned for our northern border, for the rest of us to hunker down behind.

We make it simple for you to immediately gain the necessary paperwork to set up a Canadian work and residency status similar to what you have in the US, so that you avoid disruptions or uncertainty relating to changing U.S. visa regulations.\"</p><p>Example: A brief filed by Amazon in the federal case over Trump's order says the company has 49 workers from the affected Muslim countries, plus seven new hires who are Iranian and an untold number of engineers here on various visas.</p><p>\"We are currently assessing alternatives that could include placement in countries other than the United States,\" wrote Ayesha Blackwell-Hawkins, Amazon's senior manager of Mobility and Immigration.</p><p>That Amazon has a senior manager of immigration is about all you need to know about what a self-inflicted wound this could end up being for America.</p><p>\"Amazon has an entire staff of full-time people devoted to immigration, as do Microsoft, Google, all the big tech companies,\" Michael Shutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association, told me. \"That's because it's part of their core mission to lure in the best and brightest in the world.</p><p>\"So now, the country founded by immigrants is closed, or partially closed, and instead is the kind of place that the top foreign-born talent runs away from?

The move to find a safer haven for some of our top inventors and engineers is definitely happening.\"</p><p>Kurland, the Canadian immigration specialist, said in the past they would all enjoy a chuckle or two over the quadrennial \"move to Canada\" talk in the states. Because they knew it wasn't real.</p><p>This is \"an entirely different creature,\" he said. Both Microsoft and Amazon already have offices in Vancouver, for example, so shifting foreign-born software talent there is relatively easy.</p><p>\"Your president is about to find out these are not so much American companies as global companies,\" he said.</p><p>A few weeks back when this immigration firestorm hit, I wrote that the big choice in America right now is: \"Are we going to be an open society, or closed? Open to the world, to trade, to science, to foreign ideas ... or closed, hunkered down behind our new walls.\"</p><p>I didn't consider corporations when I wrote that. They have become like their own sovereign, extra-national states, and they've made their choice. They're not going to be hunkering with us.</p><p>Also: Awkward that there isn't even a wall planned for our northern border, for the rest of us to hunker down behind.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-2d7b9c44edb411e68e78d9c4482d192c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MV3-5FP1-JBKM-D00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 8, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001299</classCode><className>PASSPORTS &amp;

To that effect, the two companies are exploring the idea of data trusts[1], a proposed data collection approach that aims to provide individuals with greater control over their personal information. The aim, the companies said, is to offer an alternative model to our current broken consent-based system of data collection such as the EU GDPR laws. </p><p>It's easy to see why. As artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) continues to infiltrate different aspects of our day-to-day lives, the technology is now doing more than ever \u2014 for both good and bad[2]. This necessitates an ethical use of such solutions to prevent misuse, and ensure there're adequate controls over the massive amounts of data accessed by these algorithms. The data trust, therefore, acts as a 'steward' that gets to approve and control the collection of, and manage access to, data with an eye on privacy while not sacrificing the benefits of AI and ML. In other words, a data trust \u2014 say, anindependent watchdog agency[3] \u2014 sets the terms of data collection, usage, and sharing, in addition to deciding who gets to access said information in a way that balances privacy and responsible use of technology. The idea of a data trust is not new. Google's sister company Sidewalk Labs \u2014 which released blueprints for its controversial Quayside smart city in Toronto back in June \u2014 has set up a data governance model that places 'urban data' under the control of an independent Civic Data Trust[4]. The gathered data, according to the planned digital governance model, will not be sold, used for advertising, or shared without people's permission. But the proposals have also courted surveillance concerns[5].Privacy in the time of surveillance capitalismWith tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft becoming the de facto data monarchs of personal information[6], the idea that they can potentially use your data without actually having it is sure an appealing one. It's a widely accepted fact that most smart technologies today \u2014 be it data-driven, internet-connected, or automated \u2014 are rife with privacy issues. Even as the battle to keep personal data private rages on, it's expected of netizens to give up some level of privacy[7] as the cost of admission for all the conveniences of the digital world, so much so that the existing framework[8] begins to feel like mere band-aid solutions[9]. The tacit agreement between individuals and the powerful digital institutions that profit from the data gathered by profiling its users has led to a privacy paradox[10], with users left with no choice but to hit 'accept' and move on. It's therefore essential that new methods are developed to address the aforementioned disconnect and decouple personal data from the companies who need them[11] in order to offer their services. Whether it's by making individuals 'data shareholders,' offering privacy as a paid service, or entrusting data in the hands of an independent 'data trust,' it's time to address the need for owning personal data so that privacy can be what it is \u2014 a fundamental human right that cannot be taken or given away.

The effort would effectively let Chrome and Mozilla users opt in to DNS encryption -- making your browser data more secure from spying and monetization -- assuming your DNS provider supports it. Needless to day, telecom giants that have made billions of dollars monetizing your every online behavior for decades now (and routinely lying about it[2]) don't much like that. </p><p>As a result, Comcast, AT...and others have been trying to demonize the Google and Mozilla efforts any way they can, from insisting the move constitutes an antitrust violation on Google's part (it doesn't[3]), to saying it's a threat to national security (it's not[4]), to suggesting it even poses a risk to 5G deployments (nah). Mozilla this week came out with a letter not only taking aim at those claims[5], but urging Congress to investigate telecom's long history of privacy problems:\"Our recent experience in rolling out DNS over HTTPs (DoH)\u2014an important privacy and security protection for consumers\u2014has raised questions about how ISPs collect and use sensitive user data in their gatekeeper role over internet usage,\" the letter[6], signed by Marshall Erwin, senior director of trust and security and Mozilla, reads. \"With this in mind, a congressional examination of ISP practices may uncover valuable insights, educate the public, and help guide continuing efforts to draft consumer privacy legislation.\"While there's obviously plenty of perfectly legitimate criticism of Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google, we've been noting[7] how telecom lobbyists have been quietly co-opting this backlash to help the telecom sector. So far you'd have to view these efforts as successful; while the government hyperventilates about Facebook and whether it should be broken up and heavily regulated, telecom has convinced lawmakers to effectively obliterate all oversight of telecom[8], despite the sector having historically been every bit as terrible[9] as Facebook on the subjects of privacy, consumer rights, and competition. As a result there are a few lawmakers (Marsha Blackburn comes quickly to mind) who claim to be utterly incensed at Facebook's behavior, but have chosen to give telecom a free pass. Mozilla's letter urges Congress to, you know, stop doing that if they want to be taken seriously:\"We believe that more information regarding ISP practices could be useful to the Committee as it continues its deliberations on this front, and we encourage the Committee to publicly probe current ISP data collection and use policies.\"As we look to craft what the privacy standards and guidelines of tomorrow look like, it's another reminder of how focusing too exclusively on the missteps of Silicon Valley giants obscures the fact that these problems aren't just exclusive to \"big tech.\" Mozilla's spot on when it notes that privacy solutions that don't consider telecom aren't much of a solution in the first place.Permalink[10] | Comments[11] | Email This Story[12] [ 1]: <url

New research\u00a0from Mozilla and its partner, the Ford Foundation, finds that barely 10 percent of computer science students wind up working in those sectors. The vast majority - 70 percent - go to big, wealthy tech companies. While that's great for Google and Facebook, Mozilla believes building good public policy around technology means attracting more technologists directly to public service.</p><p>So the maker of the popular Firefox browser is kicking off a fellowship program designed to put young engineers\u00a0in a\u00a0position to affect how tech policy, particularly when it comes to managing the Internet, gets crafted\u00a0in Washington. With a beginning budget of $4 million and an eye toward hiring five fellows this year, Mozilla and the Ford Foundation eventually intend to scale up the program to a total of 23 fellows over the next three years. The first fellows to be selected will spend their time at\u00a0public interest groups including the\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Free Press, the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute, and Public Knowledge.</p><p>\"To grapple with this big social issue called the future of the Internet, we need experts in the social and democratic issues and people who are experts in the technology,\" said Mark Surman, Mozilla's executive director. \"We're\u00a0looking for individuals who have a deep technical knowledge of the Internet and at the same time see and are motivated by the broader social and political issues.\"</p><p>The fellowship is modeled after a similar program that Mozilla launched in conjunction with the Knight Foundation. That program places programmers and data experts at news outlets around the country (including the Washington Post). But beyond giving\u00a0nonprofits and the government an injection of tech talent, the broader\u00a0aim\u00a0is to develop a pipeline, one that\u00a0tells\u00a0civic-minded engineers there's an alternative to Silicon Valley.</p><p>The big tech policy problems of the day are complicated. They're complicated because they involve a lot of legal mumbo-jumbo, which has always been true. But they're\u00a0also complicated because technology is getting increasingly complex itself - and making a case to skeptical lawmakers or regulators requires a grasp of technology that's often beyond the expertise of a lawyer or lobbyist.</p><p>Whether\u00a0Mozilla and the Ford Foundation can effectively compete in a bidding war with Google for elite engineers is unclear. Ford Foundation president Darren Walker said some people are motivated by more than money.</p><p>\"One piece of feedback we heard consistently was that there are a lot of engineers and technologists who are interested in the nonprofit sector but that they don't see a pathway into the sector for them,\" said Walker. \"These are people who are thirsty for meaning in their life and are not necessarily looking for the biggest paycheck and the largest bonus for fulfillment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8df8aa58e0de43a89a5b8f953eea9eea</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D84-B471-JB4M-V3W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 30, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001220</classCode><className>NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813211MM</classCode><className>FOUNDATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp;

At the time, CD sales were beginning to plummet and there was a lot of doom and gloom about piracy. Thankfully, the record industry is still going strong and announcing record profits.</p><p>'The predicted decline has not materialised and that\u2019s due to the success of digital. What we must ensure for the future is that artists are fairly paid and the whole music eco-system supported. Otherwise we face a decline in artistry and diversity in music, which would be a disaster for both fans and the industry.\u201dMP3 was a revolutionary link in a chain of disruption</p><p>Kevin Brennan MP, member of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and guitarist/songwriter for parliamentary rock band MP4:</p><p>\u201cSuch was the power of the humble MP3 that we named the world\u2019s first parliamentary rock band after it! It was a revolutionary link in a chain of disruption that transformed how we listen to, and distribute, music. Music and technology have been intertwined since Thomas Edison developed the phonograph. The music industry has a long track-record of accelerating and adapting to new technologies.</p><p>'From concept albums and sleeve artwork made possible by 12-inch LPs to shorter tracks and algorithm-based marketing we see through streaming \u2013 the technology through which music is distributed has always influenced its form.</p><p>\u201cThe pandemic has exposed how in this digital world songwriters and musicians rely on live music, and how failings in the streaming market for recorded music and gaps in the Government\u2019s support for freelancers and sole-traders impact the livelihoods of music creators.</p><p>'Plenty of people still make money out of recorded music but we need a new deal for those who actually make that music. This is why I\u2019m supporting the call by The Ivors Academy and Musicians\u2019 Union on Government to hold a review of streaming with a view to achieving a transparent and fair system.\u201dThis crisis is a golden opportunity to re-write the rules</p><p>Crispin Hunt, Chair of The Ivors Academy:</p><p>\u201cBefore the MP3 the music industry thought it sold music. It didn\u2019t, it sold plastic with music in it and MP3s changed all that. The music industry has evolved, but it still needs to re-think how music rewards its creators now it\u2019s plastic free.</p><p>'As creators we\u2019re given crumbs from streaming revenues and face coercive business practices that buy out our rights in return for \u2018exposure\u2019. Making a career for many music creators in this environment relies on live music. With no mass gatherings for the foreseeable future and creatives falling through the gaps in Government support we\u2019re all concerned about the immediate future.</p><p>'Music will survive, the industry will adapt and we will rush to adopt new technologies. But this crisis provides a golden opportunity to re-write the rules, to challenge established business practices and thinking, and imagine a fairer and more equitable way of creating and distributing value from the music we create.\u201dThe MP3 player was an alarm bell</p><p>Tom Gray, musician, member of the band Gomez and writer director of PRS:</p><p>'I remember in the late-nineties my A&amp;R man, opening a box and in hushed tones telling me the tiny device he held before me could hold - wait for it - 16 songs. He felt certain it would revolutionise the industry. He was right. Thanks to the MP3 player, music is the most mature digital market and should serve as warning to all other industries, regulators and governments.</p><p>'We are nearly completely captured by big tech and a few global corporations, setting tens of thousands of creators in a non-negotiable and detrimental bind. Competition law and digital strategy are not fit for purpose. The brilliantly conceived and convenient MP3 player was the alarm bell at the dawn of this cautionary tale.'Take action now</p><p>Together the The Ivors Academy we\u2019re calling for a Government review into streaming.</p><p>We want greater transparency in where the money goes, and a fairer share of the pie for music creators and performers, so that music creators and performers don't have to rely on hardship funds while major labels boast about record streaming profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3538346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D0-FK91-F0YC-N0PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

To mark the anniversary, The Ivors Academy talked to several music industry figures about their memories of the MP3 and the impact that it\u2019s had.    It\u2019s a time to reflect on a huge change to the music industry, and remember how important it is to support the call to Keep Music Alive by fixing streaming now.   We must ensure that the whole music eco-system is supported   Our Deputy General Secretary Naomi Pohl:    \u201cI remember an ex-colleague, who dealt with recording, saying it was his sad lot to preside over the death of the record industry. At the time, CD sales were beginning to plummet and there was a lot of doom and gloom about piracy. Thankfully, the record industry is still going strong and announcing record profits.    \"The predicted decline has not materialised and that\u2019s due to the success of digital. What we must ensure for the future is that artists are fairly paid and the whole music eco-system supported. Otherwise we face a decline in artistry and diversity in music, which would be a disaster for both fans and the industry.\u201d   MP3 was a revolutionary link in a chain of disruption   Kevin Brennan MP, member of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and guitarist/songwriter for parliamentary rock band MP4:    \u201cSuch was the power of the humble MP3 that we named the world\u2019s first parliamentary rock band after it! It was a revolutionary link in a chain of disruption that transformed how we listen to, and distribute, music. Music and technology have been intertwined since Thomas Edison developed the phonograph. The music industry has a long track-record of accelerating and adapting to new technologies.    \"From concept albums and sleeve artwork made possible by 12-inch LPs to shorter tracks and algorithm-based marketing we see through streaming \u2013 the technology through which music is distributed has always influenced its form.    \u201cThe pandemic has exposed how in this digital world songwriters and musicians rely on live music, and how failings in the streaming market for recorded music and gaps in the Government\u2019s support for freelancers and sole-traders impact the livelihoods of music creators.    \"Plenty of people still make money out of recorded music but we need a new deal for those who actually make that music. This is why I\u2019m supporting the call by The Ivors Academy and Musicians\u2019 Union on Government to hold a review of streaming with a view to achieving a transparent and fair system.\u201d   This crisis is a golden opportunity to re-write the rules   Crispin Hunt, Chair of The Ivors Academy:    \u201cBefore the MP3 the music industry thought it sold music. It didn\u2019t, it sold plastic with music in it and MP3s changed all that. The music industry has evolved, but it still needs to re-think how music rewards its creators now it\u2019s plastic free.    \"As creators we\u2019re given crumbs from streaming revenues and face coercive business practices that buy out our rights in return for \u2018exposure\u2019. Making a career for many music creators in this environment relies on live music. With no mass gatherings for the foreseeable future and creatives falling through the gaps in Government support we\u2019re all concerned about the immediate future.    \"Music will survive, the industry will adapt and we will rush to adopt new technologies. But this crisis provides a golden opportunity to re-write the rules, to challenge established business practices and thinking, and imagine a fairer and more equitable way of creating and distributing value from the music we create.\u201d   The MP3 player was an alarm bell   Tom Gray, musician, member of the band Gomez and writer director of PRS:    \"I remember in the late-nineties my A&amp;R man, opening a box and in hushed tones telling me the tiny device he held before me could hold - wait for it - 16 songs. He felt certain it would revolutionise the industry. He was right. Thanks to the MP3 player, music is the most mature digital market and should serve as warning to all other industries, regulators and governments.    \"We are nearly completely captured by big tech and a few global corporations, setting tens of thousands of creators in a non-negotiable and detrimental bind. Competition law and digital strategy are not fit for purpose. The brilliantly conceived and convenient MP3 player was the alarm bell at the dawn of this cautionary tale.\"   Take action now   Together the The Ivors Academy we\u2019re calling for a Government review into streaming.    We want greater transparency in where the money goes, and a fairer share of the pie for music creators and performers, so that music creators and performers don't have to rely on hardship funds while major labels boast about record streaming profits.    If you haven\u2019t already, then please sign and share the petition now.

UK politics.</p><p>The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.</p><p>Tory MP and committee chairman Damian Collins said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day.</p><p>\"Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.\"</p><p>Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said: \"Labour agrees with the committee's ultimate conclusion: the era of self-regulation for tech companies must end immediately.</p><p>\"We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.\"</p><p>\"Few individuals have shown contempt for our parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has.\"</p><p>A government spokesman said: \"The government's forthcoming white paper on online harms will set out a new framework for ensuring disinformation is tackled effectively, while respecting freedom of expression and promoting innovation.</p><p>\"This week the culture secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.\"</p><p>An electoral commission spokesman added: \"We agree that reform of electoral law is urgently needed.</p><p>\"The UK's government must ensure that the tools used to regulate political campaigning online continue to be fit for purpose in a digital age.\"</p><p>Karim Palant from Facebook UK's public policy department said: \"We share the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence.</p><p>\"We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for 7 years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p><p>\"We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PHOTO: </emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://e3.365dm.com/16/02/640x380/10161585-1-1-2048x1536_3418334.jpg?20190218061608\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SKYNWS-11640821</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SKYNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFN-F7Y1-DY03-349N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409844</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><timeReceived>06:20 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BSkyB All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sky News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13207\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But she suggested the new legislation would not be introduced until next year at the earliest. </p><p>MPs on the DCMS committee have now hit out at the ongoing lack of regulation, claiming it has led to a surge in misinformation during the coronavirus outbreak, including promoting hoax treatments and attacks on 5G engineers as a result of conspiracies about the technology. </p><p>\"Early examples of misinformation during the pandemic often misled people about cures or preventative measures to infection,\" they said. \"Some people have mistakenly turned to unproven home remedies, stopped taking ibuprofen and prescribed medicine, or elsewise ingested harmful chemicals such as disinfectant.\" </p><p>Relatedcontent </p><p> Coronavirus misinformation reaching one in two adults </p><p> DCMS unit to lead government's anti-disinformation work </p><p> 'Crazed conspiracy theory' - Downing St says 5G vandals are endangering lives </p><p>Meanwhile, the group warned that high engagement with conspiracy content had encouraged companies to \"monetise misinformation\" by promoting the posts across their platforms to boost advertising revenue. </p><p>They said: \"The current business model not only creates disincentives for tech companies to tackle misinformation, it also allows others to monetise misinformation too.\" </p><p>And the committee hits out at the efforts of tech giants themselves to tackle misinformation, saying that adding warning labels to misinformation had \"fallen short\" in tackling the issue. </p><p>Instead, the DCMS committee said ministers should immediately appoint a regulator and hand them the power to develop new guidelines on disinformation, with powers to issue \"significant\" fines against firms who fail to implement them. </p><p>Julian Knight, chair of the committee, said without the new legislation there would be \"no incentive\" for firms to crack down on misinformation. </p><p>\"We are calling on the government to name the regulator now and get on with the 'world-leading' legislation on social media that we've long been promised,\" he said. \"The proliferation of dangerous claims about Covid-19 has been unstoppable. The leaders of social media companies have failed to tackle the infodemic of misinformation.\" </p><p>Knight added: \"Evidence that tech companies were able to benefit from the monetisation of false information and allowed others to do so is shocking. We need robust regulation to hold these companies to account. The coronavirus crisis has demonstrated that without due weight of the law, social media companies have no incentive to consider a duty of care to those who use their services.\" </p><p>'Slow to act' </p><p>Responding to the report, Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson Daisy Cooper said it was clear the government needed to do more to \"stamp out\" misinformation online. </p><p>She added: \"To tackle the invisible algorithms that drive people to extreme content, platforms must not only have the ability to act quickly but there must be a regulator with teeth to step in when platforms are not doing enough.\" </p><p>And Labour's Jo Stevens said the report confirmed that ministers had been \"slow to act\". </p><p>The shadow culture secretary said: \"It has been more than 15 months since the promised online harms legislation and the select committee shares our concerns that this long-overdue legislation puts safeguarding profits of the big tech platforms before public safety.\" </p><p>A DCMS spokesperson said: \"We are developing world-leading plans to put a duty of care on online platforms towards their users and will introduce legislation as soon as possible. Since the start of the pandemic, specialist government units have been working around the clock to identify and rebut false information about coronavirus. We are also working closely with social media platforms to help them identify and remove incorrect claims about the virus that could endanger people's health.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PBTNET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PBTNET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DJ-FH51-F0JV-8226-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><timeReceived>1:11 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PublicTechnology (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAKE NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000369</classCode><className>CONSPIRACY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY</classCode><className>Conspiracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

The MPs also encourage the introduction of a tax on social media firms' profits to fund the provision of advice and guidance. </p><p>And they have urged the government to look into whether the \"addictive\" nature of social media sites means over-use should be officially classed as a disease by the World Health Organisation. </p><p>In a piece written forPublicTechnology sister publication PoliticsHome, Labour MP Chris Elmore, who chairs the group, said ministers were \"only just facing up to\" the problem of harm caused by social media. </p><p>Related content </p><p> MPs make urgent call for social media regulator </p><p> Social media not a 'serious threat' to court hearings, government concludes </p><p> Hancock warns social media sites to remove harmful content or face new legislation </p><p>\"One particularly startling finding was that the percentage of children experiencing mental health issues more than doubles among youngsters who spend three or more hours per day on social media compared to those who aren't signed up to these sites,\" he said. \"Add to this the prevalence of body-shaming online, a deeply worrying 46% of girls who responded found that social media had a negative impact on their self-esteem.\" </p><p>The call for tougher action on social media giants follows an outcry over the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017. </p><p>After her death, her Instagram account was found to contain self-harm related material, and her parents have suggested new laws may be needed to combat exposure to suicide and depression-focused content. </p><p>Pointing to her case, Elmore warned: \"I fear that this experience online is not atypical and highlights the very real dangers out there to young and impressionable people. For me, tragedies like Molly's underline exactly why it's vital the government takes real and meaningful action to get to grips with the crisis unfolding online, but away from the eyes of parents and politicians - it is a scandal hiding in plain sight.\" </p><p>The group has also urged ministers to set up a new 'Social Media Health Alliance' to carry out detailed research and establish \"clear new guidance\" on social media use. </p><p>They want the new initiative to be funded with a 0.5% levy on the profits of social media companies. </p><p>\"It's essential that we urgently commission robust research into the impact social media is having on our young people and review whether it warrants being classified as an official disease,\" Elmore said. \"Just as with other addictions - cigarettes, alcohol, gambling or drugs - we need to realise that while a scroll through Facebook might not have any apparent physical effects, the damage it can do to someone's mental health must not be underestimated.\" </p><p>A government spokesperson said: \"The government will soon publish a white paper which will set out the responsibilities of online platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not.

We need robust regulation to hold these companies to account. </p><p>\"The coronavirus crisis has demonstrated that without due weight of the law, social media companies have no incentive to consider a duty of care to those who use their services.\" </p><p>Responding to the report, Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson Daisy Cooper said it was clear the Government needed to do more to \"stamp out\" misinformation online. </p><p>She added: \"To tackle the invisible algorithms that drive people to extreme content, platforms must not only have the ability to act quickly but there must be a regulator with teeth to step in when platforms are not doing enough.\" </p><p>And Labour's Jo Stevens said the report confirmed that ministers had been \"slow to act\". </p><p>The Shadow Culture Secretary said:\u00a0\"It has been more than 15 months since the promised online harms legislation and the select committee shares our concerns that this long overdue legislation puts safeguarding profits of the big tech platforms before public safety.\" </p><p>A DCMS\u00a0spokesperson said: \"We are developing world-leading plans to put a duty of care on online platforms towards their users and will introduce legislation as soon as possible. </p><p>\"Since the start of the pandemic, specialist government units have been working around the clock to identify and rebut false information about coronavirus. </p><p>\"We are also working closely with social media platforms to help them identify and remove incorrect claims about the virus that could endanger people's health.\"

The Digital Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee will build on the \"knowledge and authority\" gained in its 'fake news' inquiry by creating a new sub-grouping focusing specifically on the themes raised.Its 108-page report, released in February, was particularly critical of Facebook, which it branded \"digital gangsters\" for obstructing its investigation[1] and being found to violate data privacy laws. </p><p>The MPs will continue to build on their findings under the banner of its data privacy sub-committee, seeking to establish this as the UK parliament's \"institutional home\" for scrutinising big tech. \"As we stated at the time, our report on Disinformation and 'fake news,' was not the final word on the matter,\" said the DCMS select committee chair Damian Collins MP. \"Since beginning our investigations, tech companies have only shifted superficially in their approach to privacy, and only for the benefit of their own PR. \"It's unacceptable and we must keep up the pressure for them to shift their approach to ensure people and their rights are protected.\" While the 'fake news' inquiry established terms of reference and focused on a clear and singular set of objectives, the sub-committee will live in perpetuity. Instead of honing in on fake news, for instance, the group will take a broad approach to themes such as data privacy and online discourse. In particular, the sub-committee will aim to \"play our part in protecting individuals from the insidious onslaught of disinformation and digital disruption\". First on the agenda, however, is seeking a government response to the committee's February report, and scrutinising its touted proposals to protect against online harms. \"We believe that there's a strong public interest in establishing the Sub-Committee to continue probing ongoing threats posed by disinformation to democracies, a threat that hasn't disappeared with the end of our inquiry,\" Collins continued. \"We look forward to continuing the highly important work that we have begun.\" The sub-committee has been established in the absence of any meaningful action from the government in response to the committee's findings. Specifically, calls for a compulsory code of conduct and a newly established independent regulator have fallen on deaf ears. In fact, the government's own widely-touted proposals aimed at reigning in the tech sector, dubbed the 'Online Harms' white paper, has been delayed. The joint-DCMS and Home Office package was set to be announced during winter 2018/19, but there's been no word on its publication since the turn of the year.

Instead of honing in on fake news, for instance, the group will take a broad approach to themes such as data privacy and online discourse.</p><p>In particular, the sub-committee will aim to \"play our part in protecting individuals from the insidious onslaught of disinformation and digital disruption\".</p><p>First on the agenda, however, is seeking a government response to the committee's February report, and scrutinising its touted proposals to protect against online harms.</p><p>\"We believe that there's a strong public interest in establishing the Sub-Committee to continue probing ongoing threats posed by disinformation to democracies, a threat that hasn't disappeared with the end of our inquiry,\" Collins continued.</p><p>\"We look forward to continuing the highly important work that we have begun.\"</p><p>The sub-committee has been established in the absence of any meaningful action from the government in response to the committee's findings. Specifically, calls for a compulsory code of conduct and a newly established independent regulator have fallen on deaf ears.</p><p>In fact, the government's own widely-touted proposals aimed at reigning in the tech sector, dubbed the 'Online Harms' white paper, has been delayed.</p><p>The joint-DCMS and Home Office package was set to be announced during winter 2018/19, but there's been no word on its publication since the turn of the year. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPITPR-33374athttpswwwitprocouk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPITPR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT2-TPK1-DXHJ-F07H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464401</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

It is Monday, April the 1st and we promise, this is far from an April fool's joke. Once again, we have our teams standing outside the Houses of Parliament at Westminster as lawmakers are trying to pull Brexit out of the mud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, MPs in the chamber have a free vote on a variety of options, including a Customs Union or a second referendum. For the first time, could May be over before the end of April? She will decide whether to hit the nuclear button and go for a snap election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, Brexit is turning Britain into a laughing stock says a top Siemens executive while easyJet warns the uncertainty is hurting its business. I'm Amara Walker and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Good evening to you, and a warm welcome once again to Westminster where MPs have now just started voting on the alternatives to Theresa May's E.U. withdrawal deal. Now, they managed to unite behind the plan. They could force the Prime Minister's hand and change the course of Brexit.</p><p>There are four options and MPs are trying to whittle it down to find one that can get a majority. If that happens, it could lead to a long Brexit delay and new negotiations.</p><p>Bianca is with me to go through the ones that are actually being talked about. If Parliament doesn't back any of today's proposals, the Prime Minister could ask for the full term -- if the Prime -- what is likely to happen?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Tonight, we're expecting that there will be a majority around one of the soft Brexit options. That's because the Labour Party has said it's going to support, it's going to whip for support of three of them including the Customs Union and Common Market 2.0. Those are the ones that they have a real eye on.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so which ones -- I have my --</p><p>NOBILO: We both have our order papers, Richard. We've had two here.</p><p>QUEST: I have my order paper here which is going to lead the way here. So as we go through this evening, which ones have been accepted by the Speaker?</p><p>NOBILO: We have C to start with, which is the Customs Union.</p><p>QUEST: Just a moment, so we are going to have a Customs -- all right, let's talk briefly through the first ones. Customs Union -- what does that entail? That's the one where ...</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST: ... straight forward they'll either going to join a permanent Customs Union.</p><p>NOBILO: Exactly. Permanent Customs Union tabled by Ken Clarke, Father of the House considered to be popular, has some cross-party support and also did what was one of the best votes last week. It was one of the most popular.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and the second one is D has been accepted.</p><p>NOBILO: D, that's Common Market.</p><p>QUEST: Which is the Common Market.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, Common Market 2.0. That requires a bit more discussion, so it's tabled by a Conservative MP, but Labour is going to support it.</p><p>QUEST: Let's listen to what Labour says. It will support the Customs Union and the Common Market 2.0. It will also support some of the others. Let's listen to what was said in the House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMILY THORNBERRY, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY: We've been trying to do things that will help the British economy and protect British jobs and we accept that in the referendum, 52 percent of people voted to leave but 48 percent voted to remain. And so, really, the answer for any states person we think in those circumstances is to try to keep the country together to leave, but actually not go very far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Right, then we have -- he's accepted number E which is the -- well, confirmatory. How do you say it?</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, I say confirmatory, but it's up to you how you say it, but the point is the branding is different from a second referendum. The idea is, it will be a public vote on whatever it is that Parliament decides versus remain.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and then the last one that's been accepted was --</p><p>NOBILO: The last one, now this is the safety net option, I think is the easiest way to refer to it, so that means --</p><p>QUEST: Parliamentary supremacy.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, so that means, if there is deal agreed, then you go to the E.U. and ask for another extension. If the E.U. rejects that, then Parliament votes on whether or not wants to do no-deal. If Parliament rejects that, then you revoke Article 50 and Labour is not supporting that.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so what we like -- how long is the piece of string -- the Speaker has already said that you can't go for -- you can't vote yes or no on the same one. So you can't spoil your ballot paper.</p><p>NOBILO: Actually, let's talk a moment about the Speaker's choice because usually you'd select a spectrum. Now, all of those are soft Brexit options. He didn't choose either of the two Brexiteer amendments which were put down.</p><p>QUEST: Now, for good reason.</p><p>NOBILO: They were less popular last week. But still he always says it's his job to show the fullest expression of Parliamentary will.</p><p>QUEST: But hang on. I read the note that you wrote on this. Didn't he also say that there's no point because a hard Brexit is the default option and, anyway, even if you add them all up, they still wouldn't have got a majority or wouldn't?</p><p>NOBILO: I mean, not quite. You would expect them to have something from the other side, but he's chosen four which, for those people who have criticized the Speaker's role in this Brexit debate and say he's had an agenda, that he was a remain supporter and wants to facilitate that, the selections today do support that idea. However, the majority in Parliament is squarely around a softer Brexit, so it makes sense to facilitate that.</p><p>QUEST: All right, so let's tick tock. They're voting now which is why you see the clock, not that you can see the clock, but you see the clock. They'll finish voting. Let's display that one, four crosses or ticks on a piece of paper and then there's the clock seven minutes past 8:00, but we're not expecting a result. The House is suspended when you see the clock. Tell me what will happen.</p><p>NOBILO: So we're expecting a result around 10:00 because the votes will take a while and then the counting takes a while. The Speaker will announce all of them together. Usually, he will announce the results of the division right after it.</p><p>QUEST: So what time?</p><p>NOBILO: So some time in the 10:00 hour.</p><p>QUEST: 10:00.</p><p>NOBILO: Meanwhile, there will also be other Brexit statutes going through as well.</p><p>QUEST: Well --</p><p>NOBILO: I will see you.</p><p>QUEST: Don't go too far. Put something warm on, though. It was a beautiful day in London, but it's jolly chilly now, I can tell you that. As the sun has gone down, I've got the heaters on. Right, when we come back after -- thank you.</p><p>As we come back, companies across the continent say Brexit is hurting their business; easyJet has reported a loss and says demand somewhat looks weak. The easyJet airline says the uncertainty is driving ticket prices lower. In a moment, we'll talk about it.</p><p>[15:10:19]</p><p>QUEST: Companies across the continent say Brexit is hurting their business. EasyJet has reported a loss and says demand somewhat looks weak. The share price down nearly 10%. The airline also says the uncertainty is driving ticket prices lower after nearly -- off nearly 9.7 at the close.</p><p>The chief executive of Siemens says Britain is becoming into a laughing stock. Jurgen Maier is warning MPs he is having trouble making the case to his colleagues that it is worth investing in the U.K. whilst Goldman is telling Brexit is costing the U.K. nearly $800 million each week. That's about 2.4% of GDP.</p><p>Anna, you've been reviewing these. Are they just alarmists? Hyperbole?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, REPORTER, CNN: I wish they were, Richard, but unfortunately, Brexit uncertainty quite apart from Brexit itself is costing businesses, is costing the economy. Where should we start? Should we start with easyJet?</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>STEWART: I mean, we knew that they were going to have a loss for the last six months, 360 million pounds.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, but hang on, hang on. But they usually make a loss in the quarter anyway.</p><p>STEWART: And lots of different head winds, but the thing that was much more worrying in this trading update was the outlook for the summer. Very soft, weak demand for consumers and the CEO says today, macroeconomic uncertainty, many unanswered questions concerning Brexit are driving weak customer demand in the U.K. and on the European side, too.</p><p>QUEST: Siemens describing the MPs or Parliament or Brexit as a laughing stock. I think he put in here -- he is describing about he can't justify investment.</p><p>STEWART: Yes, this is very interesting. Open letter in POLITICO today and it was a real stinging rebuke actually against Parliament. I mean, it was very direct in fact to MPs. Let me read you one line. It says, \"The world is watching and where the U.K. used to be a beacon of stability, we are now becoming a laughingstock. I personally can no longer defend the action of our Parliament when reporting to my managing board.\"</p><p>And he is going on and on about compromise and the need for compromise across parties. He wants a Customs Union, of course. So he'll be watching the indicative vote tonight with great care.</p><p>QUEST: Where are these hundreds of millions coming from -- Goldman says is being lost? I mean, again, people on the streets will say, well, I didn't see any money going.</p><p>STEWART: Quite, and you've got to think about, firstly, look at the economic picture. Both the CEO and Goldman Sachs are saying we've lost 2.5% potentially on GDP that is looking at where the U.K. economy could be and where it is now since the referendum.</p><p>In terms of money per week that Brexit is costing, they all come to different conclusions because they use different little parameters here. Goldman Sachs, $790 million a week. The CER, $470 million, the Bank of England, $1 billion a week. Depending on whether you are looking at consumer spending, business investment, borrowing for the government.</p><p>QUEST: Isn't this exactly what everybody forecast would happen with a shoddy Brexit? A sort of a mishmash of indecision?</p><p>STEWART: Well, I don't think anyone quite predicted this level of indecision, I would suggest. You know, the CER did say that lots of forecasts, particularly from the Treasury themselves were wrong after the vote, and they were. But they say independent forecasts like their own were bang on the dollar.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Anna. Keep watching those, please.</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>QUEST: We'll also talk about that. We want you to join the conversation. We'd like you to join the conversation. It's really quite simple now at cnn.com/join. It's really a straightforward one. Bearing in mind what Anna was just telling me from the comment on Siemens. Tonight's question, is Brexit making the U.K. the laughing stock of the world? And as a Brit it gives me no treat or pleasure to put that question tonight.</p><p>But bearing in mind the seeming inability to do anything, is it -- is Brexit making the U.K. a laughing stock? Mohamed El-Erian is the chief economic adviser at Allianz and Mohamed is now with me from New York. When we see these numbers about loss of -- Goldman says it's costing $800 million a week. What are they referring to?</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ: They are referring to three things and that is what you get when you have slow Brexit. People postpone decisions so they are referring to investment decisions that are being postponed. They refer to consumption decisions that are being postponed, and they refer to the inflows of capital of direct investment from the rest of the world that's being postponed and add those three things together, they all point to growth being a victim of this unusual uncertainty associated with a slow Brexit process.</p><p>QUEST: How does one reconcile those economic realities with the very passioned and passionate arguments being put in the House? I mean, nobody I suppose is doing this willingly or wantingly. They are doing it because they believe in it. Is it possible to square that circle economically?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: It is because there's two arguments. One is about the destination. What does the destination look like? And here you can argue whether a soft Brexit or a harder Brexit dominates, but that is about the destination. What we are learning is if the journey is too slow, and we've been on a very slow journey, there are costs that are associated not with the destination but with the journey.</p><p>And let me give you an example. There was no political appetite to look at any other issue today in Britain other than Brexit. You need a major crisis to get focused. So any attempt to promote productivity and growth gets delayed pending the resolution of the Brexit issue.</p><p>QUEST: Mohamed, stay with us, please, because we're going to come back to you in a moment or three. We're going to talk about the Customs Union and the merits or demerits of such a thing versus the Common Market. Stay with us for that.</p><p>On the question of what Europe makes of it. Brexit is no April fools' joke. It's a tragedy. The words of Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator said, \"The U.K. is nearly out of time and the clock is now at five to midnight.\"</p><p>Mairead McGuinness is Vice President of the European Parliament. Always good to see you even in such very difficult circumstances like tonight. Parliament is voting again. What do you hope they will vote for and what happens once they've voted that way?</p><p>MAIREAD MCGUINNESS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Well, I am actually not sure what I hope for anymore. What I had hoped for was that the withdrawal agreement negotiation would be passed and we'd get on to chatting about the future. So I'm quite nervous and anxious about what's going to happen tonight.</p><p>There are four amendments, and you've been talking about them. It's going to be another late night here trying to look at the results and ponder about whether they chart a way forward.</p><p>I suppose what concerns us here at E.U. level is the time -- I mean, we were talking about March the 29th, I think previously, but now we're looking at April the 12th and I don't see any coming together.</p><p>I tried to watch some of the debates to see what the movement -- and you know, some are actually now saying they would vote against the withdrawal agreement that had previously voted for it.</p><p>So I really don't have the wisdom to say what I hope for anymore other than what I had hoped for hasn't happened. Now perhaps I should try and be optimistic and with the results that come this evening, maybe the Prime Minister can eventually get her withdrawal agreement over the line by promising to MPs that she can adjust the political declaration. That's my hope. But do I think it will happen? I'm not so sure.</p><p>And I think around this town today, it's Monday. It's April fools' day, it's April the 1st, nobody was smiling very much. There were a few jokes told, but I think we're all really aware now that while a no deal was something we thought was there, we now realize it's a much closer to happening almost by accident rather than by design.</p><p>And I think that's the worst possible outcome for the United Kingdom and for the European Union.</p><p>[15:20:01]</p><p>QUEST: All right, but the Taoiseach is saying today warning about the possibility of a no deal and warning Irish companies to be ready for it. Do you think the E.U. -- remaining E.U. is now ready for a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>MCGUINNESS: Well, we've done a lot of work in Parliament to vote through a lot of measures to deal with the no deal scenario and we'd do more of that this week. The Irish government have been running all sorts of engagement with businesses for many months now, in fact, since the referendum we've been looking at this and what the appeal from the Taoiseach this evening is to those businesses that perhaps, had not made enough preparations.</p><p>But all companies are anxious. Whether they are in the U.K. or in Ireland, and I think your previous speaker mentioned uncertainty, and I know that from my constituents, there are businesses that are delaying investment until they see what is going to happen and that really doesn't really help us as an economy and it doesn't help the U.K. either.</p><p>QUEST: Mairead, thank you. We'll talk more I am pretty certain. Always grateful that you take the time to talk to us on \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>MCGUINNESS: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much and the same with Mohamed El-Erian, always grateful to have you. The Customs Union tonight is being discussed. It's either Customs Union or Common Market 2.0 which is more single market, but just on Custom Union alone now, does it make sense or is this sort of a Norway plus and a rather poor option?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: It's a feasible option and it is better than the alternatives. I think, Richard, the tragedy in all of this is that you have increased the probability of what's known as tail events -- things that were thought to be very unlikely that now command material probability.</p><p>We heard about hard Brexit. There's also the possibility of an early election in the U.K. So suddenly, you have all these other scenarios that have become possible, much more possible and that's before you talk about the two very complicating issues. What do you do with the European Parliamentary elections, and what do you do the second referendum advocates?</p><p>I love multidimensional games, I love the analysis, but this is getting really complicated, which means you may get unintended consequences.</p><p>QUEST: Is one of those -- I mean, the difficulty is you and I could sit here all night and sketch out a million possibilities and options in between, but what's the most realistic option tonight, do you think, looking at it from the financial point of view? Is it some sort of long delay leading to an ultimate Customs Union?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: Yes, I think certainly delay. No one wants to go down in history to being the decisive voice enforcing a hard Brexit. So when push comes to shove, people delay. Now, if you want to be an optimist, you say delay in order to reach consensus, but the reality is that the political process is much better deciding what it doesn't want rather than what it wants.</p><p>So we will get a delay and that delay will go longer and we'll talk again about the economic cost to the U.K. of this process that's a saga by now. I think that's the most likely outcome which is delay, delay, delay.</p><p>QUEST: Can I turn to one other matter before -- I mean, the rest of the world watching is also very concerned. This inversion in the yield curve in the U.S. admittedly it's the 10 and the 3-month so it's not exactly a major, but the view seems to be that's not suggesting immediate problems, but 2020 potential recession. How concerned are you about the inversion?</p><p>EL-ERIAN: So I'm not concerned when it comes to the outlook for the U.S. economy. I do not think we are heading into recession either this year or in 2020. What it tells us is two things. One is people are worried about the rest of the world and the spillover effects and today's China data was encouraging, whether it was as encouraging as the markets' bounce suggests is a different issue, but it was encouraging.</p><p>And the second thing the inverted yield curve is telling you is that it is distorted by monetary policy, by unconventional policies. So I do not think it's the signal of a recession coming up in the U.S. either this year or next.</p><p>QUEST: Mohamed, thank you very much indeed. We will talk more, obviously, as we'll need you to interpret and help us understand from the financial point of view, from the wider geopolitical point of view what's happening with Brexit. Always grateful to see you. My apologies that I'm not in New York to do it face-to-face. Thank you.</p><p>The question that we asked, of course, about the U.K. being a laughing stock in Europe. If you look at the result, it is pretty overwhelming.</p><p>[15:25:08]</p><p>QUEST: I don't think we've had one quite as overwhelming. Maybe once or twice; 92% of you say Brexit is making the U.K. a laughing stock. That will not be pleased music to the ears of internationalists here in London or indeed those who have to do business.</p><p>As we continue, the European market's strong data from the U.K. lifted the stocks in London. The FTSE climbing 0.5%. Apparently, it was some panic stockpiling in case of a no-deal Brexit that helped boost Britain's factory sector. We'll look at all of those numbers a little bit later on. This is \"Quest Means Business\" live tonight. They are voting. The MPs will have probably voted by now, and we'll have the result, we suspect, in about two hours.</p><p>QUEST: I'm Richard Quest. There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment. Preparing to vote -- lawmakers have voted and it's going up for a late night. They're looking to see if they can find a path forward and in doing so, pick Brexit that's right for them.</p><p>Amid all the gloom, there is satire for survival. We will meet the artist who is painting the town red with his interpretations of Brexit. This is CNN and here on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>President Trump is repeating a threat to close the border with Mexico. But this time, he says there's a deadline. He says he will do it this week, unless Mexico stops all illegal immigration into the U.S. The President says closing the border would also help stop the flow of drugs.</p><p>The head of a congressional committee plans to subpoena key White House staffers saying a whistleblower has revealed grave features of national security at the highest levels of the Trump administration.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>He said the whistleblower told his committee that senior Trump officials overruled concerns about dozens of people who were initially denied security clearances.</p><p>After the first round of voting in Ukraine's presidential election, a television comedian has the most votes. With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, Volodymyr Zelensky seems headed to a runoff against the incumbent president. Zelensky is the star of a popular TV show in which he plays a nobody who accidentally gets elected president.</p><p>DNA samples found at the site of last month's Ethiopian Airlines crash are being sent to the United Kingdom for analysis. Victims' families have been trying to get the analysis done so that they can identify remains and give their loved ones proper burials.</p><p>And the music world is mourning the Grammy-nominated rapper known as Nipsey Hussle. The 33-year-old was shot dead outside his Los Angeles clothing store on Sunday. And so far, there's no word on a suspect.</p><p>Now, these are live pictures inside the Houses of Commons. For some reason, it's not entirely clear. The speaker of the house has come back in. I suspect it's just for some sort of procedural matters that are taking care of because normally when the house is suspended, all we see is the clock.</p><p>But John Bercow; the speaker is now back in. And there are four alternatives to Theresa May's Brexit deal on the table for MPs. Motion C, the Customs Union, we've talked about this quite a bit, motion D, the common market 2.0, motion E, having a public vote on a deal that's put together, and motion G, is think about we don't want to get into it, it's basically the Brexit safety net.</p><p>Carole Walker is with me at the moment. What -- I think we're getting into just some procedural issues in the house. What do you make of what's -- what is the difference between all these motions do you think for MPs?</p><p>CAROLE WALKER, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, there are four different options there. All of them essentially would be what is loosely termed a softer Brexit. Ken Clarke would be just a Customs Union, that basically means that you don't have an independent trade policy, you have the same tariffs as the EU on the rest of the world.</p><p>But there are no tariffs between the U.K. and the rest of the EU. So that would help some businesses, but it would severely restrict the U.K.'s capability of forging new trade deals around the world. The one that there is most interested in, which is called Common Market 2, would be a form of membership of the European economic area with a Customs Union tacked on.</p><p>So we have those sorts of arrangements which I've described, but also an arrangement to be inside the single market, that means that you match your regulations with those of the European Union. Those who back it, of course say, well, that helps trade much more easily. But if you are a true Brexiteer, you say, well, it's not really Brexit --</p><p>QUEST: OK --</p><p>WALKER: If you're so closely --</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>WALKER: Tied --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>WALKER: To the EU.</p><p>QUEST: But you -- with that one, I suppose we don't know the details, but would you have to take freedom of movement of labor, freedom of movement of people. I mean, if you're so aligned, would you want to be in the single market, with that comes the price of the four pillars?</p><p>WALKER: Well, that's right, and the European Union has always insisted that if you're a member of the single market, you've got to have all four of those pillars. One of them is freedom of movement, so you wouldn't be able to have your own independent immigration policy, but there's a bit of a get out clause where you can say if there is huge pressure on the economy of a particular region, then you could put an emergency brake on immigration.</p><p>But under normal circumstances, no, you'd have to allow EU citizens to come here and live and work here and of course --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>WALKER: British citizens would be able to do the same across the EU.</p><p>QUEST: Right, moment of truth, which one do you think is going to win?</p><p>WALKER: Well, the one that is gaining the most traction is that common market 2 that we've just been talking about. And the reason for that is that both labor and the SMP, the Scottish Nationalist Party are whipping their MPs to support it.</p><p>Now, that in itself may expose some of the divisions within the Labor Party because there will be some Labor MPs in strongly leave supporting areas who will not be happy at the prospect of staying so closely --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>WALKER: Entwined with the European Union. But that's the one that's most likely to get --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>WALKER: The most votes tonight.</p><p>QUEST: You're not going anywhere, are you?</p><p>WALKER: Where else could I go to on a night like this?</p><p>QUEST: It's a little cold, isn't it?</p><p>WALKER: To talk to you about the latest extraordinary developments. It is another extraordinary night in the Commons. It is unusual --</p><p>[15:35:00] QUEST: Right --</p><p>WALKER: For MPs to have control of parliament like this. And the key question is, when they do reach a decision, if they reach a decision, what does the government do next?</p><p>QUEST: You've dropped your pen.</p><p>WALKER: I have dropped my pen, I can continue there if you like without it.</p><p>QUEST: No, I'll tell you, why don't we take a break and then I can pick up your pen for you.</p><p>WALKER: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: All right. We've got so much more to talk about as we continue. We return, a push for privacy and a request for regulation. Facebook wants governments to play a more active role in making rules for the internet. Isn't this a bit like the poacher turned gamekeeper? We need to understand that, it's after the break.</p><p>We are in the final hour of trade, we'll show you the markets as well. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from London.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, it's the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and look at that, 1.17, a strong start to the second quarter.

How did you vote?</p><p>STEPHEN DOUGHTY, BRITISH LABOR MP: I voted for a confirmatory vote which obviously --</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>DOUGHTY: Attached to any deal, a vote for one of soft Brexit options for a Customs Union and I voted for a revocation if we got to a stage where it was going to be a no deal.</p><p>QUEST: So as I was just saying before we came on air, you defied your own party's whip.</p><p>[15:45:00] DOUGHTY: Well, I vote consistently with how I vote in the last round of confirmatory votes while our whip actually slightly changed between those two things. I always had an independent mind on all of these issues. Now, I listened very carefully to the arguments in the chamber today before I cast my vote.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but you know, what's the point of having a whipping system if everyone says I voted my conscience, which might be completely true, I'm not -- I'm not questioning for a second that you -- your ethics or integrity --</p><p>DOUGHTY: Well --</p><p>QUEST: But you're saying, but you didn't vote the whip.</p><p>DOUGHTY: Well, I'm a former whip and you know --</p><p>QUEST: Worse!</p><p>DOUGHTY: Jeremy Corbyn --</p><p>QUEST: You're a game keeper turned poacher.</p><p>DOUGHTY: Well, I mean, Jeremy Corbyn of course broke I think 550 times. I mean, I think what's extraordinary about this period in British politics is of course the --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DOUGHTY: This is an issue that transcends --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DOUGHTY: Traditional party boundaries, it transcends factions. And actually, particularly on this indicative votes, people are voting in the way that they feel is the best way forward.</p><p>QUEST: So let's assume just for the purposes of my question that the Customs Union wins the day. What do you do with that? You've still got to pass the withdrawal bill. Now admittedly, the Customs Union gives you cover against the backstop, but how do you take this vote and turn it into something tangible?</p><p>DOUGHTY: Well, I think fundamentally, there's going to be a deal that goes forward. If we have a deal with the Customs Union attached or if one of the other options succeeds tonight, where I think indeed it's the Prime Minister's deal. I think any one of them now has to go back to the people.</p><p>And I think, you know, we've had the chaos in here, we've had the --</p><p>QUEST: Yes, well --</p><p>DOUGHTY: Impasse. And we've got to have a chance for people to have the final say on whether they want to leave with a deal, a real deal, but a fancy deal and then whether if they don't want that deal, whether they want to keep the deal that we've got.</p><p>QUEST: So you -- assuming -- but what if there is no confirmatory vote. I mean, the Prime Minister is pretty much against it, your own party agrees on a second vote, but in very dubious circumstances, and would prefer an election first.</p><p>DOUGHTY: Well, I mean, and obviously Labor Party would prefer an election, we'd all prefer an election, I'd prefer an election, but --</p><p>QUEST: Would you really? Would you really --</p><p>DOUGHTY: You know --</p><p>QUEST: Prefer an election for a country that is absolutely split at this time? When the former Prime Minister, Sir John Major, is calling for a national unity, but says this would be disastrous?</p><p>DOUGHTY: I think it's very unlikely that we get an election at the moment. You know, a lot of conservatives have made clear they won't support one. And of course, as you say, we're in the middle of a crisis and we had a chance to vote for an election a few weeks ago, that didn't happen.</p><p>But I think the crucial thing now is that, if we just sort of cobble together a deal in here, it may be at the risk of not meeting what either leavers voted for or what remainers voted for. And you only have to look at the protests in the last few weeks, the million people who were on the streets for the people's vote march, the 6 million people signing the petition to revoke --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DOUGHTY: Article 50. There's something happening out there in the public, and we need to respond to that.</p><p>QUEST: We've had -- one last quickly. We've had -- and we've been asking our viewers following on from what Siemens CEO said. Is this making the U.K. the laughing stock of the world?</p><p>DOUGHTY: Well, I think -- I think it has made us, you know, diminished in the international world -- in the international standings both in terms of our politics --</p><p>QUEST: And you're prepared to accept --</p><p>DOUGHTY: Our business and our government.</p><p>QUEST: And you're prepared to accept your part of blame in that?</p><p>DOUGHTY: Well, I think the government fundamentally, they chose to handle this process in a particular way. Parliament actually is the one that's taken back control here to try to find a way forward. We're working across all bases to find compromise --</p><p>QUEST: Well --</p><p>DOUGHTY: And that's going to be a way to find a solution.</p><p>QUEST: We're out of time, good to see you sir --</p><p>DOUGHTY: Pleasure, always --</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, thank you. As we continue, painting a picture of Brexit. We'll meet the man wielding the paint cans in London.</p><p>[15:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: As British lawmakers prepare again voting on alternatives to the Prime Minister's Brexit deal, frustration is growing across the U.K.. You've heard about it from our correspondents, Nina and Stewart both reported at the sheer anger at the political turmoil here in Westminster.</p><p>Well, that's the case in Stockton-on-Tees in Northern England, the region that wants out of the European Union and where Hadas Gold is this evening. What you're hearing from the people there is what?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, Richard, this area voted overwhelmingly in favor of leaving the European Union. In some areas in this key side region, which is what it's known as, even voted up to 70 percent in favor of Brexit. Now, this area has been really hurt in the last few years, the closure of especially one large steel plant.</p><p>And the unemployment numbers here are double what they are on the national average. And a lot of people here blame the U.K. being part of the European Union as one of the reasons why they think this area has had trouble reinventing itself or reinvigorating itself.</p><p>They believe that EU regulations and rules have prevented the U.K. having sovereignty over their own business decisions. So they see Brexit as a way out, as a salvation. Something that will bring them new opportunities, including a new free port proposal that's been brought up here, that would turn it into a Customs tariff-free zone.</p><p>They -- but they can't get any of that started they believe until Brexit happens. Now, these people are very frustrated with parliament, one person yesterday described parliament to me as a bunch of squabbling children and other people say, you know, we've survived world wars, we're tough people especially up here in the north.</p><p>We can survive a Brexit, we can survive even a no-deal Brexit. They are incredibly frustrated and they just want to be able to move on.</p><p>QUEST: Hadas, thank you. We listen to what people say where you are. You really do get the flavor of the colorful way in which they put it.</p><p>GOLD: They definitely put it in a colorful way, but it's also a reflection of just their own frustrations with what is happening. Their own frustrations with the politicians. They don't believe that the politicians reflect their values, reflect what they actually want to see happen.</p><p>They say the people voted in 2016 and the politicians in Westminster are not executing on what that vote told them to do.</p><p>QUEST: Hadas, thank you. Hadas Gold in Stockton-on-Tees in the Northeast. The writing is on the wall, literally, Brexit is a mess. This is the scene outside just on the street where our offices are. Sleep-walking towards Theresa May in various poses, sleepwalking, falling over hurdles, amongst other things. People walking by told us this paints an accurate picture of Brexit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they're really good. I think it sums up the mood of what everyone is feeling at the moment. And you know, the mood is stop wasting money, stop wasting time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think one purpose of this art is to really inform people at the same time to really evoke emotions and, you know, what's going on, on people's mind.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: While I stopped and take a pose is because it made me happy, because I could laugh at it for once and it's been quite depressing scenario and it's been going on for years. I'm really glad that someone can take a relatively light-hearted poke at it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The artist responsible goes by the name Loretto and Loretto is with me now, good to see you, sir --</p><p>BIO LORETTO, GRAFFITI ARTIST: Hi, nice to see you --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed --</p><p>LORETTO: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And why did you do these things? Because I saw them on -- as we were walking back from dinner the other night --</p><p>LORETTO: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And they're really attracting a crowd. Why did you do them?</p><p>LORETTO: I feel so inspired about all these things that happen actually. You know, actuality, here and other countries, United States, and I think it's a lot of inspiration for artists, really.</p><p>QUEST: But your art -- you're not European.</p><p>LORETTO: No.</p><p>[15:55:00] QUEST: But you've decided that this satirical art against Brexit, what was the motivation? I mean, when you feel the mood of the country?</p><p>LORETTO: It's like I think as an artist, we feel sometimes as inspiration how people feel.</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LORETTO: And I --</p><p>QUEST: So what are you saying about Brexit here?</p><p>LORETTO: What do I say? I think she needs to think what people are thinking or what people are telling because I think a leader must do sometimes what people want, expect her to do, yes. And I think --</p><p>QUEST: Are you surprised at how popular these pictures have been? I saw lots of people take --</p><p>LORETTO: Yes, I'm so happy about it.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, it has been quite -- people are taking pictures, and when I saw you the other day, people were coming up and talking to you about it --</p><p>LORETTO: Yes, I like the --</p><p>QUEST: What were they saying about it? What did they say?</p><p>LORETTO: They like the artworks, they like the meaning, they like the colors. Because I want also to create something beautiful about maybe a higher moment, yes, because this is all about life, right? Through her moment we can create something good, you know, and give some sort of message, yes?</p><p>And also in another hand to do like a comedy, you know, like a comedian.</p><p>QUEST: Well, let's face it, the comedian is about -- could become the most precedent --</p><p>LORETTO: I'm glad you liked my work.</p><p>QUEST: Very much so, thank you, sir.</p><p>LORETTO: You're welcome --</p><p>QUEST: So to the European markets, strong data, strong data from the United Kingdom lifted stocks in London. The FTSE 100 climbing half of a percent, others stockpiling of no deal, in case of a no Brexit, helped bruised Britain's factory sector.</p><p>You can see the gains on the last, no losses today. Nearly out of time in terms of the Dow, what a day in New York, you've got the Dow that marched on to a high, look at that, up 351, 1.3 and all the other markets are up as well. We'll have more, we'll continue, there is much more because the news never stops, neither do we.

It is Monday, April the 1st and we promise, this is far from an April fool's joke.  Once again, we have our teams standing outside the Houses of Parliament at Westminster as lawmakers are trying to pull Brexit out of the mud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, MPs in the chamber have a free vote on a variety of options, including a Customs Union or a second referendum.  For the first time, could May be over before the end of April?  She will decide whether to hit the nuclear button and go for a snap election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, Brexit is turning Britain into a laughing stock says a top Siemens executive while easyJet warns the uncertainty is hurting its business.  I'm Amara Walker and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Good evening to you, and a warm welcome once again to Westminster where MPs have now just started voting on the alternatives to Theresa May's E.U. withdrawal deal.  Now, they managed to unite behind the plan.  They could force the Prime Minister's hand and change the course of Brexit.</p><p>There are four options and MPs are trying to whittle it down to find one that can get a majority.  If that happens, it could lead to a long Brexit delay and new negotiations.</p><p>Bianca is with me to go through the ones that are actually being talked about.  If Parliament doesn't back any of today's proposals, the Prime Minister could ask for the full term -- if the Prime -- what is likely to happen?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Tonight, we're expecting that there will be a majority around one of the soft Brexit options.  That's because the Labour Party has said it's going to support, it's going to whip for support of three of them including the Customs Union and Common Market 2.0.  Those are the ones that they have a real eye on.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, so which ones -- I have my --</p><p>NOBILO:  We both have our order papers, Richard.  We've had two here.</p><p>QUEST:  I have my order paper here which is going to lead the way here.  So as we go through this evening, which ones have been accepted by the Speaker?</p><p>NOBILO:  We have C to start with, which is the Customs Union.</p><p>QUEST:  Just a moment, so we are going to have a Customs -- all right, let's talk briefly through the first ones.  Customs Union -- what does that entail?  That's the one where ...</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST:   ... straight forward they'll either going to join a permanent Customs Union.</p><p>NOBILO:  Exactly.  Permanent Customs Union tabled by Ken Clarke, Father of the House considered to be popular, has some cross-party support and also did what was one of the best votes last week.  It was one of the most popular.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, and the second one is D has been accepted.</p><p>NOBILO:  D, that's Common Market.</p><p>QUEST:  Which is the Common Market.</p><p>NOBILO:  Yes, Common Market 2.0.  That requires a bit more discussion, so it's tabled by a Conservative MP, but Labour is going to support it.</p><p>QUEST:  Let's listen to what Labour says.  It will support the Customs Union and the Common Market 2.0.  It will also support some of the others.  Let's listen to what was said in the House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMILY THORNBERRY, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY:  We've been trying to do things that will help the British economy and protect British jobs and we accept that in the referendum, 52 percent of people voted to leave but 48 percent voted to remain.  And so, really, the answer for any states person we think in those circumstances is to try to keep the country together to leave, but actually not go very far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Right, then we have -- he's accepted number E which is the -- well, confirmatory.  How do you say it?</p><p>NOBILO:  Yes, I say confirmatory, but it's up to you how you say it, but the point is the branding is different from a second referendum.  The idea is, it will be a public vote on whatever it is that Parliament decides versus remain.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, and then the last one that's been accepted was --</p><p>NOBILO:  The last one, now this is the safety net option, I think is the easiest way to refer to it, so that means --</p><p>QUEST:  Parliamentary supremacy.</p><p>NOBILO:  Yes, so that means, if there is deal agreed, then you go to the E.U. and ask for another extension.  If the E.U. rejects that, then Parliament votes on whether or not wants to do no-deal.  If Parliament rejects that, then you revoke Article 50 and Labour is not supporting that.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, so what we like -- how long is the piece of string -- the Speaker has already said that you can't go for -- you can't vote yes or no on the same one.  So you can't spoil your ballot paper.</p><p>NOBILO:  Actually, let's talk a moment about the Speaker's choice because usually you'd select a spectrum.  Now, all of those are soft Brexit options.  He didn't choose either of the two Brexiteer amendments which were put down.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, for good reason.</p><p>NOBILO:  They were less popular last week.  But still he always says it's his job to show the fullest expression of Parliamentary will.</p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  I read the note that you wrote on this.  Didn't he also say that there's no point because a hard Brexit is the default option and, anyway, even if you add them all up, they still wouldn't have got a majority or wouldn't?</p><p>NOBILO:  I mean, not quite.  You would expect them to have something from the other side, but he's chosen four which, for those people who have criticized the Speaker's role in this Brexit debate and say he's had an agenda, that he was a remain supporter and wants to facilitate that, the selections today do support that idea.  However, the majority in Parliament is squarely around a softer Brexit, so it makes sense to facilitate that.</p><p>QUEST:  All right, so let's tick tock.  They're voting now which is why you see the clock, not that you can see the clock, but you see the clock.  They'll finish voting.  Let's display that one, four crosses or ticks on a piece of paper and then there's the clock seven minutes past 8:00, but we're not expecting a result.  The House is suspended when you see the clock.  Tell me what will happen.</p><p>NOBILO:  So we're expecting a result around 10:00 because the votes will take a while and then the counting takes a while.  The Speaker will announce all of them together.  Usually, he will announce the results of the division right after it.</p><p>QUEST:  So what time?</p><p>NOBILO:  So some time in the 10:00 hour.</p><p>QUEST:  10:00.</p><p>NOBILO:  Meanwhile, there will also be other Brexit statutes going through as well.</p><p>QUEST:  Well --</p><p>NOBILO:  I will see you.</p><p>QUEST:  Don't go too far.  Put something warm on, though.  It was a beautiful day in London, but it's jolly chilly now, I can tell you that.  As the sun has gone down, I've got the heaters on.  Right, when we come back after -- thank you.</p><p>As we come back, companies across the continent say Brexit is hurting their business; easyJet has reported a loss and says demand somewhat looks weak.  The easyJet airline says the uncertainty is driving ticket prices lower.  In a moment, we'll talk about it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:10:19]</p><p>QUEST:  Companies across the continent say Brexit is hurting their business. EasyJet has reported a loss and says demand somewhat looks weak.  The share price down nearly 10%.  The airline also says the uncertainty is driving ticket prices lower after nearly -- off nearly 9.7 at the close.</p><p>The chief executive of Siemens says Britain is becoming into a laughing stock.  Jurgen Maier is warning MPs he is having trouble making the case to his colleagues that it is worth investing in the U.K. whilst Goldman is telling Brexit is costing the U.K. nearly $800 million each week.  That's about 2.4% of GDP.</p><p>Anna, you've been reviewing these.  Are they just alarmists?  Hyperbole?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, REPORTER, CNN:  I wish they were, Richard, but unfortunately, Brexit uncertainty quite apart from Brexit itself is costing businesses, is costing the economy.  Where should we start?  Should we start with easyJet?</p><p>QUEST:  Yes.</p><p>STEWART:  I mean, we knew that they were going to have a loss for the last six months, 360 million pounds.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes, but hang on, hang on.  But they usually make a loss in the quarter anyway.</p><p>STEWART:  And lots of different head winds, but the thing that was much more worrying in this trading update was the outlook for the summer.  Very soft, weak demand for consumers and the CEO says today, macroeconomic uncertainty, many unanswered questions concerning Brexit are driving weak customer demand in the U.K. and on the European side, too.</p><p>QUEST:  Siemens describing the MPs or Parliament or Brexit as a laughing stock.  I think he put in here -- he is describing about he can't justify investment.</p><p>STEWART:  Yes, this is very interesting.  Open letter in POLITICO today and it was a real stinging rebuke actually against Parliament.  I mean, it was very direct in fact to MPs.  Let me read you one line.  It says, \"The world is watching and where the U.K. used to be a beacon of stability, we are now becoming a laughingstock.  I personally can no longer defend the action of our Parliament when reporting to my managing board.\"</p><p>And he is going on and on about compromise and the need for compromise across parties.  He wants a Customs Union, of course.  So he'll be watching the indicative vote tonight with great care.</p><p>QUEST:  Where are these hundreds of millions coming from -- Goldman says is being lost?  I mean, again, people on the streets will say, well, I didn't see any money going.</p><p>STEWART:  Quite, and you've got to think about, firstly, look at the economic picture.  Both the CEO and Goldman Sachs are saying we've lost 2.5% potentially on GDP that is looking at where the U.K. economy could be and where it is now since the referendum.</p><p>In terms of money per week that Brexit is costing, they all come to different conclusions because they use different little parameters here.  Goldman Sachs, $790 million a week.  The CER, $470 million, the Bank of England, $1 billion a week.  Depending on whether you are looking at consumer spending, business investment, borrowing for the government.</p><p>QUEST:  Isn't this exactly what everybody forecast would happen with a shoddy Brexit?  A sort of a mishmash of indecision?</p><p>STEWART:  Well, I don't think anyone quite predicted this level of indecision, I would suggest.  You know, the CER did say that lots of forecasts, particularly from the Treasury themselves were wrong after the vote, and they were.  But they say independent forecasts like their own were bang on the dollar.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Anna.  Keep watching those, please.</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>QUEST:  We'll also talk about that.  We want you to join the conversation.  We'd like you to join the conversation.  It's really quite simple now at cnn.com/join.  It's really a straightforward one.  Bearing in mind what Anna was just telling me from the comment on Siemens.  Tonight's question, is Brexit making the U.K. the laughing stock of the world?  And as a Brit it gives me no treat or pleasure to put that question tonight.</p><p>But bearing in mind the seeming inability to do anything, is it -- is Brexit making the U.K. a laughing stock?  Mohamed El-Erian is the chief economic adviser at Allianz and Mohamed is now with me from New York.  When we see these numbers about loss of -- Goldman says it's costing $800 million a week.  What are they referring to?</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ:  They are referring to three things and that is what you get when you have slow Brexit.  People postpone decisions so they are referring to investment decisions that are being postponed.  They refer to consumption decisions that are being postponed, and they refer to the inflows of capital of direct investment from the rest of the world that's being postponed and add those three things together, they all point to growth being a victim of this unusual uncertainty associated with a slow Brexit process.</p><p>QUEST:  How does one reconcile those economic realities with the very passioned and passionate arguments being put in the House?  I mean, nobody I suppose is doing this willingly or wantingly.  They are doing it because they believe in it.  Is it possible to square that circle economically?</p><p>EL-ERIAN:  It is because there's two arguments.  One is about the destination.  What does the destination look like?  And here you can argue whether a soft Brexit or a harder Brexit dominates, but that is about the destination.  What we are learning is if the journey is too slow, and we've been on a very slow journey, there are costs that are associated not with the destination but with the journey.</p><p>And let me give you an example.  There was no political appetite to look at any other issue today in Britain other than Brexit.  You need a major crisis to get focused.  So any attempt to promote productivity and growth gets delayed pending the resolution of the Brexit issue.</p><p>QUEST:  Mohamed, stay with us, please, because we're going to come back to you in a moment or three.  We're going to talk about the Customs Union and the merits or demerits of such a thing versus the Common Market.  Stay with us for that.</p><p>On the question of what Europe makes of it.  Brexit is no April fools' joke.  It's a tragedy.  The words of Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator said, \"The U.K. is nearly out of time and the clock is now at five to midnight.\"</p><p>Mairead McGuinness is Vice President of the European Parliament.  Always good to see you even in such very difficult circumstances like tonight.  Parliament is voting again.  What do you hope they will vote for and what happens once they've voted that way?</p><p>MAIREAD MCGUINNESS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Well, I am actually not sure what I hope for anymore.  What I had hoped for was that the withdrawal agreement negotiation would be passed and we'd get on to chatting about the future.  So I'm quite nervous and anxious about what's going to happen tonight.</p><p>There are four amendments, and you've been talking about them.  It's going to be another late night here trying to look at the results and ponder about whether they chart a way forward.</p><p>I suppose what concerns us here at E.U. level is the time -- I mean, we were talking about March the 29th, I think previously, but now we're looking at April the 12th and I don't see any coming together.</p><p>I tried to watch some of the debates to see what the movement -- and you know, some are actually now saying they would vote against the withdrawal agreement that had previously voted for it.</p><p>So I really don't have the wisdom to say what I hope for anymore other than what I had hoped for hasn't happened.  Now perhaps I should try and be optimistic and with the results that come this evening, maybe the Prime Minister can eventually get her withdrawal agreement over the line by promising to MPs that she can adjust the political declaration.  That's my hope.  But do I think it will happen? I'm not so sure.</p><p>And I think around this town today, it's Monday.  It's April fools' day, it's April the 1st, nobody was smiling very much.  There were a few jokes told, but I think we're all really aware now that while a no deal was something we thought was there, we now realize it's a much closer to happening almost by accident rather than by design.</p><p>And I think that's the worst possible outcome for the United Kingdom and for the European Union.</p><p>[15:20:01]</p><p>QUEST:  All right, but the Taoiseach is saying today warning about the possibility of a no deal and warning Irish companies to be ready for it.  Do you think the E.U. -- remaining E.U. is now ready for a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>MCGUINNESS:  Well, we've done a lot of work in Parliament to vote through a lot of measures to deal with the no deal scenario and we'd do more of that this week.  The Irish government have been running all sorts of engagement with businesses for many months now, in fact, since the referendum we've been looking at this and what the appeal from the Taoiseach this evening is to those businesses that perhaps, had not made enough preparations.</p><p>But all companies are anxious.  Whether they are in the U.K. or in Ireland, and I think your previous speaker mentioned uncertainty, and I know that from my constituents, there are businesses that are delaying investment until they see what is going to happen and that really doesn't really help us as an economy and it doesn't help the U.K. either.</p><p>QUEST:  Mairead, thank you.  We'll talk more I am pretty certain.  Always grateful that you take the time to talk to us on \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>MCGUINNESS:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much and the same with Mohamed El-Erian, always grateful to have you.  The Customs Union tonight is being discussed.  It's either Customs Union or Common Market 2.0 which is more single market, but just on Custom Union alone now, does it make sense or is this sort of a Norway plus and a rather poor option?</p><p>EL-ERIAN:  It's a feasible option and it is better than the alternatives.  I think, Richard, the tragedy in all of this is that you have increased the probability of what's known as tail events -- things that were thought to be very unlikely that now command material probability.</p><p>We heard about hard Brexit.  There's also the possibility of an early election in the U.K.  So suddenly, you have all these other scenarios that have become possible, much more possible and that's before you talk about the two very complicating issues.  What do you do with the European Parliamentary elections, and what do you do the second referendum advocates?</p><p>I love multidimensional games, I love the analysis, but this is getting really complicated, which means you may get unintended consequences.</p><p>QUEST:  Is one of those -- I mean, the difficulty is you and I could sit here all night and sketch out a million possibilities and options in between, but what's the most realistic option tonight, do you think, looking at it from the financial point of view?  Is it some sort of long delay leading to an ultimate Customs Union?</p><p>EL-ERIAN:  Yes, I think certainly delay.  No one wants to go down in history to being the decisive voice enforcing a hard Brexit.  So when push comes to shove, people delay.  Now, if you want to be an optimist, you say delay in order to reach consensus, but the reality is that the political process is much better deciding what it doesn't want rather than what it wants.</p><p>So we will get a delay and that delay will go longer and we'll talk again about the economic cost to the U.K. of this process that's a saga by now.  I think that's the most likely outcome which is delay, delay, delay.</p><p>QUEST:  Can I turn to one other matter before -- I mean, the rest of the world watching is also very concerned.  This inversion in the yield curve in the U.S. admittedly it's the 10 and the 3-month so it's not exactly a major, but the view seems to be that's not suggesting immediate problems, but 2020 potential recession.  How concerned are you about the inversion?</p><p>EL-ERIAN:  So I'm not concerned when it comes to the outlook for the U.S. economy.  I do not think we are heading into recession either this year or in 2020.  What it tells us is two things.  One is people are worried about the rest of the world and the spillover effects and today's China data was encouraging, whether it was as encouraging as the markets' bounce suggests is a different issue, but it was encouraging.</p><p>And the second thing the inverted yield curve is telling you is that it is distorted by monetary policy, by unconventional policies.  So I do not think it's the signal of a recession coming up in the U.S. either this year or next.</p><p>QUEST:  Mohamed, thank you very much indeed.  We will talk more, obviously, as we'll need you to interpret and help us understand from the financial point of view, from the wider geopolitical point of view what's happening with Brexit.  Always grateful to see you.  My apologies that I'm not in New York to do it face-to-face.  Thank you.</p><p>The question that we asked, of course, about the U.K. being a laughing stock in Europe.  If you look at the result, it is pretty overwhelming.</p><p>[15:25:08]</p><p>QUEST:  I don't think we've had one quite as overwhelming.  Maybe once or twice; 92% of you say Brexit is making the U.K. a laughing stock.  That will not be pleased music to the ears of internationalists here in London or indeed those who have to do business.</p><p>As we continue, the European market's strong data from the U.K. lifted the stocks in London.  The FTSE climbing 0.5%.  Apparently, it was some panic stockpiling in case of a no-deal Brexit that helped boost Britain's factory sector.  We'll look at all of those numbers a little bit later on.  This is \"Quest Means Business\" live tonight.  They are voting.  The MPs will have probably voted by now, and we'll have the result, we suspect, in about two hours.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  I'm Richard Quest.  There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.  Preparing to vote -- lawmakers have voted and it's going up for a late night.  They're looking to see if they can find a path forward and in doing so, pick Brexit that's right for them.</p><p>Amid all the gloom, there is satire for survival.  We will meet the artist who is painting the town red with his interpretations of Brexit.  This is CNN and here on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>President Trump is repeating a threat to close the border with Mexico.  But this time, he says there's a deadline.  He says he will do it this week, unless Mexico stops all illegal immigration into the U.S.  The President says closing the border would also help stop the flow of drugs.</p><p>The head of a congressional committee plans to subpoena key White House staffers saying a whistleblower has revealed grave features of national security at the highest levels of the Trump administration.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>He said the whistleblower told his committee that senior Trump officials overruled concerns about dozens of people who were initially denied security clearances.</p><p>After the first round of voting in Ukraine's presidential election, a television comedian has the most votes.  With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, Volodymyr Zelensky seems headed to a runoff against the incumbent president.  Zelensky is the star of a popular TV show in which he plays a nobody who accidentally gets elected president.</p><p>DNA samples found at the site of last month's Ethiopian Airlines crash are being sent to the United Kingdom for analysis.  Victims' families have been trying to get the analysis done so that they can identify remains and give their loved ones proper burials.</p><p>And the music world is mourning the Grammy-nominated rapper known as Nipsey Hussle.  The 33-year-old was shot dead outside his Los Angeles clothing store on Sunday.  And so far, there's no word on a suspect.</p><p>Now, these are live pictures inside the Houses of Commons.  For some reason, it's not entirely clear.  The speaker of the house has come back in.  I suspect it's just for some sort of procedural matters that are taking care of because normally when the house is suspended, all we see is the clock.</p><p>But John Bercow; the speaker is now back in.  And there are four alternatives to Theresa May's Brexit deal on the table for MPs.  Motion C, the Customs Union, we've talked about this quite a bit, motion D, the common market 2.0, motion E, having a public vote on a deal that's put together, and motion G, is think about we don't want to get into it, it's basically the Brexit safety net.</p><p>Carole Walker is with me at the moment.  What -- I think we're getting into just some procedural issues in the house.  What do you make of what's -- what is the difference between all these motions do you think for MPs?</p><p>CAROLE WALKER, POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, there are four different options there.  All of them essentially would be what is loosely termed a softer Brexit.  Ken Clarke would be just a Customs Union, that basically means that you don't have an independent trade policy, you have the same tariffs as the EU on the rest of the world.</p><p>But there are no tariffs between the U.K. and the rest of the EU.  So that would help some businesses, but it would severely restrict the U.K.'s capability of forging new trade deals around the world.  The one that there is most interested in, which is called Common Market 2, would be a form of membership of the European economic area with a Customs Union tacked on.</p><p>So we have those sorts of arrangements which I've described, but also an   arrangement to be inside the single market, that means that you match your   regulations with those of the European Union.  Those who back it, of course say, well, that helps trade much more easily.  But if you are a true Brexiteer, you say, well, it's not really Brexit --</p><p>QUEST:  OK --</p><p>WALKER:  If you're so closely --</p><p>QUEST:  All right --</p><p>WALKER:  Tied --</p><p>QUEST:  But --</p><p>WALKER:  To the EU.</p><p>QUEST:  But you -- with that one, I suppose we don't know the details, but would  you have to take freedom of movement of labor, freedom of movement of people.  I mean, if you're so aligned, would you want to be in the single market, with that comes the price of the four pillars?</p><p>WALKER:  Well, that's right, and the European Union has always insisted that if you're a member of the single market, you've got to have all four of those pillars.  One of them is freedom of movement, so you wouldn't be able to have your own independent immigration policy, but there's a bit of a get out clause where you can say if there is huge pressure on the economy of a particular region, then you could put an emergency brake on immigration.</p><p>But under normal circumstances, no, you'd have to allow EU citizens to come here and live and work here and of course --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>WALKER:  British citizens would be able to do the same across the EU.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, moment of truth, which one do you think is going to win?</p><p>WALKER:  Well, the one that is gaining the most traction is that common market 2 that we've just been talking about.  And the reason for that is that both labor and the SMP, the Scottish Nationalist Party are whipping their MPs to support it.</p><p>Now, that in itself may expose some of the divisions within the Labor Party  because there will be some Labor MPs in strongly leave supporting areas who will not be happy at the prospect of staying so closely --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>WALKER:  Entwined with the European Union.  But that's the one that's most   likely to get --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>WALKER:  The most votes tonight.</p><p>QUEST:  You're not going anywhere, are you?</p><p>WALKER:  Where else could I go to on a night like this?</p><p>QUEST:  It's a little cold, isn't it?</p><p>WALKER:  To talk to you about the latest extraordinary developments.  It is another extraordinary night in the Commons.  It is unusual --</p><p>[15:35:00]  QUEST:  Right --</p><p>WALKER:  For MPs to have control of parliament like this.  And the key question is, when they do reach a decision, if they reach a decision, what does the government do next?</p><p>QUEST:  You've dropped your pen.</p><p>WALKER:  I have dropped my pen, I can continue there if you like without it.</p><p>QUEST:  No, I'll tell you, why don't we take a break and then I can pick up your pen for you.</p><p>WALKER:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  We've got so much more to talk about as we continue.  We return, a push for privacy and a request for regulation.  Facebook wants governments to play a more active role in making rules for the internet.  Isn't this a bit like the poacher turned gamekeeper?

In a \"Washington Post\" opinion piece, he calls for a stricter rules regarding harmful content.  He also argues government should do more to guard against online election meddling and the misuse of users' private data.</p><p>Facebook was recently condemned for failing to protest or prevent a terrorist live streaming video of a mass shooting in New Zealand.  CNN's Brian Stelter with me in New York.  Is this the poacher turned game keeper? Seems a bit bizarre, he's now sort of saying to government, no, this is your business, you get on with it?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  He knows regulators around the world have a lot ideas.  And he is trying to shape the   conversation about how to regulate these big tech companies.  That's definitely what's going on, Richard, and it's part of a multi-pronged effort we're seeing from Zuckerberg and from his new head of Global Affairs, his new PR chief Nick Clegg who was hired of course from where you are right now.</p><p>Right now, Zuckerberg and Clegg are both in Berlin, they've been on an European tour of sorts, meeting with publishers, meeting with regulators, again, trying to set the debate on their own terms.  Zuckerberg says for example, that there need to be regulations about online content, about what kind of hate  speech is tolerable and what's intolerable on sites like Facebook.</p><p>And this is something that we have seen Facebook executives privately saying --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>STELTER:  For a while.  They've told me for a couple of years, if there are rules, we will follow them.  Now, Zuckerberg is actively himself, saying the same thing and trying to set the agenda.</p><p>QUEST:  Brian Stelter, Brian, thank you.</p><p>STELTER:  Thanks.</p><p>QUEST:  Turning to tonight's Brexit, joining me now Stephen Doughty is a member of parliament for the Labor Party.  How did you vote?</p><p>STEPHEN DOUGHTY, BRITISH LABOR MP:  I voted for a confirmatory vote which obviously --</p><p>QUEST:  All right --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Attached to any deal, a vote for one of soft Brexit options for a Customs Union and I voted for a revocation if we got to a stage where it was going to be a no deal.</p><p>QUEST:  So as I was just saying before we came on air, you defied your own party's whip.</p><p>[15:45:00]  DOUGHTY:  Well, I vote consistently with how I vote in the last round of confirmatory votes while our whip actually slightly changed between those two things.  I always had an independent mind on all of these issues.  Now, I listened very carefully to the arguments in the chamber today before I cast my vote.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, but you know, what's the point of having a whipping system if everyone says I voted my conscience, which might be completely true, I'm not -- I'm not questioning for a second that you -- your ethics or integrity --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Well --</p><p>QUEST:  But you're saying, but you didn't vote the whip.</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Well, I'm a former whip and you know --</p><p>QUEST:  Worse!</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Jeremy Corbyn --</p><p>QUEST:  You're a game keeper turned poacher.</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Well, I mean, Jeremy Corbyn of course broke I think 550 times.  I mean, I think what's extraordinary about this period in British politics is of course the --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  This is an issue that transcends --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Traditional party boundaries, it transcends factions.  And actually, particularly on this indicative votes, people are voting in the way that they feel is the best way forward.</p><p>QUEST:  So let's assume just for the purposes of my question that the Customs   Union wins the day.  What do you do with that? You've still got to pass the   withdrawal bill.  Now admittedly, the Customs Union gives you cover against   the backstop, but how do you take this vote and turn it into something tangible?</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Well, I think fundamentally, there's going to be a deal that goes forward.  If we have a deal with the Customs Union attached or if one of the other options succeeds tonight, where I think indeed it's the Prime Minister's deal.  I think any one of them now has to go back to the people.</p><p>And I think, you know, we've had the chaos in here, we've had the --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes, well --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Impasse.  And we've got to have a chance for people to have the final say on whether they want to leave with a deal, a real deal, but a fancy deal and then whether if they don't want that deal, whether they want to keep the deal that we've got.</p><p>QUEST:  So you -- assuming -- but what if there is no confirmatory vote.  I mean, the Prime Minister is pretty much against it, your own party agrees on a second vote, but in very dubious circumstances, and would prefer an election first.</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Well, I mean, and obviously Labor Party would prefer an election, we'd all prefer an election, I'd prefer an election, but --</p><p>QUEST:  Would you really? Would you really --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  You know --</p><p>QUEST:  Prefer an election for a country that is absolutely split at this time? When the former Prime Minister, Sir John Major, is calling for a national unity, but says this would be disastrous?</p><p>DOUGHTY:  I think it's very unlikely that we get an election at the moment.  You know, a lot of conservatives have made clear they won't support one.  And of course, as you say, we're in the middle of a crisis and we had a chance to vote for an election a few weeks ago, that didn't happen.</p><p>But I think the crucial thing now is that, if we just sort of cobble together a deal in   here, it may be at the risk of not meeting what either leavers voted for or what remainers voted for.  And you only have to look at the protests in the last few weeks, the million people who were on the streets for the people's vote march, the 6 million people signing the petition to revoke --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Article 50.  There's something happening out there in the public, and we need to respond to that.</p><p>QUEST:  We've had -- one last quickly.  We've had -- and we've been asking our viewers following on from what Siemens CEO said.  Is this making the U.K. the   laughing stock of the world?</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Well, I think -- I think it has made us, you know, diminished in the international world -- in the international standings both in terms of our politics --</p><p>QUEST:  And you're prepared to accept --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Our business and our government.</p><p>QUEST:  And you're prepared to accept your part of blame in that?</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Well, I think the government fundamentally, they chose to handle this process in a particular way.  Parliament actually is the one that's taken back control here to try to find a way forward.  We're working across all bases to find compromise --</p><p>QUEST:  Well --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  And that's going to be a way to find a solution.</p><p>QUEST:  We're out of time, good to see you sir --</p><p>DOUGHTY:  Pleasure, always --</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, thank you.  As we continue, painting a picture of Brexit.  We'll meet the man wielding the paint cans in London.</p><p>[15:50:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  As British lawmakers prepare again voting on alternatives to the Prime Minister's Brexit deal, frustration is growing across the U.K..  You've heard about it from our correspondents, Nina and Stewart both reported at the sheer anger at the political turmoil here in Westminster.</p><p>Well, that's the case in Stockton-on-Tees in Northern England, the region that wants out of the European Union and where Hadas Gold is this evening.  What you're hearing from the people there is what?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, Richard, this area voted overwhelmingly in favor of leaving the European Union.  In some areas in this key side region, which is what it's known as, even voted up to 70 percent in favor of Brexit.  Now, this area has been really hurt in the last few years, the closure of especially one large steel plant.</p><p>And the unemployment numbers here are double what they are on the national average.  And a lot of people here blame the U.K. being part of the European   Union as one of the reasons why they think this area has had trouble reinventing itself or reinvigorating itself.</p><p>They believe that EU regulations and rules have prevented the U.K. having sovereignty over their own business decisions.  So they see Brexit as a way out, as a salvation.  Something that will bring them new opportunities, including a new free port proposal that's been brought up here, that would turn it into a Customs   tariff-free zone.</p><p>They -- but they can't get any of that started they believe until Brexit happens.  Now, these people are very frustrated with parliament, one person yesterday described parliament to me as a bunch of squabbling children and other people say, you know, we've survived world wars, we're tough people especially up here in the north.</p><p>We can survive a Brexit, we can survive even a no-deal Brexit.  They are incredibly frustrated and they just want to be able to move on.</p><p>QUEST:  Hadas, thank you.  We listen to what people say where you are.  You really do get the flavor of the colorful way in which they put it.</p><p>GOLD:  They definitely put it in a colorful way, but it's also a reflection of just their own frustrations with what is happening.  Their own frustrations with the   politicians.  They don't believe that the politicians reflect their values, reflect what they actually want to see happen.</p><p>They say the people voted in 2016 and the politicians in Westminster are not executing on what that vote told them to do.</p><p>QUEST:  Hadas, thank you.  Hadas Gold in Stockton-on-Tees in the Northeast.  The writing is on the wall, literally, Brexit is a mess.  This is the scene outside just   on the street where our offices are.  Sleep-walking towards Theresa May in various poses, sleepwalking, falling over hurdles, amongst other things.  People walking by told us this paints an accurate picture of Brexit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think they're really good.  I think it sums up the mood of what everyone is feeling at the moment.  And you know, the mood is stop wasting money, stop wasting time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think one purpose of this art is to really inform people at the same time to really evoke emotions and, you know, what's going on, on people's mind.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  While I stopped and take a pose is because it made me happy, because I could laugh at it for once and it's been quite depressing   scenario and it's been going on for years.  I'm really glad that someone can take a relatively light-hearted poke at it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  The artist responsible goes by the name Loretto and Loretto is with me now, good to see you, sir --</p><p>BIO LORETTO, GRAFFITI ARTIST:  Hi, nice to see you --</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed --</p><p>LORETTO:  Yes --</p><p>QUEST:  And why did you do these things? Because I saw them on -- as we were walking back from dinner the other night --</p><p>LORETTO:  Yes --</p><p>QUEST:  And they're really attracting a crowd.  Why did you do them?</p><p>LORETTO:  I feel so inspired about all these things that happen actually.  You know, actuality, here and other countries, United States, and I think it's a lot of  inspiration for artists, really.</p><p>QUEST:  But your art -- you're not European.</p><p>LORETTO:  No.</p><p>[15:55:00]  QUEST:  But you've decided that this satirical art against Brexit, what was the motivation? I mean, when you feel the mood of the country?</p><p>LORETTO:  It's like I think as an artist, we feel sometimes as inspiration how people feel.</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>LORETTO:  And I --</p><p>QUEST:  So what are you saying about Brexit here?</p><p>LORETTO:  What do I say? I think she needs to think what people are thinking or what people are telling because I think a leader must do sometimes what people want, expect her to do, yes.  And I think --</p><p>QUEST:  Are you surprised at how popular these pictures have been? I saw lots of people take --</p><p>LORETTO:  Yes, I'm so happy about it.</p><p>QUEST:  I mean, it has been quite -- people are taking pictures, and when I saw   you the other day, people were coming up and talking to you about it --</p><p>LORETTO:  Yes, I like the --</p><p>QUEST:  What were they saying about it? What did they say?</p><p>LORETTO:  They like the artworks, they like the meaning, they like the colors.  Because I want also to create something beautiful about maybe a higher moment, yes, because this is all about life, right? Through her moment we can create  something good, you know, and give some sort of message, yes?</p><p>And also in another hand to do like a comedy, you know, like a comedian.</p><p>QUEST:  Well, let's face it, the comedian is about -- could become the most precedent --</p><p>LORETTO:  I'm glad you liked my work.</p><p>QUEST:  Very much so, thank you, sir.</p><p>LORETTO:  You're welcome --</p><p>QUEST:  So to the European markets, strong data, strong data from the United   Kingdom lifted stocks in London.  The FTSE 100 climbing half of a percent, others stockpiling of no deal, in case of a no Brexit, helped bruised Britain's factory sector.</p><p>You can see the gains on the last, no losses today.  Nearly out of time in terms of   the Dow, what a day in New York, you've got the Dow that marched on to a high, look at that, up 351, 1.3 and all the other markets are up as well.  We'll have more, we'll continue, there is much more because the news never stops, neither do we.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Social media giants already under siege over privacy concerns would face stiff financial penalties and tougher legal requirements to remove abusive material under the recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry into cyber-bullying.</p><p>The inquiry into the adequacy of existing criminal laws around cyber-bullying by the Senate's legal and constitutional affairs committee was triggered late last year by the suicide of Adelaide schoolgirl Libby Bell after an alleged bullying campaign that took place in person and on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.</p><p>The Labor and crossbench-dominated committee has recommended the government \"place and maintain regulatory pressure on social media platforms to both prevent and quickly respond to cyber-bullying material on their platform, including through the use of significant financial penalties where insufficient progress is achieved\".</p><p>It also said the companies should have a legal duty of care for their users - giving people a right to seek compensation in the case of a breach - and be compelled to publish data on cyber-bullying complaints they have received and have acted on.</p><p>But DIGI, the industry body representing Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and other tech companies in Australia, resisted the push for tougher regulations, saying the current laws were adequate.</p><p>\"We understand the desire for greater transparency about the work the industry does to keep our community safe,\" DIGI managing director Nicole Buskiewicz said.</p><p>\"However, we are concerned that the Senate committee has acted against expert advice offered by the anti-bullying experts, legal organisations and police agencies who testified that the current legislative framework is sufficient to deal with cyber-bullying from a regulatory perspective.\"</p><p>Ms Buskiewicz said the industry was committed to investing in prevention of bullying and harmful behaviour on its platforms.</p><p>The findings come as Facebook weathers a global storm over its handling of users' data, with multiple investigations established across the world in response to allegations the data science firm Cambridge Analytica harvested users' personal information without permission.</p><p>The scandal has fuelled a #DeleteFacebook movement and wiped tens of billions of dollars off the social media behemoth's market value.</p><p>Law firm Maurice Blackburn said tougher regulation was needed because social media companies were not being held to account for bullying on their platforms.</p><p>\"Imposing a duty of care that has real consequences we believe can make a difference to these big tech companies playing an urgent and long overdue role in minimising bullying and inappropriate behaviour on their social media platforms,\" Maurice Blackburn employment law principal Josh Bornstein said.</p><p>Government senators disagreed with the recommendations for tougher regulation and penalties, saying social media companies were aware of the risks of cyber-bullying to their business.</p><p>Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said there was \"no silver bullet\" when it came to cyber-bullying but, \"as far as I'm concerned, all options are on the table when it comes to doing whatever we can to stamp out cyber bullying\".</p><p>He said many of the committee's concerns were already addressed by the powers of the eSafety commissioner and existing criminal laws.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The leaders of social media companies have failed to tackle the infodemic of misinformation. </p><p>He added: \"Evidence that tech companies were able to benefit from the monetisation of false information and allowed others to do so is shocking. We need robust regulation to hold these companies to account. </p><p>\"The coronavirus crisis has demonstrated that without due weight of the law, social media companies have no incentive to consider a duty of care to those who use their services.\" </p><p>Responding to the report, Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson Daisy Cooper said it was clear the Government needed to do more to \"stamp out\" misinformation online. </p><p>She added: \"To tackle the invisible algorithms that drive people to extreme content, platforms must not only have the ability to act quickly but there must be a regulator with teeth to step in when platforms are not doing enough.\" </p><p>And Labour's Jo Stevens said the report confirmed that ministers had been \"slow to act\". </p><p>The Shadow Culture Secretary said: \"It has been more than 15 months since the promised online harms legislation and the select committee shares our concerns that this long overdue legislation puts safeguarding profits of the big tech platforms before public safety.\" </p><p>A DCMS spokesperson said: \"We are developing world-leading plans to put a duty of care on online platforms towards their users and will introduce legislation as soon as possible. </p><p>\"Since the start of the pandemic, specialist government units have been working around the clock to identify and rebut false information about coronavirus. </p><p>\"We are also working closely with social media platforms to help them identify and remove incorrect claims about the virus that could endanger people's health.\"

Her father said had been 'killed by Facebook', which owns Instagram.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">75 year old David Turnbill lost his pension through an unregulated financial product prominently advertised through Google adverts. Last year TikTok live streamed a teenager's suicide.</p><p>Misinformation on the Coronavirus is rapidly spreading on social media.</p><p>One online abuse offence against a child is recorded every 16 minutes.</p><p>Before becoming an MP, I was an Engineer for 20 years. I helped build out the internet. I'm proud of my work which enabled people to better communicate and connect. But it has been clear for years that the internet requires proper regulation.</p><p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee who invented the web, said it. The NSPCC said it.</p><p>So we should be pleased that after years of kowtowing to the tech giants the Tories are making plans to regulate the internet... but I have to report it is too little, too late. It is weak, overdue and ultimately ineffective.</p><p>Social media companies will have a legal 'duty of care' which Ofcom will regulate. Good. The tech giants always had a moral duty of care in my opinion and it is wrong that families like Molly Russell's have had to go through so much heartache before that is enshrined in law. The first online suicide was ten years ago. Government should have taken action then.</p><p>But is it really taking action now This doesn't amount to tough new laws, but instead a wordy response to a bureaucratic consultation process. There is no detail on when any new laws will be passed. And instead of creating a strong new regulator they've given the responsibility to Ofcom. I like Ofcom, I used to work for them, but in the last ten years they have had the postal system, the BBC, and now the internet added to their remit. With no additional resource are they really going to be able to take strong action</p><p>And what action would that be There are hints that they will be given some enforcement powers but... I wonder when the Government will get round to it And they are clear that Ofcom won't be able to investigate or rule on individual complaints. So no help there.</p><p>Is the Government are making the same mistakes and expecting different results Many new online harms are emerging. Just a few weeks ago, smart doorbell system Ring was hacked, putting children at risk. Algorithms might force people to work all hours and facial recognition systems might be tracking you down the street. This 'response' to online harms doesn't talk about that.</p><p>Tories took power in 2010 just as the world was really getting online. By cosying up to the big tech beasts and forgetting the people they are meant to serve, Tories have put us all at risk. It's time for swift action and proper legislation - the families of those affected are counting on us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIRONL-60474673</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y89-W3M1-F021-62V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419001</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><timeReceived>3:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Trinity Mirror, Plc.

In December, he walked the red carpet, along with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, at a screening of \"The Post\" in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, Mr. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, made public their $33 million donation to a nonprofit that provides college scholarships to so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. In October, he received an award for a donation to a marriage equality campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jennifer Cast, an Amazon executive who solicited the donation from him, said at the event that they could have donated anonymously to the campaign. \"But just as critical as the money was Jeff's offer to let us publicly acknowledge their gifts,\" she said.</p><p>\"By allowing us to take their donation public,\" she added, \"the world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\"</p><p>The appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.</p><p>As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world's most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon's hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon's growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.</p><p>But while Mr. Bezos - who at 54 is the world's richest person, with a net worth of more than $100 billion - can afford virtually any luxury, obscurity is no longer among them.</p><p>Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \"big tech,\" along with Apple, Alphabet's Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.</p><p>\"People are starting to get scared of Amazon,\" said Steve Case, a co-founder of America Online, who recently started an investment fund focused on start-ups in underserved areas, with Mr. Bezos among its contributors. \"If Jeff continues to hang out in Seattle, he's going to get a lot more incoming. Even for just defense reasons, he has to now play offense.\"</p><p>Mr. Bezos' portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city's most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city's political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.</p><p>Mr. Bezos' space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.</p><p>\"He's getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums - not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\" said Margaret O'Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.</p><p>In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \"Jeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\"</p><p>But interviews with more than 30 people who know Mr. Bezos, most of whom declined to be identified to protect their relationships with him, revealed his awareness of the growing opposition to Amazon and his growing comfort with being in the public eye.</p><p>Mr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.</p><p>The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos' mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.</p><p>\"You're going to get a lot of scrutiny if you're disrupting other people's livelihoods,\" Mr. Buffett said.</p><p>Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.</p><p>But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.</p><p>Hiding in Plain Sight</p><p>Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon's chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.</p><p>But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.</p><p>Even as he was named Time magazine's person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.</p><p>There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.</p><p>A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.</p><p>But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country's most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.</p><p>For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.</p><p>Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p>It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.</p><p>By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.</p><p>\"I'm not aware of what Amazon does in the community,\" Sally Jewell, the chief executive of the retailer R.E.I. at the time, said in The Seattle Times in 2012. \"It's not a name that comes up often in the nonprofit organizations I'm involved with.\"</p><p>With investors, Mr. Bezos gave just enough of a peek at Amazon's business to win their confidence while saying as little as possible to keep competitors guessing. To this day, Amazon will not disclose exactly how many Kindles, Echoes and other devices it has sold, and for years it refused to reveal financial details about Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing business.</p><p>Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.</p><p>A Growing Spotlight</p><p>A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.</p><p>At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon's image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.</p><p>Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.</p><p>As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.</p><p>Suddenly, a company that once refused to confirm how many employees it had at its Seattle headquarters could not stop talking about how many jobs it was creating. It now has 542,000 employees.</p><p>As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.</p><p>Waves of store closings by bricks-and-mortar retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Macy's increased the volume. \"Amazon Must Be Stopped,\" read a 2014 New Republic article about the company's growing market power.</p><p>That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon's reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher's titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.</p><p>After the matter was resolved, Mr. Bezos told an interviewer that Amazon was simply negotiating hard on behalf of its customers.</p><p>\"It's very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\" he said, referring to book publishers.</p><p>Another blow to the company's public standing landed in 2015 when The New York Times published a lengthy examination of Amazon's corporate work culture, which was depicted as an unforgiving environment. \"The article doesn't describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day,\" Mr. Bezos said in an email to the company's employees after the article came out.</p><p>According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.</p><p>By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.</p><p>\"The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!\" he tweeted in December that year. \"Big tax shelter.\"</p><p>Mr. Bezos responded by offering to launch the future president of the United States into space on a Blue Origin rocket.</p><p>A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.</p><p>\"The purchase of Whole Foods was a moment when people looked up and recognized this company as a force in the economy,\" said Stacy Mitchell, a co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for local businesses, which has published a critical report on Amazon's impact on jobs and communities.</p><p>Mr. Bezos Goes to the Other Washington</p><p>People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.</p><p>He became an active user of Twitter in late 2015, posting a photo of himself wearing his lucky cowboy boots and a video clip of him standing atop a wind turbine in Texas. At an event with his brother in Los Angeles in November, as part of a long lineup of presentations by an array of business, wellness and entertainment leaders, he said his ideal job would be bartender, partly because he enjoys talking to people.</p><p>\"I pride myself on my craft cocktails,\" he said.</p><p>If there's an image that captures Mr. Bezos at the moment, it's a picture of him with his biceps bulging out of a polo shirt at a business conference in Idaho from July. \"Swole Jeff Bezos\" instantly became an internet meme, with one tweet juxtaposing shots of a doughy Mr. Bezos from the late 1990s (caption: \"I sell books\") and the brawny 2017 version (\"I sell whatever I want\").</p><p>The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.</p><p>On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.</p><p>Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post's leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper's top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \"Joy of Cooking\" on their first visit to his house.</p><p>\"It wasn't like we went to some billionaire's house and the help outnumbered the guests,\" said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper's chief information officer. \"He was trying to get the dog off the couch.\"</p><p>Mr. Bezos' more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.</p><p>Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company's advantage. In September, he masterminded the company's splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move - up to 50,000 total - and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.</p><p>In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital's stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue's row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home - two combined properties that used to be the city's Textile Museum.</p><p>Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city's movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.</p><p>\"It's a very big house,\" said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \"I hope he has a party for us in the house.\"</p><p>Sally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city's social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos' plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.</p><p>\"There's really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\" said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \"The Post.\" \"It would be like a throwback to the old days.\"</p><p>\"I think Jeff,\" she said, \"is the only person who could do that.\"</p><p>Follow Nick Wingfield and Nellie Bowles on Twitter: @nickwingfield and @NellieBowles</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Nellie Bowles from San Francisco.

The social media has been battling controversy after controversy about restricting conservative content.This is part of the findings of a new poll, conducted by McLaughlin and Associates, specifically looking at conservatives' attitude towards Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter. </p><p>The poll asked 1,000 likely voters some questions about their opinions about Big Tech.According to the poll, 76.7 percent of conservatives polled do not trust Facebook to treat all of its users equally. However, the majority of people polled also expressed a similar opinion, with 63.4 percent of those polled saying they did not trust Facebook to treat all of its users equally.Facebook recently released a report of its audit, conducted by the former director of the ACLU, Laura Murphy. In the audit, Facebook announced that it was looking to remove even more content based on ideology.Google did not fare well with conservative opinion either. 62.9 percent of conservatives did not trust the search engine platform to treat users equally. Leaked documents from Google, published by Project Veritas, showed employees labeling conservative figures like Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro 'nazis.' However, almost half of those polled all together did not trust Google either. 47.9 percent agreed that Google did not treat its users equally.YouTube, Google's sister company, appeared to have suffered from its past decisions. 60.6 percent of conservatives polled did not trust YouTube to treat its users equally. While YouTube de-monetizes and deletes videos from conservative channels like Steven Crowder and PragerU, the video platform is losing its users trust. This does not just apply to conservatives, however. 48.7 percent of those polled did not trust YouTube.Twitter was given criticism, too. 63.2 percent of conservatives polled did not trust Twitter to treat its users equally. The social media site has targeted conservative content as well as political beliefs it does not agree with, such as people who believe that transgender women are still men.Many conservatives, as well as others polled, said they are interested in seeing tech monopolies split up. 38.8 percent agreed that they would like to see Facebook, Google, and Amazon regulated and split up into smaller companies. Conservatives feared that Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter had too much control over their users. 48.3 percent of them answered that Big Tech had 'too much control over what information people see.' Another 40.8 percent stated that these companies had 'too much personal information about us.'Methodology:This survey of 1,000 likely general election voters nationwide was conducted on June 18-24, 2019.All interviews were conducted online; survey invitations were distributed randomly within predetermined geographic units. These units were structured to correlate with actual voter turnout in a nationwide general election.This poll of 1,000 likely general election voters has an accuracy of +/- 3.1% at a 95% confidence interval. The accuracy of the responses from the 359 self-described conservatives is +/- 5.2% at a 95% confidence interval. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NBST107778156267763767125176900212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHT-G421-JCMN-Y0XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The social media has been battling controversy after controversy about restricting conservative content.This is part of the findings of a new poll, conducted by McLaughlin and Associates, specifically looking at conservatives' attitude towards Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter. </p><p>The poll asked 1,000 likely voters some questions about their opinions about Big Tech.According to the poll, 76.7 percent of conservatives polled do not trust Facebook to treat all of its users equally. However, the majority of people polled also expressed a similar opinion, with 63.4 percent of those polled saying they did not trust Facebook to treat all of its users equally.Facebook recently released a report of its audit, conducted by the former director of the ACLU, Laura Murphy. In the audit, Facebook announced that it was looking to remove even more content based on ideology.Google did not fare well with conservative opinion either. 62.9 percent of conservatives did not trust the search engine platform to treat users equally. Leaked documents from Google, published by Project Veritas, showed employees labeling conservative figures like Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro 'nazis.' However, almost half of those polled all together did not trust Google either. 47.9 percent agreed that Google did not treat its users equally.YouTube, Google's sister company, appeared to have suffered from its past decisions. 60.6 percent of conservatives polled did not trust YouTube to treat its users equally. While YouTube de-monetizes and deletes videos from conservative channels like Steven Crowder and PragerU, the video platform is losing its users trust. This does not just apply to conservatives, however. 48.7 percent of those polled did not trust YouTube.Twitter was given criticism, too. 63.2 percent of conservatives polled did not trust Twitter to treat its users equally. The social media site has targeted conservative content as well as political beliefs it does not agree with, such as people who believe that transgender women are still men.Many conservatives, as well as others polled, said they are interested in seeing tech monopolies split up. 38.8 percent agreed that they would like to see Facebook, Google, and Amazon regulated and split up into smaller companies. Conservatives feared that Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter had too much control over their users. 48.3 percent of them answered that Big Tech had 'too much control over what information people see.' Another 40.8 percent stated that these companies had 'too much personal information about us.'Methodology:This survey of 1,000 likely general election voters nationwide was conducted on June 18-24, 2019.All interviews were conducted online; survey invitations were distributed randomly within predetermined geographic units. These units were structured to correlate with actual voter turnout in a nationwide general election.This poll of 1,000 likely general election voters has an accuracy of +/- 3.1% at a 95% confidence interval. The accuracy of the responses from the 359 self-described conservatives is +/- 5.2% at a 95% confidence interval. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-NBST107778156267763767125176900212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHT-FW21-JB4V-81WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The only segment that the MRC highlighted to promote the chat was about a segment in which the two bashed Facebook.Corinne Weaver wrote in a Nov. 13 NewsBusters post[3]:Donald Trump Jr. warned of the large liberal influence that Big Tech companies such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have on elections in an exclusive interview with Media Research Center president and founder, L. Brent Bozell.Trump Jr. hammered Big Tech. He said that the companiesy should be 'reined in' before 2020 becomes a 'dry run for suppression' of free speech on social media platforms. Bozell said, 'When you have got a social media industry world' that is 'shutting down the pro-life movement,' and 'the NRA and the pro-gun movement, systematically, that is a real threat.' Trump Jr. agreed, and added that Silicon Valley's 'leftist' problem was the real issue behind the tech companies.'In the case of Mark Zuckerberg,' explained Bozell, the Facebook CEO believed that 'we have to be the market of free ideas. But at a secondary level, they could care less about what happens to our company.' Trump Jr. asserted, 'I don't think Mark Zuckerberg is a conservative ... but I don't believe he's got full control of that ship.' He went on to say that 'tens of thousands of employees' all believe the Silicon Valley 'leftist' think.He's not alone in that view. Facebook engineer Brian Amerige said that tech employees 'attack anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.'Weaver didn't mention that Amerige has said that Republicans and conservatives interpreted his message all wrong, as Wired reported[4]:Amerige says his biggest fear and annoyance was the fact that his comments 'were going to be used as a weapon for legislating or regulating the company.\" \"I left the company because I think this is such an important issue, and they're headed in the wrong direction,\" he says, \"but I would defend Facebook's right to screw this up until the very end.\" Weaver also omitted one crucial fact from her post: The Trump Jr.-Bozell chat took place without issue on Facebook Live. Once more, the MRC's failing narrative[5] that Facebook discriminates against conservatives has been undercut.

The only segment that the MRC highlighted to promote the chat was about a segment in which the two bashed Facebook.Corinne Weaver wrote in a Nov. 13 NewsBusters post[3]:Donald Trump Jr. warned of the large liberal influence that Big Tech companies such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have on elections in an exclusive interview with Media Research Center president and founder, L. Brent Bozell.Trump Jr. hammered Big Tech. He said that the companiesy should be 'reined in' before 2020 becomes a 'dry run for suppression' of free speech on social media platforms. Bozell said, 'When you have got a social media industry world' that is 'shutting down the pro-life movement,' and 'the NRA and the pro-gun movement, systematically, that is a real threat.' Trump Jr. agreed, and added that Silicon Valley's 'leftist' problem was the real issue behind the tech companies.'In the case of Mark Zuckerberg,' explained Bozell, the Facebook CEO believed that 'we have to be the market of free ideas. But at a secondary level, they could care less about what happens to our company.' Trump Jr. asserted, 'I don't think Mark Zuckerberg is a conservative ... but I don't believe he's got full control of that ship.' He went on to say that 'tens of thousands of employees' all believe the Silicon Valley 'leftist' think.He's not alone in that view. Facebook engineer Brian Amerige said that tech employees 'attack anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.'Weaver didn't mention that Amerige has said that Republicans and conservatives interpreted his message all wrong, as Wired reported[4]:Amerige says his biggest fear and annoyance was the fact that his comments 'were going to be used as a weapon for legislating or regulating the company.\" \"I left the company because I think this is such an important issue, and they're headed in the wrong direction,\" he says, \"but I would defend Facebook's right to screw this up until the very end.\" Weaver also omitted one crucial fact from her post: The Trump Jr.-Bozell chat took place without issue on Facebook Live. Once more, the MRC's failing narrative[5] that Facebook discriminates against conservatives has been undercut.

He then stated: But to give you an idea of where things stand right now with the conservative movement -- we just came out with poll results[1] that show that two-thirds of self-identified conservatives think that these social media companies are censoring conservatives. And almost one-third,32%, have either left the platform of Facebook or are considering doing so. Asman agreed and asked Gainor about Facebook's own employees starting to see an issue. He replied, 'The first step ofany problem is identifying that you have a problem.' Gainor explained: These companies are starting to admit that. They're working with the conservative movement. We've got a coalition of 40 conservative groups trying to stop online censorship, and the idea that they are working with us is a good step. But it's only one step. Gainor ended his appearance by stating, 'What we're looking for ultimately is what the president said: We want fairness. We don't want better treatment, but we don't want worse.'
