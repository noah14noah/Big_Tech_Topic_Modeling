By any reasonable standard in corporate America, Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Facebook, the company he founded with his friends in a Harvard University dorm room in 2004, is under an electron-microscope. And for good reason.</p><p>If Zuckerberg weren't Facebook's visionary founder, its board of directors would likely have removed him from at least one of his posts for his leadership stumbles and bumbles and the reputational damage that has occurred under his watch, especially over the past two years. Very few CEOs would or could survive such tumult.</p><p>Of late, Facebook has spent more time in the news for its flaws and flops than its innovation and influence. Those disasters reached a crisis level in the last two weeks as exposes revealed Facebook refuting, redirecting and dismissing its problems, with the help of a questionable, outside public relations team.</p><p>At the center of this whirlwind of bad press and chaos is its embattled, puckish CEO. As one of the big tech CEOs who make up the FANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), Zuckerberg is surely the most susceptible, not only because of Facebook's current plight, but because his leadership qualities might not be up to task of satisfying the long list of disgruntled stakeholders.</p><p>Let's lay credit where it is due. Amazon sells things. Netflix distributes things. Google compiles things. But Facebook makes things, as intangible as they may be. That was Zuckerberg's genius. Facebook was the champion of the social media space. It redefined how we connect. It allowed personal expression at scales never imagined. It was disruptive before we knew what disruptive was. Moving forward, it used its early girth to grow and its cash to acquire.</p><p>Make no mistake, Facebook is still pertinent. It's not stale. It's not insolvent. It's not incorrigible. It's not insoluble. Facebook is a company with good bones. It has all the resources to be beyond just relevant.</p><p>Facebook enjoyed a splashy birth, then strutted through a troubled adolescence (it is, after all, just 14 years old, the archetypical age transformation coming of age). The question is whether or not the right person is in place to usher it into mature adulthood. Maybe it's time for Facebook to grow up.</p><p>Zuckerberg isn't the first tech CEO to be hobbled by his own growing pains. His skills as a leader have been in question from the beginning, as he was more nerd than chieftain, more tech zealot than inspirational Fortune 500 leader. Today those management qualities - well suited for a youthful, dare it be said, juvenile, firm - have drawn the attention of a restive Congress, not to mention regulators in the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p><p>From a leadership perspective, Zuckerberg is a classic example of when your personality and qualities shift from working to your advantage to being a liability. Everything Zuckerberg needed to be successful, his gawky sociability and monomaniacal pursuits of profit and technology, were benefits for a fledgling social media company rising to worldwide muscle. But now those very same qualities prove to be burdens. As Corinthians 1:13 states in its lamentation of aging: \"For now we see in a mirror darkly, but then face to face.\" Time for some mirror gazing?</p><p>Yet, Zuckerberg isn't like Uber's former CEO and founder Travis Kalanick or Tesla's CEO and cofounder Elon Musk, both of whom hurt their companies as much as themselves due to their lack of impulse control, a very childish tendency. Zuckerberg is a measured person. He may be responsible for business embarrassments, but he's not a temperamental teen.</p><p>In the past, I've written about the CEO lifecycle as a way to explain the ripening of corporate leadership. A new executive gets to know a company, builds trust and relationships, and establishes a faithful following first. Then the CEO is articulating a strategy and attaining consensus. The company is responding thereafter to the leader's management. Then, so soon, the CEO is taking the steps to put into place a logical succession and planning a smooth exit strategy.</p><p>Under this leadership progression, a strong CEO can transform so much of the operation that at some point he or she is no longer needed. Gifted leaders alter the workplace and culture so much that their talents aren't compulsory. By being good at what they do, they create the need and opportunity for their own exits.</p><p>Obviously, this five-year calculation must be extended for the founder of a company, especially one like Zuckerberg who conjured the business while an undergrad and college dropout, and then spearheaded its growth to a monolithic global force.</p><p>Admittedly, much of the growth came after Zuckerberg acknowledged his weakness as a leader - a very adult thing to do - and asked chief operating office Sheryl Sandberg to come in and formalize operations and rebuild the company's business model with advertising. It was an early sign that Zuckerberg could not only learn from similar arrangements in other tech companies (Google), but also that his ego could withstand the appointment of a management minder.</p><p>Facebook's problems today, however, reflect the limits of Zuckerberg's continued leadership as both CEO and chairman. Because he owns 60 percent of the shares in the company, his influence is outsized, and the recent battles over privacy concerns, Russian influence peddling, customer boycotts and unscrupulous PR campaigns have reflected this troubling fact. Add to that the exits of high-profile executives, and Facebook looks like a fiefdom with a petulant progeny on the throne.</p><p>What makes the potential for leadership change more likely now than ever is that Facebook has lost a significant share of its value in the last year, thanks largely to the wave of scandals and tech repositioning. Is it entirely Zuckerberg's fault? No. Broader forces are at play here. Markets are no longer as eager about the FANG companies as they were a year ago due to the calls for regulation, stunted earning potential, a lack of capital assets and the shrinking economy.</p><p>Given this environment, Zuckerberg must face up to the need for succession planning at Facebook. He must understand that the patriarchy (bro-archy) that served so well needs to be seamlessly acceded to another. One of the things that Facebook cannot afford to have happen is an internal rupture, with a loss of employee morale coupled with an exodus of the talent that has accounted for breakthrough growth and innovation. The brain-children must remain at home.</p><p>Zuckerberg doesn't need to be demoted like Musk. Instead, he needs to look to succession. A successful chief executive should be looking for ways to develop the competencies of those around him and remake Facebook's culture into a high-performing, employee-supported operation again. For Zuckerberg, the choice may be stepping down as chairman to allow the board to play its critical oversight role and help steer the company through the current morass. As painful as it might be, all good parents step aside.</p><p>As hard as it is to fathom, the long-term viability of Facebook may depend on Zuckerberg stepping back and sharing leadership with a stronger, more empowered executive team. That is never an easy thing to do. It involves admitting that it's time to go, that growing up might not include you. Zuckerberg had the audacity and foresight to create Facebook. The question now is whether he has the same to ensure its future.</p><p>Facebook, it's time to grow up.</p><p>James R. Bailey is a professor of Leadership at the George Washington University School of Business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-565541154</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 565541154</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYW-4X21-JCBJ-K1W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1285\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newsweek Media Group</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 13, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chairpersons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook (Website)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Management</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Management dynamics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Compiled by James Thomson and Tony Boyd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QWhat policies/reforms should the government prioritise to stimulate growth?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Marnie Baker, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank: Red tape and regulation mean that businesses are forced to hire people that cost them money, rather than make them money, which means less to invest in growing their businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David Attenborough, Tabcorp: Government needs to focus on encouraging businesses to invest and grow through tax reform and effective deregulation. The aim should be to reduce bureaucracy, encourage research and development, and support investment in skills and training.</p><p>Catherine Tanna, EnergyAustralia: There's a strong argument that the experience of the past few years in energy shows that stable policy matters more than reforming policy. In Australia, and internationally, we're seeing more subjective decision-making and more power concentrated in the hands of politicians, and a few politicians at that.</p><p>Pat Regan, QBE: I would like to see more governments around the world doing more on the fiscal side, particularly in parts of the economy where we need to be creating jobs and opportunities for young people. That includes here in Australia where, for example, I think we have a real opportunity to develop an innovation and technology hub that with the right investment and incentives could eventually compete with places like Silicon Valley or Tel Aviv.</p><p>Alison Watkins, Coca-Cola Amatil: We do need to face the reality that Australia's business tax rates are high compared to the OECD average and most trading partners. Our 30 per cent rate was set in 2006 and is out of step with an Asia-Pacific average of 21 per cent. It's made worse by the current two-tier system which creates a tax cliff between small and large businesses. We need to lower the rate progressively to 25 per cent for all companies.</p><p>Andy Penn, Telstra: There is a lot we need to get right in the policy space and broadly the focus has to be on policies that are pro-investment, pro-innovation and pro-customer. Pro-investment, because business needs an incentive to invest, including a reasonable return on that investment. That is not always the case, including in the telco sector. Pro-innovation, because Australia's future will be built on innovation. And pro-customer and particularly pro-inclusion because too many people, particularly those living in regional areas or on low incomes, are missing out on the opportunities of the digital age.</p><p>Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz, Mirvac: The recent announcement by the federal government to bring forward spending on infrastructure projects around the country is a good step to help boost the economy and transform our rapidly growing cities. Of course, most infrastructure is delivered by state governments, so greater co-operation between all levels of government to plan and prioritise our cities and then agree a commitment to funding is welcome.</p><p>Peter Coleman, Woodside: An investment allowance has been used successfully in the past to enhance economic growth and is worth considering now. In industrial relations, we are keen to see life-of-project agreements for greenfields projects that improve the chances of a project finishing on schedule and on budget. That, in turn, improves the chances of the investment being made in the first place.</p><p>Peter Harmer, IAG: The future of work. The changing nature of work is a broad economic and social phenomenon affecting governments, companies and communities. The conversation needs to shift from robots taking jobs, to how we can ensure Australians have the right skills for the future, as well as the appropriate level of protections and entitlements.</p><p>Jean-Sebastien Jacques, Rio Tinto: Clearly, energy policy needs to be resolved so that Australia, as an energy-rich country, has the affordable, secure and flexible supply it needs. We have gone from having some of the most competitively priced energy to nearly the most expensive in the developed world.</p><p>Shemara Wikramanayake, Macquarie Group: Governments face a variety of challenges around the world and stimulating growth is common to most. If the government were minded to use fiscal stimulus, infrastructure investment has historically driven growth and job creation. We would also be supportive of the government continuing to work with the Productivity Commission on a number of micro-economic reform measures.</p><p>Matt Comyn, Commonwealth Bank: Australia needs income growth to stimulate the economy. We saw some positive impact from the government's one-off tax refunds earlier this year, and there may be an opportunity to bring forward planned future tax cuts to help increase disposable income for households on a persistent basis. There are also opportunities to bring forward infrastructure investment and drive structural reform aimed at driving productivity - areas that both federal and state governments are working on. The other big opportunity is taking steps to further encourage small and medium businesses to invest, innovate and grow.</p><p>QWhat big opportunity did Australia fail to seize in the past decade?</p><p>Andrew Bassat, Seek: Comparing 10 years ago to now, the really big businesses on the ASX are still relatively similar. When you look at the China or US exchanges, they have seen the emergence of really big tech businesses which are huge employers and on the right side of long-term structural trends. Hopefully, it is not too late for Australia to seed the next generation of high-growth global tech businesses.</p><p>Richard White, WiseTech Global: Making Australia a global technology hub. The war for talent is our ever-present battleground and we urgently need to focus on technology occupations to prepare workforces for the new tech-enabled and tech-dominated economies. We need people coming out of high school and university to have much higher levels of ambition in terms of education.</p><p>Richard Vincent, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries: As a country I think we failed to get our innovation policy settings right. Our innovation success stories are few and far between. I've seen statistics that show that our spending on R&amp;D has fallen since the GFC to below 1 per cent of GDP. At the same time, the likes of the US, Singapore, Korea, Germany and Israel range between 2 per cent and 4 per cent of GDP.</p><p>Mark Steinert, Stockland: To fully commercialise some of the great innovation which our universities, CSIRO and business have created.</p><p>Peter Coleman, Woodside: With the benefit of hindsight, we should have put a market-based price on carbon a decade ago. We all hold some responsibility for this failure - and that includes industry, as well as political parties from right across the Parliament.</p><p>Elizabeth Gaines, Fortescue Metals Group: Australia has the potential to be a big player in the new and renewable energy space, and a clear and consistent national policy framework - which we have lacked over the last decade - is an important foundation. Our focus at Fortescue is on practical initiatives to reduce our emissions and cost of energy. We are working with CSIRO to explore opportunities with hydrogen and recently announced the Chichester Solar Gas Project, which will see up to 100 per cent of daytime stationary energy requirements at our Chichester Hub iron ore operations powered by renewable energy.</p><p>Rob Wheals, APA Group: Australia's inability to reach a bi-partisan agreement on a national energy and climate policy is the most profound missed opportunity in the last 10 years.</p><p>Alan Joyce, Qantas: Big reform is hard, but I worry that quite a few ideas wind up in the \"too hard\" basket. Things like significant tax and IR changes, or energy policy. The last major tax reform in Australia was the GST. Our economy has changed a lot since then and yet the system is largely the same.</p><p>Matt Comyn, Commonwealth Bank: I think we have missed an opportunity to drive some of the big, difficult structural reforms that will really set the country up well for the decades ahead. When I compare the reform agenda of the past decade to the 80s or 90s or early 2000s, structural reform feels like it has been harder for a range of reasons. Given the pace of change, a broader reform agenda will be required in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78bsk1z9n0g1f6rxa7la</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPC-YJG1-JD34-V284-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Specifically, I argued that big tech continues to undermine pillars of freedom including free speech, free elections, and personal privacy. Unfortunately, this trend does not seem to be slowing down. This month, news emerged that Google has fired yet another employee[2] who, by creating a browser notification for her colleagues, reminded them of their right to organize and negotiate collectively with management. A few weeks before that, Google fired four employees[3] who appear to have been actively organizing Google labor. </p><p>Interestingly, in both cases, Google has cited security concerns for its decisions. Let me be blunt: This is bad for our democracy and this trend must change. Technology is not above the law and tech labor is still labor. We should stop further encroachments on our democratic values before they disappear from American society completely. They are worth protecting! Collective bargaining is an inherently democratic process. When employees organize and choose a representative based on a majority vote to negotiate with management, they realize our most fundamental democratic values in the workplace. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or the Wagner Act) explicitly grants employees the right to collectively bargain and join trade unions in the United States. Enacted in 1935, it applies to most private company employees and establishes procedures to select a labor organization to represent employees in collective bargaining. It also regulates the tactics each side may employ, including prohibitions against retaliation on the part of management against employees who seek to organize their colleagues. The right for employees to organize is not just an abstract expression of representative democracy; it also leads to inclusive negotiation-based and consensus-building conflict resolution methods. It allows employees to self-govern and re-create many democratic processes at a local level. When empowered by a collective bargaining unit, employees can demand not just pay, benefits, or working conditions but also \u2014 equally important, but more often forgotten \u2014 whistleblower protections, proper training, mentoring and other career opportunities, fair performance rating, and more. In other words, collective bargaining is a process that gives unionized employees a seat at the bargaining table. It holds employers accountable. And in the United States, the right to organize is rooted not just in one law passed in the mid-20th Century, but in the many Constitutionally and statutorily protected rights of association, speech, and petition, each of which is critical to a thriving democracy. Thus, exercising a right to organize is a basic civil right. Association: At its core, a union is an association of individual employees to address workplace issues. The First Amendment right of association protects employees' ability to meet with co-workers to discuss issues they care about. And in the case of Google, employees have recently been raising[4] numerous public policy related issues - from the handling of sexual harassment[5] and treatment of contract employees to working with the Department of Defense, federal border agencies[6], and the Chinese government. Speech: While the First Amendment does not protect private sector employees from efforts by their private employers to censor speech, the NLRA and other federal and state statutes ensure the right of employees to join a union and engage in collective bargaining to protect basic free speech. This allows union members to participate meaningfully in workplace debates without fear of retaliation, which is critical to a functioning democratic society. Petition: Finally, unions defend the First Amendment right to petition the government rights of their members. Unions often lobby the government and file legal actions in court to protect the rights of individual members. Thus, unions give employees the opportunity to exercise the critical right of petition when individual employees would lack the resources to on their own. Outside of the United States, which has comparatively weak labor protections, Google's recent retaliatory actions would be even more legally dubious. In fact, the right to organize free of employer interference is often seen as a fundamental human right, not just a constitutional or civil one. For example, even though the United States has not ratified U.N. Convention No. 87 on the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize or U.N. Convention No. 98 on the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining, most countries, including most democracies, respect the employees' right to unionize and have ratified these documents. Global companies like Google have a larger social responsibility to protect human rights, and especially the human rights of their global workforce. Finally, collective bargaining is beneficial to the economy and to society at large. It empowers employees to dream bigger in creating a meaningful career and a better world. It frees employees from their individual, often oppressive immediate circumstances. By participating in a dialogue with management, employees collaboratively engage with their employer to improve internal processes, often leading to higher employee retention. And unionized employees often address larger societal issues, beyond just wages and working conditions, that we all care about. In the end, to say that Google's reaction to employee organizing is immature, especially in hiding behind the hot-button buzzword of 'security' after the fact, is an understatement. It encroaches on our democratic values, violates human rights, and jeopardizes our economic prosperity. A global company like Google can and must use its resources to protect our democratic values, safeguard human rights, and facilitate economic well-being for everyone. Isn't that what leaders do? Isn't that what changing the world with technology is all about? Olga V.

The British government is cracking down on tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Twitter with new tax rules. What is your opinion on how these corporations should pay tax?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. A second businessman has launched a court case against Google citing the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 from the search engine. Do you think those with a criminal past have the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 in an age of social media and tech?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. One of the two bidders for the National Broadband Plan contract has dropped out, stalling the progress. How do you think this lack of broadband affects small businesses based around Ireland?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">4. Educational virtual reality (VR) is a fast-rising technology in Ireland \u2013 how soon do you think the technology will become an everyday item, if ever?</p><p>5. What do you think can be done about the gender gap in the technology industry?</p><p>6. Name one app you couldn\u2019t live without.</p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_413204\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"138\"] Pamela Newenham founder, GirlCrew[/caption]</p><p>1. I think companies should pay tax in the country in which they were founded, similar to the US system where worldwide incomes are taxed.</p><p>2. The nature of the crime should determine whether a person has the right to be forgotten or not. People who commit minor crimes should be afforded the right.</p><p>3. Tasks such as maintaining an online presence and promoting your business through social media are faster with broadband. Time is money, so broadband is needed.</p><p>4. VR headsets need to become cheaper and graphics need to improve before they are mainstream in schools. I think this will take a few years to happen.</p><p>5. Make Stem subjects more interesting for schoolchildren through the adoption of more practical elements and hands-on projects, such as how to build a computer.</p><p>6. Slack. We communicate on it all day, and it is especially handy for keeping up to date with everything abroad. It is also easier than email.</p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_413205\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"143\"] Justin Lawless chief executive officer, Intact Software[/caption]</p><p>1. Tax should be applicable in the country where the sale takes place. IP charges and management fees could be deducted, but not to the extent where sensible business doesn\u2019t occur.</p><p>2. In a modern age, it should be incorporated into the narrative and sentencing, and particular crimes come without the right to be forgotten \u2013 if the legal system was effective and unbiased, that is.</p><p>3. A lack of broadband not only affects existing small businesses, but there is also an unimaginable opportunity cost where start-ups just don\u2019t happen. The internet levels the playing field for all.</p><p>4. The tech enthusiast part of me would love to see it next year; the optimist part says five years; the realist part says 15 years. While tech giants fight it out for classroom eyeballs, it will remain widespread cost-prohibitive.</p><p>5. I think there are three things \u2013 introduce technology at an earlier age in education, celebrate the achievements of women in technology to date, and kill the bro culture that often exists and remove pay gaps.</p><p>6. My photo app for when I\u2019m travelling and missing family.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_413206\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"129\"] Mark Ganly chief executive, Contego Sports Limited[/caption]</p><p>1. The proposed digital services tax could make our 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate less attractive, which has been very successful in attracting these companies to Ireland. The rates are competitive and should be paid here.</p><p>2. I think it is very much dependent on the crime committed \u2013 did they plead guilty and could they now pose a danger to the public?</p><p>3. This is having a massive effect on operating small businesses in rural Ireland and effective broadband is a minimal requirement for any business. People should have equal opportunities to live and work in their rural communities and not be forced into large urban areas.</p><p>4. I think this could occur very quickly, as the benefits for students are very exciting. VR can bring learning to life and give the student a connection to the subject, making it easier to understand and retain the information.</p><p>5. There are a lot of practical options, such as transparency around pay. I think to be at their most competitive, companies need to create a culture of building diverse, dynamic teams.</p><p>6. Twitter. It allows me to communicate with customers, follow industry trends and researchers, and get sports updates.</p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_413207\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"115\"] Dima Kfouri founder, Outfitable[/caption]</p><p>1. I think tech giants can afford to pay their fair share of taxation, but I wonder how smaller start-ups will fare under those same rules and regulations, as they desperately need every bit of profitability at the early stage.</p><p>2. I\u2019m all for controlling the use of individual information, but there is a lot of potential for the dishonest application of this law. Since it\u2019s an ever-evolving law, I think it could be re-evaluated to be more nuanced and take into account the practical application of it. I\u2019d be concerned, for example, if public officials can request their pasts to be delisted online. It\u2019s in the public\u2019s interest to know.</p><p>3. It means small businesses naturally have to be urban-based, concentrated into pockets of areas with broadband. Access to talent, remote work flexibility, affordable office rent or housing, and public transportation would greatly improve if businesses could access the entire country and spread out more.</p><p>4. It will become an everyday item as soon as costs decrease and better content is created, which is just a matter of time. It will revolutionise how people learn experientially, especially with real-world simulations, catering to different learning styles, and allowing for better retention of information.</p><p>5. It\u2019s important to be aware of biases and cultural expectations. What helps is being conscious about prioritising diversity in all aspects of business operation, from style of leadership to work/life balance, from family leave policies to flexible office hours. It makes business sense to find \u2018diverse\u2019 ways to ensure productivity and efficiency. Then more role models would positively impact the gender gap in technology education/enrolment.</p><p>6. Between my bank\u2019s app and Revolut, I can handle all my regular banking needs on the go, even when travelling. I can\u2019t remember the last time I visited the bank.</p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_413208\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"106\"] Eamonn Keller chief executive, Avitor[/caption]</p><p>1. Corporations should pay tax on their profits in the territory where they operate, but at the proper nominal rates.</p><p>2. No, but it depends on the severity and quantity of the offence.</p><p>3. Lack of adequate broadband puts Irish businesses on an unlevel playing field, which has a detrimental effect on rural Ireland. These companies are also penalised by exorbitant charges for an inadequate service. I believe remote working is central to the future of the Irish economy.</p><p>4. The technology to be mainstream exists at the right price point. We need the government to invest in this to benefit schools and colleges. This should happen within the next five years.</p><p>5. From the grassroots up, we need more done to empower girls to choose tech careers paths: for example, championing successful women in tech.</p><p>6. Carzone.</p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_413209\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"139\"] Eddie Carty chief executive, Captiva POS[/caption]</p><p>1. Britain looks like it will introduce tax on revenues or \u2018royalties\u2019 at about 5 per cent in originating revenue countries, which makes sense to me. We as a country benefit greatly from big tech employment, but the Irish government seems to be fighting a losing battle as changes will loosen our grip on big tech FDI. There is a general sense that the government systems are outdated and not progressive with regards to indigenous companies. If SMEs\u2019 collective energy and ideas were allowed more space to grow, it would benefit employment and the commercial sector hugely.</p><p>2. This is a very difficult area because I believe we all have a right to privacy. In a case that goes up against simply \u2018delisting\u2019, [requesting to be delisted from] Google\u2019s search results is short-sighted and pointless. Google is a big part of Ireland and Britain\u2019s results but we can search other platforms including social, with all manner of results.</p><p>3. Broadband is just as important as water to the modern age. It doesn\u2019t matter if somebody is selling hats or cow food, their growth in both creativity and turnover will be greatly affected without proper access to broadband. As my Da would say, \u201cYou might as well be throwing stones at your coat\u201d without it.</p><p>4. The educational system in Ireland has been deeply flawed for years. Like a lot of countries, its focus is on a mainstream, one-core structure and entrepreneurs often aren\u2019t challenged in this environment. Ireland has a proven record of entrepreneurship and we could foster this right through the education system. With the recent introduction of technology and practices including iPads and extra teaching including SNAs, it shows they are ready for change. With the wind behind VR and software companies engaging, early adoption will bring VR into mainstream life.</p><p>5. There are plenty of studies that show a divergence of sexes in post-primary with regards to technology. We need more amazing strong women in the technology sector. If we can foster and encourage from primary school up, it will make a big difference.</p><p>6.

However, it demanded a warrant for the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office \u2013 the body responsible for protecting British citizens\u2019 data \u2013 to do the same.</p><p>  In the face of multinational behemoths such as Facebook, which made $40bn in revenue in 2017, individual governments have found themselves to be almost powerless. Facebook has more than two billion users, and is free to access. As the saying goes, \u201cIf you are not paying for it, you\u2019re not the customer; you\u2019re the product being sold.\u201d For all its spiel about \u201cconnecting the world\u201d, Facebook is an advertising business, and it has prospered by offering to target users by age, location, interests and other variables.</p><p>  The huge volumes of information that can be harvested from \u201clikes\u201d and browsing habits \u2013 and which Facebook supplements by purchasing consumer data such as credit reports \u2013 have disturbing implications. In November, Facebook agreed to turn off \u201cmulticultural affinity segments\u201d: in other words, the ability to target by presumed race and ethnicity. It only did this after journalists at ProPublica revealed they had bought housing adverts \u201cbut asked that they not be shown to certain categories of users, such as African Americans, mothers of high school kids, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews, expats from Argentina and Spanish speakers\u201d.</p><p>  It is not hard to see how similar targeting could have an effect on political discourse. When inflammatory adverts appear on billboards, in newspapers and on mainstream television channels, there is at least a chance for the public to see them, and to complain. Online, such material may pass unnoticed outside the target group. Facebook has shown it cannot be trusted, and should ban political advertising.</p><p>  The actions of Cambridge Analytica, as revealed by the\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Observer</emphasis>\u00a0and Channel 4 News, are equally troublesome in their implications for democracy. The company contracted an academic to produce a personality test, and then harvested the information not only of those who took the test, but their friends. This was not a violation of Facebook\u2019s terms of service at the time (similar methods were employed by the Obama campaign in 2012) and some of the more lurid reporting is overblown. A \u201cdata war machine\u201d built by Cambridge Analytica is not responsible for the election of Donald Trump, or the Brexit vote. In fact, when filmed by Channel 4\u2019s undercover reporters, the firm\u2019s chief executive, Alexander Nix, claimed its methods for influencing elections were often old-fashioned and low-tech: honeytraps and framing opponents for corruption. If the company folds, it should blame its own hyped-up sales pitch.</p><p>  The true scandal of the story is that our data is extraordinarily valuable \u2013 it has been called \u201cthe new oil\u201d \u2013 and yet the trade in data is often invisible and barely regulated. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is poorly funded and overly cautious in pursuing offenders. It should be given more money, and made to answer directly to parliament \u2013 as the National Audit Office does \u2013 rather than Whitehall.</p><p>  It is dismaying to note that one of the few organisations with the clout and political will to stand up to the big tech companies is the European Union, which is bringing in tough new data regulations (and large fines to enforce them) in May. Britain will follow these regulations post-Brexit, but it will be poorly placed to contribute to any new, pan-European actions against the misuse of personal data. Our information is precious, and politicians are failing to protect it.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXP-MCF1-JCF0-N00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New Statesman Ltd.

In another, he dismissed criticism that by pushing the change, he was doing the bidding for companies like Verizon, his former employer. He joked that his nightmare scenario would be refereeing a dispute between Verizonand Sinclair Broadcasting, another company he has been accused of helping with his policies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''How do you choose,'' he said, ''between a longtime love and a newfound crush?''</p><p>  The agency was expected to vote on Thursday to dismantle the so-called net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for higher quality delivery to consumers. It would also dial back the stance established during the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>that broadband should be regulated like a utility. The three Republican commissioners, including Mr. Pai, have said they will vote for the proposal, outnumbering the two Democratic commissioners.</p><p>  Passing the plan would be the biggest victory in Mr. Pai's eventful 11-month tenure as the head of the F.C.C. Under his leadership, the agency has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers.</p><p>  All of this activity has made Mr. Pai, 44, a former lawyer for Verizonand a longtime government bureaucrat, the target of many angry protests. In recent days, government officials -- including 18 state attorneys generals and dozens of Democratic members of Congress -- have asked the F.C.C. to delay the vote. On Wednesday, the attorneys general said that many of the 23 million public comments that had been filed to the agency about net neutrality appeared to be fraudulent. Mr. Pai has ignored the delay requests.</p><p>  But Mr. Pai's changes have also made him a pivotal official in the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>rush to shed regulations. The effects of his decisions have rippled across the industries Mr. Pai oversees. The looser rules on media ownership, for example, has enabled Sinclair Broadcasting's $3.9 billion bid for Tribune.</p><p>  ''Ajit Pai has the potential to be one of most consequential commissioners in the agency's history,'' said Gus Hurwitz, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law, who is an expert in telecom policy and who supports Mr. Pai's proposal.</p><p>  Even Mr. Pai's detractors acknowledge that Mr. Pai has been efficient at moving his agenda. Mark Cooper, a staff member of Consumer Federation of America, said Mr. Pai has far outpaced his recent predecessors, even if Mr. Cooper does not agree with those efforts.</p><p>  ''In every way,'' Mr. Cooper said, ''his decisions are bad for consumers and good for big corporations.''</p><p>  Mr. Pai declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a statement, the F.C.C. said that he ''has been focused on making the agency more transparent, closing the digital divide, and updating the Commission's rules to reflect the modern communications marketplace.''</p><p>  The agency added that ''the F.C.C. has modernized its rules across a wide range of areas to encourage more competition and innovation.''</p><p>  Mr. Pai's deregulatory fervor began well before the presidential election and his nomination by President Trump.</p><p>  The child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, Mr. Pai was lauded by Republicans and Democrats when he was appointed in 2011 by President Obama to the F.C.C. Lawmakers and public interest groups hoped the young nominee would bring a greater appreciation for how communications was shifting online than past commissioners.</p><p>  But for five years as a minority member of the F.C.C., Mr. Pai consistently voted against regulations such as those limiting business broadband prices and a broadband subsidy for low-income Americans. He complained that the agency's Democratic leaders, including Tom Wheeler, were too heavy-handed with companies.</p><p>  The biggest offense, in his opinion, were the 2015 net neutrality rules, which included the declaration that broadband would be subject to more utility-style rules. He said the regulations would burden the fast-growing high-speed internet market. In dissenting comments during the debate over the rules, he echoed the arguments of telecom companies that the F.C.C.'s net neutrality rules made it hard for telecoms to expand their networks, leading to less innovation in business plans and would eventually harm the economy.</p><p>  He also accused the White House of presidential interference in the activities of the F.C.C., an independent agency. Mr. Pai said that the agency had taken its direction only after President Obama posted a video in favor of the net neutrality rules.</p><p>  ''We are flip-flopping for one reason and one reason alone,'' he said at the time. ''President Obama told us to do so.''</p><p>  Mr. Pai's consistent opposition attracted supporters from free-market think tanks and conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh and Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser who recently praised the proposal to scrap net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai became a frequent guest on Fox News and other conservative media and was praised in the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>  ''How fortunately ironic that it is Ajit Pai himself, as the Trump-appointed chair of the F.C.C., that will pull the plug on the ill-intended act called 'net neutrality,''' Mr. Stone wrote recently in The Daily Caller.</p><p>  Supporters of net neutrality argue that telecom companies want to become the gatekeepers of the internet, deciding whether sites have access to fast or slow connections. But Mr. Pai has responded by saying the bigger threat is from the big tech companies. Google, Twitter and Facebook, he argues, can deprive consumers of free expression.</p><p>  He says Twitter, for example, sometimes wrongly suspends users just because they do not share the same views as the company.</p><p>  ''Let's not kid ourselves,'' Mr. Pai said last month at an event sponsored by the R Street Institute, a free markets think tank.

In comments filed today by the Institute for Public Representation at Georgetown and organized by Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) and the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC), the coalition explained the opaque data and digital marketing practices targeting kids. The comments are filed with the FTC as part of its early review of the rules protecting children under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The advocates' call was supported by Sesame Workshop, the leading producer of children's educational programming, in a separate filing.</p><p>To better assess the impacts on children from today's digital data-driven advertising system, and features such as cross-device tracking, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality, and real-time measurement--the advocates urge the commission to gather and analyze data from leading companies that target children. Any proposed changes to COPPA must be based on empirical data, which is consistent with calls by Commissioners Wilson, Phillips, and Simons that rulemaking must be evidence-based.</p><p>In their comments, the organizations ask the FTC to use its authority under rule 6(b) to:</p><p>* Examine today's methods of advertising to children and their impact, including their discriminatory effects</p><p>* Examine practices concerning data collection and retention</p><p>* Illuminate children's presence on \"general audience\" platforms and those platforms' awareness of children's presence</p><p>* Identify how the data of children is being used by contemporary data platforms, including \"marketing clouds,\" \"identity management\" systems, in-house data management platforms, and data brokers</p><p>* Illuminate the efficacy--or lack thereof--of safe harbors</p><p>Groups that have signed the comments are Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood; Center for Digital Democracy; American Academy of Pediatrics; Badass Teachers Association; Berkeley Media Studies Group; Center for Science in the Public Interest; Children and Screens; Color of Change; Common Sense Media; Consumer Action; Consumer Federation of America; Consumer Federation of California; Consumer Reports; Consumer Watchdog; Corporate Accountability; Defending the Early Years; Electronic Frontier Foundation; Electronic Privacy Information Center; Obligation, Inc.; Parent Coalition for Student Privacy; Parents Across America; Parents Television Council; P.E.A.C.E.

Since digital technology evolves rapidly, so must our understanding of how data companies are engaging with children's information online. As we pursue the promise of digital media for children's development, we must design robust protections to keep them safe based on an up-to-date understanding of the digital spaces they navigate.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Josh Golin, Executive Director of Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood:</p><p>As kids are spending more time than ever on digital devices, we need the full power of the law to protect them from predatory data collection -- but we can't protect children from Big Tech business models if we don't know how those models truly work. The FTC must use its full authority to investigate opaque data and marketing practices before making any changes to COPPA. We need to know what Big Tech knows about our kids.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katharina Kopp, Director of Policy, Center for Digital Democracy (CDD):</p><p>\"Children are being subjected to a purposefully opaque 'Big Data' digital marketing system that continually gathers their information when they are online. The FTC must use its authority to understand how new and evolving advertising practices targeting kids really work, and whether these data practices are having a discriminatory, or other harmful impact, on their lives.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to James P. Steyer, CEO and Founder of Common Sense:</p><p>\"Kids and families have to be the priority in any changes to COPPA and in order to do that, we must fully understand what the industry is and isn't doing when it comes to tracking and targeting kids. Tech companies are never going to be transparent about their business practices which is why it is critical that the FTC use its authority to look behind the curtain and shed light on what they are doing when it comes to kids so that if any new rules are needed, they can be smart and well-informed.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel, Consumer Reports:</p><p>\"We're glad the FTC is asking for comments on the implementation of COPPA through the 2013 COPPA rule. But the Commission should have the fullest possible picture of how children's personal information is being collected and used before it considers any changes. It's well-documented that compliance with COPPA is uneven among apps, connected toys, and online services. The FTC must fully understand how kids' personal information is treated before the 2013 rule can be modified, in order to ensure that children and their data are protected.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Marc Rotenberg, President, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC):</p><p>\"The FTC should complete its homework before it proposes changes to the regulations that safeguard children's privacy. Without a clear understanding of current industry practices, the agency's proposal will be ill-informed and counterproductive.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Lindsey Barrett, Staff Attorney and Teaching Fellow, Institute for Public Representation, Georgetown Law:</p><p>The FTC should conduct 6(b) studies to shed light on the complex and evolving profiling practices that violate children's privacy. Children are being monitored, quantified, and analyzed more than ever before, and the Commission cannot make informed decisions about the rules that protect them online based on limited or skewed information about the online ecosystem.</p><p>The following can be attributed to Robert Weissman, President, Public Citizen:</p><p>\"The online corporate predators are miles ahead of the FTC, employing surveillance and targeting tactics against children that flout the protections enshrined in COPPA. The first thing the FTC should do is invoke its investigative powers to get a firm grasp on how Big Tech is systematically invading children's privacy.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Cheryl A. Leanza, Policy Advisor, UCC OC Inc.:</p><p>\"In the modern era, our data are our lives and our children's lives are monitored and tracked in more detail than any previous generation to unknown effect. Parents seek to pass on their own values and priorities to their children, but feel subverted at every turn by unknown algorithms and marketing efforts directed to their children. At a minimum, the FTC must collect basic facts and trends about children and their data privacy.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Eric Rodriguez, Senior Vice President, UnidosUS:</p><p>\"All children should have the right to privacy and live free from discrimination, including in digital spaces. Latino children are targeted by digital marketing efforts and with real consequences to their health and wellbeing. UnidosUS urges the Commission to use its authority and study how children of color operate in the digital space, what happens to their personal data, and how well they are protected by COPPA. Only then can the Commission take effective and objective action to strengthen COPPA to protect an increasingly diverse youth population.\"</p><p>coppa_6b_comments_final.pdf (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democraticmedia.org/sites/default/files/field/public-files/2019/coppa_6b_comments_final.pdf\">https://www.democraticmedia.org/sites/default/files/field/public-files/2019/coppa_6b_comments_final.pdf</url>).</p><p>[Category: Consumer Services]</p><p>Contact: Jeffrey Chester, CDD, 202/494-7100, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jeff@democraticmedia.org\">jeff@democraticmedia.org</email>;

Over the course of the two-day event, delegates heard from leading experts on the latest trends that are shaping the financial services ecosystem, including the rise of virtual banks, how InsurTechs are reshaping the customer experience, the emergence of Open Banking and the application of AI within financial services. The panellists also shared their experiences on how delegates can apply the latest technologies within their own organisations, which will be essential if financial institutions are to thrive in the post-COVID-19-world.  Out of all of the themes discussed, panellists agreed that there are four core key themes that will shape the future of the financial services industry:   1.       COVID-19 has accelerated the digitisation of the financial industry and has forced banks to rethink how they service and engage with their customers      2.       Big tech companies are rapidly disrupting and redefining finance, leading to established financial institution needing to fast track their digital journeys in-order to compete at the same level       3.       AI and Big Data are moving from the fringe to the mainstream, with more and more financial institutions using the technologies to deal with the challenges created by COVID-19      4.       Digital assets are quickly gaining regulatory acceptance and becoming an essential part of institutional finance, especially as central banks start to explore the possibility of issuing their own digital currencies   At a time when many countries are experiencing second or third waves of COVID-19 and going back into lockdown, the Virtual FinTech Fair has also created an event blueprint that other industries can use to bring their communities together virtually to discuss the respective challenges they face. This is especially important during a period where no one can travel, and large group events are banned. Throughout the event, delegates had the opportunity to network with some of the biggest names in finance and meet potential business partners in virtually the same way as if they were at a physical event. Over the course of the next year, FinStep Asia and Novsphere Media will also host virtual conferences on Women in FinTech, WealthTech and RegTech &amp; Cybersecurity.   Musheer Ahmed, Managing Director of FinStep Asia, said:  \u201cIn a rapidly changing world, where the future looks increasingly uncertain, it is essential that executives have the opportunity to meet and hear from the brightest minds in finance to understand the forces that are changing the financial services ecosystem. The Virtual FinTech Fair facilitated this, and we hope delegates are now equipped with the knowledge, tools and contacts to accelerate their own digital journeys.\u201d   Sherry Shi, Founder of Novsphere Media, said:  \u201cThe financial industry as we know it will be fundamentally different once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. If established financial institutions are to adapt and thrive in this new ecosystem, their executives must have the know-how to be able to navigate the landscape. We have helped executives to achieve this through the Virtual FinTech Fair, and over the next year we will be hosting a number of exciting virtual events to enable financial executives to take their organisations to the next level and be at the forefront of the digital revolution in finance.\u201d   King Leung, Head of FinTech at Invest Hong Kong, said :  \u201cInvestHK is delighted to have supported the global FinTech community through the Virtual FinTech Fair and share insights with participants during a period of great change. Many industries will have to adapt to the new normal, and FinTech will be key to the future of the financial industry.  Hong Kong is well positioned as a resilient FinTech hub to be the ideal launchpad for FinTechs looking to expand across Asia. InvestHK will continue to support the worldwide FinTech community and fast-track the success of FinTechs throughout the region.\u201d   The thought leadership webinars are now available on demand at  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.virtualfintechfair.com\">www.virtualfintechfair.com</url> .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42911244050</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NM-R221-F07F-81XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Financial IT</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Asset and Liability Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRBNTJEQ0ZBMzU4NDJENEE3MzQ1MDgyNTYxQjU3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjYwNzU1MEY2MzcyNDc1QUEzMjIyMkVGNDdBRTkxOUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000569</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BANKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTk5RDIyOTlFMEQzNEIxMjlBQkIyQTA4RDY2Q0QzM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode><className>External Audits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000958</classCode><className>INTERNET BANKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

Ted Poe, R-Texas, a former criminal court judge and prosecutor who is leading bipartisan efforts with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., to stop the rule change. \"It's disturbing.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite congressional concern about criminals and rogue nations hacking everything from the Democratic National Committee to Yahoo, Congress has not held a single hearing on the potential mass hacking of Americans by U.S. government agents.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sens. <person><nameText>Patrick Leahy, </nameText></person>D-Vt., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have written a letter urging Judiciary Committee Chairman <person><nameText>Chuck Grassley, </nameText></person>to hold a hearing. So far, Grassley has not scheduled one.</p><p>\"I am very concerned if we don't even have any hearings on this, that about six months from now, or eight months from now, we're going to find ourselves with some unintended consequences, and everyone is going to say how'd that happen?\" said Leahy, the senior Democrat on the panel. \"We've still got time to do it. ... With the reaction to what we've seen before in hacking, do we really want to say, oh, but the government can do it?\"</p><p>The Justice Department, which has pushed for the rule, says it's necessary to keep pace with changes in the technology used by criminals, particularly the increased use of \"botnets\". These are clusters of computers infected by malware that can be controlled remotely and used by hackers to steal financial data.</p><p>Opponents of the new rule say it goes too far, and they've got backing from big tech companies that want it stopped. They are pushing to get a vote on the Stopping Mass Hacking Act, a bipartisan bill that would bar the change in federal criminal procedures from taking effect. Congress is scheduled to return from recess on Nov. 15 for about four weeks of work.</p><p>\"We're really up against the clock,\" said Wyden, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"If Congress does what it does best and does nothing, then a lot of people are going to have to explain to their constituents why they let this happen without even a debate.\"</p><p>The controversy centers on an obscure government regulation known as Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Justice Department began about three years ago to seek changes to it. Those changes were adopted by the U.S. Federal Courts and approved on April 28 by the Supreme Court, which sent them to Congress for review. The new rule will automatically take effect on Dec. 1 unless Congress acts to stop it.</p><p>Federal prosecutors say the updated rule is needed in part to investigate criminals' use of \"botnets.\" The risk became more apparent with the recent release of source code for Mirai, a tool to create botnets that helps hackers take over home devices like DVRs and routers and use their combined power to launch denial of service attacks on targets.</p><p>To thwart criminals, federal agents already hack into victims' computers, but the government could greatly expand that ability under the new rule.</p><p>Currently, FBI agents must go to magistrates in every judicial district where infected computers are known to be located and request warrants to hack into those machines, which may number in the thousands or even the millions and be scattered across the country. The change to Rule 41 would allow them to go to just one judge to get a warrant to access all those computers, regardless of their locations.</p><p>\"For example, agents may seek a search warrant to assist in the investigation of a ransomware scheme facilitated by a botnet that enables criminals abroad to extort thousands of Americans,\" wrote Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell of the Criminal Division in a blog post. She was referring to criminals who install malware in their victims' computers and then demand money to remove it.</p><p>\"This change would not permit indiscriminate surveillance of thousands of victim computers,\" she added.</p><p>But critics of the new rule are skeptical of such assurances.</p><p>\"This is lazy investigation on the part of the DOJ,\" Poe said. \"I never had a policeman come to me when I was a judge and say 'we're looking for stolen property in a particular neighborhood and we want one warrant to search every house in the zip code.' No judge would agree to that. But the DOJ wants to be able to go to one judge and say we've got 100,000 infected computers and we want to go in with a single warrant and snoop around. And we're not going to tell the victims. That's an abuse of power.\"</p><p>Federal agents must make \"reasonable efforts\" to tell people that their property was remotely searched or that their information was seized or copied.</p><p>\"That's not a very high bar,\" said Robyn Greene, policy counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute. \"It's entirely possible that you might never be told.\"</p><p>Google, Inc., which opposes the new rule, said government hacking could inadvertently damage victims' computer systems and make them more vulnerable to future cyber attacks after they've been searched and, in some cases, \"cleaned\" by federal agents.</p><p>\"The use of various forms of (hacking) ... are more invasive than other searches because they often have unknown, widespread, and sometimes destructive consequences,\" wrote Richard Salgado, Google's director of law enforcement and information security.</p><p>Wyden said the government would be re-hacking Americans who have already been hacked by criminals.</p><p>\"You're essentially hitting an innocent victim twice,\" Wyden said. \"I think people are going to be furious.\"</p><p>Leahy said he believes a public hearing when Congress returns next month is essential.</p><p>\"If we do it publicly, I have a feeling we could bring people across the political spectrum together to accomplish two things: one, protect the privacy of Americans, and secondly, give law enforcement the tools they need to go after everybody from child pornographers to sex traffickers,\" he said.</p><p>Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who also serves on the Judiciary Committee, said Congress has other options if it runs out of time this year to hold hearings or vote on the Wyden-Poe bill.</p><p>He said lawmakers could delay implementation of the rule for six months to give the new Congress more time to hold hearings and thoroughly consider the bill. Congress also could pass legislation next year to undo the rule after it takes effect, Coons said.</p><p>\"More than anything else, the challenge is to get my colleagues to focus on issues like that,\" Coons said. \"I understand that many members are distracted by their reelection campaigns.

With respect to Facebook in particular, Senator Elizabeth Warren has been championing a plan that would see regulators rollback a number of Facebook's more notable acquisitions, including its $1 billion purchase of Instagram and its $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp. 'Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,' Warren said in a widely circulated blog post[1] this past March. 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.' </p><p>Without getting into the strength of Warren's argument \u2014 or its deficiencies, depending on your perspective \u2014 it shouldn't come as a surprise that Facebook has been quite wary of Warren's plan. What's more, there have been reports that Facebook in recent months has even abandoned a few acquisitions as to prevent further scrutiny. In light of that, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in a leaked audio clip obtained by The Verge[2], said that Facebook would be willing to fight should Warren ultimately become president.You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.The audio itself was obtained via a Q...ession Zuckerberg held with Facebook employees. Zuckerberg also intimated that breaking up big tech companies likely won't accomplish anything of substance.It's just that breaking up these companies, whether it's Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues. And, you know, it doesn't make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together.As Zuckerberg's internal comments began to circulate, it didn't take long for Warren to respond via Twitter. 'What would really 'suck,' Warren said, 'is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.' Notably, Warren is so intent on battling it out with big tech that it's become a key talking point for her campaign and even occupies its own section on her election website.

With respect to Facebook in particular, Senator Elizabeth Warren has been championing a plan that would see regulators rollback a number of Facebook's more notable acquisitions, including its $1 billion purchase of Instagram and its $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" Warren said in a widely circulated blog post this past March. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>Without getting into the strength of Warren's argument - or its deficiencies, depending on your perspective - it shouldn't come as a surprise that Facebook has been quite wary of Warren's plan. What's more, there have been reports that Facebook in recent months has even abandoned a few acquisitions as to prevent further scrutiny.</p><p>In light of that, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in a leaked audio clip obtained by The Verge, said that Facebook would be willing to fight should Warren ultimately become president.</p><p>You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies ... if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.</p><p>The audio itself was obtained via a Q&amp;A session Zuckerberg held with Facebook employees.</p><p>Zuckerberg also intimated that breaking up big tech companies likely won't accomplish anything of substance.</p><p>It's just that breaking up these companies, whether it's Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues. And, you know, it doesn't make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together.</p><p>As Zuckerberg's internal comments began to circulate, it didn't take long for Warren to respond via Twitter.</p><p>\"What would really 'suck,' Warren said, \"is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\"</p><p>Notably, Warren is so intent on battling it out with big tech that it's become a key talking point for her campaign and even occupies its own section on her election website.</p><p>More from BGR</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://bgr.com/2019/05/09/facebook-breakup-co-founder-chris-hughes/\">Even a Facebook co-founder thinks Mark Zuckerberg has way too much power</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bgr.com/2019/03/12/elizabeth-warren-vs-facebook-ads-removed-and-then-restored/\">Facebook briefly removed Elizabeth Warren's ads that said Facebook has too much power</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bgr.com/2019/03/08/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-security-escape-chute/\">Mark Zuckerberg reportedly has an escape hatch in his office in case of emergency</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRBGR-5744632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRBGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5R-BN51-JC3V-617V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434845</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BGR</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26323\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Do these companies essentially act as publishers and, if so, should they be regulated as such?</p><p> Should the government make efforts to break up the tech giants? These questions and more need answering as the public grapples with the reality that 'Big Tech' is gaining more control over what we see, hear, and read while surfing the Internet. Now, more fuel has been added to the fire as the controversial conservative investigative outlet Project Veritashas released leaked documents[2] which show Pinterest blocking links of alternative media websites and search terms related to Christianity and abortion. The apparent blacklist is part of a 'porn domain block list' designed to keep the social media platform free of sexually explicit content. Veritas published the internal documents and reportedly interviewed a company insider who claimed Pinterest directly and indirectly censors content related to pro-life and Christian themes, as well as alternative health sites, and several independent news websites known for challenging the U.S. government narrative on a range of topics, including the War on Terror. These sites include ZeroHedge[3], The Anti-Media[4], NewsWars (operated by Alex Jones' Infowars), The PedoGate, Tracking Vaccinations, and Organic Healthy Tips. Other documents leaked to Project Veritas include a large text file titled 'Sensitive Terms List' containing search terms that Pinterest considers 'sensitive.' A user searching one of these 'sensitive' terms will received modified search results per Pinterest internal policy. The documents note that search terms are assigned an 'abusive,' 'sensitive,' and 'brand unsafe' value. Pinterest employees have the option to either block auto-complete results in the search bar, show the user a warning, or remove the term from recommended or trending feeds. The so-called 'Sensitive Terms List' reveals that Christianity-related terms like 'christian easter' and 'bible verses' were marked as 'brand unsafe.' This is not the first time Pinterest made the news for censoring certain material. In February, the platform also blocked searches related to 'anti-vaccination' material[5].Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace!Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomHowever, the company is not alone in their efforts to remove unpopular opinions and alternative media from their platforms. One day after Project Veritas' report, theDaily Caller reported[6] that a whistleblower within Google leaked screenshots of two apparent blacklists of websites which are being scrubbed from the search engine's results. TheDaily Caller reviewed documents and found that employees are instructed to add the line '# REMOVE url' to ensure that a 'fringe' website is removed from Google's 'featured snippets' search results. The 'featured snippets' feature is responsible for finishing users sentences when they type questions into Google's search box. The document suggests that the removal of certain websites from featured snippets is being conducted manually by a human employee rather than the result of a mistake by an algorithm or artificial intelligence. The Caller also reports that a second blacklist, called 'all_fringe_domains,' is designed to block websites labeled 'fringe.' Some of the websites being blocked include 'the American Spectator, Breitbart, Breaking911, the website of pastor Brian Jones, the website of Bring Your Bible to School Day, Consortium News[7] (published by Robert Parry), St. Philip the Deacon Lutheran Church, speakerryan.com, The Franklin Society (a cryptocurrency blog), Free Thought Project[8], The Gateway Pundit, and The Gorka Briefing'. The leaked documents reported on by the Daily Caller and Project Veritas raise a number of questions regarding how much control and influence the Big Tech giants have over public discourse. Even more worrisome is the fact that websites like the Free Thought Project, the Anti-Media, and ZeroHedge have been facing waves of censorship for over a year, with both the Anti-Media and the Free Thought Project being purged[9] from Facebook in October 2018.

Facebook's profit jumped 98 percent. Even though the pandemic shuttered many of its stores, Apple increased sales of all its products in every part of the world and posted $11.25 billion in profit. Advertising revenue dropped for Alphabet, the laggard of the bunch, but it still did better than Wall Street had expected.</p><p>  ''The strong continue to get stronger,'' said Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. ''As many companies are falling by the wayside, the tech stalwarts continue to gain muscle and power in this environment.''</p><p>  The tech companies' financial performance was a remarkable contrast to the overall health of the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the country's gross domestic product fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter of the year as consumers cut back spending. It was the steepest drop on record.</p><p>  Combined, the companies reported $28.6 billion in quarterly net profit, underscoring how regulatory scrutiny remains more background noise and a distraction for them rather than an imminent threat to their businesses.</p><p>  On Wednesday, a congressional antitrust panel questioned the companies' leaders -- Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet -- about their market power and business practices.</p><p>  It was part of a broader inquiry by regulators and lawmakers into the dominance of the tech giants, with open investigations from the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.</p><p>  The spectacle of the chief executives of the four companies, worth nearly $5 trillion by market capitalization combined, appearing before a House subcommittee was historic. But antitrust investigations often take years, especially if regulators seek more drastic measures like breaking up companies.</p><p>  The pandemic has reinforced the advantages held by the big tech companies. As consumers stay home, demand for Amazon's shopping site surged, while companies are turning to its cloud computing products to keep their services up and running. Apple said the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple's devices and use its services.</p><p>  ''Our products and services are very relevant to our customers' lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,'' Luca Maestri, Apple's finance chief, said in an interview. He noted, however, that Apple could have made several billion dollars more if not for the pandemic.</p><p>Facebook and Google continue to be important to marketers and they are weathering the downturn in advertising better than rivals. Facebook shrugged off a spending slowdown, hailing record levels of engagement with its products.</p><p>  Alphabet said revenue from Google search ads fell 10 percent -- pushing the company's overall revenue lower for the first time in the company's history -- but that still was better than rivals. Last week, Microsoft reported an 18 percent slide in search advertising revenue.</p><p>  Since the beginning of March, the companies' stock prices have risen by an average of 35 percent, compared with a 10 percent rise in the S.&amp;P. 500.</p><p>Amazon</p><p>  Buoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping, Amazon had $88.9 billion in quarterly sales, up 40 percent from a year earlier. Profit doubled, to $5.2 billion, even though the company invested in expanding warehouses and other ways to increase capacity.</p><p>  ''Simply put, Covid-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,'' Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson &amp; Company, wrote in a recent note to investors.</p><p>  In April, Mr. Bezos told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend about $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses like temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing, and $300 million for testing its work force for the virus.</p><p>  But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales up 48 percent.</p><p>  On a call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would give its warehouse workers virus-related bonuses or raises in the current quarter, but added that pandemic-related expenses would fall to $2 billion in the quarter.</p><p>  Sales at Amazon's lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers include major corporations and small start-ups, grew 29 percent, to $10.8 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they had expected.</p><p>Facebook</p><p>Facebook's revenue for the second quarter rose 11 percent from a year earlier to $18.7 billion, while profits jumped 98 percent to $5.2 billion. The results were well above analysts' estimates of $17.3 billion in revenue with a profit of $3.9 billion, according to data provided by FactSet.</p><p>  Despite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions about its role in subverting elections and how people use the platform to spread misinformation, neither users nor advertisers have shown an inclination to stop using Facebook.</p><p>  More than three billion people now regularly come to Facebook or one of its family of apps, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world. And some 2.47 billion people use one or more of Facebook's apps every day.</p><p>  The company said its number of monthly active users rose 12 percent from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of shelter-in-place orders around the world.</p><p>  In late June, a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate for Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to reduce their spending because of issues with hate speech on the site.</p><p>Facebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July and warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could eventually hurt Facebook's bottom line.</p><p>Apple</p><p>  Despite the global economic slowdown, people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets.</p><p>Apple said its sales rose 11 percent to $59.7 billion and its profits increased 12 percent to $11.25 billion. Both figures handily beat analysts' expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas.</p><p>  Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually. Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which include Apple's cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe.</p><p>  Even the iPhone, which remains the company's biggest seller, had a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters.</p><p>Apple also announced a stock split on Thursday that would quadruple its number of shares, allowing people to buy a share in the company for a quarter of the current stock price, which closed at $384.76 on Thursday.</p><p>  Alphabet</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers. The company posted revenue of $38.3 billion and a profit of $6.96 billion -- significantly higher than what Wall Street analysts had predicted.</p><p>  Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, said advertising revenue ''gradually improved'' as the quarter went on. The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside Google's search results, but the company's efforts to diversify its business paid off as revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud computing business grew.</p><p>  When asked in a call with financial analysts about the congressional hearing, Mr. Pichai said the company would have to learn to live with the investigations.</p><p>  ''The scrutiny is going to be here for a while and we're committed to working through it,'' he said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Amazon reported a combined $28 billion in profits on Thursday.

I guess we are live. Great. Thank you so much. We are so pleased to have Lear Corporation joining us. I'm Dan Levy, the Lead Autos Analyst at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Very pleased to have Lear Corporation joining us, and on stage with us are Jason Cardew, the recently newly minted CFO of Lear, has been with Lear since 1992.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JASON M. CARDEW, SENIOR VP &amp; CFO, LEAR CORPORATION: That's right.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: So you've been around. And John Absmeier, CTO, joined Lear last year after he spent some time at Harman and Delphi, so well familiar with the auto tech landscape as well. Also from the team is Alicia Davis and David Lim from IR. Very pleased to have them. So we're going to jump right into a fireside chat. I have some prepared -- some questions. But to the extent you have any questions, feel free to interject. Also, you can e-mail my colleague, Rob Moon, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:robert.moon@credit-suisse.com\">robert.moon@credit-suisse.com</email>, and he can also ask on your behalf. So let's just start -- and this is a standard question I've been asking everyone to start. Let's just start very basic end market because I think that's been dictating a lot of the investor conversations. What's the latest update just in terms of puts and takes into 2020? How should we be thinking from an end market perspective on North America, Europe, China?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. So maybe start with 2019 and how we see the rest of the year playing out and then talk a little bit about 2020 as well. So on our third quarter earnings call, we talked about the fact that we're in the middle of the GM strike, and we had made some assumptions in regards to when that strike would end. And as it turns out, the strike did end the day of our earnings call. And so it ended up being about a 6-week impact and the high end of our range had contemplated 7 weeks of lost production. We ended up with about 6.5 weeks of lost production. So at the high end of our range, we had expected sales to be down due to the GM strike by about $420 million. That ended up at about $350 million. And so as a result of that, we would expect to come in just above the high end of our guidance range. But just more generally on the markets, I think, they've -- it's still a challenging environment globally, but they have stabilized a little bit. We've seen some modest positive improvements from what we had assumed on the third quarter earnings call. So there's a bit of a stabilization happening, albeit at a lower run rate than we started the year. As we look out to 2020, if you look at what IHS has suggested, and I think they have the market as roughly flat globally, with North America up and China and Europe flat. If you look at our platforms, we see a pretty nice tailwind in North America due to the non-reoccurrence of the GM strike. GM is a big customer for us. And so the fact that there won't be another strike next year, we're going to see a positive tailwind from that. However, in Europe and in China, we see our platforms down probably about 5%. And if we were to call a global number, global production number for next year, I'd expect when we give guidance in January to talk about something like 2% to 3% in global production decline overall.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. And so that's, I think, the sort of the end market look. When we talk about things that are more Lear-specific, how do we think about maybe some of the factors that were onetime in 2019 that are non-repeat or any discrete items? So GM strike, any inefficiencies related to that, any launch costs? I know there were some stuff with Mercedes, on the GLE pricing actions on E-Systems. How do we think about any of these sort of Lear-specific actions?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. And maybe it helps just to give you a sense of what we see in terms of the operating margins of the segments next year. We would expect, given the production outlook that I just described that our E-Systems business would continue to run in the kind of mid-7s, maybe perhaps a little bit better than that, next year in terms of adjusted operating margins and our Seating business to continue running around 8%, which is what both of those businesses are running at in the second half of this year, if you exclude the impact of the GM strike. In addition to that, just to sort of some of the puts and takes, starting on the positive side, we have the fact that the GM strike is not going to reoccur and revenue benefit associated with that is pretty significant, particularly on the seating side. We have the benefit of our restructuring program. We've invested $200 million this year in restructuring. We talked before about roughly $60 million of savings associated with that. So that will be helpful. Also launch costs will be lower in 2020 than they were this year in both segments.</p><p>On the negative side, and I talked a little bit about this on the third quarter earnings call that we have higher incentive compensation expense next year to the tune of about $60 million. That's really because we missed our financial targets this year due to the steep reduction in industry production volumes. And so that will be a headwind for us for next year, and that will show up both in the headquarter strip and in the segments. And then also on the positive side, we have a backlog rolling on next year that will help offset the lower production volume that we see in Europe. And in China, our backlog, at this point, we see it about $800 million, $850 million. So that is lower than what we had initially anticipated for 2020, but that's our current outlook for the backlog for next year. And I guess one more negative to point out is the continued strength of the U.S. dollar will weigh on revenue as well and operating income to a lesser extent, next year too.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: So you said that backlog, $800 million to $850 million for next year versus the prior outlook was...</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: So when we issued our backlog in January of this year, we had called next year's backlog at $1.425 billion. And so it is down pretty significantly. And it's down in both segments. The biggest driver of that -- biggest single driver, there's a program that's launching towards the tail end of 2020 that we had initially anticipated launching at the beginning of 2020. That's about $200 million of revenue that's getting pushed out to 2021. So we look at 2021, we see a really strong backlog coming there, and we'll describe that in more detail in January on the fourth quarter earnings call. But I would expect, looking at '19, '20, '21, still have about $1 billion per year in average revenue over that time period, which is very much in line with our historical backlog run rate, perhaps a little bit better.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. And then just on a segment basis, within that, as you said, $800 million to $850 million for next year is how we should think of it. How do we think of that as an E-Systems versus Seating? E-Systems, obviously, you called out sort of incremental or a sharper downturn there versus Seating, where you've at least had some Conquest Business. So how do we think about sort of the puts and takes around those 2 segments?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. So E-Systems' backlog for next year is looking around $250 million and Seating at the high end would be $600 million. So that would be the composition of the $850 million. And so both segments were impacted, as I mentioned, by that program that was delayed. And it's about $100 million in each segment, and that's the biggest contributor.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Right. Why don't so -- I think that sort of starts the discussion on the segments. Why don't we start, I guess, with the convergence of the segments? And so I think we've gotten some good updates on the financial outlook from you, Jason. John, on the tech side, I think, we've heard a lot about the convergence of Seating and E-Systems, obviously, intelligent seating. So could you just give us a sense of the latest update on your view on synergies between these 2 segments? How real do we look at intelligent seating? Is that something that's sort of a nice concept, but it's not going to show up? Or is this something that's actually starting to materialize now?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER, CTO, LEAR CORPORATION: Yes, it is starting to materialize. And if you think about the evolution of the car, the -- in-vehicle, I don't know if I have a connection, but the in-vehicle user experience is becoming the key differentiator in the car. So the seat, in particular, is obviously, the cradle of that experience in the car. And as we think about -- hold on, tech difficulties. Apologize. So as we think about the evolution of the user experience of the car, the seat becomes a much more important part of that in terms of personalization, customization, and what it takes to do that is embedding technology into the seat. So bringing more electronics into the seat, more software-defined functions into the seat, more sensors into the seat and, of course, the electrical architecture. So the wires for power and signal that are coming into the seat. And so to get back to the question of whether it's real, we now have production programs for the product we call SoundZone, which is one of our Intu products that's bringing the sound into the seat. So that's audio domain control, noise cancellation, individual audio in the seat. We also have production programs for our ConfigurE+ product, which is a powered rail system so that the seat is untethered from the vehicle and can be moved and configured for different use cases in the vehicle. And then we have development programs on the other Intu products with OEM.</p><p>So our BioBridge, which is a biometric-sensing device that's being used for driver distraction, for drowsiness and even for measuring comfort levels, so that we can implement our proactive capability, which is adjusting the seat to make subtle adjustments, so that it keeps you comfortable before you know you're uncomfortable. And so we have development programs with all those. But maybe another one that's quite important, we announced in January, a partnership with Gentherm. And so we have our Modular Heat &amp; Cool program with Gentherm, where we're, for the first time ever, doing a highly integrated version of Heat &amp; Cool in the seat. This is extremely important as electrification becomes more dominant for improving the efficiency of the vehicle overall. Instead of just blowing hot or cold air into the cabin of the car, now we can cool or heat the individual to their needs. And so this is now getting traction as well in the market.</p><p>And this will be the first time that we have very efficient heating and cooling, much faster times to cool you down or to heat you up and targeted at certain points on the body to make it more effective.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. And then if we're thinking about the 2 segments, should we think about Seating, basically, being the engine that's funding E-Systems' growth and providing sort of a source of stability? Because it's very clear that E-Systems, there's clearly -- with electrification and connectivity, you are pushing more outside of the bounds of what was your traditional product set, seating is still very much steady as it goes. Do you view seating as the engine that funds E-Systems and that's sort of the harmony between the 2?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Well, really, both segments are generating free cash flow. So our E-Systems business can fund its own capital requirements, its own engineering requirements. So both businesses are high-return businesses that can support themselves. And so I look at those sort of independently, and then when taken together, we're generating significant free cash flow for the company overall. And we've described our philosophy around capital allocation in the past. And we have a strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. So both businesses can support their own growth needs with the cash that they're generating.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: And from a tech development standpoint, is there any sort of joint -- have the tech teams merged in any way or consolidation of resources, put it that way?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. So our Seating organization leverages our E-Systems organization for electronics, software and architecture development when it comes to the electrical architecture of the vehicle. So the teams leverage resources and capabilities, share resources and capabilities. Software, for example, developing algorithms at both low level and high level application software for our BioBridge product, for example, is executed together in collaboration with the E-Systems team. So yes, that happens.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. Anyone who has questions, feel free to raise your hand or e-mail Rob or otherwise, we can just continue. All right.</p><p>So that starts the discussion on the segments. Let's go into Seating. I think you said seating, next year, 8%, which is interesting, because this is now -- that would then be basically ex GM strike this year like the fifth year of 8% for Seating, which is pretty impressive. It's just been very, very steady, even in spite of what's been a pretty choppy round of end market volatility. So what is it that's really underlying this that's allowed you to hold in that margin? Is it the mix? Is it just exceptionally strong platforms? Is there a vertical integration piece of this? Is it good execution? What's going on?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. It's really a combination of all those factors. And it goes back to 2011, '12, 13, when Ray and I were in the Seating business. We've really spent a lot of time building the team and focusing on earning a return in excess for cost of capital on every program with every customer in every region. The way we broke the organization up really gave us clear visibility to where we were earning a return and, where we weren't. We showed a willingness early on to walk away from business that we couldn't earn a return on. So we're very disciplined in our plans for taking on new business. We only take business on if there's a clear pathway to a earn return in excess for our cost of capital. And that's something that's in the DNA of the organization today. We've been investing in that business consistently for a long period of time. If you kind of compare us to some of the competitors that have been in the business, that have been out of the business, they've been distracted. We've had a consistent emphasis on the Seating business. And I think we've built this really diverse, strong foundation of customers and product segments. We're not overly reliant on any 1 particular customer. We have 7 or 8 customers that have 8% market share within our Seat business. And we have a relatively small structures business, which is probably the most challenging aspect of Seating. It's important to be a credible global seat maker to have some structures and mechanisms business, but it doesn't have to be a massive business. So we have what we think is the right-sized business there. And then we have this really strong surface materials business that I think is unique to Lear. That combination of leather, fabric and cut and sew, I think that's been a really high-performing business for us as well.</p><p>And it's -- so that's a combination of factors, I think, that has allowed us to continue running in that 8% range consistently.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: On the structures and surface materials, is that all the Lear? Or are you acting as a Tier 2 for anyone?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: So on the structure side, it's primarily internal sales. We do have some external sales, but it's fairly limited. On surface materials, leather, for example, it is mostly outside sales and less so internally.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Right. As we think about, I guess, you're saying volume is down 2% to 3%. I mean, I think, it begs the question of decremental margins. How do we think about decremental margins in a down environment for this segment?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: For Seating, it's 15% to 20%, largely dependent on the level of vertical integration. So our more vertically integrated programs are going to have decremental margins of around 20% to cover that added investment and capital structure required to support that program. The less vertically integrated programs and Just-in-Time seating programs are going to be on the lower end of that range, generally.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. Competitively, and this is a segment, Seating has sort of held in the growth right now are on a pure dollar basis, certainly. You've gotten a good amount of Conquest Business. What's the competitive environment that you're seeing right now? To what extent is there -- I think this year, you said it was something like $1 billion-plus of Conquest Business in the backlog and you picked up another $300 million over the course of the year. Like how do we think of the limit of how much Conquest Business you can get?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. I think there's a lot of opportunity there. And so we had $300 million Conquest awards this year. And you probably heard Ray talk about this a lot in the past. It's -- customers are reluctant to resource the seatings program in the middle of program life. And so the opportunity to take advantage of missteps by the competition oftentimes takes 4 or 5 years to play out. And I think we're starting to see the benefit of our long-term sustained investments in the space and strong performance, operational execution and quality. Customers recognize that and are rewarding us with Conquest opportunities. We've grown our market share from 19% to 23% over the last 5 years. We've talked about targeting 28%. I still think that's a very reasonable longer-term target. And most of that will come through Conquest Business taking share from competitors that have misstepped.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. And then how do you make sure, clearly, share is an important part of this? How do you do this without sacrificing margins?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. So if we wanted to grow this business faster, we've had ample opportunity. We've had opportunities to take programs, particularly on the structure side, but we just did not see a clear path to earning a return in excess of our cost of capital, and we've shied away from that. And so we're going to prioritize returns over growth. We're not going to take business just for the sake of top line growth. That being said, just -- it depends on the type of business you're winning. If you're winning Just-in-Time seating program, you might -- a Just-in-Time seating program, you may see a lower margin there, say, 5% or 6%, because that's all it takes in order to earn a return greater than your cost of capital. If you're winning business that's a combination of structure, surface materials and jet, then we're going to continue targeting that sort of 8% operating margin rate because that's what it takes to earn the return that we're after there.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. Let's pivot to E-Systems. And we'll start on the financials, but then I want to jump into the tech because I think this is presumably, John, where you're spending a lot of your efforts. So let's start on the financial side. This 10% margin. Obviously, E-Systems margins have been probably one of the core focuses for investors over the course of the year. So that's 7% right now, you're looking for 10% over the next 3 years. You said mid-7% next year and I think that sort of underscores the prior comment that the first 18 months in that 3-year period modest improvement and then more of a sort of step function change. But how much of this ramp? I mean, just talk through the qualitative pieces of getting from 7% to 10%. How much of this is product mix shift, scale, operational efficiencies? Xevo is certainly a piece of this. And how do you just give us some sense that -- what's the confidence in hitting the target, how end market dependent is that?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. I think the first step for us was to stabilize the business. And I think the pace of industry volume reductions has slowed, and we have a little bit more visibility on what the production rates are going to be going forward. And that's allowed us to restructure our facilities, take some capacity out and that's the first step to improving the margins. Now sort of working against that, we have some added engineering needs for that business. We've won $400 million of electrification and connectivity business this year. It's a significant ramp-up of that high-growth area of E-Systems, and that's going to require some engineering investment. So as I look at next year, we're not expecting anything in terms of positive from the production environment. If anything, it'll be maybe slightly negative. We are expecting to roll on $250 million in the backlog, and that will be positive. We'll see the benefit of restructuring. We'll also start to see the first benefits of our renewed focus on terminals and connectors and other vertical integration opportunities in E-Systems. So we've already identified some business that we're going to bring in-house. We'll see some initial benefit from that towards the tail end of next year.</p><p>And then part of it is just getting the team in place and executing the plan. And now we have the team largely in place. We're still looking for one additional piece of that puzzle, but we largely have the team in place. We have a Head of E-Systems in Carl Esposito that's in place. We have a new Head of our E-Systems business in Asia that has great relationships with the customers there, and that's been a troubled part of the business for us. And we've put in a great leader in our wire and Ts and Cs business, Mike Balsei, joined the company, formerly worked at Delphi and Aptiv and ran that part of the business for them.</p><p>So we've got some of the key building blocks in place with the team, and we're starting to see some traction from that as well. So there's sort of the kind of the near-term building blocks to margins expanding.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: From a mix perspective, I think, a big piece of the margin step-down was the roll-off of some very profitable Asia, China wiring harness business. How much of that -- can you just give us a sense of like how much mix were you at before? And how do we -- should we be comfortable that, that mix has now stabilized?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. In the case of China, the biggest issue we had was with Ford or CAS. And that business was roughly 30% of our Asia E-Systems business, it's now 5%. The 5% of our E-System sales in China. And so it's -- we've derisked that. Certainly, there's been an 80% reduction in revenue on those platforms over the last 18 months. That's the single biggest factor. I think just in general, the China market has been our biggest challenge, not just the lower volumes on those mature customers, but some of the new customers we've added to the portfolio, where it's going to take some time to work the margin up. So I think we did the right thing in trying to improve the diversification of our customer mix, in E-Systems. We're growing with Volvo Geely. We're growing with FAW and SAIC. Those are important customers for the long term, but they have been a drag on the margins initially.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. Let's talk about the tech side because I think that on the E-Systems front, that's probably, John, the core of your work. And actually, if you go to the Lear IR webpage, it says growth in very big text, and I assume that is probably the growth. So let's start with just how we look at the portfolio? You've done a number of things, I'd say, in recent years, some sort of predated you in terms of Arada and Autonet and EXO. Xevo was your deal. How do we look at the portfolio? Do you think it's complete? Is there more that needs to be done? Is there more capabilities, partnerships? How do we think about sort of how complete that portfolio is or what more you need to do to fill it out?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. Let me talk a little bit about the technology, and then I'll kick it to Jason. He can talk about capital allocation and things of that. But if you think about the growth drivers, certainly, Ts and Cs, as Jason talked a little bit about, are an area that we're looking at, but more on the high-growth electronics and connectivity and electrification. There's a lot of focus there. And if you look at where we've been bolting on acquisitions with Autonet, Arada, XO and now Xevo, that's been in the software domain. And so if you think about connectivity and domain controllers, the car is going through digital transformation. And so a lot of the smaller ECUs and electronics boxes that have been in cars as single function units are now becoming more rich, higher power controllers with more compute, more memory and with all functions defined by software. And so with connectivity and domain controllers, the acquisitions that we've made have been to augment what we've done in the past with embedded software moving into higher-value application software and even out of the car into services and data monetization of bringing in things like e-commerce with Xevo. And so that's where a lot of the growth that we're seeing coming in the connectivity and domain controller space.</p><p>And in the electrification side, obviously, with emissions regulations getting stricter and consumers becoming more aware of and finding eco-friendly transportation more important, we're seeing growth globally. It's really China and Europe leading the charge with the U.S. in third, on electrification, bringing in hybrid -- plug-in hybrid and now, more recently, a very strong push towards pure battery electric vehicle. And so we are 1 supplier that has both the E architecture with low voltage and high-voltage wiring and Ts and Cs as well as power electronics, and we are very strong in the energy management side of the architecture. Lear has been developing and producing onboard chargers, for example, for over a decade. We were first to market with onboard chargers with General Motors, and that's continued to be a strong point for us. Also with battery management systems, so sort of from the wall to the battery is really where we have a big differentiator and a big capability. And that's where we're growing significantly in connectivity and electrification.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: And then on a partnership perspective, or how much more do you need to do from an M&amp;A?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: So we don't see any gaps in the portfolio. We feel like we can grow those businesses organically. We're not going to turn away if there's a great opportunity in front of us. But in these uncertain times, we're going to be a little bit more cautious. We're not looking to do anything transformational, certainly. But we can use partnerships and other investments -- modest investments to help kind of round out our capabilities. John, maybe you can talk about some examples of that.</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. So we announced in January of this year, our Lear Innovations Ventures activity, which is a systematic approach to leveraging innovation to create business results. So as Jason said, sort of, modest ways of using small amounts of money to put into start-up companies or venture capital firms or work with accelerators and incubators and get access to new technologies sooner and leverage that to basically accelerate our activities or educate us in what we need to do to be cutting-edge and on the forefront of the changes that are happening in the car. So a few of the things that we've announced partnerships like Gentherm, our investment in Maniv Mobility, which is an Israel-based auto tech fund, our Techstars activity, which is an incubator. They've actually co-located in our innovation center in Detroit. And we've done some smaller equity -- direct equity investments and start-up companies to get access to technology and have some commercial befit from that.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: How comfortable from a tech perspective are you in really going outside of your wheelhouse?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. I don't think we'll go far outside. I think we have focused on our core capabilities: E-architecture, electronics, core electronics like body domain controllers, domain controllers, electrification and connectivity, and the farthest out we've gone is bringing in those software and data and services businesses, like EXO and Xevo. And I think those are important because as hardware becomes commoditized in the long run, we have to find new value streams, and we're bringing in software and services to the OEMs that were previously unrealized value. And as domain controllers and the software-defined car becomes a reality, we have to make that a living product through the life of the car. So once you have software-defined features on the car and you have connectivity ubiquitously across a fleet, you can now update and serve that product over 10-, 12-year cycle.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: On Xevo, what features about it allow it to really compete with Android Auto or CarPlay, how does it remain a relevant option for consumers?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes, great question. It doesn't compete with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, it lives on top of. So Android Auto and Android Automotive and Apple CarPlay are sort of a user interface and an operating system of sorts. Android Automotive is an operating system. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are using the phone to project into the car. Xevo would reside on top of those applications as an application in the user interface. And so we've talked about our business with Toyota, with General Motors and now with FCA, which recently launched. And with Toyota, it's bringing in our Journeyware product, which is really a framework to deliver apps and services in the car. With General Motors and FCA, it's a marketplace. So it's an application where the user gets recommendations for services like filling your car with gas. And again, that's sort of an unrealized value for the OEMs and for Lear. We split the revenue with them, allowing users to fill up very easily through the dashboard of the car.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Expansion beyond North America. Is that...</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: We're actually already outside of North America, with Toyota. But we have a big focus with several OEMs, both in China and in Europe, to expand there. Our initial focus is on getting the platform in as many vehicles as possible. We're now on 33 million -- well, over 33 million cars across the 3 OEMs and more coming. And that's the first step. Then it's really improving the user experience using the data that the users are generating by using the platform to make it seamless, make it better. And that will bring more merchants and more services to the platform. So that's the next steps with it.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: I'll sort of wrap up the section on tech with a broader question, and I guess this is maybe indication of the landscape. Obviously, you're coming from a more of a tech background, where software was very, very central. How difficult is it for you -- or I guess, maybe, this is a comment on the industry to compete with big tech software space to acquire top talent?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. I mean, there's always a huge competition for top talent. And software is 1 area. But I think in general, in electronics and in architecture of the vehicle and software and data, those are all areas where we're competing for top talent. There's a number of things that we're doing to try to foster and support that. Certainly, it starts at the top. So having Ray committed to innovation and technology helps, right? That shows the company and the people that we're trying to attract that there's a real opportunity. Secondly, it's giving people interesting things to work on. It's more important than compensation, in fact. And so we have a lot of projects like Xevo, for example, that are extremely compelling. People want to see those solutions get to market. And the car is one of the best ways to do that. You get to work on something that people use in millions of vehicles is very compelling to an engineer. And I would also add that we have looked at other locations for talent, right? So we acquired Xevo. They have a strong presence in Seattle. We acquired EXO, they were in Silicon Valley and Israel. So between Silicon Valley, Israel and Seattle, we are finding that we can attract the best talent in those spaces. I would say another -- one last thing about that is that over the past 5 to 7 years, the automotive industry has drawn a lot more attention from talent, because you get to see what you do go out in the hands of the public very easily. It's easy to say what you do. And so cars, I think, as an evolution is happening with the architecture with autonomous driving, with the connectivity, with electrification, et cetera, it's a bit more of a talent draw as well. So that's to our benefit.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. I don't know if there are folks who have any questions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have a slightly lateral question. Talking to some of your customers, the Auto OEMs, they are kind of embarking on their kind of digital journeys for their manufacturing, which they tell us will require some kind of compliance by the supply chain. So I wanted to ask whether you are working on this already. Is this kind of seen as a more of a burden or an opportunity for you? And I'm talking about things like being able to obviously feed into their PLM software systems, but also then to be able to feed straight into the IoT platforms that they're now kind of building or buying?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. So maybe let me make sure that I understood the question correctly. You're talking on the product side or manufacturing side or both? Because it's happening, I guess, somewhat on both.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Well, so if we take 1 example, there's been a big announcement. Volkswagen said that they're going to build industrial cloud together with Siemens and AWS. From what I understand is that the suppliers into Volkswagen would have to feed data on their products into MindSphere hosted on the AWS. Is this for you kind of a problem? Or is this an opportunity to maybe to look at digitalizing your own manufacturing?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. So it is, I would say, an opportunity, although it's something that we've been working on for years. Part of my -- I guess my charge is across products, process and business model innovation. So on the process front, we definitely have a lot of innovation work going into understanding the data throughout the flow of our manufacturing process, and let's say, aggregating that across the enterprise. And so I think that ultimately, that has to interact with the OEMs and from a privacy and security perspective, we take that very seriously. And on the product side, we already now have with Xevo to comply with those regulations, GDPR, CCPA, all that sort of thing. So we -- yes, I mean, we are contributing and participating in that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And your product life cycle and the process is already digitized, and you run it through kind of CAD/CAM, PLM software that is fully compatible with that?</p><p>JOHN P. ABSMEIER: Yes. Yes, we do, absolutely. The normal enterprise tools.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Why don't we just wrap up? I wanted to wrap up finally with balance sheet. The leverage, I think, you're at 1x?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. I think gross debt's 1.3x EBITDA today, about $2.3 billion in gross debt.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: So what's the upper end of the range that you're comfortable with on the leverage front. And then, I guess, more broadly, how do we think about -- you've obviously used a lot of your -- very strong free cash generation. You have used a lot of that towards share buybacks. Would you consider reducing share buybacks if larger acquisition opportunities come along?</p><p>JASON M. CARDEW: Yes. So our expectation in regards to debt levels, and we've talked a lot about this in the past, we want to retain our investment-grade credit metrics. And for us, we look at that as 1.5x EBITDA. So gross debt at 1.5x, there's not a big gap between where we're at today and that level. So we're not looking to lever up, certainly and certainly not in this environment. In terms of our capital allocation philosophy, it remains unchanged. The first thing we're going to continue to do is reinvest in our business through capital expenditures, bolt-on acquisitions, if there's something compelling out there that we find and then continue returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend program and through share repurchases. So I would expect that to continue.</p><p>DAN MEIR LEVY: Great. I think with that, we are out of time. Great. Jason, John, Alicia and Davi, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.</p><p>JASON M.

(BBVA) has issued the following press release:  <br/><br/>Some of the senior leaders from BBVA this week attended the Propel Venture Partners CEO summit in San Francisco.  <br/>The yearly summit is a chance for the businesses that Propel invests in, on behalf of BBVA, to meet with key decision makers at the bank and update them on the progress their business has been making.  </p><p><br/>More than that, though, it is a vital opportunity for BBVA to experience first hand the disruption that is taking place on the edges of the financial services sector \u2013 and to see where the future of the industry is heading.  <br/>This is often a chance to hear both the positive coming out of the sector, and the negative and ways in which that can be transformed. Equally, its a chance for thought leaders in sectors across the financial services industry to share their thinking on where the sector is going, and how well it is serving both businesses and consumers alike.  <br/>One of those taking part was a senior member of the White House staff, who was there to discuss the role politics can play in creating a more innovative and engaging financial services sector. For example, ensuring that things like regulation doesn\u2019t impinge on the ability for startups to start to work, while still protecting people assets.  <br/>For the speaker, they said that the work goes both ways though, with one of the other key learnings from the sector being how to manage disruptive change. For the Government, and the businesses they support, this means moving from a fear of automation and the impact that has on people\u2019s jobs, to one where the impetus becomes finding new roles for people.  <br/>The speaker said that here politicians can play a part by promoting different types of education, like cyberskills and programming, or ensuring that the skillsets businesses need in an era of increased digital working are properly met by those training people for the future.  The digitasion of trust  <br/>Another discussion saw the CEOs of two banks describe how for them, a bank\u2019s value proposition starts with trust. As banking moves increasingly to digital platforms, the digitisation of trust \u2013 and how banks move to protect the digital assets of their clients, while building out trust by supporting people to make better decisions, was vital.  <br/>One of the CEO\u2019s, a start-up, outlined how for them, 75% of their new customers come from social media referrals, showing just how valuable this channel can be for both growing a business and using the trust and positive customer sentiment to acquire new customers.  <br/>The discussion then turned to the technology that underpins digital banking, with another of the CEOs present saying that, for them, technology is also an enabler of trust.  About responsability  <br/>Noting the recent troubles of Facebook \u2013 who\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg was being interviewed by the US Congress even as the summit in Sausalito was taking place yesterday \u2013 the point was made that strong tech infrastructure can promote trust.  <br/>The CEO added that there was an analogy between social networks and banking. Thirty years ago banks didn\u2019t have much responsibility for what criminals might be doing with illicit money via their technology platforms.  <br/>Now, though, it\u2019s clear that a bank\u2019s responsibility is to prevent criminal activity and to carefully monitor those systems they use to run their business for the wider protection of society. This is an approach that has really changed in the past three decades. Its help reduce criminality, and increased accountability and stability. The CEO\u2019s suggested that maybe the same regulations and obligations now need to be applied to big tech.  <br/>Another big topic on the day was the impact AI will make on the financial services sector. One of the biggest challenges the industry faces is reducing the complexity of the huge volumes of data the industry has. This is where the power of machine learning algorithms can really deliver value from the data.  <br/>Secondly, it needs to really deliver on human experience, to understand natural human behaviours, and to develop solutions that add to human experience, yet still seem \u2018magical\u2019.  <br/>Lastly, into the future, AI needs to work seamlessly with people\u2019s lives \u2013 that for example, implants that people might have in the future to enable AI engagement are designed to extend their thinking and support their acquisition of knowledge \u2013 not just gimmicks.  <br/>Ultimately, the ideas being posited by the CEOs present during the day all related to better serving customers and clients, to improving decision making, and to adding value by using data in smarter ways.  <br/>The summit itself is conducted under Chatham House rules, to allow for greater freedom of conversation, so it means that only the themes that emerge can be shared.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN734956920180412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3K-B2T1-DXCW-D0JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Innovation is the lifeblood of the technology industry, but what happens when new technological paradigms 'break things' and there's shattered glass on the floor? Who is stuck with the bill?</p><p> Across the world, lawmakers and regulatory agencies are mulling this question, and many have big tech squarely in their sights. The recent case of Facebook's proposed Libra token is a good illustration of this - U.S. Congress had a bipartisan field day with the social media giant during a series of heated hearings, expressing their skepticism of both the proposed cryptocurrency and the social media giant's good faith. Across the pond, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation targeting data privacy, and the UK's recently announced Digital Markets Unit to monitor large online companies, are similar examples of this growing consensus. In electoral politics, Democratic presidential primary candidate Elizabeth Warren has listed breaking up big tech as a central tenet of her platform, turning it into a hotly debated topic on the campaign trail. On the other side of the aisle, calls for measures to prevent firms like Facebook or Google from censoring conservative speech have become common among Republicans. Regardless of how you might feel about these regulations in isolation, the sum total is enough to make your head spin. Look at the headlines on any given day, and it's easy to get the impression that there is a war on big tech. The architects of our new technological ecosystem can be forgiven for sounding the alarm. After all, wasn't it just a decade ago that Silicon Valley was the darling of a world on the cusp of digital revolution? Hasn't it brought people closer together in ways once thought impossible? Won't these new regulations suffocate the very spirit that thrust the tech world into the spotlight in the first place? The answers to those questions are yes, yes and, crucially, no. While regulation is inevitable, it doesn't need to come at the cost of innovation. Done right, a robust regulatory framework can support efficiency and results while also promoting transparency and fairness. Need proof? Just look at the capital markets. I work with dozens of the largest firms in financial services, and like big tech, our industry does not have a spotless history. Bad behavior and predatory practices by market participants caused - either wholly or in part, depending on your perspective \u2014 the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis that ballooned into a global financial crisis, causing regulators to think long and hard about their role in protecting investors and promoting fairness. While obviously not the only example of economic downturn caused by risky behavior, these developments followed a wave of deregulation in the 1980s and '90s and stand as defining events for the current generation of lawmakers. While they may not have done so as swiftly and forcefully as some would have liked, regulators acted. The Federal Reserve increased its oversight of institutions that play a pivotal role in market stability. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act brought sweeping reforms to the U.S. financial services industry on a level not seen since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 'New Deal' in the 1930s. In Europe, the UK FCA focused on improving the culture, conduct, and accountability of investment firms, while Basel III has strengthened capital requirements and will continue to do so as the ultimate deadline approaches, now set for 2022. Make no mistake, there was plenty of resistance to these measures at the time they were adopted. But the doomsday criers are now few and far between. Far from being suffocated by lack of innovation or controlling lawmakers, the financial services industry now has the best of both worlds. A quick look at what banks have been able to accomplish in recent years dispels the notion that slowing down is an inevitable consequence of increased regulation. Consider the 'robo advisors' that now make it cheaper and easier than ever to invest, or the fact that customers are carrying out complex banking operations from their cell phones. Elsewhere, machine learning has taken over the back office in the form of highly sophisticated compliance frameworks. Finally, some of the largest incumbents are in the process of internally developing comprehensive next generation platforms for their institutional client bases, a significant lift that these institutions expect to be a big boon to business. These are not the activities of an industry that has been hindered by regulation. Instead, regulation has given investors and lawmakers transparency and peace of mind as innovation continues at a rapid pace. There will always be growing pains, but banks have largely succeeded in finding plenty of room to generate new ideas and remain on the cutting edge while also steering clear of activities that would land them a date with the SEC. The industry is better for it. The tech world should look to finance as a model. The heightened interest in regulatory action may be jarring to those working in big tech, but ultimately it is not a long-term threat to the health of their industry. Today's engineers come out with new products faster than consumers can make sense of them, so even if some firms are slowed by these new measures, it is a small price to pay for greater accountability and transparency in what has become the new world order. Instead of stressing over the potential negative effects, the tech world should see this as an opportunity to shape what effective regulation looks like in this space. When regulators are fearful or don't fully understand the landscape, they are more likely to roll out blanket rules that unnecessarily constrict industry players or fail to address the heart of the issue. By taking an active role in educating both regulators and the wider public, tech can make its best case for proportional oversight. We see this playing out in regulatory sandboxes around the world. These allow for testing and development of new ideas in an environment that will safeguard consumer protection. Too often, the relationship between innovator and regulator is an adversarial one; by working together, they can create a robust regulatory framework that preserves the best sides of Silicon Valley's longstanding ambition to transform the world. So Silicon Valley, take it from Wall Street: you, too, can learn to love your regulated future. It's just a matter of suspending your skepticism and pursuing regulations that work for everyone - consumers, lawmakers and, yes, big tech alike. Mazy Dar is CEO of OpenFin[1].

More troubling still for the UK is that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">trade deal</url> with the US could reinforce that dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The heads of the world's largest tech firms consistently demonstrate a troubling indifference to democratic scrutiny. One of the many conclusions from last week's Intelligence and Security Committee's report into Russian interference in UK politics was that social media platforms have entangled themselves in our daily lives but are failing to play their part in keeping us safe. </p><p>Meanwhile, misinformation and fake news have exacerbated and fuelled the deadly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">Covid-19</url> pandemic. Decisions by big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter can drive the virality of anti-vaxx conspiracy videos as well as racist and anti-semitic abuse videos. How they design their algorithms determines what posts get removed and which ones get boosted.</p><p>Despite the companies' bold claims about tackling misinformation about the virus, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">OfCom</url> reported a consistent half of the population are seeing false or misleading information week after week. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">examined</url> 225 pieces of misinformation (claims fact-checked as false) around Covid-19; 88 per cent of these pieces were spread on social media, while only 9 per cent appeared on TV, and 7 per cent on other websites. </p><p>All of this demonstrates beyond doubt the need for tough regulation of big tech and social media companies: leaving them to govern themselves isn't working. Democracy in the digital age should be able to hold these behemoths to account for how they affect the health of its citizens and of democracy itself.</p><p>It is alarming, therefore, that the government may tie its own hands through the US-UK trade talks. The US's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">stated goals</url> include specifically limiting the UK's ability to scrutinise the tech companies. This must not be allowed to happen. </p><p>The government has promised to close the democratic deficit between tech companies and UK citizens. The stated ambition of four successive secretaries of state is to establish a statutory duty of care on the social media companies. This could mean empowering a regulator to enforce a kind of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">precautionary principle</url>, asking the tech companies: have you first checked that your products will do no harm or that a change to your algorithm won't fuel dangerous conspiracy theories or silence legitimate voices?</p><p>The US-UK trade talks could jeopardise the government's ambition. The experience from Canada, where I now live and work, is cautionary. The trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, generally known as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">USMCA</url>, introduced a digital trade chapter. But the deal also included what one Canadian professor, Michael Geist, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">called</url> a culture \"poison pill\". Now the US can theoretically retaliate with tariffs on other sectors if the Canadian government regulates online services or content in ways that the US government dislikes. </p><p>The digital elements of the deal flew under the radar during the trade talks. While the tech companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">tripled</url> their spend on lobbying in Ottawa, public scrutiny focused on other sectors like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">auto industry</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">dairy</url>. </p><p>Facebook condemned in report it commissioned into its civil right record</p><p>Considering the UK's scrutiny of the companies, look no further than the contrast between the tech CEOs' appearances in front of the US Congress and how <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">little respect</url>Facebook had previously shown for parliament's oversight, sending junior officials not permitted to say anything of use. All the while, even through the coronavirus crisis, some of the platform companies are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tech-hearing-live-stream-zuckerberg-facebook-bezos-amazon-cook-pichai-apple-google-a9644821.html\">increasing</url> their spending on lobbying in Washington, DC, to shape the US government's position. </p><p>The tech CEOs' aloofness on Capitol Hill should be a reminder this side of the Atlantic: the imbalance of power between the Silicon Valley platforms and UK citizens has become alarming for our democracy. We must learn the lesson from Canada: trade talks negotiated without proper consideration of digital provisions can unintentionally bind the hands of a government.</p><p>Instead of permitting the tech giants to continue to operate in the shadows, our leaders must move urgently to cast these companies in the bright light of public scrutiny and transparency. Let slip that chance in the current trade talks, and we risk descending even further into darkness.</p><p>                     Dr Heidi Tworek is associate professor of international history and public policy at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.

Indeed, a major one sparked, however unwittingly, the development of credible governments that respect the rule of law, underpinning our prosperity today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Until the 16th century it was impossible for Europe's patchwork of emerging national governments to credibly commit to paying back their debts. Monarchs routinely defaulted or even murdered their creditors, severely undermining their attractiveness as debtors.</p><p>But Henry VIII's marital woes and subsequent war with the Catholic Church set off an economic chain reaction that ultimately entrenched the rule of law and underscored British economic dominance, and later the principles behind the US and Australian constitutions.</p><p>By expropriating the church's English lands and selling them off, Henry created a growing class of independent farmers and businessmen, the \"gentry\", who had a strong incentive to improve their land and within a generation were three times richer than the church and nobility put together.</p><p>\"Parliament provided the co-ordination the dispersed gentry needed to assert its recently acquired economic power,\" explain economists Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales in their book Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists.</p><p>The Glorious Revolution of 1688, which formally subordinated the king to parliament, was the culmination of changed economic reality more than it was an act of deliberate political enlightenment.</p><p>Meanwhile, without a dramatic wealth redistribution of their own to jolt their economies on to a new growth path, a gentry never developed in Britain's continental rivals, whose governments could not borrow at anything but exorbitant interest rates, until much later.</p><p>By 1697, British public debt had surged from less than 3 per cent of GDP to about 40 per cent in 1697, while yields fell from 14 per cent to 6 per cent over the same period. That's how Britain beat Napoleon a century later, when its debt to GDP soared to more than 200 per cent. France had to rely on crushing taxation to fund its war effort.</p><p>\"Property in the wrong hands, especially if concentrated, can be very detrimental both to reducing the power of the state and to the emergence of free markets,\" the two authors add.</p><p>The moral of the story, that dispersing economic power by force can have a salutary impact on development, played out in Australia, too.</p><p>NSW governor George Gipps blocked William Wentworth, the most famous and among the richest Australians of the 19th century, from buying most of the South Island of New Zealand in 1839. Indeed, successive colonial governments continually resisted the rich squatters' demands for title to their lands, saving us from the sort of \"Bunyip aristocracy\" the big landowners had craved.</p><p>Where power isn't dispersed, the outcomes can be disastrous. The Russian \"privatisation\" of the 1990s, where swathes of formerly public assets were practically given away to a handful of politically well-connected \"businessmen\", has poisoned its govern-ance. The entire nation of Zaire was the personal property of the Belgian king until 1908; it remains one of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>Of course, land isn't the dominant resource any more, it's the digital economy, where power is very concentrated.</p><p>While productivity and wage growth have stagnated for a decade, we're still prospering, but we don't know how much concentration, not only in tech, is holding us back. Remember Google itself emerged out of successful US government antitrust -action against Microsoft in the late 1990s.Adam Creighton is The Australian's economics editor.

You have the human side if you visit a branch and you have the digital platform if you want to do it from your office or home, and even the ATM, the smart ATM, which I consider an automated technology,\" she said.</p><p>\"Some banks are using the [interactive teller machine]; it's a hybrid. You start with a digital transaction and if you need an adviser, you can have an interaction with a human being,\" Chahwan added.</p><p>She predicts that in half a decade, machines will outnumber bank tellers as the latter transition to more advisory roles.</p><p>The summit also offered a chance for Central Bank representatives and Lebanese retail bankers to meet and jointly tackle digitalization.</p><p>\"As we have seen, over the period of the last five years, [the Central Bank] has become a lot more receptive to [these] ideas and has actually reacted to the demands of the industry,\" Zaman said. \"It is now putting in place new frameworks, and the rules which are going to permit more digitalization.\"</p><p>One representative of the Central Bank in attendance spoke of the new E-Transactions Law as the latest step in regulating e-banking. \"This law is very important. It allows us to move forward with e-payments, digital payments and digital currency. This law has given the Central Bank the necessary authority to issue the necessary regulations for digital currency, digital payments and others, and the Central Bank is working on these issues in a very serious manner,\" Makram Bou Nassar, the Central Bank's executive director and head of payment systems, told The Daily Star. The law has been in effect since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Asked whether cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will come into use in Lebanon anytime soon, Bou Nassar responded in the negative. \"However, the Central Bank is planning and working on issuing its own Central Bank Digital Currency, but this requires time. It's under investigation,\" he said.</p><p>While certainly more is yet to come in terms of regulation, another main challenge in the way of digitalization is rural inclusion.</p><p>\"If you see today, everybody's talking about rural,\" said Ramzi Saboury, the chief commercial officer of Areeba, a Lebanese fintech company whose self-proclaimed goal is \"to empower a cashless world.\"</p><p>Areeba has started a rural awareness campaign, which began in the Bekaa Valley, toured other rural areas and is set to conclude in the Chouf region in September.</p><p>\"I started this two years ago. ... The biggest challenge [was] education and awareness,\" Saboury said.</p><p>\"We went to rural areas, because you have to set [up] the infrastructure, because you want the consumer to wake up to know that his entourage accepts his payment, whether mobile or card. And the challenge was to convince businesses, small ones, 'Why do [I] have to go electronic?' So you have to tell them what's bad about cash, but you have to go with [nontechnical] language. Use day-to-day business language,\" Saboury said. \"We were able to multiply our acquisition by small businesses by 7 to 8 times [compared to] before because of this.\"</p><p>Areeba's foray into this previously untapped market has shined the light on e-banking in rural areas. \"Now if you go, you're gonna start seeing [that the Central Bank] is starting to talk about rural, [and] the banks are [as well],\" Saboury said.</p><p>Saboury foresees no room for face-to-face interactions in the future. \"The future is transactional. The relationship has become the transaction,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TDASTA-148258904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TDASTA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGH-TF51-F11P-X4J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335154</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Star - The Daily Star FZ LLC.

Et cette d\u00e9- fiance est dangereuse, car justifi\u00e9e. Le capitalisme actuel a un vrai probl\u00e8me : bon nombre d'entreprises de l'\u00e9conomie traditionnelle jouissent de positions beaucoup trop confortables, tandis que dans la nouvelle \u00e9conomie, le Big Tech s'est rapidement taill\u00e9 une position dominante. Une r\u00e9volution est aujourd'hui n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9tablir une concurrence saine, diminuer les profits anormalement \u00e9lev\u00e9s et garantir l'innovation. Aux Etats-Unis, un dixi\u00e8me de l'\u00e9conomie est compos\u00e9 d'industries dans lesquelles quatre firmes contr\u00f4lent plus des deux tiers du march\u00e9. Le cash-flow disponible pour les entreprises est, par rapport au PIB, 76 % plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que sa moyenne sur cinquante ans. Sur le Vieux Continent, la part de march\u00e9 des quatre plus gros acteurs de chaque industrie a augment\u00e9 de 3 points depuis 2000. Sur les deux continents, les firmes dominantes sont de plus en plus difficiles \u00e0 d\u00e9loger. Avec pour cons\u00e9quence une explosion d\u00e9mesur\u00e9e des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices. Au niveau mondial, le montant de ces profits anormaux s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 660 milliards de dollars. La position dominante de ces grandes entreprises peut \u00eatre battue en br\u00e8che de trois fa\u00e7ons. Tout d'abord, les r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant les donn\u00e9es et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour encourager l'innovation, non pour prot\u00e9ger les monopoles. Cela exige d'obliger les grandes plateformes \u00e0 transmettre leurs donn\u00e9es anonymis\u00e9es \u00e0 d'\u00e9ventuels concurrents. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les gouvernements doivent supprimer les obstacles \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9, comme les clauses de nonconcurrence, les exigences en mati\u00e8re de certification professionnelle et les r\u00e9glementations complexes con\u00e7ues par les lobbyistes. Aujourd'hui, plus de 20% des Am\u00e9ricains doivent \u00eatre titulaires d'une certification pour exercer leur emploi, alors qu'ils n'\u00e9taient que 5% dans les ann\u00e9es 1950. Enfin, les lois antitrust doivent \u00eatre adapt\u00e9es au XXI e si\u00e8cle. Les r\u00e9gulateurs doivent mieux garantir la concurrence. On devrait donner aux r\u00e9gulateurs am\u00e9ricains, comme c'est le cas au Royaume-Uni, davantage de pouvoirs pour intervenir sur les march\u00e9s qui deviennent dysfonctionnels. Les g\u00e9ants technologiques ne doivent pas \u00eatre en mesure de neutraliser aussi facilement leurs rivaux potentiels, comme Facebook l'a fait en acqu\u00e9rant Instagram en 2012 et WhatsApp en 2014. Ces changements ne r\u00e9soudront pas tous les probl\u00e8mes. Mais s'ils r\u00e9ussissaient \u00e0 ramener \u00e0 des niveaux raisonnables les profits r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par les grandes firmes am\u00e9ricaines, et si les employ\u00e9s du secteur priv\u00e9 en recevaient une part plus \u00e9quitable, les salaires r\u00e9els augmenteraient sensiblement. Les consommateurs auraient un choix plus large. La productivit\u00e9 cro\u00eetrait. Cela n'enrayera peut-\u00eatre pas la mont\u00e9e du populisme. Mais une r\u00e9volution de la concurrence contribuerait puissamment \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir la confiance du public dans le capitalisme. \u2022</p><p>En Europe, la part de march\u00e9 des quatre plus gros acteurs de chaque industrie a augment\u00e9 de 3 points depuis 2000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLNGS-144062396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLNGS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV7-WPF1-F14X-H2MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Challenges tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Challenges</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40041\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>29 novembre 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Le Conseil de stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re (CSF, ou FSB, pour Financial Stability Board) publie deux rapports concernant ces entreprises. Le premier mesure les implications de leur incursion dans les m\u00e9tiers de la finance. </p><p>Le second examine quels risques pourraient \u00e9merger de l'utilisation croissante, par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, des services de cloud qu'elles proposent. Dans ces deux rapports, le FSB souligne d'abord les points positifs inh\u00e9rents au d\u00e9veloppement des Big Tech dans les secteurs financiers. En termes d'innovation d'abord, mais aussi concernant leur vertus d'inclusion financi\u00e8re\u00a0de populations issues des march\u00e9s \u00e9mergents et des \u00e9conomies en voie de d\u00e9veloppement. Le FSB rel\u00e8ve aussi que l'utilisation des services de cloud peut se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler b\u00e9n\u00e9fique, car une infrastructure dispers\u00e9e g\u00e9r\u00e9e par des sp\u00e9cialistes du secteur permet davantage de flexibilit\u00e9 aux institutions financi\u00e8res, est susceptible d'entra\u00eener des r\u00e9ductions de co\u00fbts pour les clients, et pr\u00e9sente une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 parfois sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me centralis\u00e9. Cependant, outre les risques classiques que les institutions financi\u00e8res peuvent faire peser sur le syst\u00e8me financier mondial - li\u00e9s \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes de levier, de liquidit\u00e9 ou encore aux risques op\u00e9rationnels -, la puissance de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s technologiques, et la rapidit\u00e9 avec laquelle elles peuvent conqu\u00e9rir des march\u00e9s, pourraient en cr\u00e9er de nouveaux. Il existe d'abord un risque de concentration. Le FSB constate en effet que le nombre des entreprises technologiques reste tr\u00e8s r\u00e9duit et que, dans certains pays, elles pourraient dominer la fourniture de certains services financiers. A noter que la situation se r\u00e9v\u00e8le tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente selon la zone g\u00e9ographique ou le type de pays. Dans les pays d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s, les Big Tech se concentrent souvent sur des services sp\u00e9cifiques, comme les paiements, et travaillent de concert avec les institutions financi\u00e8res. Dans les pays \u00e9mergents, et notamment en Chine, les entreprises technologiques proposent une gamme de services beaucoup plus large, et de mani\u00e8re beaucoup plus ind\u00e9pendantes des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s purement financi\u00e8res. Un autre risque identifi\u00e9 par le FSB porte sur les mod\u00e8les \u00e9conomiques m\u00eames des institutions financi\u00e8res classiques, qui pourraient \u00eatre mis \u00e0 mal par une concurrence exacerb\u00e9e avec ces nouveaux acteurs. \u00abCe n'est pas le r\u00f4le des autorit\u00e9s de prot\u00e9ger les institutions financi\u00e8res de la concurrence, mais les r\u00e9gulateurs et les superviseurs doivent accorder une attention particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 son impact sur la viabilit\u00e9 des mod\u00e8les \u00e9conomiques des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s en place et \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont elles r\u00e9agissent\u00bb, note le FSB. \u00a0 Ensuite, les liens existants entre les Big Tech et les institutions financi\u00e8res, notamment lorsque les premi\u00e8res aident les secondes \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ou distribuer des produits financiers, pourraient servir de canal \u00e0 la propagation d'une crise financi\u00e8re. \u00abCes risques peuvent \u00eatre particuli\u00e8rement importants si ces services financiers ne sont pas facilement substituables et si la gestion des risques et les contr\u00f4les des entreprises Big Tech sont moins efficaces que ceux exig\u00e9s des institutions financi\u00e8res r\u00e9glement\u00e9es\u00bb, souligne le FSB. Enfin, concernant l'utilisation de services en cloud par les institutions financi\u00e8res, le FSB admet qu'\u00abil ne semble pas exister de risque imm\u00e9diat pour la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re\u00bb. Il souligne toutefois que les autorit\u00e9s doivent rester vigilantes sur \u00able caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat des normes r\u00e9glementaires et des pratiques de surveillance en mati\u00e8re d'externalisation\u00bb, ou encore sur \u00ables efforts de normalisation pour assurer l'interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 et la portabilit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es\u00bb.  </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEQUO-1514556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEQUO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPB-XH21-JBT0-W340-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382163</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 L'AGEFI Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>L'AGEFI Quotidien</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19467\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>d\u00e9cembre 9 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XKI</classCode><className>CONJONCTURE \u00c9CONOMIQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLBG</classCode><className>FINANCE D'ENTREPRISE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>GESTION DU RISQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>MARCH\u00c9 \u00c9MERGENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>PAYS EN VOIE DE D\u00c9VELOPPEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>RAPPORTS COMMERCIAUX &amp; PR\u00c9VISIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>CRISE \u00c9CONOMIQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><className>PAYSAGE FINANCIER &amp; BANCAIRE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>GESTION DU RISQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Greta Thunberg. La jeune militante su\u00e9doise a point\u00e9 la direction vers laquelle a regard\u00e9 une large majorit\u00e9 des participants au 50eForum \u00e9conomique mondial. Il faut remonter \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990 pour retrouver pareille convergence. A l'\u00e9poque, c'\u00e9tait la r\u00e9volution num\u00e9rique. Cette fois, c'est la r\u00e9volution \u00e9cologique.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tout avait pourtant mal commenc\u00e9. Les trois indicateurs publi\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ouverture du Forum n'\u00e9taient gu\u00e8re encourageants. Gita Gopinath, l'\u00e9conomiste en chef du FMI, a encore r\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 la baisse sa pr\u00e9vision de croissance pour 2020, d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 3,3 %, malgr\u00e9 une accalmie des tensions g\u00e9opolitiques. Bob Moritz, le patron du cabinet d'audit PwC, a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats de son enqu\u00eate annuelle aupr\u00e8s des PDG qui marque un \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">niveau record de pessimisme</emphasis>\u00bb, avec 53 % des dirigeants estimant que la croissance va d\u00e9cliner dans l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 venir. Et Richard Edelman, fondateur de la firme de relations publiques \u00e0 son nom, a d\u00e9voil\u00e9 son barom\u00e8tre de la confiance, selon lequel 56 % des habitants de la plan\u00e8te estiment que le capitalisme fait plus de mal que de bien (34.000 personnes interrog\u00e9es dans 28 pays).</p><p>Mais il en fallait plus pour d\u00e9primer les chefs des grandes entreprises. D'abord parce qu'ils ont confiance dans la r\u00e9silience de leurs entreprises tant qu'il n'y a pas de cygne noir comme un krach financier, peu probable avec des taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat aussi bas. Ensuite et surtout parce qu'ils ont la t\u00eate ailleurs. Trois points de bascule revenaient en boucle dans les \u00e9changes. D'abord, les cinq sujets jug\u00e9s les plus dangereux dans le rapport sur les risques publi\u00e9 par l'organisation du Forum juste avant Davos \u00e9taient pour la premi\u00e8re fois tous reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l'environnement. Ensuite, la lettre annuelle de Larry Fink, o\u00f9 le patron du premier gestionnaire mondial d'actifs, BlackRock, souligne l'urgence climatique et affirme qu'il va vendre les actifs tr\u00e8s li\u00e9s au charbon. Enfin, l'annonce par Microsoft, non seulement que la firme va \u00e9mettre moins de carbone qu'elle n'en absorbera en 2030, mais aussi qu'elle va \u00ab ravaler \u00bb ensuite toutes ses \u00e9missions de CO2 depuis sa cr\u00e9ation. Les participants du Forum sentent qu'il va falloir changer, \u00e0 la fois vite et en profondeur. Et que les r\u00e8gles du jeu vont bouger comme jamais depuis pr\u00e8s d'un si\u00e8cle.</p><h>Tous \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole !</h><p>C'est Jim Hagemann Snabe, le pr\u00e9sident danois du g\u00e9ant allemand Siemens, qui raconte l'histoire. Dans une entreprise, le directeur financier demande au PDG : \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Qu'est-ce qui se passe si on d\u00e9pense beaucoup d'argent pour les former et qu'apr\u00e8s ils partent ?</emphasis>\u00bb R\u00e9ponse du PDG : \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Qu'est-ce qui se passe si on ne d\u00e9pense pas d'argent pour les former et qu'apr\u00e8s ils restent ?</emphasis>\u00bb</p><p>Le d\u00e9bat sur le travail s'est d\u00e9cal\u00e9. Hier, 47 % des emplois devaient dispara\u00eetre, selon une \u00e9tude de deux chercheurs d'Oxford. Aujourd'hui, \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100 % des emplois vont changer</emphasis>\u00bb, affirme Ginni Rometty, la PDG du groupe informatique IBM. \u00ab J<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e n'ai jamais vu \u00e7a, tous les m\u00e9tiers changent</emphasis>\u00bb, lui fait \u00e9cho Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, ministre fran\u00e7aise du Travail. Une formule fait mouche : \u00ab A<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">yons plus de robots pour que nos salari\u00e9s puissent se former. </emphasis>\u00bb</p><p>La course \u00e0 la formation est lanc\u00e9e. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous avons form\u00e9 5 millions d'Europ\u00e9ens</emphasis>\u00bb, se vante Sundar Pichai, le patron du g\u00e9ant du Net Google. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous voulons faire de la formation \u00e0 tous les niveaux</emphasis>\u00bb, dit Pedro S\u00e1nchez, le pr\u00e9sident du Conseil espagnol, aur\u00e9ol\u00e9 de la constitution enfin r\u00e9ussie de son gouvernement. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ici, \u00e0 Davos, nous cr\u00e9ons une plateforme public-priv\u00e9 pour donner \u00e0 1 milliard de personnes les comp\u00e9tences dont elles ont besoin dans la quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9volution industrielle</emphasis>\u00bb, explique Klaus Schwab, le fondateur du Forum \u00e9conomique mondial.</p><p>Muriel P\u00e9nicaud met en avant Mon compte formation, l'application sur mobile r\u00e9cemment lanc\u00e9e par son minist\u00e8re, d\u00e9j\u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9e par plus de 1 million de personnes. Elle raconte que le permis de conduire vient en premier choix, avec les langues. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mais les voitures seront bient\u00f4t autonomes</emphasis>\u00bb, lui r\u00e9torque le mod\u00e9rateur de la session. La question tourne dans la t\u00eate de nombreux dirigeants : former \u00e0 quoi ? Les comp\u00e9tences requises changent sans cesse. Et de plus en plus, il faut des<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">soft skills,</emphasis>des comp\u00e9tences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et relationnelles plus difficiles \u00e0 transmettre que le savoir-faire technique. La<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r\u00e9volution de la requalification</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00bb</emphasis>voulue par le Forum reste \u00e0 inventer.</p><h>Des nuages de drones</h><p>A Davos, on aime l'innovation. Beaucoup de gens ont en t\u00eate les images des tests de drones par le g\u00e9ant am\u00e9ricain du commerce Amazon. Derri\u00e8re ce coup de marketing \u00e9merge toute une industrie.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> \u00ab Nous nous sommes rendu compte \u00e0 quel point \u00e7a allait changer les choses il y a cinq ans \u00bb,</emphasis>t\u00e9moigne David Abney, le patron du grand livreur am\u00e9ricain UPS. Une exp\u00e9rience a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9e en 2016 au Rwanda pour transporter des poches de sang destin\u00e9es \u00e0 transfuser des femmes ayant fait une h\u00e9morragie en accouchant. Le syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendu au Ghana. Il va servir aux Etats-Unis aussi pour des applications m\u00e9dicales - \u00e9chantillons pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s, m\u00e9dicaments, s\u00e9rums antivenimeux.</p><p>Il faut maintenant changer d'\u00e9chelle, une probl\u00e9matique qui revient souvent dans la bouche des industriels \u00e0 Davos.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Nous n'avons qu'un seul ciel,</emphasis>rappelle Fang Liu, l'avocate chinoise qui dirige l'Organisation de l'aviation civile internationale.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tout le monde doit pouvoir circuler en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dedans</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00bb</emphasis>Il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 12.000 normes pour les avions, et il va en falloir en rajouter.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> \u00ab Pour l'instant, les bases de drones sont \u00e9loign\u00e9es des a\u00e9roports. Mais \u00e7a va forc\u00e9ment changer \u00bb,</emphasis>estime Abney, dont la firme exploite 600 avions. Il va falloir enregistrer les drones, former et certifier les pilotes, \u00e9viter les collisions, pr\u00e9server la vie priv\u00e9e. Et puis aussi communiquer, en r\u00e9duisant les temps de latence. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aujourd'hui, on sait ma\u00eetriser \u00e0 distance des engins \u00e0 200 km/h</emphasis>, rappelle Hans Vestberg, le PDG du groupe am\u00e9ricain de t\u00e9l\u00e9com Verizon.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demain, \u00e0 500 km/h. Aujourd'hui, on peut contr\u00f4ler \u00e0 distance 50.000 engins sur un kilom\u00e8tre carr\u00e9. Dans cinq ans, on pourra en contr\u00f4ler un million</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00bb</emphasis></p><p>Peu \u00e0 peu, la diff\u00e9rence entre l'avion et le drone va s'estomper.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab L'avion sans pilote commencera par le cargo, car c'est plus facile \u00e0 accepter \u00bb,</emphasis>pr\u00e9dit Fang Liu. Le ciel n'a pas fini de se remplir. Tiens, pour une fois, on n'a pas entendu parler carbone.</p><h>Le triomphe de la finance am\u00e9ricaine</h><p>La Chine sera bient\u00f4t la premi\u00e8re puissance \u00e9conomique mondiale, mais la finance reste am\u00e9ricaine. Jamais les grands acteurs de Wall Street n'ont autant m\u00e9rit\u00e9 le surnom de \u00ab ma\u00eetres du monde \u00bb, \u00e9crasant leurs concurrents par leurs valorisations stratosph\u00e9riques.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Il y a dix ans, Deutsche Bank et JP Morgan valaient la m\u00eame chose en Bourse. Aujourd'hui, le premier vaut 16 milliards et le second 420 milliards ! \u00bb</emphasis>, se lamente un financier europ\u00e9en. La messe est dite.</p><p>Au centre de Davos, Deutsche Bank avait install\u00e9 une agence pour recevoir ses clients. Sur la vitrine, ce slogan \u00e9trange pour une banque :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab La croissance est-elle une illusion ? \u00bb</emphasis>Ce qui n'est pas illusoire, c'est la domination de la finance am\u00e9ricaine depuis la crise financi\u00e8re de 2008. Elle a \u00e9limin\u00e9 la concurrence dans certains m\u00e9tiers de financement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9, impos\u00e9 ses normes et engrang\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices inou\u00efs. Avec une seule ann\u00e9e de profit (36 milliards de dollars), la banque de Jamie Dimon pourrait racheter cash la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale et Natixis...<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab En Europe, les taux n\u00e9gatifs laminent les marges des banques. Ce n'est pas le cas aux Etats-Unis \u00bb</emphasis>, explique un banquier de Citibank.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Pas facile de faire ce m\u00e9tier avec des taux n\u00e9gatifs \u00bb</emphasis>, admet Kees van Dijkhuizen, le patron d'ABN Amro. Quatre \u00e9tablissements g\u00e9ants dominent le march\u00e9 de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9conomie mondiale et ils vont tellement bien que, pour le patron de Citigroup, Michael Corbat, les risques sur l'emploi dans son r\u00e9seau d'agences n'est pas un sujet. Tandis que, en Europe, la consolidation du secteur reste un mythe, l'union bancaire un projet et les effectifs des banques de d\u00e9tail un cauchemar. Un grand \u00e9cart se creuse.</p><h>Tech, conspiration et espionnage</h><p>A 89 ans, George Soros n'a rien perdu de sa verve. Chaque ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 Davos, le financier philanthrope pousse plus loin sa croisade contre les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et Facebook en particulier. Apr\u00e8s avoir accus\u00e9 la firme de Mark Zuckerberg de cr\u00e9er l'addiction chez ses utilisateurs, il la soup\u00e7onne cette fois d'\u00eatre un alli\u00e9 de Donald Trump dans sa campagne pour sa r\u00e9\u00e9lection.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Il y a un accord informel d'assistance mutuelle entre eux, Facebook va aider Trump \u00e0 se faire r\u00e9\u00e9lire et Trump va prot\u00e9ger Facebook pour que rien ne change \u00bb</emphasis>, soutient-il, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux appels au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement lanc\u00e9s par des d\u00e9mocrates.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg, la patronne op\u00e9rationnelle de Facebook, multiplie les rencontres pour souligner les efforts que d\u00e9ploie l'empire de la tech pour lutter contre les fake news. Et Nick Clegg, l'ancien vice-Premier ministre de David Cameron devenu responsable des affaires publiques de Facebook, autrement dit son lobbyiste en chef, enfonce le clou :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Nous avons supprim\u00e9 plus de cinq milliards de faux comptes Facebook l'an dernier ! \u00bb</emphasis>Deux milliards de plus que l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Mais ces efforts ressemblent au ch\u00e2timent de Sisyphe, dont on ne voit jamais la fin. Pour ne rien arranger, Facebook s'est retrouv\u00e9 au centre de l'attention avec l'affaire de l'espionnage du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de Jeff Bezos, l'homme le plus riche du monde, par l'Arabie saoudite. C'est en effet via la messagerie WhatsApp, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Facebook, que le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du patron d'Amazon aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 hack\u00e9. Au moyen d'un message envoy\u00e9 par le prince h\u00e9ritier Ben Salmane lui-m\u00eame dans lequel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 un logiciel malveillant... La nouvelle a choqu\u00e9 les participants au Forum, mais, signe de la m\u00e9fiance qu'inspirent les g\u00e9ants de la tech, beaucoup y ont vu une nouvelle histoire d'arroseur arros\u00e9 :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Peut-on dire que le cloud de Jeff Bezos est vraiment s\u00fbr ? \u00bb</emphasis>interrogeait un Europ\u00e9en.</p><p>Face au d\u00e9luge de critiques sur l'utilisation qu'ils font des donn\u00e9es de leurs utilisateurs, les Big Tech minimisent le probl\u00e8me.

Et tous les PDG de la tech, de Sundar Pichai (Google) \u00e0 Satya Nadella (Microsoft), r\u00e9clament une meilleure r\u00e9gulation de l'intelligence artificielle. Confiants, sans doute, dans leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 modeler les r\u00e8gles en leur faveur. La presse am\u00e9ricaine r\u00e9v\u00e9lait cette semaine que les cinq Big Tech avaient d\u00e9pens\u00e9 plus de 60 millions de dollars en lobbying l'an dernier \u00e0 Washington, plus du double que le secteur pharmaceutique, habituellement en t\u00eate.</p><h>ESG</h><p>Difficile d'avoir une conversation \u00e0 Davos sans ces trois lettres. A les en croire, les investisseurs vont faire des crit\u00e8res ESG -<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Environmental, Social and Governance</emphasis>- l'alpha et l'om\u00e9ga, si l'on peut dire, de leurs d\u00e9cisions d'investissement. Pour \u00eatre convenablement valoris\u00e9e en Bourse, une entreprise devra bient\u00f4t cocher les trois cases. Mais quels sont au juste ces crit\u00e8res ? Comme il y a autant de d\u00e9finitions que d'investisseurs, Brian Moynihan, le patron de Bank of America, a entrepris d'y mettre un peu d'ordre. Une fois de plus, des normes am\u00e9ricaines sont en passe de s'imposer pour fl\u00e9cher l'\u00e9pargne.</p><p>Contributor: Envoy\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciaux \u00e0 Davos</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"632880856fe5918ff74ed8dfff1bc11e\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"fcf889236cd85e538afb7efc0252adbb\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"9fbd35132f9c1b8c94b24e610cc4e9ce\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>fichier PDF de ce document</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2020012712\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LESECH-0602645995174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LESECH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2T-6W01-F066-M2J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">233065</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>N\u00b0. 23124</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>lundi 27 janvier 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS335110 ELECTRIC LAMP BULB &amp;

Greta Thunberg. La jeune militante su\u00e9doise a point\u00e9 la direction vers laquelle a regard\u00e9 une large majorit\u00e9 des participants au 50e Forum \u00e9conomique mondial. Il faut remonter \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990 pour retrouver pareille convergence. A l'\u00e9poque, c'\u00e9tait la r\u00e9volution num\u00e9rique. Cette fois, c'est la r\u00e9volution \u00e9cologique.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tout avait pourtant mal commenc\u00e9. Les trois indicateurs publi\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ouverture du Forum n'\u00e9taient gu\u00e8re encourageants. Gita Gopinath, l'\u00e9conomiste en chef du FMI, a encore r\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 la baisse sa pr\u00e9vision de croissance pour 2020, d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 3,3 %, malgr\u00e9 une accalmie des tensions g\u00e9opolitiques. Bob Moritz, le patron du cabinet d'audit PwC, a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats de son enqu\u00eate annuelle aupr\u00e8s des PDG qui marque un \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">niveau record de pessimisme</emphasis>\u00bb, avec 53 % des dirigeants estimant que la croissance va d\u00e9cliner dans l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 venir. Et Richard Edelman, fondateur de la firme de relations publiques \u00e0 son nom, a d\u00e9voil\u00e9 son barom\u00e8tre de la confiance selon lequel 56 % des habitants de la plan\u00e8te estiment que le capitalisme fait plus de mal que de bien (34.000 personnes interrog\u00e9es dans 28 pays).</p><h>Lire aussi</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump \u00e0 Davos</p><p>Le point commun entre Davos et BlackRock</p><p>Mais il en fallait plus pour d\u00e9primer les chefs des grandes entreprises. D'abord parce qu'ils ont confiance dans la r\u00e9silience de leurs entreprises tant qu'il n'y a pas de cygne noir comme un krach financier, peu probable avec des taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat aussi bas. Ensuite et surtout parce qu'ils ont la t\u00eate ailleurs. Trois points de bascule revenaient en boucle dans les \u00e9changes. D'abord, les cinq sujets jug\u00e9s les plus dangereux dans le rapport sur les risques publi\u00e9 par l'organisation du Forum juste avant Davos \u00e9taient pour la premi\u00e8re fois tous reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l'environnement. Ensuite, la lettre annuelle de Larry Fink o\u00f9 le patron du premier gestionnaire mondial d'actifs, BlackRock, pointe l'urgence climatique et affirme qu'il va vendre les actifs tr\u00e8s li\u00e9s au charbon. Enfin, l'annonce par Microsoft non seulement que la firme va \u00e9mettre moins de carbone qu'elle n'en absorbera en 2030, mais aussi qu'elle va \u00ab ravaler \u00bb ensuite toutes ses \u00e9missions de CO2 depuis sa cr\u00e9ation. Les participants du Forum sentent qu'il va falloir changer, \u00e0 la fois vite et en profondeur. Et que les r\u00e8gles du jeu vont bouger comme jamais depuis pr\u00e8s d'un si\u00e8cle.</p><h>Tous \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole!</h><p>C'est Jim Hagemann Nasbe, le pr\u00e9sident danois du g\u00e9ant allemand Siemens, qui raconte l'histoire. Dans une entreprise, le directeur financier demande au PDG : \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Qu'est-ce qui se passe si on d\u00e9pense beaucoup d'argent pour les former et qu'apr\u00e8s ils partent ?</emphasis>\u00bb R\u00e9ponse du PDG : \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Qu'est-ce qui se passe si on ne d\u00e9pense pas d'argent pour les former et qu'apr\u00e8s ils restent ?</emphasis>\u00bb</p><p>Le d\u00e9bat sur le travail s'est d\u00e9cal\u00e9.

Et de plus en plus, il faut des \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">soft skills</emphasis>\u00bb, des comp\u00e9tences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et relationnelles plus difficiles \u00e0 transmettre que le savoir-faire technique. La \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r\u00e9volution de la requalification</emphasis>\u00bb voulue par le Forum reste \u00e0 inventer.</p><h>Des nuages de drone</h><p>A Davos, on aime l'innovation. Beaucoup de gens ont en t\u00eate les images des tests de drones par le g\u00e9ant am\u00e9ricain du commerce Amazon. Derri\u00e8re ce coup de marketing \u00e9merge toute une industrie. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous nous sommes rendu compte \u00e0 quel point \u00e7a allait changer les choses il y a cinq ans</emphasis>\u00bb, t\u00e9moigne David Abney, le patron du grand livreur am\u00e9ricain UPS. Une exp\u00e9rience a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9e en 2016 au Rwanda, pour transporter des poches de sang destin\u00e9es \u00e0 transfuser des femmes ayant fait une h\u00e9morragie en accouchant. Le syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendu au Ghana. Il va servir aux Etats-Unis aussi pour des applications m\u00e9dicales - \u00e9chantillons pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s, m\u00e9dicaments, anti-venins.</p><p>Il faut maintenant changer d'\u00e9chelle, une probl\u00e9matique qui revient souvent dans la bouche des industriels \u00e0 Davos. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous n'avons qu'un seul ciel</emphasis>, rappelle Fang Liu, l'avocate chinoise qui dirige l'Organisation de l'aviation civile internationale.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tout le monde doit pouvoir circuler en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dedans</emphasis>\u00bb. Il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 12.000 normes pour les avions, et il va en falloir en rajouter. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pour l'instant, les bases de drones sont \u00e9loign\u00e9es des a\u00e9roports. Mais \u00e7a va forc\u00e9ment changer</emphasis>\u00bb, estime Abney dont la firme exploite 600 avions.</p><p>Il va falloir enregistrer les drones, former et certifier les pilotes, \u00e9viter les collisions, pr\u00e9server la vie priv\u00e9e. Et puis aussi communiquer, en r\u00e9duisant les temps de latence. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aujourd'hui, on sait ma\u00eetriser \u00e0 distance des engins \u00e0 200 km/h</emphasis>, rappelle Hans Vestberg, le PDG du groupe am\u00e9ricain de t\u00e9l\u00e9com Verizon.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demain, \u00e0 500 km/h. Aujourd'hui, on peut contr\u00f4ler \u00e0 distance 50.000 engins sur un kilom\u00e8tre carr\u00e9. Dans cinq ans, on pourra en contr\u00f4ler un million</emphasis>. \u00bb</p><p>Peu \u00e0 peu, la diff\u00e9rence entre l'avion et le drone va s'estomper. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L'avion sans pilote commencera par le cargo car c'est plus facile \u00e0 accepter</emphasis>\u00bb, pr\u00e9dit Gang Liu. Le ciel n'a pas fini de se remplir. Tiens, pour une fois, on n'a pas entendu parler carbone.</p><h>Le triomphe de la finance am\u00e9ricaine</h><p>La Chine sera bient\u00f4t la premi\u00e8re puissance \u00e9conomique mondiale, mais la finance reste am\u00e9ricaine. Jamais les grands acteurs de Wall Street n'ont autant m\u00e9rit\u00e9 le surnom de \u00ab ma\u00eetres du monde \u00bb, \u00e9crasant leurs concurrents par leurs valorisations stratosph\u00e9riques.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Il y a dix ans, Deutsche Bank et JP Morgan valaient la m\u00eame chose en Bourse. Aujourd'hui, le premier vaut 16 milliards et le second 420 milliards ! \u00bb</emphasis>, se lamente un financier europ\u00e9en. La messe est dite.</p><p>Au centre de Davos, Deutsche Bank avait install\u00e9 une agence pour recevoir ses clients. Sur la vitrine, ce slogan \u00e9trange pour une banque :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab La croissance est-elle une illusion ? \u00bb</emphasis>Ce qui n'est pas illusoire, c'est la domination de la finance am\u00e9ricaine depuis la crise financi\u00e8re de 2008. Elle a \u00e9limin\u00e9 la concurrence dans certains m\u00e9tiers de financement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9, impos\u00e9 ses normes et engrang\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices inou\u00efs. Avec une seule ann\u00e9e de profit (36 milliards de dollars), la banque de Jamie Dimon pourrait racheter cash la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale et Natixis...<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab En Europe, les taux n\u00e9gatifs laminent les marges des banques. Ce n'est pas le cas aux Etats-Unis \u00bb</emphasis>, explique un banquier de Citibank.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Pas facile de faire ce m\u00e9tier avec des taux n\u00e9gatifs \u00bb</emphasis>, admet Kees van Dijkhuizen, le patron d'ABN Amro. Quatre \u00e9tablissements g\u00e9ants dominent le march\u00e9 de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9conomie mondiale et ils vont tellement bien que pour le patron de Citigroup Michael Corbat, les risques sur l'emploi dans son r\u00e9seau d'agences n'est pas un sujet. Tandis qu'en Europe, la consolidation du secteur reste un mythe, l'union bancaire un projet et les effectifs des banques de d\u00e9tail un cauchemar. Un grand \u00e9cart se creuse.</p><h>Tech, conspiration et espionnage</h><p>A 89 ans, George Soros n'a rien perdu de sa verve. Chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 Davos, le financier philanthrope pousse plus loin sa croisade contre les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et Facebook en particulier. Apr\u00e8s avoir accus\u00e9 la firme de Mark Zuckerberg de cr\u00e9er l'addiction chez ses utilisateurs, il la soup\u00e7onne cette fois d'\u00eatre un alli\u00e9 de Donald Trump dans sa campagne pour sa r\u00e9\u00e9lection.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Il y a un accord informel d'assistance mutuelle entre eux, Facebook va aider Trump \u00e0 se faire r\u00e9\u00e9lire et Trump va prot\u00e9ger Facebook pour que rien ne change \u00bb</emphasis>, soutient-il, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux appels au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement lanc\u00e9s par des D\u00e9mocrates.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg, la patronne op\u00e9rationnelle de Facebook, multiplie les rencontres pour souligner les efforts que d\u00e9ploie l'empire de la tech pour lutter contre les \u00ab fake news \u00bb. Et Nick Clegg, l'ancien vice-Premier ministre de David Cameron devenu responsable des affaires publiques de Facebook, autrement dit son lobbyiste en chef, enfonce le clou :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Nous avons supprim\u00e9 plus de cinq milliards de faux comptes Facebook l'an dernier ! \u00bb</emphasis>Deux milliards de plus que l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Mais ces efforts ressemblent au ch\u00e2timent de Sisyphe dont on ne voit jamais la fin. Pour ne rien arranger, Facebook s'est retrouv\u00e9 au centre de l'attention avec l'affaire de l'espionnage du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de Jeff Bezos, l'homme le plus riche du monde, par l'Arabie Saoudite. C'est en effet via la messagerie WhatsApp, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Facebook, que le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du patron d'Amazon aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab hack\u00e9 \u00bb. Au moyen d'un message envoy\u00e9 par le prince h\u00e9ritier Ben Salmane lui-m\u00eame dans lequel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 un logiciel malveillant... La nouvelle a choqu\u00e9 les participants au Forum mais, signe de la m\u00e9fiance qu'inspirent les g\u00e9ants de la Tech, beaucoup y ont vu une nouvelle histoire d'arroseur arros\u00e9 :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab peut-on dire que le cloud de Jeff Bezos est vraiment s\u00fbr ? \u00bb</emphasis>, interrogeait un Europ\u00e9en.</p><p>Face au d\u00e9luge de critiques sur l'utilisation qu'ils font des donn\u00e9es de leurs utilisateurs, les \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb minimisent le probl\u00e8me. Chez Google, on explique que la cl\u00e9 n'est plus de r\u00e9colter le maximum de donn\u00e9es mais au contraire de \u00ab f<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">aire plus avec moins </emphasis>\u00bb. La vice-pr\u00e9sidente de Facebook pour l'Europe Nicola Mendelsohn r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le groupe a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer les normes du RGPD, le r\u00e8glement europ\u00e9en sur la protection des donn\u00e9es, dans d'autres r\u00e9gions du monde. Et tous les PDG de la tech, de Sundar Pichai (Google) \u00e0 Satya Nadella (Microsoft), r\u00e9clament une meilleure r\u00e9gulation de l'intelligence artificielle. Confiants, sans doute, dans leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 modeler les r\u00e8gles en leur faveur. La presse am\u00e9ricaine r\u00e9v\u00e9lait cette semaine que les cinq \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb avaient d\u00e9pens\u00e9 plus de 60 millions de dollars en lobbying l'an dernier \u00e0 Washington, plus du double du secteur pharmaceutique habituellement en t\u00eate.</p><h>ESG</h><p>Difficile d'avoir une conversation \u00e0 Davos sans ces trois lettres. A les en croire, les investisseurs vont faire des crit\u00e8res ESG - \u00ab environmental, social and governance \u00bb - l'alpha et l'om\u00e9ga, si l'on peut dire, de leurs d\u00e9cisions d'investissement. Pour \u00eatre convenablement valoris\u00e9e en Bourse, une entreprise devra bient\u00f4t cocher les trois cases. Mais quels sont au juste ces crit\u00e8res ? Comme il y a autant de d\u00e9finitions que d'investisseurs, Brian Moynihan, le patron de Bank of America, a entrepris d'y mettre un peu d'ordre. Une fois de plus, des normes am\u00e9ricaines sont en passe de s'imposer pour fl\u00e9cher l'\u00e9pargne.</p><p>Contributor: Envoy\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciaux \u00e0 Davos</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LECHFR-0602641792260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LECHFR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2T-6W01-F066-M2HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344678</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"42896\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>dimanche 26 janvier 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS335110 ELECTRIC LAMP BULB &amp;

Greta Thunberg. La jeune militante su\u00e9doise a point\u00e9 la direction vers laquelle a regard\u00e9 une large majorit\u00e9 des participants au 50e Forum \u00e9conomique mondial. Il faut remonter \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990 pour retrouver pareille convergence. A l'\u00e9poque, c'\u00e9tait la r\u00e9volution num\u00e9rique. Cette fois, c'est la r\u00e9volution \u00e9cologique.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tout avait pourtant mal commenc\u00e9. Les trois indicateurs publi\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ouverture du Forum n'\u00e9taient gu\u00e8re encourageants. Gita Gopinath, l'\u00e9conomiste en chef du FMI, a encore r\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 la baisse sa pr\u00e9vision de croissance pour 2020, d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 3,3 %, malgr\u00e9 une accalmie des tensions g\u00e9opolitiques. Bob Moritz, le patron du cabinet d'audit PwC, a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats de son enqu\u00eate annuelle aupr\u00e8s des PDG qui marque un \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">niveau record de pessimisme</emphasis>\u00bb, avec 53 % des dirigeants estimant que la croissance va d\u00e9cliner dans l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 venir. Et Richard Edelman, fondateur de la firme de relations publiques \u00e0 son nom, a d\u00e9voil\u00e9 son barom\u00e8tre de la confiance selon lequel 56 % des habitants de la plan\u00e8te estiment que le capitalisme fait plus de mal que de bien (34.000 personnes interrog\u00e9es dans 28 pays).</p><h>Lire aussi</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump \u00e0 Davos</p><p>Le point commun entre Davos et BlackRock</p><p>Mais il en fallait plus pour d\u00e9primer les chefs des grandes entreprises. D'abord parce qu'ils ont confiance dans la r\u00e9silience de leurs entreprises tant qu'il n'y a pas de cygne noir comme un krach financier, peu probable avec des taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat aussi bas. Ensuite et surtout parce qu'ils ont la t\u00eate ailleurs. Trois points de bascule revenaient en boucle dans les \u00e9changes. D'abord, les cinq sujets jug\u00e9s les plus dangereux dans le rapport sur les risques publi\u00e9 par l'organisation du Forum juste avant Davos \u00e9taient pour la premi\u00e8re fois tous reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l'environnement. Ensuite, la lettre annuelle de Larry Fink o\u00f9 le patron du premier gestionnaire mondial d'actifs, BlackRock, pointe l'urgence climatique et affirme qu'il va vendre les actifs tr\u00e8s li\u00e9s au charbon. Enfin, l'annonce par Microsoft non seulement que la firme va \u00e9mettre moins de carbone qu'elle n'en absorbera en 2030, mais aussi qu'elle va \u00ab ravaler \u00bb ensuite toutes ses \u00e9missions de CO2 depuis sa cr\u00e9ation. Les participants du Forum sentent qu'il va falloir changer, \u00e0 la fois vite et en profondeur. Et que les r\u00e8gles du jeu vont bouger comme jamais depuis pr\u00e8s d'un si\u00e8cle.</p><h>Tous \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole!</h><p>C'est Jim Hagemann Nasbe, le pr\u00e9sident danois du g\u00e9ant allemand Siemens, qui raconte l'histoire. Dans une entreprise, le directeur financier demande au PDG : \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Qu'est-ce qui se passe si on d\u00e9pense beaucoup d'argent pour les former et qu'apr\u00e8s ils partent ?</emphasis>\u00bb R\u00e9ponse du PDG : \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Qu'est-ce qui se passe si on ne d\u00e9pense pas d'argent pour les former et qu'apr\u00e8s ils restent ?</emphasis>\u00bb</p><p>Le d\u00e9bat sur le travail s'est d\u00e9cal\u00e9. Hier, 47 % des emplois devaient dispara\u00eetre, selon une \u00e9tude de deux chercheurs d'Oxford. Aujourd'hui, \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100 % des emplois vont changer</emphasis>\u00bb, affirme Ginni Rometty, la PDG du groupe informatique IBM. \u00ab J<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e n'ai jamais vu \u00e7a, tous les m\u00e9tiers changent</emphasis>\u00bb, lui fait \u00e9cho Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, ministre fran\u00e7aise du Travail. Une formule fait mouche : \u00ab A<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">yons plus de robots pour que nos salari\u00e9s puissent se former </emphasis>\u00bb.</p><h>Le regard de Sundar Pichai (Google)</h><p>La course \u00e0 la formation est lanc\u00e9e. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous avons form\u00e9 5 millions d'Europ\u00e9ens</emphasis>\u00bb, se vante Sundar Pichai, le patron du g\u00e9ant du Net Google. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous voulons faire de la formation \u00e0 tous les niveaux</emphasis>\u00bb, dit Pedro Sachez, le pr\u00e9sident du Conseil espagnol aur\u00e9ol\u00e9 de la constitution enfin r\u00e9ussie de son gouvernement. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ici \u00e0 Davos, nous cr\u00e9ons une plateforme public-priv\u00e9 pour donner \u00e0 un milliard de personnes les comp\u00e9tences dont elles ont besoin dans la quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9volution industrielle</emphasis>\u00bb, explique Klaus Schwab, le fondateur du Forum \u00e9conomique mondial.</p><p>Muriel P\u00e9nicaud met en avant Mon Compte Formation, l'application sur mobile r\u00e9cemment lanc\u00e9e par son minist\u00e8re, d\u00e9j\u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9e par plus d'un million de personnes. Elle raconte que le permis de conduire vient en premier choix, avec les langues. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mais les voitures seront bient\u00f4t autonomes</emphasis>\u00bb, lui r\u00e9torque le mod\u00e9rateur de la session. La question tourne dans la t\u00eate de nombreux dirigeants : former \u00e0 quoi ? Les comp\u00e9tences requises changent sans cesse. Et de plus en plus, il faut des \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">soft skills</emphasis>\u00bb, des comp\u00e9tences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et relationnelles plus difficiles \u00e0 transmettre que le savoir-faire technique. La \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r\u00e9volution de la requalification</emphasis>\u00bb voulue par le Forum reste \u00e0 inventer.</p><h>Des nuages de drone</h><p>A Davos, on aime l'innovation. Beaucoup de gens ont en t\u00eate les images des tests de drones par le g\u00e9ant am\u00e9ricain du commerce Amazon. Derri\u00e8re ce coup de marketing \u00e9merge toute une industrie. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous nous sommes rendu compte \u00e0 quel point \u00e7a allait changer les choses il y a cinq ans</emphasis>\u00bb, t\u00e9moigne David Abney, le patron du grand livreur am\u00e9ricain UPS. Une exp\u00e9rience a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9e en 2016 au Rwanda, pour transporter des poches de sang destin\u00e9es \u00e0 transfuser des femmes ayant fait une h\u00e9morragie en accouchant. Le syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendu au Ghana. Il va servir aux Etats-Unis aussi pour des applications m\u00e9dicales - \u00e9chantillons pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s, m\u00e9dicaments, anti-venins.</p><p>Il faut maintenant changer d'\u00e9chelle, une probl\u00e9matique qui revient souvent dans la bouche des industriels \u00e0 Davos. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nous n'avons qu'un seul ciel</emphasis>, rappelle Fang Liu, l'avocate chinoise qui dirige l'Organisation de l'aviation civile internationale.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tout le monde doit pouvoir circuler en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dedans</emphasis>\u00bb. Il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 12.000 normes pour les avions, et il va en falloir en rajouter. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pour l'instant, les bases de drones sont \u00e9loign\u00e9es des a\u00e9roports. Mais \u00e7a va forc\u00e9ment changer</emphasis>\u00bb, estime Abney dont la firme exploite 600 avions.</p><p>Il va falloir enregistrer les drones, former et certifier les pilotes, \u00e9viter les collisions, pr\u00e9server la vie priv\u00e9e. Et puis aussi communiquer, en r\u00e9duisant les temps de latence. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aujourd'hui, on sait ma\u00eetriser \u00e0 distance des engins \u00e0 200 km/h</emphasis>, rappelle Hans Vestberg, le PDG du groupe am\u00e9ricain de t\u00e9l\u00e9com Verizon.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Demain, \u00e0 500 km/h. Aujourd'hui, on peut contr\u00f4ler \u00e0 distance 50.000 engins sur un kilom\u00e8tre carr\u00e9. Dans cinq ans, on pourra en contr\u00f4ler un million</emphasis>. \u00bb</p><p>Peu \u00e0 peu, la diff\u00e9rence entre l'avion et le drone va s'estomper. \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L'avion sans pilote commencera par le cargo car c'est plus facile \u00e0 accepter</emphasis>\u00bb, pr\u00e9dit Gang Liu. Le ciel n'a pas fini de se remplir. Tiens, pour une fois, on n'a pas entendu parler carbone.</p><h>Le triomphe de la finance am\u00e9ricaine</h><p>La Chine sera bient\u00f4t la premi\u00e8re puissance \u00e9conomique mondiale, mais la finance reste am\u00e9ricaine. Jamais les grands acteurs de Wall Street n'ont autant m\u00e9rit\u00e9 le surnom de \u00ab ma\u00eetres du monde \u00bb, \u00e9crasant leurs concurrents par leurs valorisations stratosph\u00e9riques.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Il y a dix ans, Deutsche Bank et JP Morgan valaient la m\u00eame chose en Bourse. Aujourd'hui, le premier vaut 16 milliards et le second 420 milliards ! \u00bb</emphasis>, se lamente un financier europ\u00e9en. La messe est dite.</p><p>Au centre de Davos, Deutsche Bank avait install\u00e9 une agence pour recevoir ses clients. Sur la vitrine, ce slogan \u00e9trange pour une banque :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab La croissance est-elle une illusion ? \u00bb</emphasis>Ce qui n'est pas illusoire, c'est la domination de la finance am\u00e9ricaine depuis la crise financi\u00e8re de 2008. Elle a \u00e9limin\u00e9 la concurrence dans certains m\u00e9tiers de financement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9, impos\u00e9 ses normes et engrang\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices inou\u00efs. Avec une seule ann\u00e9e de profit (36 milliards de dollars), la banque de Jamie Dimon pourrait racheter cash la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale et Natixis...<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab En Europe, les taux n\u00e9gatifs laminent les marges des banques. Ce n'est pas le cas aux Etats-Unis \u00bb</emphasis>, explique un banquier de Citibank.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Pas facile de faire ce m\u00e9tier avec des taux n\u00e9gatifs \u00bb</emphasis>, admet Kees van Dijkhuizen, le patron d'ABN Amro. Quatre \u00e9tablissements g\u00e9ants dominent le march\u00e9 de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9conomie mondiale et ils vont tellement bien que pour le patron de Citigroup Michael Corbat, les risques sur l'emploi dans son r\u00e9seau d'agences n'est pas un sujet. Tandis qu'en Europe, la consolidation du secteur reste un mythe, l'union bancaire un projet et les effectifs des banques de d\u00e9tail un cauchemar. Un grand \u00e9cart se creuse.</p><h>Tech, conspiration et espionnage</h><p>A 89 ans, George Soros n'a rien perdu de sa verve. Chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 Davos, le financier philanthrope pousse plus loin sa croisade contre les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et Facebook en particulier. Apr\u00e8s avoir accus\u00e9 la firme de Mark Zuckerberg de cr\u00e9er l'addiction chez ses utilisateurs, il la soup\u00e7onne cette fois d'\u00eatre un alli\u00e9 de Donald Trump dans sa campagne pour sa r\u00e9\u00e9lection.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Il y a un accord informel d'assistance mutuelle entre eux, Facebook va aider Trump \u00e0 se faire r\u00e9\u00e9lire et Trump va prot\u00e9ger Facebook pour que rien ne change \u00bb</emphasis>, soutient-il, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux appels au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement lanc\u00e9s par des D\u00e9mocrates.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg, la patronne op\u00e9rationnelle de Facebook, multiplie les rencontres pour souligner les efforts que d\u00e9ploie l'empire de la tech pour lutter contre les \u00ab fake news \u00bb. Et Nick Clegg, l'ancien vice-Premier ministre de David Cameron devenu responsable des affaires publiques de Facebook, autrement dit son lobbyiste en chef, enfonce le clou :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Nous avons supprim\u00e9 plus de cinq milliards de faux comptes Facebook l'an dernier ! \u00bb</emphasis>Deux milliards de plus que l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Mais ces efforts ressemblent au ch\u00e2timent de Sisyphe dont on ne voit jamais la fin. Pour ne rien arranger, Facebook s'est retrouv\u00e9 au centre de l'attention avec l'affaire de l'espionnage du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de Jeff Bezos, l'homme le plus riche du monde, par l'Arabie Saoudite. C'est en effet via la messagerie WhatsApp, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Facebook, que le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du patron d'Amazon aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab hack\u00e9 \u00bb. Au moyen d'un message envoy\u00e9 par le prince h\u00e9ritier Ben Salmane lui-m\u00eame dans lequel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9 un logiciel malveillant... La nouvelle a choqu\u00e9 les participants au Forum mais, signe de la m\u00e9fiance qu'inspirent les g\u00e9ants de la Tech, beaucoup y ont vu une nouvelle histoire d'arroseur arros\u00e9 :<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab peut-on dire que le cloud de Jeff Bezos est vraiment s\u00fbr ? \u00bb</emphasis>, interrogeait un Europ\u00e9en.</p><p>Face au d\u00e9luge de critiques sur l'utilisation qu'ils font des donn\u00e9es de leurs utilisateurs, les \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb minimisent le probl\u00e8me. Chez Google, on explique que la cl\u00e9 n'est plus de r\u00e9colter le maximum de donn\u00e9es mais au contraire de \u00ab f<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">aire plus avec moins </emphasis>\u00bb. La vice-pr\u00e9sidente de Facebook pour l'Europe Nicola Mendelsohn r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le groupe a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer les normes du RGPD, le r\u00e8glement europ\u00e9en sur la protection des donn\u00e9es, dans d'autres r\u00e9gions du monde. Et tous les PDG de la tech, de Sundar Pichai (Google) \u00e0 Satya Nadella (Microsoft), r\u00e9clament une meilleure r\u00e9gulation de l'intelligence artificielle. Confiants, sans doute, dans leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 modeler les r\u00e8gles en leur faveur. La presse am\u00e9ricaine r\u00e9v\u00e9lait cette semaine que les cinq \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb avaient d\u00e9pens\u00e9 plus de 60 millions de dollars en lobbying l'an dernier \u00e0 Washington, plus du double du secteur pharmaceutique habituellement en t\u00eate.</p><h>ESG</h><p>Difficile d'avoir une conversation \u00e0 Davos sans ces trois lettres. A les en croire, les investisseurs vont faire des crit\u00e8res ESG - \u00ab environmental, social and governance \u00bb - l'alpha et l'om\u00e9ga, si l'on peut dire, de leurs d\u00e9cisions d'investissement. Pour \u00eatre convenablement valoris\u00e9e en Bourse, une entreprise devra bient\u00f4t cocher les trois cases. Mais quels sont au juste ces crit\u00e8res ? Comme il y a autant de d\u00e9finitions que d'investisseurs, Brian Moynihan, le patron de Bank of America, a entrepris d'y mettre un peu d'ordre. Une fois de plus, des normes am\u00e9ricaines sont en passe de s'imposer pour fl\u00e9cher l'\u00e9pargne.</p><p>Contributor: Envoy\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciaux \u00e0 Davos</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LECHFR-334610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LECHFR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y31-5YM1-JCR4-X1G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344678</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"42896\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>dimanche 26 janvier 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS335110 ELECTRIC LAMP BULB &amp;

Orrin Hatch       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/orrin-hatch-antitrust-hipster-antitrust/\"> lamented </url> the rise of  hipster antitrust.  A new cadre of Republican senators have taken their place ardent conservatives united with their left-wing counterparts in contempt for Silicon Valley s pervasive influence on society, and increasingly willing to flex the federal government s muscle to make life tough for Facebook, Google, and other tech platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The movement includes new arrivals Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn, along with old hands like Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz. And their strident anti-tech advocacy is attracting Democratic interest while sidelining Senate Republicans with traditionally conservative views of government s role in the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The discussion on tech monopolies during a Tuesday hearing of the Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee illustrates the extent of the shift. In his opening remarks, subcommittee chairman Mike Lee said he shared the concerns of his colleagues when it came to content moderation, privacy, and the alleged discrimination against conservatives by tech platforms.</p><p> What I don t share is the enthusiasm for using antitrust to address these problems,  the Utah Republican continued.  Calls for stricter antitrust enforcement are too often abstract. ... Weaponizing antitrust enforcement to police subjective concerns, rather than the objective concern for consumers, would have very broad and serious repercussions. </p><p>But of the three Republicans and three Democrats on the panel, Lee was alone in warning against the dangers of overzealous antitrust activity. Hawley, meanwhile, joined his Democratic peers in pushing for a federal crackdown on the concentration of power in Silicon Valley. </p><p> Is it really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity, when these companies behave in the way that they do when they spy on their consumers, when they take data without disclosing it, when they use it for things that consumers have not approved?  Hawley said.  Unless their behavior changes, I can t imagine that pressure will stop. And it shouldn t. </p><p>It s tempting to view Hawley a former state attorney general who s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-08/josh-hawley-s-missouri-senate-bid-could-be-a-problem-for-google\"> tangled </url> with Google in the past as an isolated case. But Graham, the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, shares Hawley s desire for vigorous antitrust action.</p><p> This is the wild, wild West, and let s bring something,  Graham told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>last week, citing Hawley, Cruz, and Blackburn as Republicans who share his outlook.  I don t know if the European model is the right model, but something s gotta happen. And yeah, I m going to unleash these people on them. </p><p>The mere consideration of Europe s regulatory model by Graham the EU imposed a tough new data-privacy regime last year, and its antitrust model is historically more aggressive than anything pursued by U.S. regulators bodes poorly for both Silicon Valley and Republicans, like Lee, who want to pump the brakes on such talk. </p><p> Senator Lee agrees that the conduct of tech companies is troubling,  Lee spokesman Conn Carroll wrote in an email.  The debate is relatively narrow which policy tool is the most appropriate? </p><p>Though less explicitly than Hawley, Blackburn and Cruz have both expressed a desire to bring the hammer down on Silicon Valley. Blackburn tag-teamed a skeptical line of questioning aimed at tech lobbyists with Sen. Amy Klobuchar during a privacy hearing last week, suggesting she doesn t trust the industry s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/677008/tech-industry-comes-around-to-strong-privacy-bill-but-senators-still-skeptical\"> newfound support </url> for strong privacy rules. And Cruz in the same hearing railed about alleged bias against conservative viewpoints at Facebook, Google, and Twitter, suggesting that the Department of Justice  ought to be looking at this question very closely. </p><p>Though somewhat wary of their motives, Senate Democrats like Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal are delighted their conservative peers are advancing strong privacy and antitrust actions to target big tech.</p><p> Senator Hawley is right,  Blumenthal said during Tuesday s hearing.  There is a lot of pressure because of the abusive practices that are made possible by the market power that these companies have gained.  Blumenthal later told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>he saw an alliance  both on privacy and on monopolistic power  forming between Democrats and some Republicans.</p><p> I m glad there s Republican interest,  said Klobuchar, who also made an effort to highlight Hawley's and Blackburn s sympathetic views during Tuesday s hearing. But she expressed concern over their repeated invocation of Silicon Valley s alleged anti-conservative bias as a primary driver of their anxiety.</p><p> I think when they focus on the political angle, like Trump has, you do a disservice to actually moving on some of the real consumer issues,  Klobuchar said.</p><p>These Senate Republicans have sought to frame their aggressive approach to big tech as the conservative position, with Hawley in particular claiming to back the small-business heartland against giant, well-connected corporations. But his position is already receiving pushback from some conservative quarters.</p><p>During a session at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, Hawley fended off a series of skeptical questions on his plans for the tech industry from Kimberley Strassel, a conservative columnist at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wall Street Journal</emphasis>. Strassel noted that President Trump s antitrust chief Makan Delrahim has repeatedly said America s largest tech companies aren t monopolies.  He might want to check in with his new boss on that,  Hawley shot back, referencing the concerns raised by Attorney General William Barr about Silicon Valley s concentration of power during his recent confirmation hearing.</p><p>Right-leaning tech advocates are also concerned by the shift, though some say it s driven more by a changing guard in the Commerce and Judiciary Committees than a broader about-face in Republican ideology.  I think what you re seeing, really, is just a change in composition in Republican leadership, not necessarily a change in kind of the mainstream thinking on this,  said Will Rinehart, the director of technology and innovation policy at American Action Forum.</p><p>But Robert Reich, who served as secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> that a privacy and antitrust clampdown against big tech is a  natural area  for Republicans and conservatives.  I am quite surprised that they haven t taken it up until now,  he said.</p><p>Hawley and his populist counterparts in the Senate will likely continue to influence progress on a privacy bill, for which a separate, bipartisan group of four senators is expected to soon release a draft. The populist impact on antitrust is less certain because it s the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission that will ultimately decide how aggressively to police market concentration in the tech industry. </p><p>Reich, a former FTC official, said the agencies are likely to take their cues from Congress on the issue. </p><p> They are sensitive to the direction that the wind is blowing,  he said.  And a series of hearings like this, with senators from both sides of the aisle expressing real concerns about this industry, will light a fire. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-677171</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKJ-R2D1-JBNW-3472-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1245\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Mike Lee used his new Parler account to tout the fight he's picking with Google, Facebook, Twitter and Squarespace over how each internet platform moderates content in general, and potentially targets conservative voices</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Somehow, I'm willing to be(t) this will get more likes and shares on Parer (sic) than it will on Facebook and Twitter combined. In any event, I picked a big fight today with Google, Facebook, and Twitter,\" Lee posted to his @SenMikeLee Parler account Thursday evening.</p><p>Parler has emerged as the social media darling of some conservative U.S. politicians and commentators, and Lee has even worked to pump up the platform by issuing an invitation to President Donald Trump to join the party. Ironically, that invitation was proffered on Twitter, where the president enjoys a follower list north of 80 million accounts.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Parler was not one of the addressees of Lee's letter Thursday that instead went to the CEOs of Google, Facebook, Twitter and Squarespace.</p><p>Lee, who earlier this week announced the Senate antitrust committee he chairs will host a hearing focused on Google and its online advertising practices, said he is most concerned with company conduct he believes is based on political bias rather than consistent, across-the-board content policies.</p><p>\"I am specifically concerned about corporations wielding their power unilaterally to silence opinions they dislike, and thus warp the public debates their platforms present to the American people,\" Lee wrote. \"In recent years, conservative voices like The Federalist, PragerU, President Trump, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, Jr., churches, religious groups, Christian schools and others have found themselves deplatformed, demonetized or otherwise penalized for expressing their opinions.\"</p><p>Lee's concerns mirror some lines of questioning that arose during a House antitrust hearing this week that featured the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.</p><p>During that virtual hearing, Congressman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio reeled off a list of instances of purported censoring of, or content warnings issued to, conservative social media posters.</p><p>Jordan accused the group of tech executives of selectively censoring those expressing politically conservative opinions and cautioned them that \"If it doesn't end, there have to be consequences.\"</p><p>Lee issued his own admonishment of big tech companies and the power he says they're using inappropriately.</p><p>\"I view your heavy-handed censorship as a sign of exactly the sort of degraded quality one expects from a monopolist,\" Lee wrote. \"In any other business you would never dream of treating your customers the way you treat those with views you don't like.\"</p><p>In another Parler post on Thursday evening, Utah's senior senator linked to a story posted by right-wing website Breitbart News claiming Google has been censoring the outlet's content from search results since the 2016 election. Attached to the post was Lee's comment, \"This is not ok, and it has to stop.\"</p><p>In his letter, Lee also called out tech leaders for their roles in taking down video content that circulated earlier this week that showed what was characterized as a press conference by a group calling itself \"America's Frontline Doctors.\"</p><p>CNN reported that the video, which had not been viewed by the Deseret News, was published by Breitbart News and included a quote from a woman claiming to be a doctor who said \"This virus has a cure, it's called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,\" and \"You don't need masks, there is a cure.\"</p><p>Lee declined to take a position on the content of the video, but said he supported a social media arena of open dialogue.</p><p>\"While I'm not in a position to endorse or refute any of the doctors' comments, I believe that we should err on the side of encouraging more speech, not less,\" Lee wrote.</p><p>The heart of the letter goes to 11 questions seeking details of how each of the platforms manages content moderation in the stipulated areas of COVID-19; violent riots and how they are distinguished from peaceful protests; hate speech; protections of the unborn; misinformation; and terrorist influence.</p><p>The questions include how content standards are established, the scope of processes designed to screen moderators for bias, whether user consent about content moderation is appropriately established, if platforms coordinate with each other on content moderation and other issues.</p><p>Deseret News requests for comment via email and social media direct messaging to Google, Facebook, Twitter and Squarespace were not immediately responded to.</p><p>While Lee rattled the saber of bringing antitrust regulations to bear on the behaviors of U.S. tech monoliths, Sen. Mitt Romney struck a somewhat more measured tone in comments he made Thursday at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.</p><p>\"I know there's great interest, sometimes politically, to go after some of the big tech companies, Google, Amazon and so forth and Facebook, and berate them for their market power,\" Romney said. \"And if they violate American antitrust laws, why, that's totally appropriate.</p><p>\"But I would note that we're in a global competition. And China has been successful in driving a lot of Western companies out of business. They've not been successful in driving companies like these out of business. These are thriving and succeeding. The last thing we ought to be doing is trying to knock down businesses in the United States that are succeeding on a global stage.\"</p><p>Romney referenced the U.S. dominance, thus far, of China when it comes to innovation industries but cautioned against overreach when it comes to the companies that have solidified the country's current high tech upper hand.</p><p>\"So, we need to be careful not to flex our muscle to berate those entities that are successful and are beating China,\" Romney said. \"Alibaba would like to replace Amazon. TikTok would like to replace Instagram. It just an area of concern.\"</p><p>EMAIL: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-51921932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-9V21-DY6J-M0MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1005\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Fintech forecast: What effects would the administration of President Joe Biden have on companies seeking to disrupt traditional financial services with new technology?</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. GOP antitrust leaders solidify opposition to new laws aimed at Big Tech</p><p>Much of the so-called techlash in Washington since the 2016 presidential election has revolved around the question of whether giant technology companies have grown too big or powerful to be governed by today's antitrust laws, meant to protect consumers and ensure competition.</p><p>Many Democrats in Congress have come around to the idea that new antitrust laws may be a good way to rein in companies that they believe pose a threat to both the economy and American democracy.</p><p>Where the average Republican stands, meanwhile, has been more difficult to read. </p><p>GOP lawmakers have agreed to Democratic efforts to investigate Big Tech companies for possible antitrust violations and they participated in this summer's House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing with the chief executives of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company. </p><p>But for the most part, their questions weren't about antitrust, as lawmakers used the opportunity to air a host of unrelated grievances -- namely alleged anti-conservative bias on social media. Late in the hearing, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's top Republican, made clear his opposition to using antitrust to rein in Big Tech.</p><p>\"History shows that Congress does a poor job of picking winners and losers,\" he said. \"I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws.\"</p><p>With Sensenbrenner now on the record, attention turned to Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who chairs the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. Lee has been critical of Silicon Valley in the past and says he shares the concerns of his House colleagues over anti-conservative bias. But he had not weighed in since the House hearing in late July.</p><p>At a subcommittee hearing on Tuesday meant to examine whether Google's advertising policies undermine competition in the online marketplace, Lee lamented what he believes is a growing chasm in the antitrust world between those who \"would want no antitrust laws\" and others who would \"cast aside evidence\" in order to use antitrust laws to solve social, economic, or racial disparities.</p><p>As for where he stands, Lee said \"maintaining the antitrust laws is important and I believe the current laws are for the most part sufficient to meet the challenges of the day.\"</p><p>\"Attempts to repurpose antitrust law into a social justice program would have scores of unintended consequences that would cripple our economy for generations,\" he said.</p><p>Although Sensenbrenner is retiring, his and Lee's opposition to new antitrust laws speaks volumes about the GOP stance. With the debate in antitrust law pitting adherents of conservative legal icon Robert Bork against devotees of liberal former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Republicans are proving dependably pro-business despite their other problems with Silicon Valley.</p><p>2. Iranian company was front for government hackers, Treasury Department says</p><p>The Treasury Department on Thursday announced sanctions against an Iranian technology company accused of acting as a front for the Iranian government as it used malware to attack dissidents and journalists considered a threat by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security.</p><p>The sanctions, announced by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, also target 45 individuals associated with the company Rana Intelligence Computing Co., and the cyber threat group within the Iranian ministry dubbed by the U.S. government Advanced Persistent Threat 39, or APT-39.</p><p>\"The Iranian regime uses its Intelligence Ministry as a tool to target innocent civilians and companies, and advance its destabilizing agenda around the world,\" Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \"The United States is determined to counter offensive cyber campaigns designed to jeopardize security and inflict damage on the international travel sector.\"</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the individuals sanctioned used Rana to target Iranian private sector firms as well as \"former government employees, environmentalists, refugees, university students and faculty, and employees at international nongovernmental organizations.\"</p><p>\"Some of these individuals were subjected to arrest and physical and psychological intimidation by the [Iranian government],\" Pompeo said. \"Today's action is another reminder of the great risk that the Iranian regime poses to international cybersecurity as well as to the Iranian people, who face the continued threat of digital darkness and high-tech silencing.\"</p><p>In an effort to render APT39's malware tools useless, the FBI published source code and intrusion indicators for eight unique malware programs used by the group.</p><p>3. U.S. charges Chinese, Malaysian hackers with targeting 100 companies globally</p><p>The Justice Department this week brought charges against seven hackers -- five Chinese and two Malaysians who aided them -- accusing them of stealing source code and other information from 100 companies around the world, including the United States.</p><p>The two Malaysian hackers were arrested by the country's authorities based on U.S. grand jury indictments and arrest warrants, the department said. </p><p>The five Chinese hackers were part of a group affiliated with the country's government, code-named APT-41, that \"facilitated the theft of source code, software code signing certificates, customer account data, and valuable business information,\" the department said, adding that the two Malaysians were businessmen affiliated with two of the Chinese hackers and who profited from targeting the video game industry in the United States and abroad.</p><p>\"Today's charges, the related arrests, seizures of malware and other infrastructure used to conduct intrusions, and coordinated private sector protective actions reveal yet again the department's determination to use all of the tools at its disposal and to collaborate with the private sector and nations who support the rule of law in cyberspace,\" Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers said in a statement. \"This is the only way to neutralize malicious nation state cyber activity.\"</p><p>Three of the five Chinese hackers were affiliated with Chengdu 404 Network Technology, a company operated by the Chinese government, the department said.</p><p>The hackers also targeted companies, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, according to the department. </p><p>The defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India and Vietnam, the department said, adding that the hackers conducted a ransomware attack on a nonprofit combating global poverty.</p><p>The Chinese hackers also carried out supply-chain attacks \"in which the hackers compromised software providers and then modified the providers' code to facilitate further intrusions against the software providers' customers,\" the department said.</p><p>The two Malaysian hackers targeted video game companies in the United States, France, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea, according to the department.</p><p> -  Gopal Ratnam </p><p>4. What would a Biden White House mean for fintech?</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden's steady lead in the polls is forcing the financial technology industry to prepare for how his nascent administration would handle fintech policy, my colleague Jim Saksa writes.</p><p>Biden's campaign hasn't said much specifically about financial technology, but its ideas on traditional financial services -- credit reporting, redlining, access to banking services -- could have a profound impact on the companies that have eroded the strength of big financial institutions by using technology to encroach on their territory.</p><p>The fintech sector is overwhelmingly backing Biden in terms of campaign contributions, although the amounts pale compared with its bigger and older siblings in technology and finance, which are also betting big on the White House going blue in November.</p><p>For example, PayPal's employees and affiliates have given $263,300 so far in 2020 across all federal races, including $34,400 for Biden and $5,100 for President Donald Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A CQ Roll Call review of other major fintechs finds similar margins at firms like Intuit Inc., Square Inc. and Stripe Inc.</p><p>For comparison, affiliates of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, have given the former vice president more than $1 million and Trump just under $30,000, while JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. affiliates have supported Biden over Trump to the tune of $255,700 to $77,500.</p><p>The Biden campaign has released relatively little in the way of plans for the technology and finance sectors, let alone for the fintech niche -- although it's far more than what's been released by Trump, whose platform is a continuation of his \"Make America Great Again\" agenda. </p><p>But Biden has said enough on certain issues to expect some big policy shifts, said Diego Zuluaga, a Cato Institute researcher focusing on fintech.</p><p>\"I think the change could potentially be very substantial,\" said Zuluaga, pointing to Biden's support for a public credit-reporting agency that would compete with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, as well as calls to reinstate fair-lending regulations, like the ability-to-repay rule, that Trump appointees rolled back.</p><p>Those changes could fall heavily on fintech lenders that have marketed themselves as cheaper alternatives to high-cost, small-dollar lenders, even as some consumer advocates say the fintechs are no different from the payday lenders they seek to disrupt.</p><p>\"I do worry about attempts to equalize access to credit, even though well-intentioned, that could lead to fintechs leaving certain segments of the market,\" Zuluaga said.</p><p>Read Jim's full report on Biden and fintech here. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ Roll Call's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

I'm going to recharge my battery for the biggest, most important election in our lifetime. I'll see you after Labor Day. Let not your heart be troubled. Pete Hegseth in for Laura.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pete, how are you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST: Sean, you've earned the break, and your book sold 30 times more copies than mine did. So, congratulations.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. But you know what? I don't care. You look a lot cooler on your cover than I did on mine. That's all I can say. If I could--</p><p>HEGSETH: If only--</p><p>HANNITY: If I could match that, I would have put it on the cover. I can't top that.</p><p>HEGSETH: You've got another one in you, Sean, and we'll be ready for it. Come on.</p><p>HANNITY: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No. No.</p><p>HEGSETH: I've got a guy.</p><p>HANNITY: No. No. No.</p><p>HEGSETH: I got a tattoo guy.</p><p>HANNITY: No. Listen. I love seeing you in primetime. It's kind of hard.

Thank you very much.</p><p>HANNITY: Awesome.</p><p>HEGSETH: The biggest thing I have to get to is saying good evening instead of good morning. It is the evening.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HANNITY: Yes, that's right.</p><p>HEGSETH: I'm used to that. So we'll start. But Sean, thank you very much. Great show.</p><p>So I will start that way. Good evening. I'm Pete Hegseth in for Laura Ingraham, and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from New York live tonight. We have a lot more from Laura's exclusive interview with the President in just moments, including his concerns about mail-in ballots. Will we see Melania on the trail? And what do you think of Joe Biden trying to blame him over football being canceled? Plus, the President tells Laura why he suggested that he and Biden be drug-tested ahead of the debates.</p><p>And in moments, I'll speak to Ken Cuccinelli about the warning the Department of Homeland Security just sent to City of Portland, the lawless city. And Donald Trump Jr. is here with the reaction to the President's visit to Kenosha today, and he'll respond to Nancy Pelosi's hyper hypocritical maskless salon visit.</p><p>But first, Democrats have long griped that while Donald Trump may technically be Commander-in-Chief, he doesn't try to be the President of all Americans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: These are American cities. But Trump doesn't see himself as President for all of America.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They see two different Americas. They really don't want to do anything more than just focus on these two visions of America.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): It is time for a president that represents all of America, including people in the middle of this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: OK. Well, of course, the left doesn't want all Americans to look to Trump for leadership. That would be bad for them politically. So that's why when Trump first planned to meet with victims of rioting and looting in Kenosha, the media tried framing his efforts as divisive and a distraction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now, President Trump is wrapping up his visit in Kenosha, Wisconsin after defying local officials wishes and visiting the city--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The President is visiting Wisconsin this afternoon despite repeatedly being asked not to come.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wasn't invited, and local officials say he isn't welcome.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: And in typical fashion, the media's narrative about how Kenoshans don't want the President to visit, well, it's not necessarily connected to facts on the ground. Seven Kenosha County board supervisors sent a letter to the President yesterday, begging him not to cancel his trip to the besieged city. And at a meeting with the President today, Kenosha Sheriff said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID BETH, KENOSHA COUNTY SHERIFF: I said I didn't care who I got help from, I wanted resources here. And after it was approved and I got the word that the President said whatever you need, it's coming - I probably shouldn't share this, but some people that were in Portland that weren't treated as good as they were treated here, and they said we can't believe what a different place this is because of how we all worked together rather than not wanting to work together at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, that's right. They don't want him there. And for his part, the President made clear that his administration will not leave the city, its businesses, its citizens in town (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We'll be talking to you. We're going to be helping you with law enforcement. We're going to be helping you with some economic development, get - get it back in shape, get Kenosha back in shape. And we'll get it back in - I think, very quickly. I really think so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: So let's break this down a little bit. It's easy to see what's going on here. President Trump campaigned in the area around Kenosha in 2016. In doing so, he became the first Republican to win this city in 44 years. Democrats can't afford for that to happen again. So they and their media lackeys tried their hardest to thwart this trip. They were unsuccessful.</p><p>Joining me now exclusively is Donald Trump Jr., Executive Vice President of The Trump Organization and author of the brand-new book, \"Liberal Privilege.\"</p><p>Don, thank you so much for being here. Congrats on the book. We'll get to that in a moment for sure. But it's apparent what the left is trying to do here. They want to stand in the way of your father offering support for the cities that Democrat leaders refuse to address.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP JR., \"LIBERAL PRIVILEGE\" AUTHOR &amp; EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: 100 percent, Pete. I mean, it's disgusting. You've seen Democrat states with Democrat governors, Democrat-run cities with Democrat mayors and Democrat city councils. But it's Donald Trump's fault that they had 100 years of failure. It's really crazy.</p><p>I mean, this is the first time in modern American history and probably American history where you get in trouble, you get arrested or you get fined or you could lose your business license for opening up your business to put food on your family's table. But if you loot someone else's business, that's fine, that's totally acceptable.</p><p>I saw - for one week, I watched the DNC, that sort of I-hate-America Zoom call that was the DNC, and I didn't see one person, not one - and they can fact-check me on this - that condemned the riots, that condemned the looting--</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, you're right.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: --or the violence going on in these cities. They didn't address it. You know when they addressed it? When CNN and Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon said, oh, man, it's really affecting them in the polling. The next day, all of a sudden, we went from a narrative of these are all peaceful protests, there are no riots, to these riots are somehow Donald Trump's fault.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: It's asinine, but that's the problem. That's why I wrote \"Liberal Privilege.\" It talks about exactly that, which is if you're a Democrat, you can do and say anything. You can--</p><p>HEGSETH: We're going to get--</p><p>TRUMP JR.: --not be held accountable for your actions. You can flip-flop whenever you want and the media will carry your water and tell you that you're right and sell that to the American people.</p><p>HEGSETH: We're going to get to a portion of it in a moment, Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco. It's amazing. You can't, but you got to believe your lying eyes. But the - it is Joe Biden who's trying to flip the script here. He was in Pittsburgh saying, \"Does anyone believe that there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?\" He's saying, hey, he's the Commander-in-Chief, there is violence happening, therefore it must be his fault. Of course, the media will echo that. What's the strongest rhetoric to that?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Yes. Well, I think it's insane. No one said that about Obama when you had the Ferguson riots or Orlando or the numerous riots there. They will do anything that's negative against Donald Trump. The reality is Joe Biden almost said nothing about these things. He sat there. There must be tacit acceptance because these are Biden voters.</p><p>These are Democrat voters that are out there doing this. You don't see the conservatives burning down businesses. You don't see conservatives getting attack - attacking others for doing - wearing a MAGA hat. Imagine wearing a MAGA hat in Portland. Now, you could wear a Biden hat in any city in the country, and no one would do anything. That's the difference. That's the double-standard.</p><p>Joe Biden himself said the other day. Well, he was going to stay in his basement bunker for another 10 days before addressing it, until the polling issue came out. And then all of a sudden, he said, oh, I'm now - I may have to leave the bunker 10 days early. 10 days? To act as a president? This guy wants to lead our country?</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes-</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HEGSETH: --the basement.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: This guy isn't fit to lead a kindergarten class.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HEGSETH: Don, the Bible of that left-wing double-standard, of course, is the failing \"New York Times.\" They had - they ran this shameful story. Look at this headline. It said, \"As right-wing groups increasingly move to confront protesters in U.S. cities, demonstrators are assessing how to keep themselves safe.\" So, Don, help me with this. Don't you feel sorry for the left-wing anarchists who just want to riot and now murder in peace?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Yes. 100 percent. You know what? Obviously, I don't feel bad for the business owner, the small business owner whose family business of four years--</p><p>HEGSETH: Exactly.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: --was burned down. They deserve it. NPR, Pete - NPR, National Public Radio, your taxpayer-funded dollars are going to someone who wrote an article on NPR saying, the defense of looting, they are trying to justify it.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Again, these are not conservatives doing this. They are Joe Biden voters burning down their cities. And then we're supposed to be sympathetic to a looter, to a rioter, to an arsonist? Not the small business--</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: --that was destroyed whose livelihoods were ruined? Again, it's the first time in American history where you get ticketed for going to church but not for going to commit arson or felony crimes. It's insane.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HEGSETH: Well - not even that, but you might get the Biden campaign or Kamala Harris's staff to actually donate to your fund to get you out of jail. You can't make this stuff up. But you talk about liberal--</p><p>TRUMP JR.: 100 percent. I mean, Kamala Harris was still encouraging that.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, absolutely. You talk about \"Liberal Privilege\" though. I don't actually know how Nancy Pelosi could explain this one away. She's in San Francisco. Everyone is locked down. Salons are closed. You have to wear a mask. But she went to her own private salon without a mask to get her hair blown out. Caught on tape because the salon owner who's a single mom, two kids, no income right now, has been shut down, says I've got to release this tape because I can't believe that she would - she called it a slap in the face. This is - this type of behavior is--</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH: --exactly the theme of your book. It's exactly - they can get away with whatever they want. But you, the average person, no salon for you.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: No. There's a different set of rules, and that's the reality. The media has decided to be activists for the left. They are not objective. They don't even have a pretense about objectivity anymore. So when you look at Joe Biden's 50-year career in Washington, D.C., Pete, 50 years, that's a half a century. They're pretending like there is nothing there between the brain aneurysms, which could probably explain why he can't remember where he is 50 percent of the time. We can't touch that.</p><p>The terrible decisions on racial issues, the terrible decisions on trade, TPP, NAFTA, permanent trade status for China in the World Trade Organization, Joe Biden has done more damage and destruction to the American middle class and American manufacturing than likely any human being alive. And yet he is treated as though he's somehow a hero of those people. It's liberal privilege at its finest.</p><p>So the book was there to talk about all of the things that the media should be doing, should be telling the American people. But they refuse because they realize it's - it would work against their leftist narrative. So I figured someone has to put pen to paper and write it for Americans. So this is more for independents, people who haven't made up their mind. Once you realize how flagrant the hypocrisy is, how bad it is, how bad this guy's policies have been, you're obviously going to be a Trump voter.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, they just - and one you missed, which we don't have time to get to, is fracking. He's going to the trail saying I never said that and there's mountains of tape of him talking about how he wants to end fracking.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH: The book is \"Liberal Privilege.\" You can get it at anywhere books are sold. What's your website as well, Don? Folks can buy it directly.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Donjr.com. I know some of the guys - it's available everywhere, but donjr.com for those who don't want to go to the big tech guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP JR.: I did that and people have really liked it. So, donjr.com.</p><p>HEGSETH: People just want an option to go somewhere else. Don Jr., thank you very much. Congrats.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Thank you, Pete.</p><p>HEGSETH: All right. For more than three months, Portland has been under siege from left-wing radicals. And what has Mayor Ted Wheeler done about it? Well, nothing. In fact, worse than nothing. He's gone out of his way to attack the President and he's refused federal help to try to restore law and order. The Trump administration has finally had enough and is firing back.</p><p>DHS Secretary Chad Wolf writing this in a letter to Wheeler. \"I urge you to prioritize public safety and to request federal assistance to restore law and order in Portland. President Trump has made it abundantly clear that there will come a point when state and local officials fail to protect its citizens from violence, the federal government will have no choice but to protect our American citizens.\"</p><p>Remember those, citizens, that should be protected?</p><p>Joining me now is Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli.</p><p>Ken, straight up, how close is Portland to the point where federal officers will have to be sent to actually end these riots?</p><p>KEN CUCCINELLI, DHS ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY: Well, we saw Governor Brown there make a sort of stab at at least telling us she had a plan how to deal with it. That fell apart very quickly. But the fact that she's even moving now when she hasn't in three months employed her National Guard, over 7,800 national guardsmen in the Oregon National Guard, and you saw how quickly that worked in Kenosha. It's been available all along.</p><p>And in fact, even Portland's terrible mayor, Ted Wheeler, requested the guard in early June, and Governor Brown turned him down. So they have the tools there, and we're seeing movement by the Governor, who's clearly getting uncomfortable now for all the reasons you've already cited--</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: --earlier tonight. That we think maybe we're going to finally get some action that will stick. She sent state troopers in for two weeks and then they left. And we've seen the continuing of rioting, even attacks- -</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: --on Mayor Wheeler's own condo.</p><p>HEGSETH: Ken, we have indeed. In fact, you alluded to the previous plan. Two counties that were asked to send law enforcement said there's no political support--</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Right.</p><p>HEGSETH: --for public safety. We're not going to send additional law enforcement if they're not going to be properly backed. Attorney General Bill Barr was in Kenosha today talking about the deeper aspect of investigations into what's happening. We're going to play what Bill Barr had to say and get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: We were picking up information that these violent instigators were coming to Kenosha. They were coming from California, Washington State, a lot from Chicago. And out of 175 arrests, 100 were from out of town. These are the same people using the same tactics that have been used in various cities, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Chicago, now Kenosha, Portland.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: So, Ken, if these anarchists, antifa, Black Lives Matter activists, whatever label you want to use, if they're crossing state lines, does it make it a federal issue, and can the DHS step in?</p><p>CUCCINELLI: It definitely begins to invoke new federal jurisdiction that isn't available for people within their own state. So in Portland, well over 90 percent of the arrests are of people who live in that area, very high percentage. You just heard the Attorney General talk about the fact that over half of the arrests in Kenosha are not from Kenosha. And in fact, many of those - most of those are from other states.</p><p>And so, yes, if you're crossing state lines, if you're communicating across state lines for the purpose of setting up rioting, that does invoke federal jurisdiction. And the Department of Justice has advanced over 200 officers to Kenosha. We have some from DHS there. But that's - that's a major factor in expanding federal opportunities for investigation. And I should note, there are already hundreds of investigations running related to the violence all over the country.</p><p>HEGSETH: The Democrats are in hyper-drive here trying to place the blame somewhere else. Here is Democrat Congressman from California, Ted Lieu, on MSNBC on Sunday. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TED LIEU (D-CA): Donald Trump is the sitting President of the United States. The violence and chaos we're seeing in Portland and Kenosha, Wisconsin is happening under his watch. And you can draw a straight line between some of his actions and words in this violence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: How do you address the issue when the other side is blaming the President who has clearly and consistently said I want to bring law-and- order and end this?</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Yes. Truth is an awfully tough opponent for Congressman Lieu. And you look at the narratives rolling out of June into July in Portland alone, they said, oh, the feds showed up and so they caused the violence. Well, there had been five weeks of riots. Who declared them riots? The local police.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: So that didn't work. They said, well, it was getting better and then it got worse because they came. But then you look at Ted Wheeler's own words on July 3rd calling for an end to the violence and so forth. And it was spiking before anybody even knew we had more officers there. So it's one narrative after another. And so now you have Congressman Lieu's latest narrative, and it's just false, false, false.</p><p>I have great faith in the wisdom and the vision of the American people. 2020 clarity. And I believe they see through this sort of junk--</p><p>HEGSETH: I think you're right.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: --even when the mainstream media tries to help people like Congressman Lieu peddle this trash.</p><p>HEGSETH: Because it doesn't even--</p><p>CUCCINELLI: It doesn't help when you've got people like the Speaker of the House out there calling the law enforcement officers Nazis.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes. It doesn't even remotely pass the smell test.</p><p>Ken Cuccinelli, thank you very much.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Right. Agreed.</p><p>HEGSETH: Appreciate your time. People see through that.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Good to be with you.</p><p>HEGSETH: Exactly right.</p><p>All right. Part two of Laura's exclusive interview with President Trump is just moments away. Why he suggested Biden should be drug-tested before the debates, and will we see Melania on the trail? The President has answers. That's next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: I was investigated practically from the time I came down the escalator with our great first lady. I was under investigation, and it's a disgrace. And it should never be allowed to happen again.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Speaking - yes.</p><p>TRUMP: And I say this openly. Bill Barr can go down as the greatest attorney general in the history of our country or he can go down as just another guy. It depends. They have all the stuff. You don't need anything else. They want everything. You don't need anything else. They all lied to Congress. They were liars. They were cheaters. They were treasonous. There was treason. That--</p><p>INGRAHAM: But Bill Barr, you're saying, has to prosecute all of these individuals to be a great attorney general?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, look, look--</p><p>INGRAHAM: You mean he's - he's--</p><p>TRUMP: I - I--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --one of the most talented attorney generals that--</p><p>TRUMP: I will--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --we've ever had?</p><p>TRUMP: I'll let you know about that, and I really like him a lot, but I'll let you know about that. Right now, if I just read the newspapers, even the bad ones, even the ones that are--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: --fake news, there's a case - look, there was a 78-page report about Comey done by Horowitz. And I have to tell you - Inspector General Horowitz. I have to tell you, that report was one of the most brutal reports I've ever seen. Let's see what happens with it. The report on McCabe was one of the most brutal. I actually read them.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: One of the most brutal reports I've ever seen. Let's see what happens with them. If I get another report, if I were a Democrat, this whole thing would've been so different. People would be in jail now, two years ago, for 50-year terms, because this was treason, this was subversion, this was the overthrow of a country. And--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Have they ever stopped trying to take you out before the election, meaning, the protests, the impeachment. It's been a constant drumbeat--</p><p>TRUMP: Well, the protests--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --from the beginning.</p><p>TRUMP: --were interesting because they thought the protests would be good for them because it's all Democrat stirred up and led. They thought - and sin cities (ph), they've lost control of it. They've actually lost control. They thought the protests would be good for them and it turned out to be very bad.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Melania - you mentioned the first lady - she got rave reviews for her speech, so many of the speeches at the RNC. Are we going to be seeing more of her on the campaign trail?</p><p>TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Because I know a lot of women, especially in Middle America, are desperate to still get to know her better.</p><p>TRUMP: And they like her. And they love her style, her class, her grace. I thought she gave an incredible speech. And you have to understand it's not her first language. How many people could come over and make a speech to the world?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Not I.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP: No, think of it. When you think of it, she did an incredible job.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Will we see her on the campaign trail?</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, she will be very much involved. She wants to - she wants to see this be a victory. She--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why do you think in the popular culture where you came from, you were massive success with \"The Apprentice.\"</p><p>TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Everybody knows it. Why do you think there's this push for massive ideological conformity in Hollywood, in the entertainment industry, comedians, everyone? Why is that happening? Why are they so unhinged now?</p><p>TRUMP: They are unhinged, but a lot of those people are going to vote for me because they don't want to lose their money, because they know if Biden gets in, the stock market is going to crash, they're going to lose their money.</p><p>And I saw a recent number on Beverly Hills. The people in Beverly Hills, California, where I had a home, sold it, but I lived for a while on and off because I was doing a project out there. Beverly Hills, California that many, many people voted for me, and then I see them on television saying bad things. And they say, you know, that person voted for you. A large percentage of people voted for--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: But they're afraid to say so.</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, but they don't want to lose their wealth. They are very - they're greedy people. They don't want to lose their wealth. So they will talk one way, but they're going to vote another way. And I think - I saw one poll, 62 percent of the people said they were lying about the polls. I think that's going to be - I will say this.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The polls were right in 2018. Republicans lost a lot, but you weren't on the ballot.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, 2018, I wasn't on the ballot.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right.</p><p>TRUMP: They try and tag me with that. You're going to win the House and you're going to get rid of Pelosi. You're going to win the House, you're going to win it. We're going to win here. The Senate is going to be tough, but we're going to, I think, come through. But you're going to win the House because people are angry.</p><p>And 2018, they tried so hard. But I wasn't on the ballot. And they went out and did polls on that too. Many people said I'm not voting if Trump is not on the ballot. Watch what happens. The level of enthusiasm for this campaign is far greater. Hey, this crazy Michael Moore said it the best. He said, \"I've never seen anything like it.\" The level of enthusiasm now--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do you think he's going to win the--</p><p>TRUMP: --is more--</p><p>INGRAHAM: --popular vote?</p><p>TRUMP: --it's more than 2016.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The popular vote. People say it's important for you to win it, not because you wouldn't be president but because it sends a message to the country--</p><p>TRUMP: OK.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --and that itself calms down. So if conservatives or Republicans in blue states that would - it kind of doesn't matter if I vote. What do you tell them tonight?</p><p>TRUMP: I think I could win. I think I did win the popular vote on a true sense. I think there was tremendous cheating in California. There was tremendous cheating in New York and other places. And if you take a look at the libertarian, they always talk about Jill Stein. Jill Stein took, what, half a percent. They talk about Jill Stein. Well, I have a libertarian - I'm somewhat libertarian. I have to be honest with you. Rand Paul will tell you that. I have a libertarian candidate on last time that got, what, 4.5 or so percent. Those are all Republican voters. They're wasting their vote because they have to vote for us.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But this time, the popular vote would be a huge message to the country if you won it (ph).</p><p>TRUMP: If there wasn't a libertarian on the ticket, I would win the popular vote. I would have won it last time.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. And finally, Mr. President--</p><p>TRUMP: The biggest risk we have--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: --I have to say - is this whole crazy thing where they're sending out 80 million ballots to people that don't even know what a ballot is. They're getting a - they're sending them all over.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Applications for voting.</p><p>TRUMP: Who's sending them? Where are they sending them? They're sending 80 million ballots to everybody. And there's tremendous cheating going to go on, as sure as you are sitting there. And all you have to do is look at the recent races that happened. It's the single biggest problem that there is because everybody wants an honest election. I want an honest election.</p><p>INGRAHAM: How do you know in Michigan if you're down by 50,000 votes, like the - if they are down by 50,000 votes, the Democrats, the next week, Governor Whitmer is, oh, we found 50,000 votes.</p><p>TRUMP: It's a crazy thing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: People are worried about that.</p><p>TRUMP: No, no. It--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: What can you say to supporters today about that?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, it's wrong. It shouldn't - the courts - it's in many courts, and hopefully the courts will stop it. If you take a look at what's going on with that, where they are sending unsolicited - I came up with a new name because they call them universal, they call them Lyva (ph). They are unsolicited. You're sending out 80 million ballots unsolicited. Then you have solicited ballot. That's absentee ballot. It's the biggest problem.</p><p>You look at New York, Carolyn Maloney, they gave her a victory. They don't even know where the ballots are. You look at - you take a look at what's happening in New Jersey. You take a look at what's happened in Virginia. You take a look at what's happening all over. These are small little races that are easy. They can't find the ballots. The ballots are a fraud. Now we're sending 80 million ballots out.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Hillary says you're not going to leave office if you lose. You're not going to leave office. How do you respond to her?</p><p>TRUMP: I think - I think Hillary is a sick woman. Honestly, she's deranged. She is - remember the famous debate where she said, will you respect the wishes of the voter? I didn't say yes or no. I didn't give her an answer. But it was like, you know, she was saying you must respect. She didn't. She lost. She wanted to get it again this time, as you know, and she got defeated then too. She wanted it very badly behind the scenes. She worked - - she wanted to be vice president behind the scenes. Hillary is a sick person. She should just take it nice and easy, relax. Go out, vote. Maybe she should go to the poll instead of sending out an unsolicited ballot.</p><p>But the biggest problem we have in this country is going to be this election with the unsolicited ballots, because even a small little district race, a small little congressional race -- Carolyn Maloney. They should do that race over again. They should do that race over again. There's fraud. There's deception. What they've done with the ballots, there are seven different things are happening.</p><p>You know the other thing, who are they sending them to? Who is sending them --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Are you going to be ready with lawyers? Are you going to have lawyers all across the country ready to challenge this stuff? Because they have a lot of lawyers.</p><p>TRUMP: We have lawyers. They do. They have more lawyers than any human being has ever hired. I don't who is hiring their lawyers, but the Democrats have lawyers, and we do, too. We're in Pennsylvania right now. We're in Nevada right now. We're in all different states fighting this. Everybody knows, including the Democrats, they know more than anybody else. Look and what -- and then they harvest. Harvesting is illegal. Except in California. They do ballot harvesting.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why did you ask for a drug test before the debate? What prompted that with you and Joe Biden?</p><p>TRUMP: Because I watched Biden in the previous debates and he was horrible. And I watched him in the Bernie debate and he was normal. He wasn't Winston Churchill, but he was normal. It was like and even deal. He got by it. And I said, that was a different guy then the guy that was in the debates where Kamala just took him apart. Kamala is terrible. She went down from 15, to -- I watched her drop like a rock. So that's automatically -- that's like a poll. She never even got to Iowa. She never got -- she never even -- because she was so low. So that's the person. But she was really mean to him. She said the worst things.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But on Biden, why the drug test? What do you think he's on?</p><p>TRUMP: He is on some kind of enhancement in my opinion. And I say we should both. I should take a drug test. So should he. Because we don't have a situation where a guy is taking some kind of --</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's like athletes?</p><p>TRUMP: No, no. I want to take one. I'll take one. He'll take one. We should both take a drug test.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST: Wow, good stuff. In moments, more from Laura's news-making exclusive. The president reacts to Biden blaming him for college football getting partially canceled. And he also lays out his plans for making China pay for unleashing COVID on America. That and more when we return.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now Joe Biden has just put out a commercial trying to turn the tables on you on the question of football. Let's watch it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good weather by opening day standard. We are going to be in the 60s. Enjoy the game.</p><p>And now, to honor America, please join in the singing of our National Anthem.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why is football so important, especially for the Big Ten, all these moms, players, want them to play, and then they're not able to play. Are they safer playing than not?</p><p>TRUMP: It shows you the lie of the Democrats. I'm the one that says play football. I said they are young, strong people. They are not going to have a problem with COVID or the China virus or whatever you want to call it. I'm the one. And they didn't like my narrative, so they made up a narrative, because if you look, Michigan is closed. All the states that are closed. North Carolina is close. These states that are closed are run by Democrats. And the reason they are closed is because we have an election on November 3rd, and they don't want the opening of the states and they don't want the income. They want to keep it nice and close.</p><p>But you take a look at what, the states that are close, it's terrible what they've done. And those people, and you discuss it a lot, so do I. There's a lot of death, depression, drug addiction on the other side. When you keep it closed, I think you're losing more people than -- it's terrible what you're doing to people than when you open it.</p><p>So I'm the football guy. I'm the one that wants to have football. I put it out all the time. I'm very upset with Big Ten. Big Ten, they should've opened it. But I'm the one that wants the football. Everybody knows it. They saw that, and they said Trump -- these people just --</p><p>INGRAHAM: They have players suing now to play.</p><p>TRUMP: Good. Good.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And their parents are really upset. Michigan State, Penn State, Minnesota, Ohio State. They could've been the national champions this year, Ohio State.</p><p>TRUMP: Absolutely. And there are a number of them in that category. But look at Pennsylvania. You have a Democrat governor. You have a Democrat in North Carolina. You have a Democrat in Michigan. They're all Democrats. Those are the states. And I do believe the governors are telling those colleges we don't want it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's an important point for Americans to understand. You think that the governors are putting their foot down, saying no. The SEC, they are going to try to play. ACC is playing. But no way. And you think it's political, Mr. President. Is this political?</p><p>TRUMP: The governor of Pennsylvania, the governor of Michigan, the governor of North Carolina. They control those teams directly or indirectly because so much money, so much aid, so many other things, including traffic signs and everything else that they have to give. Those governors control those schools. That's all done by Democrats.</p><p>But just to show you how they lie and how they cheat. And the biggest problem you have, I want football back. By the way, are you watching? I want football, OK? Joe Biden doesn't even know football. Joe Biden, look, Joe, doesn't know he's alive. But let's see how it all turns out, OK. Let's see how it all turns out. It's a very sad thing.</p><p>I will say this. We have tremendous potential. We closed it up. We're opening it up. We're doing record numbers. As you saw, over 9 million people employed now over the last three months, that's a record in the history of our country. We have a chance of having one of the best years we've ever had next year. Unless somebody comes in and wants to raise your taxes, put back on regulations.</p><p>I'm not sure. I gave the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country, and we're going down lower. But I'm not sure. I think that the regulation cuts that I did, which were the biggest in the history of our country, might have been even more important than the tax cuts.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You said that Joe Biden is China's candidate to win. They want him badly. But you said, well, at your RNC speech, you said, I know that but I'm not going to tell you why. Without compromising national security, tell us a little bit more about that.</p><p>TRUMP: Number one, you look at his son walking away with 1.5 billion. Joe, he doesn't even criticize China. I've never even heard him even criticize China. He was the one that said, oh, China is wonderful. China is this, China is that. China is not the enemy, they are not the problem. I've taken billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars out of China.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's taking the tariff off, that's for sure.</p><p>TRUMP: China, the tariffs are going to come off. We're taking in billions of dollars on tariffs. That would destroy us because it gives them such an unfair competitive advantage. We're taking in billions. They don't want me. I get along very well with President Xi, although I must tell you, since the COVID situation I have not exactly been talking to him too much.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Can you make them pay for them?</p><p>TRUMP: They are paying a lot now.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But how could they pay specifically for COVID?</p><p>TRUMP: What they've done to us in terms of the death of people -- and I'm not talking about just us. I'm talking about the world. You can never pay for that. What they've done to this country, what they've done to the world, you can never, just in terms of death. Economically at some point maybe you can catch up, but you're talking about a lot of good trade deals. I made an unbelievable trade deal. And frankly, they ordered more corn last week than any time at any time in the history of this country.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Are they taking advantage of this pandemic with what they have done to Hong Kong, what they are trying to do in the Philippines, maybe choking off some of the South China Sea? Are they taking advantage of it?</p><p>TRUMP: I think that they are hurt much worse than people think. They are having a very hard time in China. China is going very bad inside, the real numbers.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Their manufacturing, they say, has gotten back to par.</p><p>TRUMP: It's not. And they are doing poorly. China is doing very poorly. And they lost tens of thousands of people. They lost more than any other country. They just don't report it. We report everything.</p><p>INGRAHAM: How do you know that?</p><p>TRUMP: And by the way, I saw a statistic the other day talking about only six percent of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interesting -- that they died from other reasons.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They had comorbidities, which you have gotten criticized for because there are comorbidities as the Italians showed for every COVID death, I think it was 70 something percent had two or three comorbidities. But the COVID might ultimately have been the key morbidity to hit them, but the bottom line.</p><p>TRUMP: It could be, but it's an interesting statistic.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Mr. President, are you still having fun doing this?</p><p>TRUMP: I'm having a good time because we are doing a job like just about nobody else has ever done. And I said it before, I'll say it again, and nobody even challenges me on it -- I, this administration, despite all of the fake Russia, Russia, Russia, and hoaxes and impeachments, we have done more in this administration than any president in the history of our country. If you look at our military is rebuilt. If you look at choice for the vets, and if you look at accountability for the vets, and I protective the Second Amendment, which, by the way, if they got in, your Second Amendment is gone. Your taxes are tripled. Your Second Amendment is gone. Your religious liberty, forget it. They are keeping the churches closed on purpose. You have churches that still aren't open, but you're allowed to go to a casino. It's a terrible thing that's happening.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You're allowed to riot. Because a lot of people don't know how funny you are, but you're one of the funnier people that I know, but you're also in a very serious time.</p><p>TRUMP: This is a very serious -- this isn't time for games. And people say he comes across as a little bit rough or a little bit direct. I don't have time not to be. I really don't have much time not to be. We have to get things done. And we are getting them down like no president has ever -- despite the obstruction, because they are up obstructers. Despite the tremendous obstruction, we are getting them done like nobody's ever done before, and that makes me happy.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Mr. President, it's always great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much, Laura.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HEGSETH: Straight in the camera, are you watching? I want football. Laura, great job.</p><p>Speaking of those Big Ten football lawsuits mentioned in that interview, a University of Nebraska football player and his attorney join us exclusively in moments with the details of their lawsuit against the league. What will it mean for college sports if it succeeds? We'll ask them after the break.</p><p>HEGSETH: Welcome back. As you just heard the president tell Laura, he wants to get football back no matter what it takes. For the past few weeks, college football players in the Big Ten conference have taken it upon themselves to try to force the issue, suing the conference for the right to play. Here now is someone who is doing just that. Joining me now exclusively is University of Nebraska football player Brig Banks. Also with me, his attorney, Mike Flood. Gentlemen, welcome. Thank you. Brig, do you think a majority of Big Ten players feel the same way you do, they want to get back on the field and playing?</p><p>BRIG BANKS, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA FOOTBALL: I do. I think that the players in the Big Ten are very proud to be part of the Big Ten. But with that, we do want transparency from our leaders. We want them to be accountable for their decisions. But I do know one thing, that this has actually unified the Big Ten more than anything before. There are players from every team reaching out saying thank you for standing up. And I think that's a great thing.</p><p>HEGSETH: A common foe will do just that. Mike, Brig mentioned transparency. The Big Ten claims there was a vote that was 11 to three against starting the season. You're still not satisfied. What do you need see from the league?</p><p>MIKE FLOOD, HUSKER FOOTBALL PLAYERS' ATTORNEY: Well, when the vote was taken, allegedly, you had presidents or chancellors from Minnesota and Michigan State that either said they didn't think there was a vote, or they couldn't recall if there was a vote, or there wasn't a vote. And so basically it does boil down to transparency. What was the vote? Who made the motion? Who made the second? How did each individual president and chancellor vote, and what information did they use to make that decision? Six days after they had issued the fall football schedule everything changed.</p><p>And you have got these football players that were spending the better part of four or five months following every rule, staying low to the ground, doing with their coaches said, doing what the University of Nebraska Medical Center's guidelines were. And suddenly the rug was pulled out from underneath them. And I don't think it's too much to ask, how did all of that work? How did they vote?</p><p>HEGSETH: Brig, why do you want to play so bad? Is it about professional opportunities? Is it missing the opportunity at a season? Because folks in the media will point out, hey, COVID-19, there's health restrictions. People are affected. What's the reason that you're coming forth so strongly?</p><p>BANKS: Well, to make it to this point, each one of us has trained a majority of our lives and put in a lot of time to be where we are. And to have even just the opportunity to choose to play taken away from us is kind of something that really hit home for each one of us as players. So yes.</p><p>HEGSETH: Absolutely. Listen, you want to be a place like Nebraska is the top of the top when it comes to college football. You want to be on the field.</p><p>Dan Patrick tweeted this today about the possibility of the Big Ten. He said \"From a source, if conference can pass updated safety measures and procedures, Big Ten targeting October 10 to start the football season.\" Mike, if I could, the Nebraska athletic director said there is no truth to this report. So could the Big Ten come up with a plan that would satisfy you dropping this lawsuit?</p><p>FLOOD: Well, obviously we want our kids to play football. That's what they want to do. And safety is as important in Nebraska as it is in Ohio. And they will tell you, the football players will tell you they've never felt more safe. In fact, during the time when they were getting ready to play, they were being closely monitored. Now because of this decision, the training has been closed down. A lot of the services have been closed down. And they are on the dorm floor with all the other athletes.</p><p>So the question is, what's more safe? Is it more safe to play football in a very strict environment, or to not play football? And I will tell you the players say and their parents say they are safer playing football.</p><p>HEGSETH: Well, these are young men also. Brig, good luck. Thank you for joining us this evening. Thank you both.</p><p>Final thoughts when we return.</p><p>HEGSETH: That is just about all the time we have. Again, congratulations, Laura, for a fantastic interview of the president.</p><p>If you have a moment, make sure to pick up a copy of my book, \"American Crusade, Our Fight to Stay Free\" wherever books are sold.

He  doesn't work for the government anymore.  He is a cable news yapper who  spends a lot of his life yelling at people on Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Brennan is also a political extremist who, if you listen carefully, seems  unbalanced.  If John Brennan gets a security clearance, then why not the  homeless guy talking to himself on the bus?  That seems like a fair  question.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Apparently, the White House agreed with that.  Yesterday, the  administration announced it is seeking to revoke security clearances for  John Brennan, Jim Clapper, and other former officials who no longer work  for the government because, honestly, why would they have security  clearances?</p><p> In a normal year, that would not be a very big story, but things are not  normal right now.  So, here's how the geniuses on cable news reacted.   Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RICHARD HAAS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS PRESIDENT:  This is an abuse of  executive power.  This is Erdogan's Turkey.  </p><p> REP.  ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  That is exactly what you see in  authoritarian regimes.</p><p> DON LEMON, \"CNN TONIGHT\" HOST:  It's childish.  It's petty.  </p><p> REP.  NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  This is so extraordinary.   The last thing you want in intelligence is partisanship.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That he would turn against them in a way that,  obviously, disrespects civil liberties, disrespect free press is an  autocratic kind of move.  It's the kind of you'd see in a banana republic.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Autocratic! First, they came for John Brennan's security  clearance and I said nothing.  Barf.</p><p> Next time, you hear some blowhard on television warning about creeping  authoritarianism, ask yourself, am I for unfettered free speech?  Of course  you are.  You are an American.  That is your birthright and the foundation  of all other liberties.  </p><p> Then ask yourself a second question, how about the guy on television  lecturing us about authoritarianism.  Is he for unfettered free speech?  No  chance.  He considers your opinions hate speech, which is a made-up  category designed to gut the First Amendment and shut you up.  </p><p> He'd happily support big tech firms and college administrators and your  company's HR department as they punish you for saying what you think is  true.</p><p> Creeping authoritarianism?  It's already here.  And that guy is the face of  it.</p><p> Lou Dobbs, by contrast, hosts \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" on FOX Business and he  joins us tonight.  Lou, what do you make of this controversy?  I can't  remember a weirder one.  I was not aware that John Brennan had a moral  right to a security clearance in perpetuity?  </p><p> LOU DOBBS, \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\" HOST:  His ascendancy to the moral high  ground caught me by surprise too.</p><p> This is the man whose CIA spied on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who  lied about spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  </p><p> It is extraordinary.  This man has challenged, insulted and degraded the  presidency throughout the past year, and now would object to having his  security clearance lifted.</p><p> Tucker, I can't imagine why any one of those people retained a security  clearance.  They are of absolutely no use to any of them unless they are  monetizing it, as Sen.  Rand Paul has said, and I thought, frankly, your  discussion with Rand Paul hit exactly the right note in questioning the  existence of security clearance for former officials - period - for any  reason.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I mean, he is a cable news yapper.  He's a consultant to  cable news.  And so is Jim Clapper.  And they have the highest-level  security clearances.  And it raises the question, then why don't I have one  or why don't you have one?  I mean, what could possibly be the  justification for that?  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, I don't know about you, but I am holding out for subpoena  power.  I would much prefer subpoena power.  (INAUDIBLE) we will have lunch  and go from there.</p><p> I think this is just an absurdity that it exists at all.  Think about  Clapper and the quality of people that were in the Obama intelligence  leading the intelligence community under President Obama.  </p><p> Clapper.  I believe Michael Rogers, the head of the NSA out of this, he is  a sterling quality individual.  But Clapper and Brennan and Comey, are you  kidding me?  Why in the world would they have security clearance?  </p><p> CARLSON:  And then, you see these former liberals in good standing  defending this and it makes you realize that whatever Trump is for, they  are against and vice versa.  So, it's very easy to bait them.  All of a  sudden, they're for MS-13 and they're for acting in porn movies as a noble  profession and they're for demented former CIA directors having security  clearances.</p><p> I mean, how easy would it be to get them to take totally insane positions  just by telling that Trump is against it?  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, I don't think it would be difficult, as you point out, at  all.  Think about the positions that Clapper has taken, the lies that he  has told.  Comey who has misrepresented at the very least so much.</p><p> He talked about President Trump as a man who is nefarious, but this is the  man he was perfectly willing to serve as his FBI director.  And the list  goes on.</p><p> The madness and the intrigue is overwhelming, I suspect, to most Americans  because first they didn't know that these people had security clearances  still.  They didn't understand why they got them in the first place and  ascended to the top of their agencies.</p><p> And the fact is, whether it's the FBI, the CIA, the DNI, what were their  great accomplishments in achievements in leading the intelligence  community?  </p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  </p><p> DOBBS:  The history of the intelligence community over the past 20 years is  a sad and sorry tale.  </p><p> CARLSON:  If I worked in the White House, I would convene a month-long  symposium against human trafficking just to watch \"Morning Joe\" convene a  panel in favor of it.  I think it would be hilarious.  </p><p> DOBBS:  I will endorse that idea.  I think that's a lovely idea.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Amen.  Great to see you.</p><p> DOBBS:  Great to see you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Buck Sexton is a former CIA analyst.  He worked with the NYPD's  intel division.  He joins us tonight.  </p><p> So, I mean, you've worked in this world, Buck.  You have a better sense of  this.  Does this apply across all government agencies?  If I am a rifleman  in the Marine Corps, do I get to keep my rifle at the end?  Or if I work in  artillery, do I get to keep my howitzer when I leave?  Is this kind of the  way it works?  </p><p> BUCK SEXTON, FORMER CIA ANALYST:  There is specific law with regard to  clearances and there's also customs, Tucker.  When you're talking about  former agency heads, they tend to keep them in a way that run-of-the-mill  employees like me don't.</p><p> And they also have, as a courtesy, they'd say, the ability to go back in  and still have real-time access to classified information if, in fact, they  were called in for that.  That's the justification for this.</p><p> But I feel like this whole debate just highlights a much bigger problem, a  much more nefarious issue, and that is we have all these people lecturing  us about institutions being undermined and look what's happened to us and  the hacking of our democracy, this can't be allowed to happen.</p><p> We have the former intel chiefs of the biggest agencies in the United  States government, the most sophisticated intelligence apparatus on the  planet who are actively trying to undermine now the sitting president of  the United States and they weren't the intel chief 10 or 20 years ago.   They were the most recent one.</p><p> What that means is that, every time you've got Clapper or Brennan or others  who are going on air, talking about, for example, the Russia collusion  case, there is at least some perception - and by the way, I think some of  them have tried to enhance this with what they have said.  They've dance  around this - that they are drawing upon their classified knowledge to make  some of these assumptions.  They have extra gravitas.  They should be paid  attention to more because they were the most recent NSA or CIA director.   That is insidious.</p><p> I mean, this is deeply destructive to the fate that any future president  could have in the previous administration's appointees at that level, and  that's something, I think, does not get talked about enough at all here.  </p><p> CARLSON:  No.  I think it's a very wise point.  And remind us again the  point of having all these various alphabet agencies.  The intel apparatus  exists only to serve the executive and to help him or her make wise foreign  policy decisions, correct?  Is there some other reason to have a CIA?</p><p> SEXTON:  Well, I mean, there's a lot of agencies.  Seventeen now, I think,  technically in the intel community, though someone is probably going to  correct me on that one because it's actually grown since I was in it.  So,  that will tell you something.  It wasn't that long ago.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes, it has.</p><p> SEXTON:  But they exist for national security purposes.  They would tell  you what all the different specific missions are.  But, yes, they are  executive branch agencies.  And that then brings us to they should be  serving the executive branch.</p><p> The same way that liberals, Tucker, don't really accept that President  Trump is the president and, therefore, could fire Comey for no reason or  any reason, if he wants to revoke clearances under Article II authority, he  can do that.  </p><p> So, all of this freak out you are seeing from people is a form of Trump  derangement syndrome on display, for an issue that, by the way, most of  these journalists have no idea what they are talking about.</p><p> They have never held a clearance.  They don't know what goes into this and  they don't know why anyone has one anyone.</p><p> CARLSON:  Also, they are dumb.  I mean, if Trump is an authoritarian, he's  a pretty inefficient one.  I mean, if Brennan and Clapper still have  clearances a year-and-a-half in, it's not much of a police state, I would  say.  </p><p> Buck Sexton, great to see you.  </p><p> SEXTON:  Good to see you, Tucker.  Thanks.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, they're inflamed over on the left.  And tempers do not  appear to be cooling.</p><p> Over this weekend, \"The Denver Post\" published a letter to the editor  suggesting that Trump and other members of the administration literally  deserve to be executed for treason.</p><p> Well, as we do so very often when things get completely nuts, we bring in  some perspective.  Fox's senior political analyst Brit Hume has seen  everything and, therefore, he can put this in the appropriate context and  calm us down.  </p><p> Brit, great to see you.</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Thank you, Tucker.  Nice to  see you.  </p><p> CARLSON:  What do you make of this?  </p><p> HUME:  Well, I went and read the letter.  And it basically references Trump  as some kind of traitor and notes that the Rosenbergs - Julius and Ethel  Rosenberg - were found guilty of that and, says the letter, they were  executed.</p><p> I didn't quite see this as a suggestion that Trump be executed, but it was  close to the line.  And you might have thought the editors at \"The Denver  Post\" would've been more careful about publishing it.</p><p> But if we weren't talking about it tonight, I don't think the world will  look longer than a few minutes even note that it ever happened.  So, I  think it's probably much ado about not much.</p><p> CARLSON:  But it raises the larger question, which is - and correctly -  that treason is a death penalty offense and the Rosenbergs were indeed  executed for it at Sing Sing.</p><p> And if you accuse to someone of that, particularly an elected official, you  are making a pretty stout charge.  </p><p> HUME:  You are.  Well, this is - the thing about this is and it came up in  your previous segment when you were talking about John Brennan, who openly  accused the president of treason, we now inhabit an age of exaggeration.   Everybody goes to battle stations and two DEFCON 1 over everything.</p><p> So, it is not enough to say that Trump unwisely sided with Putin for a  period of time against the intelligence.  No, no, it's treason and he is a  traitor.</p><p> And on the other side, of course, everybody is said to be corrupt and there  is no reasoned discussion going on right now.  Everybody on all sides goes  completely berserk, hair on fire over everything.  And on and on it goes.</p><p> Right now, there is a Battle Royale raging in Washington over the  interpretation of the materials, the FISA application materials released at  the end of the last week, as to their interpretation.  </p><p> Some journalists are writing, after reviewing them, that they support the  conclusions reached by the Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence  Committee.  Others are saying that that's all a lie, that they don't  support that at all.  I have never seen such diametrically opposed  interpretations.  And it is all at the highest possible decimal level.   Like nothing I've ever seen before.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, what would happen if there was an actual crisis?  If there  was an attack by a foreign power, physical attack, an actual attack, not a  metaphorical one, and we found ourselves at war?  How would a country this  divided prosecute a war?  ]] </p><p> HUME:  Well, it would be entirely up to the government itself because I'm  sure that the president could interpret anything as he did as a kind of  whack the dog scenario and then believe that it was false and the  intelligence had reported it was false and so on.  Nobody trusts anybody.</p><p> And that extends to the Congress, it extends to the media.  The competition  among media outlets is more intense than I've ever seen it.  And all media  outlets criticize all other media outlets.  Professional courtesy about  that is all but gone.  And we inhabit an age where everybody is at the  ramparts over everything all day, every day.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I have noticed that.  Brit Hume, remaining calm despite all of  it.  Thank you very much for that.</p><p> HUME:  Thanks, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Bernie Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic primary, probably for not  entirely legitimate reasons, but Democratic socialism which is what he ran  on appears to be taking over his party.  Irony of ironies.  What is it  exactly?  We'll talk to one of the architects of the Bernie Sanders 2016  presidential campaign.  Coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Democratic socialism has for the last 100 years been pretty much  a fringe belief, even on the left.  Now, open socialists are all of a  sudden running for office across the United States and they are winning  Democratic primaries.</p><p> Today, on \"The View\", Joy Behar started an argument when she declared her  support for this ideology.  Here's part of it.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MEGHAN MCCAIN, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST:  On your platform, I think you should  start paying the amount of taxes that every socialist in this country  thinks you needs to.  </p><p> JOY BEHAR, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST:  They have just given this enormous tax  break to the very, very wealthy in this country.  That tax break doesn't  have to be so generous to those really rich people, does it?  Because if  you don't give that money to them, what happens to that money?  Better  schools, better post office, better garbage pickup, better police  department, better fire department.  </p><p> MCCAIN:  If you think the government is so good at running things, then the  post office is a great run business, the VA.  Some of us do not want  socialism to be normalized in this country.  </p><p> WHOOPI GOLDBERG, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST:  We will be right back.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Behar did not release her own tax returns, so we could see how  many deductions she took.  We're awaiting that.</p><p> Meanwhile, Jeff Weaver managed Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.  He's  the author of the book \"How Bernie Won:  Inside the Revolution That is  Taking Back Our Country and Where We Go From Here.\" Jeff Weaver joins us  tonight.  Jeff, thanks a lot for coming on.  </p><p> JEFF WEAVER, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Hey, Tucker.  Thanks  for having me.  I really appreciate it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, you just did an interview and were asked basically what is  this creed, what is Democratic socialism and you described basically a  series of economic - here's what you said.  </p><p> People want economic security, they want healthcare, they want dignity in  old age, they want to know that they are not going to die with nothing.   All pretty reasonable sounding ideas.</p><p> When I listen to - and how we pay for them is the point, but we could  debate that, but those aren't bad ideas.</p><p> When I hear modern Democrats talking, it is never about economics.  It is  about abortion.  It is overwhelmingly about immigration and why we need to  let people stay here, whether they are legal or not.</p><p> It is nothing about an agenda of empowering the middle class economically,  why is that?  </p><p> WEAVER:  Well, let me tell you, Tucker.  I think Democrats have to start  walking and chewing gum at the same time.  We do have to talk about the  plight of marginalized communities in this country who have been targeted  by the president during his administration, but we also have to talk about  the economic needs of people in every zip code in this country.  </p><p> Wages are stagnant.  People are anxious about their futures, about their  kids' futures, about taking care of their aging parents, about affording  college.  And we have to talk about all of these issues, frankly.</p><p> And I agree with you that we need to hear more conversations.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  But there's only so much time in the day, there's only so  much attention, there's really only so much our system can digest.  And if  your fixation is with the esoteric sexual politics, like transgender  bathrooms or global warming -</p><p> WEAVER:  Or plastic straws on Fox.  I mean, I was just watching - how many  shows on plastic straws are you going to have here on Fox?  </p><p> CARLSON:  OK, we did one.  We do a lot of segments on economics because I  think it's really important.  So, like the elites of your party are only -</p><p> WEAVER:  I would not call it a core economic issue, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm not claiming it was.  We do a lot of segments on core  economic issues, including this one.</p><p> But I'm just interested, like your elites never say anything about how  inviting millions of poor people into the country every year might depress  wages for the working class.  </p><p> WEAVER:  Look, we are not talking about inviting in millions of people.   The truth of the matter is that we do have millions of people in this  country living in the shadows who are working hard, many of them, in fact,  are paying taxes.  Their kids are in schools.  They are contributing to our  country.  And I think we have to recognize that reality.  That's for sure.</p><p> But let's talk about the core economic issues.  You wanted to talk about  \"Democratic socialism.\" I know people on Fox love the scary labels and the  red baiting.  But let's talk about what that means.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  I am  actually giving you the fairest possible shake you will get on any channel  ever.  I'm taking your ideas seriously.  I'm not mocking you.</p><p> I'm just wondering if your ideas aren't on a collision course with the  agenda set by the elites in your party.  And you know as well as I do, the  answer is yes.  They are incompatible.  What you are saying is not  compatible with what they are saying.  And you know it.  </p><p> WEAVER:  What I am saying is that we need a Democratic Party in this  country and we need a government in this country that represents the needs  of ordinary people, and that includes an agenda that guarantees healthcare  to all people, that pays people a living wage, that pays equally whether  you are a man or woman, that protects our environment, that gives people  opportunity to go to college and to have a good life.  That's what I'm  talking about.  People not retiring in poverty, destroying social security.   These are the things that people are talking about in the progressive  movement.</p><p> And, frankly, Tucker, if you look at the polling, it's wildly popular.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I agree with a lot of what you just said.  What you said that is  not true at all is that that's what they are talking about.  They're not.   They are talking about race, they're talking about sex, they're talking  about identity politics, they're attacking people because of their skin  color.  I mean, I do this for a living.  I know exactly what they're  saying.  And they're not saying what you just said.</p><p> WEAVER:  Well, let's not talk about people attacking people for their skin  color because, I think, if we go right to the White House where that  starts, frankly, my friend.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But let's be real.  I mean, honestly, every time I talk to  progressives, it's like, oh, white man this, it's like what does that have  to do with empowering the average person economically, which is what the  agenda ought to be?  </p><p> WEAVER:  We have got to empower people of all races in this country,  frankly.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p> WEAVER:  And you cannot ignore the intersection of race and gender and  other things.  I mean you're a smart guy.  I am not on \"Hannity\" here.   This is a real show.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, please.</p><p> WEAVER:  You can't ignore those issues.  But you're right, we do have to -</p><p> CARLSON:  I am not ignoring the issues, but the children of your party who  are clearly in charge, they're all about - I mean, do you personally, as a  pretty serious guy - I guess a serious guy - get a little tired of having  to follow, like, inflamed upper middle-class college students who are  constantly yelping about identity politics?  Don't you think that's kind of  a distraction from, like, the adult issues or no?  </p><p> WEAVER:  I think you are creating a false dichotomy here.  There are  important issues that are both issues of identity and there are important  issues of economics, and I think we have to speak to both.</p><p> And people in the Democratic Party who advocate just one or the other, I am  constantly in conflict with those people who think that we only have to  talk about one side of this two-sided coin.</p><p> We have to talk about these important issues that affect marginalized  communities and we have to talk about laying out an economic agenda that is  going to uplift people of all races in every zip code in this country.   That's the mission in front of us.</p><p> And if you look at Bernie Sanders' historic campaign in 2016, he won -  overwhelmingly won independent voters in the Democratic primary, a process,  including in places that were very, very red because folks understood that  he was standing with their families in their everyday struggles.  </p><p> And that's what we as Democrats and progressives have to do.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm actually kind of - I'm kind of aware of that.  I just think -  here is where I disagree with you, and we've got to go, but I will just say  in one sentence, I think the identity politics people are beating you.  And  I hope I am wrong.  </p><p> WEAVER:  I think with people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others, we  are winning.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I think she's on the identity politics side.  But come back.   Sorry, we are out of time.  Jeff Weaver, thank you.</p><p> Well, it's not getting a ton of attention, but we seem to be moving  incrementally toward war with Iran.  Maybe we should talk about it first.   Is it a good idea.  We'll take an in-depth look at that next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, with all the screeching recently about Vladimir Putin and  Russia, treason, it's been easy to miss the real news.  We have some real  news.  The United States is inching closer apparently to some kind of  conflict with Iran.</p><p> This Sunday, the president tweeted this, \"To Iranian President Rouhani,  never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer the  consequences, the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered  before.  We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words  of violence and death.  Be cautious!\"</p><p> Well, the interesting thing about this tweet is what didn't happen.  The  press is usually quick to jump on the president's intemperate tweets.</p><p>CNN has apparently an entire team of progressive teenagers devoted to  monitoring his feed.  But this time, there wasn't much comment from the  media.</p><p> Why?  Because if there is one thing Washington loves more than open borders  and fat lobbying contracts, it's pointless wars half a world away.</p><p> Contractors get rich.  Neocon intellectuals feel powerful.  Bill Kristol,  Max Boot and Nancy Pelosi agree on one thing, war is good as long as the  war does not help the United States.</p><p> John Bolton finds himself in that camp.  A lifelong neocon, Bolton  repeatedly has called for toppling the Iranian government again and again,  though tellingly he's never suggested what might replace the Iranian  government once it's toppled.</p><p> Now, as the national security advisor, he has been changing our policies.   The US, for example, has begun promoting protests within Iran in an effort  to overthrow the regime there.</p><p> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on board with this.  UN  Ambassador Nikki Haley definitely is.  Here's a recent sampling of her  saber-rattling on Iran.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NIKKI HALEY, US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN:  Their government has a long history  of murdering its own people who dare to speak the truth.</p><p> The Iranian regime is now on notice.  The world will be watching what you  do.  </p><p> If you want to come to the table and work on a new Iran deal, we'll be  right there to talk to you, but you're not going to threaten us to do it.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Iran may have messed with the wrong president here.  </p><p> HALEY:  They absolutely did.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Now, some of that is bluster, obviously, but some of it is  exactly what it looks like - the groundwork for conflict.  We are moving  toward, however slowly, some kind of confrontation with Iran.  </p><p> And that should worry everybody, but it should especially be of concern to  anyone who supported the president.</p><p> If President Trump decides to go to war with Iran, it will destroy his  presidency just as the Iraq War destroyed the presidency of his Republican  predecessor George W.  Bush.  </p><p> Attacking Iran is not like intervening in Libya or Syria or even like  invading Iraq.  It entails far greater risk and much higher costs.</p><p> Geographically, Iran is about four times the size of Iraq.  It has three  times as many people as Iraq had when we invaded.  Iraq was a divided  country along religious lines.  Iran is not.  It's cohesive.</p><p> It's a much richer country too with a military that has spent many years  preparing for a US invasion.  It's a formidable force.</p><p> In 2002, the US military carried out a war game that was widely understood  to be a simulation of an invasion of Iran.  It went badly.  America  suffered more than 20,000 casualties in a single day and officials halted  the game.</p><p> So, the question is not could America beat Iran.  Yes, it could.  The  question is, is it ready to try?  Well, less ready than ever actually.</p><p> Compared to 2003, our country is deeper in debt and far more politically  divided than it's been since the Civil War.  Our military is overstretched.   Ask anyone in it.  </p><p> Meanwhile, China is much stronger than it was 15 years ago.  You can bet  the Chinese military will be more assertive than ever when we are tied down  in yet another quagmire.</p><p> Does anyone outside of Washington actually support a new war in Iran?   Well, the Saudi royal family does.  So do the leaders of other Sunni Gulf  states.  They see Iran as their greatest rival and they'd love to have  America fight a war against Iran for them.  Why wouldn't they?</p><p> President Trump's own supporters know better than this, though.  You'll  remember that, back in 2016, during the Republican primary debate in South  Carolina, Donald Trump was the only person on that stage to call the Iraq  War a mistake.</p><p> He vowed never to repeat anything like that and promised that, if elected,  he would act only in America's interest.  </p><p> The morons handicapping the debate on television predicted Trump would  lose, it was over, saying that had sealed his fate.  And, of course, they  were wrong and he won.  </p><p> Republican voters agreed with him, it turned out.  They had a better sense  of the truth.  A lot of their kids were serving in the military.</p><p> Two-and-a-half years later, amazingly, the president's advisors are telling  him he must abandon that promise.  Iran is too important, they say.  It's  the greatest threat this country faces despite the fact that virtually  every terror attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran's  Sunni enemies.  Doesn't matter.</p><p> The mullahs are months away from building a nuke, the neocons tell us.   Keep in mind, these people have been saying the exact same thing, word for  word, for more than a decade.  You can look it up on Google.</p><p> They have no idea what they are talking about.  Their track records are  embarrassing.  Disaster after disaster.  They ought to be selling time- shares in Maui or doing something useful.</p><p> Instead, they have more political power than they have ever had.   Amazingly, almost to a person, the same group bitterly opposed the  president they now work for.  They repeatedly attacked him in public and  they attacked him savagely in private.</p><p> They consider his ideas absurd to this day.  They regard the notion of  putting America first as morally offensive.  They're fully on Bill  Kristol's team.  </p><p> In fact, just last week, Kristol was encouraging Nikki Haley to challenge  her boss, Donald Trump, for the Republican nomination two years from now,  and in a way that makes sense.  </p><p> If there was a swamp in Washington, you're looking at it, the foreign  policy establishment.  They are working overtime to ensnare the president  in a mess in Iran.  Let's hope that he understands exactly what's going on.</p><p> Douglas Macgregor is a retired army colonel, author of the book \"Margin Of  Victory,\" a frequent guest on this show and he joins us tonight.  </p><p> Colonel, Macgregor, thank you very much for coming on.  </p><p> DOUGLAS MACGREGOR, \"MARGIN OF VICTORY\" AUTHOR:  Thanks, Tucker.  I  appreciate it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, I can't help, since I have been in Washington for 30 years,  notice that the very people who are pushing this new entanglement, this new  enterprise are the Trump administration's gravest enemies on almost every  subject, and they are also the same people who predicted outcomes that  never came to pass.</p><p> And in other words, they have been wrong again and again and again.  How do  these people still have power?  </p><p> MACGREGOR:  Well, look, I think President Trump lost control of the whole  appointment process and staffing the government shortly after the election.</p><p> I don't know the details, but he ended up appointing large numbers of  people who subsequently brought in their friends, almost all of whom were  opposed to Donald Trump and his agenda.</p><p> But I think it's important to say something about the president's comment  because the president is right.  If you look at the Iranian defense  establishment, we spend more money on one Ford class aircraft carrier than  Iran spends on its entire military establishment.</p><p> So, if there were a war, it would be a very one-sided affair.  But the  problem is that wars don't work that way.  They tend to move in directions  that no one anticipated.</p><p> Suddenly, people that you would think otherwise would avoid conflict might  decide that it's not in their interest to see Iran destroyed.  And I'm  thinking of Russia and I am thinking of China as perfect examples.  Why  would they stand by and watch us pulverize Iran?  It seems very unlikely.</p><p> So, I think President Trump understands that.  In fact, this afternoon,  when he talked to VFW, he made the comment that he pulled out of the deal  with Iran, but he's open to another deal, he's open to talking, to  negotiating.  </p><p> He's talked to the Russians and he has talked to the North Koreans.  That  seems to have had a positive impact certainly on Northeast Asia.  We don't  know what will happen in the future, but I think that's a good sign.</p><p> So, I think dealing with Donald Trump, understand that anyone who threatens  the United States with this man in the White House should seek psychiatric  care, they're crazy because Donald Trump means what he says.  He will fight  to defend the United States.</p><p> On the other hand, I don't see any evidence that he is interested in  precipitating a conflict.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Do you think the advisors around him whose comments we just  played, Nikki Haley, for example, or John Bolton - they seem to come at  this with pre-existing agendas.</p><p> MACGREGOR:  Well, of course.  But the good news is that President Trump  hasn't listened very much to his advisors.  If he did, we would never have  made any progress on the Korean Peninsula.  We would not be -</p><p> CARLSON:  Good point!</p><p> MACGREGOR:  - working with the Chinese.  We would never have met with  Vladimir Putin.  So, God bless the president.  He doesn't listen to these  people.  So, I'm not too worried about that.</p><p> The thing that does worry me, though, given some of the comments that are  being made is this red meat on the table for the war lobby.  You and I know  that there are a lot of people who would welcome conflict with Iran.   That's obvious.</p><p> I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for  something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident.  Many of your viewers may not  remember that.  It never happened.  And we could very well be treated to  something like that in the Gulf.  We should watch for that.</p><p> And this is an example of President Trump's comments on fake news.  He  should not be sabotaged by fake news.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I agree.  We've seen it happen twice in Syria.  Twice! Colonel,  thank you very much.  Great to see you.  </p><p> MACGREGOR:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  One activist says conservatives only want Planned Parenthood to  be defunded in order to force the nation's women to get pregnant.  It's a  confusing argument.  We're going to allow her to explain it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, Republicans ran on the promise to defund Planned Parenthood.   Half a billion dollars a year of taxpayer money.  Remember that?  That was  in 2016 election.  Congressional Republicans haven't really tried hard to  do that.</p><p> That has not stopped the administration, though, from taking its own kind  of action on the question.  The administration is attempting to tweak Title  X funding formulas to divert federal funds away from Planned Parenthood,  the country's largest abortion provider.</p><p> Sonia Ossorio is the president of the New York chapter of the National  Organization for Women.  She says the real goal of defunding Planned  Parenthood isn't to prevent taxpayers from funding something they abhor,  abortion, it's to force women to get pregnant.</p><p> Sonia Ossorio joins us tonight.  Sonia, it's great to see you.</p><p> SONIA OSSORIO, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN OF NEW YORK PRESIDENT:   Thank you.  </p><p> Well, Tucker, if you take away the access to abortion and you take away  birth control, which is a really big issue that we've got to discuss here  tonight, you are indeed forcing women to have children.</p><p> Now, let's get to the point.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I wonder how many people actually - I think most of our viewers  know that what you're seeing is pure lunacy and dishonest.  And you do too.</p><p> But let's just sort of - just for fun, reverse engineer this for a second.   Who is taking away the right to have an abortion?</p><p> I think the law - I don't think I know.  I read it, the proposed regulation  change would just make it less likely that taxpayers have to pay for  abortion.  Is that the same as banning abortion?</p><p> OSSORIO:  Let's be really clear.  And this is something - and it's really  the reason, Tucker, that I wanted to come on your show tonight because I  needed to dispel this myth.  </p><p> People need to understand, I want all the viewers to understand, your  taxpayers do not pay for abortions in this country.  Taxpayers do not pay  for abortions.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, they don't.  But they do give half a billion dollars to the  largest abortionist on the continent.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  Your taxpayers do pay for abortions in the case of rape and if a  woman is dying.  Those are the two situations since 1977.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  You're spewing propaganda here.  We pay, taxpayers, at  gunpoint, half a billion to Planned Parenthood which provides - commits  more abortion than anybody else in the country.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  I don't think you should joke at gunpoint.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm not joking.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  You just talked about gunpoint.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, it is at gunpoint.  If you don't pay your taxes, they come  and arrest you, the cops arrest you.  So, you don't pay your taxes  voluntarily.  You do it because the government backs it up with the threat  of force.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  What everybody should also understand, if you give me a moment to  speak, what everybody should understand also is Planned Parenthood works  just like any other medical provider.</p><p> They get reimbursed for the procedures they perform that are approved by  the government.  So, they get a reimbursement for an STD testing, they get  reimbursed for all those other service they do, but not for abortions.</p><p> But I want to take a moment to talk about what is happening - </p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  You've taken a lot of moments to talk.  So, let me just  you one question, which is - </p><p> OSSORIO:  We've got 4 minutes, so down to two.  </p><p> CARLSON:  You think abortion is a constitutional right.  I think the right  to bear arms is because I have read the Bill of Rights.  Why shouldn't  taxpayers be forced to subsidize the NRA or buy my guns?  </p><p> OSSORIO:  Now, who is talking lunacy and who is being dishonest?  </p><p> CARLSON:  Why is that crazy?  You think taxpayers should pay for an  abortion - you're giving me the moral lecture, but just answer my question.   I think it's an interesting question.</p><p> OSSORIO:  I want viewers to know that one in four women in this country  have an abortion.  </p><p> CARLSON:  You're not going to answer my question.</p><p> OSSORIO:  I'm not answering question, no, because it's a stupid question.</p><p> CARLSON:  Why?  I think it's a really interesting question.  Oh, because  that's causing you to enlarge your mind and it hurts.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  I've got an opportunity to speak to your viewers and I'm trying  to speak to them.  One in four women have an abortion in this country.   That has gone down from 1 in 3.  It's gone down from 1 in 3.  The reason  why it's gone down is because we've had teen pregnancy prevention programs  that have been successful.</p><p> And, right now, the Trump administration wants to divert $250 million of  teen pregnancy programs -</p><p> CARLSON:  This is why I never like to talk to the abortion people because  they just shout.  OK, I'm sorry.  Don't make me cut you off.  Please.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  They want to divert that -</p><p> CARLSON:  Please! I'm trying.</p><p> OSSORIO:  a - to abstinence only education.</p><p> CARLSON:  All right, Sonia.  I tried.  It was a good faith effort.  I  really tried.  I hate cutting people off, but you were just too obnoxious.   I'm sorry.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right here on this show, we warned you that the FAA was putting  the country at risk in the way that they were hiring air traffic  controllers.  Now, they claim they have changed.  We have an update to our  exclusive investigation.  And that's next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  In an exclusive investigation by this program, we warned you  about the war on standards underway at the FAA.</p><p> In the name of diversity, federal officials devalued a skills-based test  for hiring - oh, no big deal! - air traffic controllers and instead  implemented a biographical questionnaire, whose purpose was not hiring  skilled controllers.  In fact, the more skills you had, the fewer points  you got, perversely.  But, instead, the point was ensuring the hiring of  people who were of the right race.  </p><p> It was insane, of course.  Dangerous, yes.  And it sparked a major  reaction.  Now, the Department of Transportation says it is ready those  policies in the name of public safety.</p><p> Steven Bradbury is the general counsel of the Department of Transportation  and he joins us tonight.  Mr. Bradbury, thanks for coming on.  </p><p> STEVEN BRADBURY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION GENERAL COUNSEL:  Well,  thanks for having me on, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, it was a pretty simple story, and I think the fix is pretty  simple.  Can you assure our viewers that air traffic controllers will be  hired solely on the basis of relevant criteria?  In other words, how good  they are at air traffic controlling, and not on the basis of irrelevant  criteria like their appearance.  </p><p> BRADBURY:  That's right.  We are making a change to no longer use that  biographical assessment that the FAA has used since 2014 and that you  featured on your show.</p><p> I will point out that the version you've focused on with the questions that  you highlighted, which I agree are counterintuitive at best, was used for  one year in 2014.  Changes were made and a new assessment was used after  2014 with different questions, and it did not have those questions that you  had focused on.</p><p> Nevertheless, in 2016, Congress prohibited the FAA from using the  biographical assessment to screen applicants - more than half of the  applicants for entry-level positions as trainees for air traffic control.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, hold on.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  You're getting  in the weeds here a bit and I think it's sort of a red herring.</p><p> The question is not whether or not a biographical questionnaire is used.   The question is solely, is the hiring done exclusively on the basis of  skills-based criteria, relevant criteria?  Does a person's appearance,  sexual orientation, parents' background, does that play any role in hiring  at all?  At all?</p><p> BRADBURY:  No.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Because if it does, that's dangerous.  No?  At all?</p><p> BRADBURY:  It doesn't.  And we agree with you that for hiring of trainees  for the academy to be trained as air traffic controllers, you really should  focus exclusively on aptitude, competence for being an excellent air  traffic controller.</p><p> And so, we're making - we're clearing the decks.  And what we are doing,  and what I am announcing on your show tonight, is that the FAA is no longer  going to use a biographical assessment in any form and instead is going to  give all applicants for these entry-level positions the aptitude test,  which is the air traffic skills assessment test, which just tests for  aptitude for the characteristics of being an excellent air traffic  controller.</p><p> And that test is validated, has been standardized, it's proctored tests.   It's the same test that applicants take who are graduates of the collegiate  training initiative schools and who apply for the academy to be air traffic  control trainees.</p><p> And I think it's important, Tucker, to point out that what we're talking  about is the incoming candidates for the academy where they get trained,  like a boot camp for air traffic control duties.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> BRADBURY:  These are not people who are hired and put on the job in control  towers to be air traffic controllers.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I understand.</p><p> BRADBURY:  They have to go through very rigorous training at the academy.   And many of them wash out, sometimes more than half washout.  It's  rigorous.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK, OK.  For our purposes - </p><p> BRADBURY:  They also go through two to three years of on-the-job training  as well before they can be certified as professional air traffic  controllers.  </p><p> CARLSON:  The bottom line is - I'm sorry.  Before we did the segment, this  was still going on.  So, before you take too much credit, I'm glad you made  that change, but this was still going on and until we shined a light on it.  </p><p> BRADBURY:  Well, listen, I do give you an assist for helping us focus on  this issue.  </p><p> CARLSON:  We are helping you to focus on it.  All right.  Well, I am glad  you did.  But, I mean, I just want to be clear about that.  I think you  needed some line shone on this.  So, Steven, thank you very much.   Appreciate it.  Unfortunately, we are out of time.</p><p> Democratic mayoral candidate of Chicago trying to muster votes the old  fashion way, by handing out money in church.  Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, in most of America, the old-fashioned political machines  are dead and buried, but in the State of Illinois, they live on.  </p><p>Illinois is, of course, America's second-most dysfunctional state.  You  know the most dysfunctional.  It's the biggest.</p><p> Democratic mayoral candidate Willie Wilson appeared at a Chicago church on  Sunday.  He began handing out bundles of cash to parishioners, ostensibly  to help them pay their bills.  Overall, he gave away more than $200,000.</p><p> Here's the amazing thing.  He says it is totally unrelated to the fact that  he is running for mayor.  Amazing! Just a generous man.</p><p> The state election board says that no laws have been broken.  Of course  not! They are never broken in Illinois.  And we wouldn't want to impugn the  integrity of Illinois politicians.  </p><p> It does make you wonder, why is Blagojevich rotting in prison until he is  old, by the way.  When you've got a city like that, is Rod Blagojevich  really the most dangerous person?  I hope he gets a pardon actually.</p><p> That's it for us tonight.  Tune in every night at 8 p.m.  to the show that  is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Not an  easy thing to pull off in 2018 where everybody is crazy.</p><p> Have a great evening! Sean Hannity is next.

He is a cable news yapper who  spends a lot of his life yelling at people on Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Brennan is also a political extremist who, if you listen carefully, seems  unbalanced.  If John Brennan gets a security clearance, then why not the  homeless guy talking to himself on the bus?  That seems like a fair  question.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Apparently, the White House agreed with that.  Yesterday, the  administration announced it is seeking to revoke security clearances for  John Brennan, Jim Clapper, and other former officials who no longer work  for the government because, honestly, why would they have security  clearances?</p><p> In a normal year, that would not be a very big story, but things are not  normal right now.  So, here's how the geniuses on cable news reacted.   Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RICHARD HAAS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS PRESIDENT:  This is an abuse of  executive power.  This is Erdogan's Turkey.  </p><p> REP.  ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  That is exactly what you see in  authoritarian regimes.</p><p> DON LEMON, \"CNN TONIGHT\" HOST:  It's childish.  It's petty.  </p><p> REP.  NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  This is so extraordinary.   The last thing you want in intelligence is partisanship.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That he would turn against them in a way that,  obviously, disrespects civil liberties, disrespect free press is an  autocratic kind of move.  It's the kind of you'd see in a banana republic.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Autocratic! First, they came for John Brennan's security  clearance and I said nothing.  Barf.</p><p> Next time, you hear some blowhard on television warning about creeping  authoritarianism, ask yourself, am I for unfettered free speech?  Of course  you are.  You are an American.  That is your birthright and the foundation  of all other liberties.  </p><p> Then ask yourself a second question, how about the guy on television  lecturing us about authoritarianism.  Is he for unfettered free speech?  No  chance.  He considers your opinions hate speech, which is a made-up  category designed to gut the First Amendment and shut you up.  </p><p> He'd happily support big tech firms and college administrators and your  company's HR department as they punish you for saying what you think is  true.</p><p> Creeping authoritarianism?  It's already here.  And that guy is the face of  it.</p><p> Lou Dobbs, by contrast, hosts \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" on FOX Business and he  joins us tonight.  Lou, what do you make of this controversy?  I can't  remember a weirder one.  I was not aware that John Brennan had a moral  right to a security clearance in perpetuity?  </p><p> LOU DOBBS, \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\" HOST:  His ascendancy to the moral high  ground caught me by surprise too.</p><p> This is the man whose CIA spied on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who  lied about spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  </p><p> It is extraordinary.  This man has challenged, insulted and degraded the  presidency throughout the past year, and now would object to having his  security clearance lifted.</p><p> Tucker, I can't imagine why any one of those people retained a security  clearance.  They are of absolutely no use to any of them unless they are  monetizing it, as Sen.  Rand Paul has said, and I thought, frankly, your  discussion with Rand Paul hit exactly the right note in questioning the  existence of security clearance for former officials - period - for any  reason.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I mean, he is a cable news yapper.  He's a consultant to  cable news.  And so is Jim Clapper.  And they have the highest-level  security clearances.  And it raises the question, then why don't I have one  or why don't you have one?  I mean, what could possibly be the  justification for that?  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, I don't know about you, but I am holding out for subpoena  power.  I would much prefer subpoena power.  (INAUDIBLE) we will have lunch  and go from there.</p><p> I think this is just an absurdity that it exists at all.  Think about  Clapper and the quality of people that were in the Obama intelligence  leading the intelligence community under President Obama.  </p><p> Clapper.  I believe Michael Rogers, the head of the NSA out of this, he is  a sterling quality individual.  But Clapper and Brennan and Comey, are you  kidding me?  Why in the world would they have security clearance?  </p><p> CARLSON:  And then, you see these former liberals in good standing  defending this and it makes you realize that whatever Trump is for, they  are against and vice versa.  So, it's very easy to bait them.  All of a  sudden, they're for MS-13 and they're for acting in porn movies as a noble  profession and they're for demented former CIA directors having security  clearances.</p><p> I mean, how easy would it be to get them to take totally insane positions  just by telling that Trump is against it?  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, I don't think it would be difficult, as you point out, at  all.  Think about the positions that Clapper has taken, the lies that he  has told.  Comey who has misrepresented at the very least so much.</p><p> He talked about President Trump as a man who is nefarious, but this is the  man he was perfectly willing to serve as his FBI director.  And the list  goes on.</p><p> The madness and the intrigue is overwhelming, I suspect, to most Americans  because first they didn't know that these people had security clearances  still.  They didn't understand why they got them in the first place and  ascended to the top of their agencies.</p><p> And the fact is, whether it's the FBI, the CIA, the DNI, what were their  great accomplishments in achievements in leading the intelligence  community?  </p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  </p><p> DOBBS:  The history of the intelligence community over the past 20 years is  a sad and sorry tale.  </p><p> CARLSON:  If I worked in the White House, I would convene a month-long  symposium against human trafficking just to watch \"Morning Joe\" convene a  panel in favor of it.  I think it would be hilarious.  </p><p> DOBBS:  I will endorse that idea.  I think that's a lovely idea.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Amen.  Great to see you.</p><p> DOBBS:  Great to see you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Buck Sexton is a former CIA analyst.  He worked with the NYPD's  intel division.  He joins us tonight.  </p><p> So, I mean, you've worked in this world, Buck.  You have a better sense of  this.  Does this apply across all government agencies?  If I am a rifleman  in the Marine Corps, do I get to keep my rifle at the end?  Or if I work in  artillery, do I get to keep my howitzer when I leave?  Is this kind of the  way it works?  </p><p> BUCK SEXTON, FORMER CIA ANALYST:  There is specific law with regard to  clearances and there's also customs, Tucker.  When you're talking about  former agency heads, they tend to keep them in a way that run-of-the-mill  employees like me don't.</p><p> And they also have, as a courtesy, they'd say, the ability to go back in  and still have real-time access to classified information if, in fact, they  were called in for that.  That's the justification for this.</p><p> But I feel like this whole debate just highlights a much bigger problem, a  much more nefarious issue, and that is we have all these people lecturing  us about institutions being undermined and look what's happened to us and  the hacking of our democracy, this can't be allowed to happen.</p><p> We have the former intel chiefs of the biggest agencies in the United  States government, the most sophisticated intelligence apparatus on the  planet who are actively trying to undermine now the sitting president of  the United States and they weren't the intel chief 10 or 20 years ago.   They were the most recent one.</p><p> What that means is that, every time you've got Clapper or Brennan or others  who are going on air, talking about, for example, the Russia collusion  case, there is at least some perception - and by the way, I think some of  them have tried to enhance this with what they have said.  They've dance  around this - that they are drawing upon their classified knowledge to make  some of these assumptions.  They have extra gravitas.  They should be paid  attention to more because they were the most recent NSA or CIA director.   That is insidious.</p><p> I mean, this is deeply destructive to the fate that any future president  could have in the previous administration's appointees at that level, and  that's something, I think, does not get talked about enough at all here.  </p><p> CARLSON:  No.  I think it's a very wise point.  And remind us again the  point of having all these various alphabet agencies.  The intel apparatus  exists only to serve the executive and to help him or her make wise foreign  policy decisions, correct?  Is there some other reason to have a CIA?</p><p> SEXTON:  Well, I mean, there's a lot of agencies.  Seventeen now, I think,  technically in the intel community, though someone is probably going to  correct me on that one because it's actually grown since I was in it.  So,  that will tell you something.  It wasn't that long ago.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes, it has.</p><p> SEXTON:  But they exist for national security purposes.  They would tell  you what all the different specific missions are.  But, yes, they are  executive branch agencies.  And that then brings us to they should be  serving the executive branch.</p><p> The same way that liberals, Tucker, don't really accept that President  Trump is the president and, therefore, could fire Comey for no reason or  any reason, if he wants to revoke clearances under Article II authority, he  can do that.  </p><p> So, all of this freak out you are seeing from people is a form of Trump  derangement syndrome on display, for an issue that, by the way, most of  these journalists have no idea what they are talking about.</p><p> They have never held a clearance.  They don't know what goes into this and  they don't know why anyone has one anyone.</p><p> CARLSON:  Also, they are dumb.  I mean, if Trump is an authoritarian, he's  a pretty inefficient one.  I mean, if Brennan and Clapper still have  clearances a year-and-a-half in, it's not much of a police state, I would  say.  </p><p> Buck Sexton, great to see you.  </p><p> SEXTON:  Good to see you, Tucker.  Thanks.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, they're inflamed over on the left.  And tempers do not  appear to be cooling.</p><p> Over this weekend, \"The Denver Post\" published a letter to the editor  suggesting that Trump and other members of the administration literally  deserve to be executed for treason.</p><p> Well, as we do so very often when things get completely nuts, we bring in  some perspective.  Fox's senior political analyst Brit Hume has seen  everything and, therefore, he can put this in the appropriate context and  calm us down.  </p><p> Brit, great to see you.</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Thank you, Tucker.  Nice to  see you.  </p><p> CARLSON:  What do you make of this?  </p><p> HUME:  Well, I went and read the letter.  And it basically references Trump  as some kind of traitor and notes that the Rosenbergs - Julius and Ethel  Rosenberg - were found guilty of that and, says the letter, they were  executed.</p><p> I didn't quite see this as a suggestion that Trump be executed, but it was  close to the line.  And you might have thought the editors at \"The Denver  Post\" would've been more careful about publishing it.</p><p> But if we weren't talking about it tonight, I don't think the world will  look longer than a few minutes even note that it ever happened.  So, I  think it's probably much ado about not much.</p><p> CARLSON:  But it raises the larger question, which is - and correctly -  that treason is a death penalty offense and the Rosenbergs were indeed  executed for it at Sing Sing.</p><p> And if you accuse to someone of that, particularly an elected official, you  are making a pretty stout charge.  </p><p> HUME:  You are.  Well, this is - the thing about this is and it came up in  your previous segment when you were talking about John Brennan, who openly  accused the president of treason, we now inhabit an age of exaggeration.   Everybody goes to battle stations and two DEFCON 1 over everything.</p><p> So, it is not enough to say that Trump unwisely sided with Putin for a  period of time against the intelligence.  No, no, it's treason and he is a  traitor.</p><p> And on the other side, of course, everybody is said to be corrupt and there  is no reasoned discussion going on right now.  Everybody on all sides goes  completely berserk, hair on fire over everything.  And on and on it goes.</p><p> Right now, there is a Battle Royale raging in Washington over the  interpretation of the materials, the FISA application materials released at  the end of the last week, as to their interpretation.  </p><p> Some journalists are writing, after reviewing them, that they support the  conclusions reached by the Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence  Committee.  Others are saying that that's all a lie, that they don't  support that at all.  I have never seen such diametrically opposed  interpretations.  And it is all at the highest possible decimal level.   Like nothing I've ever seen before.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, what would happen if there was an actual crisis?  If there  was an attack by a foreign power, physical attack, an actual attack, not a  metaphorical one, and we found ourselves at war?  How would a country this  divided prosecute a war?  ]] </p><p> HUME:  Well, it would be entirely up to the government itself because I'm  sure that the president could interpret anything as he did as a kind of  whack the dog scenario and then believe that it was false and the  intelligence had reported it was false and so on.  Nobody trusts anybody.</p><p> And that extends to the Congress, it extends to the media.  The competition  among media outlets is more intense than I've ever seen it.  And all media  outlets criticize all other media outlets.  Professional courtesy about  that is all but gone.  And we inhabit an age where everybody is at the  ramparts over everything all day, every day.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I have noticed that.  Brit Hume, remaining calm despite all of  it.  Thank you very much for that.</p><p> HUME:  Thanks, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Bernie Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic primary, probably for not  entirely legitimate reasons, but Democratic socialism which is what he ran  on appears to be taking over his party.  Irony of ironies.  What is it  exactly?  We'll talk to one of the architects of the Bernie Sanders 2016  presidential campaign.  Coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Democratic socialism has for the last 100 years been pretty much  a fringe belief, even on the left.  Now, open socialists are all of a  sudden running for office across the United States and they are winning  Democratic primaries.</p><p> Today, on \"The View\", Joy Behar started an argument when she declared her  support for this ideology.  Here's part of it.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MEGHAN MCCAIN, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST:  On your platform, I think you should  start paying the amount of taxes that every socialist in this country  thinks you needs to.  </p><p> JOY BEHAR, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST:  They have just given this enormous tax  break to the very, very wealthy in this country.  That tax break doesn't  have to be so generous to those really rich people, does it?  Because if  you don't give that money to them, what happens to that money?  Better  schools, better post office, better garbage pickup, better police  department, better fire department.  </p><p> MCCAIN:  If you think the government is so good at running things, then the  post office is a great run business, the VA.  Some of us do not want  socialism to be normalized in this country.  </p><p> WHOOPI GOLDBERG, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST:  We will be right back.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Behar did not release her own tax returns, so we could see how  many deductions she took.  We're awaiting that.</p><p> Meanwhile, Jeff Weaver managed Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.  He's  the author of the book \"How Bernie Won:  Inside the Revolution That is  Taking Back Our Country and Where We Go From Here.\" Jeff Weaver joins us  tonight.  Jeff, thanks a lot for coming on.  </p><p> JEFF WEAVER, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Hey, Tucker.  Thanks  for having me.  I really appreciate it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, you just did an interview and were asked basically what is  this creed, what is Democratic socialism and you described basically a  series of economic - here's what you said.  </p><p> People want economic security, they want healthcare, they want dignity in  old age, they want to know that they are not going to die with nothing.   All pretty reasonable sounding ideas.</p><p> When I listen to - and how we pay for them is the point, but we could  debate that, but those aren't bad ideas.</p><p> When I hear modern Democrats talking, it is never about economics.  It is  about abortion.  It is overwhelmingly about immigration and why we need to  let people stay here, whether they are legal or not.</p><p> It is nothing about an agenda of empowering the middle class economically,  why is that?  </p><p> WEAVER:  Well, let me tell you, Tucker.  I think Democrats have to start  walking and chewing gum at the same time.  We do have to talk about the  plight of marginalized communities in this country who have been targeted  by the president during his administration, but we also have to talk about  the economic needs of people in every zip code in this country.  </p><p> Wages are stagnant.  People are anxious about their futures, about their  kids' futures, about taking care of their aging parents, about affording  college.  And we have to talk about all of these issues, frankly.</p><p> And I agree with you that we need to hear more conversations.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  But there's only so much time in the day, there's only so  much attention, there's really only so much our system can digest.  And if  your fixation is with the esoteric sexual politics, like transgender  bathrooms or global warming -</p><p> WEAVER:  Or plastic straws on Fox.  I mean, I was just watching - how many  shows on plastic straws are you going to have here on Fox?  </p><p> CARLSON:  OK, we did one.  We do a lot of segments on economics because I  think it's really important.  So, like the elites of your party are only -</p><p> WEAVER:  I would not call it a core economic issue, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm not claiming it was.  We do a lot of segments on core  economic issues, including this one.</p><p> But I'm just interested, like your elites never say anything about how  inviting millions of poor people into the country every year might depress  wages for the working class.  </p><p> WEAVER:  Look, we are not talking about inviting in millions of people.   The truth of the matter is that we do have millions of people in this  country living in the shadows who are working hard, many of them, in fact,  are paying taxes.  Their kids are in schools.  They are contributing to our  country.  And I think we have to recognize that reality.  That's for sure.</p><p> But let's talk about the core economic issues.  You wanted to talk about  \"Democratic socialism.\" I know people on Fox love the scary labels and the  red baiting.  But let's talk about what that means.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  I am  actually giving you the fairest possible shake you will get on any channel  ever.  I'm taking your ideas seriously.  I'm not mocking you.</p><p> I'm just wondering if your ideas aren't on a collision course with the  agenda set by the elites in your party.  And you know as well as I do, the  answer is yes.  They are incompatible.  What you are saying is not  compatible with what they are saying.  And you know it.  </p><p> WEAVER:  What I am saying is that we need a Democratic Party in this  country and we need a government in this country that represents the needs  of ordinary people, and that includes an agenda that guarantees healthcare  to all people, that pays people a living wage, that pays equally whether  you are a man or woman, that protects our environment, that gives people  opportunity to go to college and to have a good life.  That's what I'm  talking about.  People not retiring in poverty, destroying social security.   These are the things that people are talking about in the progressive  movement.</p><p> And, frankly, Tucker, if you look at the polling, it's wildly popular.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I agree with a lot of what you just said.  What you said that is  not true at all is that that's what they are talking about.  They're not.   They are talking about race, they're talking about sex, they're talking  about identity politics, they're attacking people because of their skin  color.  I mean, I do this for a living.  I know exactly what they're  saying.  And they're not saying what you just said.</p><p> WEAVER:  Well, let's not talk about people attacking people for their skin  color because, I think, if we go right to the White House where that  starts, frankly, my friend.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But let's be real.  I mean, honestly, every time I talk to  progressives, it's like, oh, white man this, it's like what does that have  to do with empowering the average person economically, which is what the  agenda ought to be?  </p><p> WEAVER:  We have got to empower people of all races in this country,  frankly.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p> WEAVER:  And you cannot ignore the intersection of race and gender and  other things.  I mean you're a smart guy.  I am not on \"Hannity\" here.   This is a real show.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, please.</p><p> WEAVER:  You can't ignore those issues.  But you're right, we do have to -</p><p> CARLSON:  I am not ignoring the issues, but the children of your party who  are clearly in charge, they're all about - I mean, do you personally, as a  pretty serious guy - I guess a serious guy - get a little tired of having  to follow, like, inflamed upper middle-class college students who are  constantly yelping about identity politics?  Don't you think that's kind of  a distraction from, like, the adult issues or no?  </p><p> WEAVER:  I think you are creating a false dichotomy here.  There are  important issues that are both issues of identity and there are important  issues of economics, and I think we have to speak to both.</p><p> And people in the Democratic Party who advocate just one or the other, I am  constantly in conflict with those people who think that we only have to  talk about one side of this two-sided coin.</p><p> We have to talk about these important issues that affect marginalized  communities and we have to talk about laying out an economic agenda that is  going to uplift people of all races in every zip code in this country.   That's the mission in front of us.</p><p> And if you look at Bernie Sanders' historic campaign in 2016, he won -  overwhelmingly won independent voters in the Democratic primary, a process,  including in places that were very, very red because folks understood that  he was standing with their families in their everyday struggles.  </p><p> And that's what we as Democrats and progressives have to do.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm actually kind of - I'm kind of aware of that.  I just think -  here is where I disagree with you, and we've got to go, but I will just say  in one sentence, I think the identity politics people are beating you.  And  I hope I am wrong.  </p><p> WEAVER:  I think with people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others, we  are winning.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I think she's on the identity politics side.  But come back.   Sorry, we are out of time.  Jeff Weaver, thank you.</p><p> Well, it's not getting a ton of attention, but we seem to be moving  incrementally toward war with Iran.  Maybe we should talk about it first.   Is it a good idea.  We'll take an in-depth look at that next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, with all the screeching recently about Vladimir Putin and  Russia, treason, it's been easy to miss the real news.  We have some real  news.  The United States is inching closer apparently to some kind of  conflict with Iran.</p><p> This Sunday, the president tweeted this, \"To Iranian President Rouhani,  never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer the  consequences, the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered  before.  We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words  of violence and death.  Be cautious!\"</p><p> Well, the interesting thing about this tweet is what didn't happen.  The  press is usually quick to jump on the president's intemperate tweets.</p><p>CNN has apparently an entire team of progressive teenagers devoted to  monitoring his feed.  But this time, there wasn't much comment from the  media.</p><p> Why?  Because if there is one thing Washington loves more than open borders  and fat lobbying contracts, it's pointless wars half a world away.</p><p> Contractors get rich.  Neocon intellectuals feel powerful.  Bill Kristol,  Max Boot and Nancy Pelosi agree on one thing, war is good as long as the  war does not help the United States.</p><p> John Bolton finds himself in that camp.  A lifelong neocon, Bolton  repeatedly has called for toppling the Iranian government again and again,  though tellingly he's never suggested what might replace the Iranian  government once it's toppled.</p><p> Now, as the national security advisor, he has been changing our policies.   The US, for example, has begun promoting protests within Iran in an effort  to overthrow the regime there.</p><p> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on board with this.  UN  Ambassador Nikki Haley definitely is.  Here's a recent sampling of her  saber-rattling on Iran.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NIKKI HALEY, US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN:  Their government has a long history  of murdering its own people who dare to speak the truth.</p><p> The Iranian regime is now on notice.  The world will be watching what you  do.  </p><p> If you want to come to the table and work on a new Iran deal, we'll be  right there to talk to you, but you're not going to threaten us to do it.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Iran may have messed with the wrong president here.  </p><p> HALEY:  They absolutely did.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Now, some of that is bluster, obviously, but some of it is  exactly what it looks like - the groundwork for conflict.  We are moving  toward, however slowly, some kind of confrontation with Iran.  </p><p> And that should worry everybody, but it should especially be of concern to  anyone who supported the president.</p><p> If President Trump decides to go to war with Iran, it will destroy his  presidency just as the Iraq War destroyed the presidency of his Republican  predecessor George W.  Bush.  </p><p> Attacking Iran is not like intervening in Libya or Syria or even like  invading Iraq.  It entails far greater risk and much higher costs.</p><p> Geographically, Iran is about four times the size of Iraq.  It has three  times as many people as Iraq had when we invaded.  Iraq was a divided  country along religious lines.  Iran is not.  It's cohesive.</p><p> It's a much richer country too with a military that has spent many years  preparing for a US invasion.  It's a formidable force.</p><p> In 2002, the US military carried out a war game that was widely understood  to be a simulation of an invasion of Iran.  It went badly.  America  suffered more than 20,000 casualties in a single day and officials halted  the game.</p><p> So, the question is not could America beat Iran.  Yes, it could.  The  question is, is it ready to try?  Well, less ready than ever actually.</p><p> Compared to 2003, our country is deeper in debt and far more politically  divided than it's been since the Civil War.  Our military is overstretched.   Ask anyone in it.  </p><p> Meanwhile, China is much stronger than it was 15 years ago.  You can bet  the Chinese military will be more assertive than ever when we are tied down  in yet another quagmire.</p><p> Does anyone outside of Washington actually support a new war in Iran?   Well, the Saudi royal family does.  So do the leaders of other Sunni Gulf  states.  They see Iran as their greatest rival and they'd love to have  America fight a war against Iran for them.  Why wouldn't they?</p><p> President Trump's own supporters know better than this, though.  You'll  remember that, back in 2016, during the Republican primary debate in South  Carolina, Donald Trump was the only person on that stage to call the Iraq  War a mistake.</p><p> He vowed never to repeat anything like that and promised that, if elected,  he would act only in America's interest.  </p><p> The morons handicapping the debate on television predicted Trump would  lose, it was over, saying that had sealed his fate.  And, of course, they  were wrong and he won.  </p><p> Republican voters agreed with him, it turned out.  They had a better sense  of the truth.  A lot of their kids were serving in the military.</p><p> Two-and-a-half years later, amazingly, the president's advisors are telling  him he must abandon that promise.  Iran is too important, they say.  It's  the greatest threat this country faces despite the fact that virtually  every terror attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran's  Sunni enemies.  Doesn't matter.</p><p> The mullahs are months away from building a nuke, the neocons tell us.   Keep in mind, these people have been saying the exact same thing, word for  word, for more than a decade.  You can look it up on Google.</p><p> They have no idea what they are talking about.  Their track records are  embarrassing.  Disaster after disaster.  They ought to be selling time- shares in Maui or doing something useful.</p><p> Instead, they have more political power than they have ever had.   Amazingly, almost to a person, the same group bitterly opposed the  president they now work for.  They repeatedly attacked him in public and  they attacked him savagely in private.</p><p> They consider his ideas absurd to this day.  They regard the notion of  putting America first as morally offensive.  They're fully on Bill  Kristol's team.  </p><p> In fact, just last week, Kristol was encouraging Nikki Haley to challenge  her boss, Donald Trump, for the Republican nomination two years from now,  and in a way that makes sense.  </p><p> If there was a swamp in Washington, you're looking at it, the foreign  policy establishment.  They are working overtime to ensnare the president  in a mess in Iran.  Let's hope that he understands exactly what's going on.</p><p> Douglas Macgregor is a retired army colonel, author of the book \"Margin Of  Victory,\" a frequent guest on this show and he joins us tonight.  </p><p> Colonel, Macgregor, thank you very much for coming on.  </p><p> DOUGLAS MACGREGOR, \"MARGIN OF VICTORY\" AUTHOR:  Thanks, Tucker.  I  appreciate it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, I can't help, since I have been in Washington for 30 years,  notice that the very people who are pushing this new entanglement, this new  enterprise are the Trump administration's gravest enemies on almost every  subject, and they are also the same people who predicted outcomes that  never came to pass.</p><p> And in other words, they have been wrong again and again and again.  How do  these people still have power?  </p><p> MACGREGOR:  Well, look, I think President Trump lost control of the whole  appointment process and staffing the government shortly after the election.</p><p> I don't know the details, but he ended up appointing large numbers of  people who subsequently brought in their friends, almost all of whom were  opposed to Donald Trump and his agenda.</p><p> But I think it's important to say something about the president's comment  because the president is right.  If you look at the Iranian defense  establishment, we spend more money on one Ford class aircraft carrier than  Iran spends on its entire military establishment.</p><p> So, if there were a war, it would be a very one-sided affair.  But the  problem is that wars don't work that way.  They tend to move in directions  that no one anticipated.</p><p> Suddenly, people that you would think otherwise would avoid conflict might  decide that it's not in their interest to see Iran destroyed.  And I'm  thinking of Russia and I am thinking of China as perfect examples.  Why  would they stand by and watch us pulverize Iran?  It seems very unlikely.</p><p> So, I think President Trump understands that.  In fact, this afternoon,  when he talked to VFW, he made the comment that he pulled out of the deal  with Iran, but he's open to another deal, he's open to talking, to  negotiating.  </p><p> He's talked to the Russians and he has talked to the North Koreans.  That  seems to have had a positive impact certainly on Northeast Asia.  We don't  know what will happen in the future, but I think that's a good sign.</p><p> So, I think dealing with Donald Trump, understand that anyone who threatens  the United States with this man in the White House should seek psychiatric  care, they're crazy because Donald Trump means what he says.  He will fight  to defend the United States.</p><p> On the other hand, I don't see any evidence that he is interested in  precipitating a conflict.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Do you think the advisors around him whose comments we just  played, Nikki Haley, for example, or John Bolton - they seem to come at  this with pre-existing agendas.</p><p> MACGREGOR:  Well, of course.  But the good news is that President Trump  hasn't listened very much to his advisors.  If he did, we would never have  made any progress on the Korean Peninsula.  We would not be -</p><p> CARLSON:  Good point!</p><p> MACGREGOR:  - working with the Chinese.  We would never have met with  Vladimir Putin.  So, God bless the president.  He doesn't listen to these  people.  So, I'm not too worried about that.</p><p> The thing that does worry me, though, given some of the comments that are  being made is this red meat on the table for the war lobby.  You and I know  that there are a lot of people who would welcome conflict with Iran.   That's obvious.</p><p> I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for  something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident.  Many of your viewers may not  remember that.  It never happened.  And we could very well be treated to  something like that in the Gulf.  We should watch for that.</p><p> And this is an example of President Trump's comments on fake news.  He  should not be sabotaged by fake news.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I agree.  We've seen it happen twice in Syria.  Twice! Colonel,  thank you very much.  Great to see you.  </p><p> MACGREGOR:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  One activist says conservatives only want Planned Parenthood to  be defunded in order to force the nation's women to get pregnant.  It's a  confusing argument.  We're going to allow her to explain it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, Republicans ran on the promise to defund Planned Parenthood.   Half a billion dollars a year of taxpayer money.  Remember that?  That was  in 2016 election.  Congressional Republicans haven't really tried hard to  do that.</p><p> That has not stopped the administration, though, from taking its own kind  of action on the question.  The administration is attempting to tweak Title  X funding formulas to divert federal funds away from Planned Parenthood,  the country's largest abortion provider.</p><p> Sonia Ossorio is the president of the New York chapter of the National  Organization for Women.  She says the real goal of defunding Planned  Parenthood isn't to prevent taxpayers from funding something they abhor,  abortion, it's to force women to get pregnant.</p><p> Sonia Ossorio joins us tonight.  Sonia, it's great to see you.</p><p> SONIA OSSORIO, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN OF NEW YORK PRESIDENT:   Thank you.  </p><p> Well, Tucker, if you take away the access to abortion and you take away  birth control, which is a really big issue that we've got to discuss here  tonight, you are indeed forcing women to have children.</p><p> Now, let's get to the point.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I wonder how many people actually - I think most of our viewers  know that what you're seeing is pure lunacy and dishonest.  And you do too.</p><p> But let's just sort of - just for fun, reverse engineer this for a second.   Who is taking away the right to have an abortion?</p><p> I think the law - I don't think I know.  I read it, the proposed regulation  change would just make it less likely that taxpayers have to pay for  abortion.  Is that the same as banning abortion?</p><p> OSSORIO:  Let's be really clear.  And this is something - and it's really  the reason, Tucker, that I wanted to come on your show tonight because I  needed to dispel this myth.  </p><p> People need to understand, I want all the viewers to understand, your  taxpayers do not pay for abortions in this country.  Taxpayers do not pay  for abortions.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, they don't.  But they do give half a billion dollars to the  largest abortionist on the continent.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  Your taxpayers do pay for abortions in the case of rape and if a  woman is dying.  Those are the two situations since 1977.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  You're spewing propaganda here.  We pay, taxpayers, at  gunpoint, half a billion to Planned Parenthood which provides - commits  more abortion than anybody else in the country.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  I don't think you should joke at gunpoint.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm not joking.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  You just talked about gunpoint.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, it is at gunpoint.  If you don't pay your taxes, they come  and arrest you, the cops arrest you.  So, you don't pay your taxes  voluntarily.  You do it because the government backs it up with the threat  of force.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  What everybody should also understand, if you give me a moment to  speak, what everybody should understand also is Planned Parenthood works  just like any other medical provider.</p><p> They get reimbursed for the procedures they perform that are approved by  the government.  So, they get a reimbursement for an STD testing, they get  reimbursed for all those other service they do, but not for abortions.</p><p> But I want to take a moment to talk about what is happening - </p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  You've taken a lot of moments to talk.  So, let me just  you one question, which is - </p><p> OSSORIO:  We've got 4 minutes, so down to two.  </p><p> CARLSON:  You think abortion is a constitutional right.  I think the right  to bear arms is because I have read the Bill of Rights.  Why shouldn't  taxpayers be forced to subsidize the NRA or buy my guns?  </p><p> OSSORIO:  Now, who is talking lunacy and who is being dishonest?  </p><p> CARLSON:  Why is that crazy?  You think taxpayers should pay for an  abortion - you're giving me the moral lecture, but just answer my question.   I think it's an interesting question.</p><p> OSSORIO:  I want viewers to know that one in four women in this country  have an abortion.  </p><p> CARLSON:  You're not going to answer my question.</p><p> OSSORIO:  I'm not answering question, no, because it's a stupid question.</p><p> CARLSON:  Why?  I think it's a really interesting question.  Oh, because  that's causing you to enlarge your mind and it hurts.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  I've got an opportunity to speak to your viewers and I'm trying  to speak to them.  One in four women have an abortion in this country.   That has gone down from 1 in 3.  It's gone down from 1 in 3.  The reason  why it's gone down is because we've had teen pregnancy prevention programs  that have been successful.</p><p> And, right now, the Trump administration wants to divert $250 million of  teen pregnancy programs -</p><p> CARLSON:  This is why I never like to talk to the abortion people because  they just shout.  OK, I'm sorry.  Don't make me cut you off.  Please.  </p><p> OSSORIO:  They want to divert that -</p><p> CARLSON:  Please! I'm trying.</p><p> OSSORIO:  a - to abstinence only education.</p><p> CARLSON:  All right, Sonia.  I tried.  It was a good faith effort.  I  really tried.  I hate cutting people off, but you were just too obnoxious.   I'm sorry.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right here on this show, we warned you that the FAA was putting  the country at risk in the way that they were hiring air traffic  controllers.  Now, they claim they have changed.  We have an update to our  exclusive investigation.  And that's next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  In an exclusive investigation by this program, we warned you  about the war on standards underway at the FAA.</p><p> In the name of diversity, federal officials devalued a skills-based test  for hiring - oh, no big deal! - air traffic controllers and instead  implemented a biographical questionnaire, whose purpose was not hiring  skilled controllers.  In fact, the more skills you had, the fewer points  you got, perversely.  But, instead, the point was ensuring the hiring of  people who were of the right race.  </p><p> It was insane, of course.  Dangerous, yes.  And it sparked a major  reaction.  Now, the Department of Transportation says it is ready those  policies in the name of public safety.</p><p> Steven Bradbury is the general counsel of the Department of Transportation  and he joins us tonight.  Mr. Bradbury, thanks for coming on.  </p><p> STEVEN BRADBURY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION GENERAL COUNSEL:  Well,  thanks for having me on, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, it was a pretty simple story, and I think the fix is pretty  simple.  Can you assure our viewers that air traffic controllers will be  hired solely on the basis of relevant criteria?  In other words, how good  they are at air traffic controlling, and not on the basis of irrelevant  criteria like their appearance.  </p><p> BRADBURY:  That's right.  We are making a change to no longer use that  biographical assessment that the FAA has used since 2014 and that you  featured on your show.</p><p> I will point out that the version you've focused on with the questions that  you highlighted, which I agree are counterintuitive at best, was used for  one year in 2014.  Changes were made and a new assessment was used after  2014 with different questions, and it did not have those questions that you  had focused on.</p><p> Nevertheless, in 2016, Congress prohibited the FAA from using the  biographical assessment to screen applicants - more than half of the  applicants for entry-level positions as trainees for air traffic control.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, hold on.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  You're getting  in the weeds here a bit and I think it's sort of a red herring.</p><p> The question is not whether or not a biographical questionnaire is used.   The question is solely, is the hiring done exclusively on the basis of  skills-based criteria, relevant criteria?  Does a person's appearance,  sexual orientation, parents' background, does that play any role in hiring  at all?  At all?</p><p> BRADBURY:  No.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Because if it does, that's dangerous.  No?  At all?</p><p> BRADBURY:  It doesn't.  And we agree with you that for hiring of trainees  for the academy to be trained as air traffic controllers, you really should  focus exclusively on aptitude, competence for being an excellent air  traffic controller.</p><p> And so, we're making - we're clearing the decks.  And what we are doing,  and what I am announcing on your show tonight, is that the FAA is no longer  going to use a biographical assessment in any form and instead is going to  give all applicants for these entry-level positions the aptitude test,  which is the air traffic skills assessment test, which just tests for  aptitude for the characteristics of being an excellent air traffic  controller.</p><p> And that test is validated, has been standardized, it's proctored tests.   It's the same test that applicants take who are graduates of the collegiate  training initiative schools and who apply for the academy to be air traffic  control trainees.</p><p> And I think it's important, Tucker, to point out that what we're talking  about is the incoming candidates for the academy where they get trained,  like a boot camp for air traffic control duties.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> BRADBURY:  These are not people who are hired and put on the job in control  towers to be air traffic controllers.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I understand.</p><p> BRADBURY:  They have to go through very rigorous training at the academy.   And many of them wash out, sometimes more than half washout.  It's  rigorous.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK, OK.  For our purposes - </p><p> BRADBURY:  They also go through two to three years of on-the-job training  as well before they can be certified as professional air traffic  controllers.  </p><p> CARLSON:  The bottom line is - I'm sorry.  Before we did the segment, this  was still going on.  So, before you take too much credit, I'm glad you made  that change, but this was still going on and until we shined a light on it.  </p><p> BRADBURY:  Well, listen, I do give you an assist for helping us focus on  this issue.  </p><p> CARLSON:  We are helping you to focus on it.  All right.  Well, I am glad  you did.  But, I mean, I just want to be clear about that.  I think you  needed some line shone on this.  So, Steven, thank you very much.   Appreciate it.  Unfortunately, we are out of time.</p><p> Democratic mayoral candidate of Chicago trying to muster votes the old  fashion way, by handing out money in church.  Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, in most of America, the old-fashioned political machines  are dead and buried, but in the State of Illinois, they live on.  </p><p>Illinois is, of course, America's second-most dysfunctional state.  You  know the most dysfunctional.  It's the biggest.</p><p> Democratic mayoral candidate Willie Wilson appeared at a Chicago church on  Sunday.  He began handing out bundles of cash to parishioners, ostensibly  to help them pay their bills.  Overall, he gave away more than $200,000.</p><p> Here's the amazing thing.  He says it is totally unrelated to the fact that  he is running for mayor.  Amazing! Just a generous man.</p><p> The state election board says that no laws have been broken.  Of course  not! They are never broken in Illinois.  And we wouldn't want to impugn the  integrity of Illinois politicians.  </p><p> It does make you wonder, why is Blagojevich rotting in prison until he is  old, by the way.  When you've got a city like that, is Rod Blagojevich  really the most dangerous person?  I hope he gets a pardon actually.</p><p> That's it for us tonight.  Tune in every night at 8 p.m.  to the show that  is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Not an  easy thing to pull off in 2018 where everybody is crazy.</p><p> Have a great evening! Sean Hannity is next.

He doesn't work for the government anymore. He is a cable news yapper who spends a lot of his life yelling at people on Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brennan is also a political extremist who, if you listen carefully, seems unbalanced. If John Brennan gets a security clearance, then why not the homeless guy talking to himself on the bus? That seems like a fair question.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apparently, the White House agreed with that. Yesterday, the administration announced it is seeking to revoke security clearances for John Brennan, Jim Clapper, and other former officials who no longer work for the government because, honestly, why would they have security clearances?</p><p>In a normal year, that would not be a very big story, but things are not normal right now. So, here's how the geniuses on cable news reacted. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD HAAS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS PRESIDENT: This is an abuse of executive power. This is Erdogan's Turkey.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: That is exactly what you see in authoritarian regimes.</p><p>DON LEMON, \"CNN TONIGHT\" HOST: It's childish. It's petty.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: This is so extraordinary. The last thing you want in intelligence is partisanship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That he would turn against them in a way that, obviously, disrespects civil liberties, disrespect free press is an autocratic kind of move. It's the kind of you'd see in a banana republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Autocratic! First, they came for John Brennan's security clearance and I said nothing. Barf.</p><p>Next time, you hear some blowhard on television warning about creeping authoritarianism, ask yourself, am I for unfettered free speech? Of course you are. You are an American. That is your birthright and the foundation of all other liberties.</p><p>Then ask yourself a second question, how about the guy on television lecturing us about authoritarianism. Is he for unfettered free speech? No chance. He considers your opinions hate speech, which is a made-up category designed to gut the First Amendment and shut you up.</p><p>He'd happily support big tech firms and college administrators and your company's HR department as they punish you for saying what you think is true.</p><p>Creeping authoritarianism? It's already here. And that guy is the face of it.</p><p>Lou Dobbs, by contrast, hosts \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" on FOX Business and he joins us tonight. Lou, what do you make of this controversy? I can't remember a weirder one. I was not aware that John Brennan had a moral right to a security clearance in perpetuity?</p><p>LOU DOBBS, \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\" HOST: His ascendancy to the moral high ground caught me by surprise too.</p><p>This is the man whose CIA spied on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who lied about spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>It is extraordinary. This man has challenged, insulted and degraded the presidency throughout the past year, and now would object to having his security clearance lifted.</p><p>Tucker, I can't imagine why any one of those people retained a security clearance. They are of absolutely no use to any of them unless they are monetizing it, as Sen. Rand Paul has said, and I thought, frankly, your discussion with Rand Paul hit exactly the right note in questioning the existence of security clearance for former officials - period - for any reason.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I mean, he is a cable news yapper. He's a consultant to cable news. And so is Jim Clapper. And they have the highest-level security clearances. And it raises the question, then why don't I have one or why don't you have one? I mean, what could possibly be the justification for that?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I don't know about you, but I am holding out for subpoena power. I would much prefer subpoena power. (INAUDIBLE) we will have lunch and go from there.</p><p>I think this is just an absurdity that it exists at all. Think about Clapper and the quality of people that were in the Obama intelligence leading the intelligence community under President Obama.</p><p>Clapper. I believe Michael Rogers, the head of the NSA out of this, he is a sterling quality individual. But Clapper and Brennan and Comey, are you kidding me? Why in the world would they have security clearance?</p><p>CARLSON: And then, you see these former liberals in good standing defending this and it makes you realize that whatever Trump is for, they are against and vice versa. So, it's very easy to bait them. All of a sudden, they're for MS-13 and they're for acting in porn movies as a noble profession and they're for demented former CIA directors having security clearances.</p><p>I mean, how easy would it be to get them to take totally insane positions just by telling that Trump is against it?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I don't think it would be difficult, as you point out, at all. Think about the positions that Clapper has taken, the lies that he has told. Comey who has misrepresented at the very least so much.</p><p>He talked about President Trump as a man who is nefarious, but this is the man he was perfectly willing to serve as his FBI director. And the list goes on.</p><p>The madness and the intrigue is overwhelming, I suspect, to most Americans because first they didn't know that these people had security clearances still. They didn't understand why they got them in the first place and ascended to the top of their agencies.</p><p>And the fact is, whether it's the FBI, the CIA, the DNI, what were their great accomplishments in achievements in leading the intelligence community?</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>DOBBS: The history of the intelligence community over the past 20 years is a sad and sorry tale.</p><p>CARLSON: If I worked in the White House, I would convene a month-long symposium against human trafficking just to watch \"Morning Joe\" convene a panel in favor of it. I think it would be hilarious.</p><p>DOBBS: I will endorse that idea. I think that's a lovely idea.</p><p>CARLSON: Amen. Great to see you.</p><p>DOBBS: Great to see you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Buck Sexton is a former CIA analyst. He worked with the NYPD's intel division. He joins us tonight.</p><p>So, I mean, you've worked in this world, Buck. You have a better sense of this. Does this apply across all government agencies? If I am a rifleman in the Marine Corps, do I get to keep my rifle at the end? Or if I work in artillery, do I get to keep my howitzer when I leave? Is this kind of the way it works?</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, FORMER CIA ANALYST: There is specific law with regard to clearances and there's also customs, Tucker. When you're talking about former agency heads, they tend to keep them in a way that run-of-the-mill employees like me don't.</p><p>And they also have, as a courtesy, they'd say, the ability to go back in and still have real-time access to classified information if, in fact, they were called in for that. That's the justification for this.</p><p>But I feel like this whole debate just highlights a much bigger problem, a much more nefarious issue, and that is we have all these people lecturing us about institutions being undermined and look what's happened to us and the hacking of our democracy, this can't be allowed to happen.</p><p>We have the former intel chiefs of the biggest agencies in the United States government, the most sophisticated intelligence apparatus on the planet who are actively trying to undermine now the sitting president of the United States and they weren't the intel chief 10 or 20 years ago. They were the most recent one.</p><p>What that means is that, every time you've got Clapper or Brennan or others who are going on air, talking about, for example, the Russia collusion case, there is at least some perception - and by the way, I think some of them have tried to enhance this with what they have said. They've dance around this - that they are drawing upon their classified knowledge to make some of these assumptions. They have extra gravitas. They should be paid attention to more because they were the most recent NSA or CIA director. That is insidious.</p><p>I mean, this is deeply destructive to the fate that any future president could have in the previous administration's appointees at that level, and that's something, I think, does not get talked about enough at all here.</p><p>CARLSON: No. I think it's a very wise point. And remind us again the point of having all these various alphabet agencies. The intel apparatus exists only to serve the executive and to help him or her make wise foreign policy decisions, correct? Is there some other reason to have a CIA?</p><p>SEXTON: Well, I mean, there's a lot of agencies. Seventeen now, I think, technically in the intel community, though someone is probably going to correct me on that one because it's actually grown since I was in it. So, that will tell you something. It wasn't that long ago.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it has.</p><p>SEXTON: But they exist for national security purposes. They would tell you what all the different specific missions are. But, yes, they are executive branch agencies. And that then brings us to they should be serving the executive branch.</p><p>The same way that liberals, Tucker, don't really accept that President Trump is the president and, therefore, could fire Comey for no reason or any reason, if he wants to revoke clearances under Article II authority, he can do that.</p><p>So, all of this freak out you are seeing from people is a form of Trump derangement syndrome on display, for an issue that, by the way, most of these journalists have no idea what they are talking about.</p><p>They have never held a clearance. They don't know what goes into this and they don't know why anyone has one anyone.</p><p>CARLSON: Also, they are dumb. I mean, if Trump is an authoritarian, he's a pretty inefficient one. I mean, if Brennan and Clapper still have clearances a year-and-a-half in, it's not much of a police state, I would say.</p><p>Buck Sexton, great to see you.</p><p>SEXTON: Good to see you, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, they're inflamed over on the left. And tempers do not appear to be cooling.</p><p>Over this weekend, \"The Denver Post\" published a letter to the editor suggesting that Trump and other members of the administration literally deserve to be executed for treason.</p><p>Well, as we do so very often when things get completely nuts, we bring in some perspective. Fox's senior political analyst Brit Hume has seen everything and, therefore, he can put this in the appropriate context and calm us down.</p><p>Brit, great to see you.</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you, Tucker. Nice to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: What do you make of this?</p><p>HUME: Well, I went and read the letter. And it basically references Trump as some kind of traitor and notes that the Rosenbergs - Julius and Ethel Rosenberg - were found guilty of that and, says the letter, they were executed.</p><p>I didn't quite see this as a suggestion that Trump be executed, but it was close to the line. And you might have thought the editors at \"The Denver Post\" would've been more careful about publishing it.</p><p>But if we weren't talking about it tonight, I don't think the world will look longer than a few minutes even note that it ever happened. So, I think it's probably much ado about not much.</p><p>CARLSON: But it raises the larger question, which is - and correctly - that treason is a death penalty offense and the Rosenbergs were indeed executed for it at Sing Sing.</p><p>And if you accuse to someone of that, particularly an elected official, you are making a pretty stout charge.</p><p>HUME: You are. Well, this is - the thing about this is and it came up in your previous segment when you were talking about John Brennan, who openly accused the president of treason, we now inhabit an age of exaggeration. Everybody goes to battle stations and two DEFCON 1 over everything.</p><p>So, it is not enough to say that Trump unwisely sided with Putin for a period of time against the intelligence. No, no, it's treason and he is a traitor.</p><p>And on the other side, of course, everybody is said to be corrupt and there is no reasoned discussion going on right now. Everybody on all sides goes completely berserk, hair on fire over everything. And on and on it goes.</p><p>Right now, there is a Battle Royale raging in Washington over the interpretation of the materials, the FISA application materials released at the end of the last week, as to their interpretation.</p><p>Some journalists are writing, after reviewing them, that they support the conclusions reached by the Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Committee. Others are saying that that's all a lie, that they don't support that at all. I have never seen such diametrically opposed interpretations. And it is all at the highest possible decimal level. Like nothing I've ever seen before.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what would happen if there was an actual crisis? If there was an attack by a foreign power, physical attack, an actual attack, not a metaphorical one, and we found ourselves at war? How would a country this divided prosecute a war? &gt;&gt;</p><p>HUME: Well, it would be entirely up to the government itself because I'm sure that the president could interpret anything as he did as a kind of whack the dog scenario and then believe that it was false and the intelligence had reported it was false and so on. Nobody trusts anybody.</p><p>And that extends to the Congress, it extends to the media. The competition among media outlets is more intense than I've ever seen it. And all media outlets criticize all other media outlets. Professional courtesy about that is all but gone. And we inhabit an age where everybody is at the ramparts over everything all day, every day.</p><p>CARLSON: I have noticed that. Brit Hume, remaining calm despite all of it. Thank you very much for that.</p><p>HUME: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Bernie Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic primary, probably for not entirely legitimate reasons, but Democratic socialism which is what he ran on appears to be taking over his party. Irony of ironies. What is it exactly? We'll talk to one of the architects of the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign. Coming up.</p><p>CARLSON: Democratic socialism has for the last 100 years been pretty much a fringe belief, even on the left. Now, open socialists are all of a sudden running for office across the United States and they are winning Democratic primaries.</p><p>Today, on \"The View\", Joy Behar started an argument when she declared her support for this ideology. Here's part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST: On your platform, I think you should start paying the amount of taxes that every socialist in this country thinks you needs to.</p><p>JOY BEHAR, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST: They have just given this enormous tax break to the very, very wealthy in this country. That tax break doesn't have to be so generous to those really rich people, does it? Because if you don't give that money to them, what happens to that money? Better schools, better post office, better garbage pickup, better police department, better fire department.</p><p>MCCAIN: If you think the government is so good at running things, then the post office is a great run business, the VA. Some of us do not want socialism to be normalized in this country.</p><p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST: We will be right back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Behar did not release her own tax returns, so we could see how many deductions she took. We're awaiting that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jeff Weaver managed Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. He's the author of the book \"How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That is Taking Back Our Country and Where We Go From Here.\" Jeff Weaver joins us tonight. Jeff, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JEFF WEAVER, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Hey, Tucker. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you just did an interview and were asked basically what is this creed, what is Democratic socialism and you described basically a series of economic - here's what you said.</p><p>People want economic security, they want healthcare, they want dignity in old age, they want to know that they are not going to die with nothing. All pretty reasonable sounding ideas.</p><p>When I listen to - and how we pay for them is the point, but we could debate that, but those aren't bad ideas.</p><p>When I hear modern Democrats talking, it is never about economics. It is about abortion. It is overwhelmingly about immigration and why we need to let people stay here, whether they are legal or not.</p><p>It is nothing about an agenda of empowering the middle class economically, why is that?</p><p>WEAVER: Well, let me tell you, Tucker. I think Democrats have to start walking and chewing gum at the same time. We do have to talk about the plight of marginalized communities in this country who have been targeted by the president during his administration, but we also have to talk about the economic needs of people in every zip code in this country.</p><p>Wages are stagnant. People are anxious about their futures, about their kids' futures, about taking care of their aging parents, about affording college. And we have to talk about all of these issues, frankly.</p><p>And I agree with you that we need to hear more conversations.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. But there's only so much time in the day, there's only so much attention, there's really only so much our system can digest. And if your fixation is with the esoteric sexual politics, like transgender bathrooms or global warming -</p><p>WEAVER: Or plastic straws on Fox. I mean, I was just watching - how many shows on plastic straws are you going to have here on Fox?</p><p>CARLSON: OK, we did one. We do a lot of segments on economics because I think it's really important. So, like the elites of your party are only -</p><p>WEAVER: I would not call it a core economic issue, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not claiming it was. We do a lot of segments on core economic issues, including this one.</p><p>But I'm just interested, like your elites never say anything about how inviting millions of poor people into the country every year might depress wages for the working class.</p><p>WEAVER: Look, we are not talking about inviting in millions of people. The truth of the matter is that we do have millions of people in this country living in the shadows who are working hard, many of them, in fact, are paying taxes. Their kids are in schools. They are contributing to our country. And I think we have to recognize that reality. That's for sure.</p><p>But let's talk about the core economic issues. You wanted to talk about \"Democratic socialism.\" I know people on Fox love the scary labels and the red baiting. But let's talk about what that means.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I am actually giving you the fairest possible shake you will get on any channel ever. I'm taking your ideas seriously. I'm not mocking you.</p><p>I'm just wondering if your ideas aren't on a collision course with the agenda set by the elites in your party. And you know as well as I do, the answer is yes. They are incompatible. What you are saying is not compatible with what they are saying. And you know it.</p><p>WEAVER: What I am saying is that we need a Democratic Party in this country and we need a government in this country that represents the needs of ordinary people, and that includes an agenda that guarantees healthcare to all people, that pays people a living wage, that pays equally whether you are a man or woman, that protects our environment, that gives people opportunity to go to college and to have a good life. That's what I'm talking about. People not retiring in poverty, destroying social security. These are the things that people are talking about in the progressive movement.</p><p>And, frankly, Tucker, if you look at the polling, it's wildly popular.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree with a lot of what you just said. What you said that is not true at all is that that's what they are talking about. They're not. They are talking about race, they're talking about sex, they're talking about identity politics, they're attacking people because of their skin color. I mean, I do this for a living. I know exactly what they're saying. And they're not saying what you just said.</p><p>WEAVER: Well, let's not talk about people attacking people for their skin color because, I think, if we go right to the White House where that starts, frankly, my friend.</p><p>CARLSON: But let's be real. I mean, honestly, every time I talk to progressives, it's like, oh, white man this, it's like what does that have to do with empowering the average person economically, which is what the agenda ought to be?</p><p>WEAVER: We have got to empower people of all races in this country, frankly.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>WEAVER: And you cannot ignore the intersection of race and gender and other things. I mean you're a smart guy. I am not on \"Hannity\" here. This is a real show.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, please.</p><p>WEAVER: You can't ignore those issues. But you're right, we do have to -</p><p>CARLSON: I am not ignoring the issues, but the children of your party who are clearly in charge, they're all about - I mean, do you personally, as a pretty serious guy - I guess a serious guy - get a little tired of having to follow, like, inflamed upper middle-class college students who are constantly yelping about identity politics? Don't you think that's kind of a distraction from, like, the adult issues or no?</p><p>WEAVER: I think you are creating a false dichotomy here. There are important issues that are both issues of identity and there are important issues of economics, and I think we have to speak to both.</p><p>And people in the Democratic Party who advocate just one or the other, I am constantly in conflict with those people who think that we only have to talk about one side of this two-sided coin.</p><p>We have to talk about these important issues that affect marginalized communities and we have to talk about laying out an economic agenda that is going to uplift people of all races in every zip code in this country. That's the mission in front of us.</p><p>And if you look at Bernie Sanders' historic campaign in 2016, he won - overwhelmingly won independent voters in the Democratic primary, a process, including in places that were very, very red because folks understood that he was standing with their families in their everyday struggles.</p><p>And that's what we as Democrats and progressives have to do.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm actually kind of - I'm kind of aware of that. I just think - here is where I disagree with you, and we've got to go, but I will just say in one sentence, I think the identity politics people are beating you. And I hope I am wrong.</p><p>WEAVER: I think with people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others, we are winning.</p><p>CARLSON: I think she's on the identity politics side. But come back. Sorry, we are out of time. Jeff Weaver, thank you.</p><p>Well, it's not getting a ton of attention, but we seem to be moving incrementally toward war with Iran. Maybe we should talk about it first. Is it a good idea. We'll take an in-depth look at that next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, with all the screeching recently about Vladimir Putin and Russia, treason, it's been easy to miss the real news. We have some real news. The United States is inching closer apparently to some kind of conflict with Iran.</p><p>This Sunday, the president tweeted this, \"To Iranian President Rouhani, never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer the consequences, the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death. Be cautious!\"</p><p>Well, the interesting thing about this tweet is what didn't happen. The press is usually quick to jump on the president's intemperate tweets.</p><p>CNN has apparently an entire team of progressive teenagers devoted to monitoring his feed. But this time, there wasn't much comment from the media.</p><p>Why? Because if there is one thing Washington loves more than open borders and fat lobbying contracts, it's pointless wars half a world away.</p><p>Contractors get rich. Neocon intellectuals feel powerful. Bill Kristol, Max Boot and Nancy Pelosi agree on one thing, war is good as long as the war does not help the United States.</p><p>John Bolton finds himself in that camp. A lifelong neocon, Bolton repeatedly has called for toppling the Iranian government again and again, though tellingly he's never suggested what might replace the Iranian government once it's toppled.</p><p>Now, as the national security advisor, he has been changing our policies. The US, for example, has begun promoting protests within Iran in an effort to overthrow the regime there.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on board with this. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley definitely is. Here's a recent sampling of her saber-rattling on Iran. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN: Their government has a long history of murdering its own people who dare to speak the truth.</p><p>The Iranian regime is now on notice. The world will be watching what you do.</p><p>If you want to come to the table and work on a new Iran deal, we'll be right there to talk to you, but you're not going to threaten us to do it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Iran may have messed with the wrong president here.</p><p>HALEY: They absolutely did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, some of that is bluster, obviously, but some of it is exactly what it looks like - the groundwork for conflict. We are moving toward, however slowly, some kind of confrontation with Iran.</p><p>And that should worry everybody, but it should especially be of concern to anyone who supported the president.</p><p>If President Trump decides to go to war with Iran, it will destroy his presidency just as the Iraq War destroyed the presidency of his Republican predecessor George W. Bush.</p><p>Attacking Iran is not like intervening in Libya or Syria or even like invading Iraq. It entails far greater risk and much higher costs.</p><p>Geographically, Iran is about four times the size of Iraq. It has three times as many people as Iraq had when we invaded. Iraq was a divided country along religious lines. Iran is not. It's cohesive.</p><p>It's a much richer country too with a military that has spent many years preparing for a US invasion. It's a formidable force.</p><p>In 2002, the US military carried out a war game that was widely understood to be a simulation of an invasion of Iran. It went badly. America suffered more than 20,000 casualties in a single day and officials halted the game.</p><p>So, the question is not could America beat Iran. Yes, it could. The question is, is it ready to try? Well, less ready than ever actually.</p><p>Compared to 2003, our country is deeper in debt and far more politically divided than it's been since the Civil War. Our military is overstretched. Ask anyone in it.</p><p>Meanwhile, China is much stronger than it was 15 years ago. You can bet the Chinese military will be more assertive than ever when we are tied down in yet another quagmire.</p><p>Does anyone outside of Washington actually support a new war in Iran? Well, the Saudi royal family does. So do the leaders of other Sunni Gulf states. They see Iran as their greatest rival and they'd love to have America fight a war against Iran for them. Why wouldn't they?</p><p>President Trump's own supporters know better than this, though. You'll remember that, back in 2016, during the Republican primary debate in South Carolina, Donald Trump was the only person on that stage to call the Iraq War a mistake.</p><p>He vowed never to repeat anything like that and promised that, if elected, he would act only in America's interest.</p><p>The morons handicapping the debate on television predicted Trump would lose, it was over, saying that had sealed his fate. And, of course, they were wrong and he won.</p><p>Republican voters agreed with him, it turned out. They had a better sense of the truth. A lot of their kids were serving in the military.</p><p>Two-and-a-half years later, amazingly, the president's advisors are telling him he must abandon that promise. Iran is too important, they say. It's the greatest threat this country faces despite the fact that virtually every terror attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran's Sunni enemies. Doesn't matter.</p><p>The mullahs are months away from building a nuke, the neocons tell us. Keep in mind, these people have been saying the exact same thing, word for word, for more than a decade. You can look it up on Google.</p><p>They have no idea what they are talking about. Their track records are embarrassing. Disaster after disaster. They ought to be selling time- shares in Maui or doing something useful.</p><p>Instead, they have more political power than they have ever had. Amazingly, almost to a person, the same group bitterly opposed the president they now work for. They repeatedly attacked him in public and they attacked him savagely in private.</p><p>They consider his ideas absurd to this day. They regard the notion of putting America first as morally offensive. They're fully on Bill Kristol's team.</p><p>In fact, just last week, Kristol was encouraging Nikki Haley to challenge her boss, Donald Trump, for the Republican nomination two years from now, and in a way that makes sense.</p><p>If there was a swamp in Washington, you're looking at it, the foreign policy establishment. They are working overtime to ensnare the president in a mess in Iran. Let's hope that he understands exactly what's going on.</p><p>Douglas Macgregor is a retired army colonel, author of the book \"Margin Of Victory,\" a frequent guest on this show and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Colonel, Macgregor, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>DOUGLAS MACGREGOR, \"MARGIN OF VICTORY\" AUTHOR: Thanks, Tucker. I appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I can't help, since I have been in Washington for 30 years, notice that the very people who are pushing this new entanglement, this new enterprise are the Trump administration's gravest enemies on almost every subject, and they are also the same people who predicted outcomes that never came to pass.</p><p>And in other words, they have been wrong again and again and again. How do these people still have power?</p><p>MACGREGOR: Well, look, I think President Trump lost control of the whole appointment process and staffing the government shortly after the election.</p><p>I don't know the details, but he ended up appointing large numbers of people who subsequently brought in their friends, almost all of whom were opposed to Donald Trump and his agenda.</p><p>But I think it's important to say something about the president's comment because the president is right. If you look at the Iranian defense establishment, we spend more money on one Ford class aircraft carrier than Iran spends on its entire military establishment.</p><p>So, if there were a war, it would be a very one-sided affair. But the problem is that wars don't work that way. They tend to move in directions that no one anticipated.</p><p>Suddenly, people that you would think otherwise would avoid conflict might decide that it's not in their interest to see Iran destroyed. And I'm thinking of Russia and I am thinking of China as perfect examples. Why would they stand by and watch us pulverize Iran? It seems very unlikely.</p><p>So, I think President Trump understands that. In fact, this afternoon, when he talked to VFW, he made the comment that he pulled out of the deal with Iran, but he's open to another deal, he's open to talking, to negotiating.</p><p>He's talked to the Russians and he has talked to the North Koreans. That seems to have had a positive impact certainly on Northeast Asia. We don't know what will happen in the future, but I think that's a good sign.</p><p>So, I think dealing with Donald Trump, understand that anyone who threatens the United States with this man in the White House should seek psychiatric care, they're crazy because Donald Trump means what he says. He will fight to defend the United States.</p><p>On the other hand, I don't see any evidence that he is interested in precipitating a conflict.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think the advisors around him whose comments we just played, Nikki Haley, for example, or John Bolton - they seem to come at this with pre-existing agendas.</p><p>MACGREGOR: Well, of course. But the good news is that President Trump hasn't listened very much to his advisors. If he did, we would never have made any progress on the Korean Peninsula. We would not be -</p><p>CARLSON: Good point!</p><p>MACGREGOR: - working with the Chinese. We would never have met with Vladimir Putin. So, God bless the president. He doesn't listen to these people. So, I'm not too worried about that.</p><p>The thing that does worry me, though, given some of the comments that are being made is this red meat on the table for the war lobby. You and I know that there are a lot of people who would welcome conflict with Iran. That's obvious.</p><p>I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Many of your viewers may not remember that. It never happened. And we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf. We should watch for that.</p><p>And this is an example of President Trump's comments on fake news. He should not be sabotaged by fake news.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree. We've seen it happen twice in Syria. Twice! Colonel, thank you very much. Great to see you.</p><p>MACGREGOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: One activist says conservatives only want Planned Parenthood to be defunded in order to force the nation's women to get pregnant. It's a confusing argument. We're going to allow her to explain it next.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Republicans ran on the promise to defund Planned Parenthood. Half a billion dollars a year of taxpayer money. Remember that? That was in 2016 election. Congressional Republicans haven't really tried hard to do that.</p><p>That has not stopped the administration, though, from taking its own kind of action on the question. The administration is attempting to tweak Title X funding formulas to divert federal funds away from Planned Parenthood, the country's largest abortion provider.</p><p>Sonia Ossorio is the president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women. She says the real goal of defunding Planned Parenthood isn't to prevent taxpayers from funding something they abhor, abortion, it's to force women to get pregnant.</p><p>Sonia Ossorio joins us tonight. Sonia, it's great to see you.</p><p>SONIA OSSORIO, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN OF NEW YORK PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>Well, Tucker, if you take away the access to abortion and you take away birth control, which is a really big issue that we've got to discuss here tonight, you are indeed forcing women to have children.</p><p>Now, let's get to the point.</p><p>CARLSON: I wonder how many people actually - I think most of our viewers know that what you're seeing is pure lunacy and dishonest. And you do too.</p><p>But let's just sort of - just for fun, reverse engineer this for a second. Who is taking away the right to have an abortion?</p><p>I think the law - I don't think I know. I read it, the proposed regulation change would just make it less likely that taxpayers have to pay for abortion. Is that the same as banning abortion?</p><p>OSSORIO: Let's be really clear. And this is something - and it's really the reason, Tucker, that I wanted to come on your show tonight because I needed to dispel this myth.</p><p>People need to understand, I want all the viewers to understand, your taxpayers do not pay for abortions in this country. Taxpayers do not pay for abortions.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, they don't. But they do give half a billion dollars to the largest abortionist on the continent.</p><p>OSSORIO: Your taxpayers do pay for abortions in the case of rape and if a woman is dying. Those are the two situations since 1977.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. You're spewing propaganda here. We pay, taxpayers, at gunpoint, half a billion to Planned Parenthood which provides - commits more abortion than anybody else in the country.</p><p>OSSORIO: I don't think you should joke at gunpoint.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not joking.</p><p>OSSORIO: You just talked about gunpoint.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it is at gunpoint. If you don't pay your taxes, they come and arrest you, the cops arrest you. So, you don't pay your taxes voluntarily. You do it because the government backs it up with the threat of force.</p><p>OSSORIO: What everybody should also understand, if you give me a moment to speak, what everybody should understand also is Planned Parenthood works just like any other medical provider.</p><p>They get reimbursed for the procedures they perform that are approved by the government. So, they get a reimbursement for an STD testing, they get reimbursed for all those other service they do, but not for abortions.</p><p>But I want to take a moment to talk about what is happening -</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. You've taken a lot of moments to talk. So, let me just you one question, which is -</p><p>OSSORIO: We've got 4 minutes, so down to two.</p><p>CARLSON: You think abortion is a constitutional right. I think the right to bear arms is because I have read the Bill of Rights. Why shouldn't taxpayers be forced to subsidize the NRA or buy my guns?</p><p>OSSORIO: Now, who is talking lunacy and who is being dishonest?</p><p>CARLSON: Why is that crazy? You think taxpayers should pay for an abortion - you're giving me the moral lecture, but just answer my question. I think it's an interesting question.</p><p>OSSORIO: I want viewers to know that one in four women in this country have an abortion.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to answer my question.</p><p>OSSORIO: I'm not answering question, no, because it's a stupid question.</p><p>CARLSON: Why? I think it's a really interesting question. Oh, because that's causing you to enlarge your mind and it hurts.</p><p>OSSORIO: I've got an opportunity to speak to your viewers and I'm trying to speak to them. One in four women have an abortion in this country. That has gone down from 1 in 3. It's gone down from 1 in 3. The reason why it's gone down is because we've had teen pregnancy prevention programs that have been successful.</p><p>And, right now, the Trump administration wants to divert $250 million of teen pregnancy programs -</p><p>CARLSON: This is why I never like to talk to the abortion people because they just shout. OK, I'm sorry. Don't make me cut you off. Please.</p><p>OSSORIO: They want to divert that -</p><p>CARLSON: Please! I'm trying.</p><p>OSSORIO: a - to abstinence only education.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Sonia. I tried. It was a good faith effort. I really tried. I hate cutting people off, but you were just too obnoxious. I'm sorry.</p><p>CARLSON: Right here on this show, we warned you that the FAA was putting the country at risk in the way that they were hiring air traffic controllers. Now, they claim they have changed. We have an update to our exclusive investigation. And that's next.</p><p>CARLSON: In an exclusive investigation by this program, we warned you about the war on standards underway at the FAA.</p><p>In the name of diversity, federal officials devalued a skills-based test for hiring - oh, no big deal! - air traffic controllers and instead implemented a biographical questionnaire, whose purpose was not hiring skilled controllers. In fact, the more skills you had, the fewer points you got, perversely. But, instead, the point was ensuring the hiring of people who were of the right race.</p><p>It was insane, of course. Dangerous, yes. And it sparked a major reaction. Now, the Department of Transportation says it is ready those policies in the name of public safety.</p><p>Steven Bradbury is the general counsel of the Department of Transportation and he joins us tonight. Mr. Bradbury, thanks for coming on.</p><p>STEVEN BRADBURY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION GENERAL COUNSEL: Well, thanks for having me on, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, it was a pretty simple story, and I think the fix is pretty simple. Can you assure our viewers that air traffic controllers will be hired solely on the basis of relevant criteria? In other words, how good they are at air traffic controlling, and not on the basis of irrelevant criteria like their appearance.</p><p>BRADBURY: That's right. We are making a change to no longer use that biographical assessment that the FAA has used since 2014 and that you featured on your show.</p><p>I will point out that the version you've focused on with the questions that you highlighted, which I agree are counterintuitive at best, was used for one year in 2014. Changes were made and a new assessment was used after 2014 with different questions, and it did not have those questions that you had focused on.</p><p>Nevertheless, in 2016, Congress prohibited the FAA from using the biographical assessment to screen applicants - more than half of the applicants for entry-level positions as trainees for air traffic control.</p><p>CARLSON: So, hold on. Wait, wait. Hold on. I'm sorry. You're getting in the weeds here a bit and I think it's sort of a red herring.</p><p>The question is not whether or not a biographical questionnaire is used. The question is solely, is the hiring done exclusively on the basis of skills-based criteria, relevant criteria? Does a person's appearance, sexual orientation, parents' background, does that play any role in hiring at all? At all?</p><p>BRADBURY: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Because if it does, that's dangerous. No? At all?</p><p>BRADBURY: It doesn't. And we agree with you that for hiring of trainees for the academy to be trained as air traffic controllers, you really should focus exclusively on aptitude, competence for being an excellent air traffic controller.</p><p>And so, we're making - we're clearing the decks. And what we are doing, and what I am announcing on your show tonight, is that the FAA is no longer going to use a biographical assessment in any form and instead is going to give all applicants for these entry-level positions the aptitude test, which is the air traffic skills assessment test, which just tests for aptitude for the characteristics of being an excellent air traffic controller.</p><p>And that test is validated, has been standardized, it's proctored tests. It's the same test that applicants take who are graduates of the collegiate training initiative schools and who apply for the academy to be air traffic control trainees.</p><p>And I think it's important, Tucker, to point out that what we're talking about is the incoming candidates for the academy where they get trained, like a boot camp for air traffic control duties.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BRADBURY: These are not people who are hired and put on the job in control towers to be air traffic controllers.</p><p>CARLSON: I understand.</p><p>BRADBURY: They have to go through very rigorous training at the academy. And many of them wash out, sometimes more than half washout. It's rigorous.</p><p>CARLSON: OK, OK. For our purposes -</p><p>BRADBURY: They also go through two to three years of on-the-job training as well before they can be certified as professional air traffic controllers.</p><p>CARLSON: The bottom line is - I'm sorry. Before we did the segment, this was still going on. So, before you take too much credit, I'm glad you made that change, but this was still going on and until we shined a light on it.</p><p>BRADBURY: Well, listen, I do give you an assist for helping us focus on this issue.</p><p>CARLSON: We are helping you to focus on it. All right. Well, I am glad you did. But, I mean, I just want to be clear about that. I think you needed some line shone on this. So, Steven, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are out of time.</p><p>Democratic mayoral candidate of Chicago trying to muster votes the old fashion way, by handing out money in church. Details ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, in most of America, the old-fashioned political machines are dead and buried, but in the State of Illinois, they live on.</p><p>Illinois is, of course, America's second-most dysfunctional state. You know the most dysfunctional. It's the biggest.</p><p>Democratic mayoral candidate Willie Wilson appeared at a Chicago church on Sunday. He began handing out bundles of cash to parishioners, ostensibly to help them pay their bills. Overall, he gave away more than $200,000.</p><p>Here's the amazing thing. He says it is totally unrelated to the fact that he is running for mayor. Amazing! Just a generous man.</p><p>The state election board says that no laws have been broken. Of course not! They are never broken in Illinois. And we wouldn't want to impugn the integrity of Illinois politicians.</p><p>It does make you wonder, why is Blagojevich rotting in prison until he is old, by the way. When you've got a city like that, is Rod Blagojevich really the most dangerous person? I hope he gets a pardon actually.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. Tune in every night at 8 p.m. to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Not an easy thing to pull off in 2018 where everybody is crazy.</p><p>Have a great evening! Sean Hannity is next.

But before we go, I wanted to say that our thoughts and prayers are with Herman Cain as he battles COVID-19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Make sure you set your DVR. But the \"Ingraham Angle\" is up next. Raymond Arroyo is in the chair tonight, Raymond. It's all yours.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hey, Jason. Great show. Thanks. And happy July 4th. We'll see you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHAFFETZ: Thanks.</p><p>ARROYO: I'm Raymond Arroyo in for Laura Ingraham tonight, and this is a special edition of the \"Ingraham Angle.\" Record breaking jobs numbers coming out today, but that's not enough to make the left happy. You'll hear why Biden thinks job growth is a bad thing. Mike Huckabee and Tom Bevan are here.</p><p>Plus, radicals screaming in the faces of police, destroying property and getting violent. What do we really know about these peaceful protesters? What's driving them? And citizens fight back against COVID regulations as we approach July 4th.</p><p>Breaking tonight a bombshell COVID drug study. I'm borrowing Laura's medicine cabinet for this one. We'll bring all the details to you.</p><p>But first, \"State of Emergency.\" Last night we told you about political efforts to stymie your public celebration of July 4th. But now there are efforts to banish the holiday all together. More beach closures were announced today in Orange County, California. Fireworks and parades have been canceled all over the country.</p><p>Patriotism has now joined religion as a second-class practice, one subjected to draconian restrictions, not applied to other activities owing to COVID fears. But the application of these public health restrictions, that's what they're calling them, are selectively employed and riddled with politics.</p><p>In California, politicians are using emergency regulations to stop families from beachfront cookouts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D-CA), LOS ANGELES: I know that we love seeing those firework exhibitions, but not this year. This year, we have to think about saving lives to protect what we have in this country, to protect who we are--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: But this was the scene in Los Angeles today. They couldn't be packed closer together. Now, given this coddling of protesters, nobody bothered them. People should jam the streets with patriotic protests this weekend.</p><p>Amazingly, the same public health emergency powers are being invoked to dismantle markers of American history as we approach July 4th. In Richmond, Virginia. The Democrat Mayor Levar Stoney ordered the removal of a series of Confederate statues. That came down yesterday. You probably heard very little about it.</p><p>Now, however you feel about those statues, the people of Richmond should decide the fate of these public works by a vote. But the mayor cited public health and safety as the reason for the statues removal. Listen,</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR LEVAR STONEY (D-VA), RICHMOND: We believe that we're on sound legal ground. On June 8th, the City Council evoked another declaration of emergency under our emergency operations plans. The mayor is the Emergency Management Director. We're in the state of emergency until July 29th. And I'm going to do everything necessary - it's my responsibility to do everything necessary to ensure that we protect life and property.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Especially the life and property of the protesters, not its constituents. The Richmond Mayor justified his decision to \"The Wall Street Journal\" this way. \"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, and protesters attempt to take down Confederate statues themselves or confront others who are doing so, the risk grows for serious illness, injury, or death.\"</p><p>So let me get this straight mobs endangering themselves or threatening others is the justification for taking down public works of art. I see. Now, was Stonewall Jackson spreading COVID? Then how do COVID emergency powers apply in this case?</p><p>Say there's a mob who wants to lower taxes, could those COVID emergency powers be used to lower them? I'm checking for a friend. Look, this is mob rule. And these liberal politicians are giving them exactly what they want, while silencing their citizenry. Richmond residents get to say nothing. They are stuck in the house because of COVID.</p><p>Now, this July 4th, while you're sitting at home, watching firework reruns, or older clips of singers on TV, one type of parade will be allowed with no disruptions at all. In Tampa, Chicago, Carson City, Washington DC, and possibly elsewhere, there are planned \"Boycott the 4th\" and \"The Hell With the 4th Of July!\" protests planned. That's right.</p><p>Black Lives Matter protesters don't want you to celebrate July 4th. We're going to debate that in moments with one of the organizers. The webpage for the DC protest bills it as the birth of a new nation. The idea being that Black Americans and none of us should be celebrating July 4th, because not everyone was free at the signing of the Declaration. Never mind that everyone's free now, especially protesters. This is a movement rooted in division on the day set aside to celebrate our unity.</p><p>Incidentally, the DC protesters are demanding reparations for offspring of indigenous people or slaves in a lump sum or quarterly stimulus check payments please; free health care for all citizens; and J. Edgar Hoover's name removed from the FBI headquarters, at least their original.</p><p>The problem is, Americans are now absorbing this idea that they're somehow not part of this great American holiday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: July 4th should not even be celebrated in the first place. It's a racist holiday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 4th of July in American history is an all-White holiday. Whereas Juneteenth is a celebration of black culture.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Juneteenth makes more sense, right? The rest of America, they want the 4th of July, they can have it. But I think as a as a Black person, freedom came on Juneteenth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Hmm. We'll explore this in our next segment. But we are all one people, Black, White, and everything in between. July 4th belongs to anyone who embraces the American ideal founded in liberty. We cannot be a nation of perpetual grievance and unforgiveable sins. Independence Day is a day to recall the principles and spirit that bring us together.</p><p>But this year, it's being exploited as an occasion to drive us apart. And in the COVID regulations, and we see the nation on edge. And later we'll get to the ways citizens are fighting back against this arbitrary isolation and the masking.</p><p>But after months, it's pushed people to the limit and it's turned politically. If you're worried about being infected or you're ill, please stay home. But your COVID concerns are not a license to attack or harass fellow citizens who are just as free as you are, to exercise their rights and take their own risks.</p><p>I mean, I even saw people at the grocery today at a Costco, they're elbowing, yelling at each other, put the mask on, or get in line or stay away from me. And the government should be careful as well. In the way they invoke these emergency orders to constrict the movement of people in the United States of America.</p><p>As you know, the President is attending a big fireworks display outdoors at Mount Rushmore Friday night. We'll be bringing you live coverage of that event. It promises to be a moment of normalcy in a year that's been anything but. And right on cue Dr. Fauci shows up to discourage attendance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Masks will not be mandated, nor will social distancing. What is your message to political leaders and people who are insisting on holding events like this in this environment?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Avoid crowds, wear a mask, keep physical distance. It doesn't matter what the reason for the congregation, whether it's a celebration here, the demonstration there, it doesn't make any difference, wear a mask.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: If all Americans, protesters and everyday citizens, were treated alike that guidance might be better received, but they aren't. There are two rules at play. One for protesters and rioters and another for law abiders.</p><p>This holiday weekend, every American is entitled to celebrate as they see fit, calculating the risk, whether raising a fist or waving a flag. It is this great country that allows us that freedom. It deserves our respect, and to be celebrated boldly this weekend.</p><p>Joining me now is Horace Cooper of Project 21, the Co-Chair and Author of \"How Trump is Making Black America Great Again.\" Also, with me is Scotty Smart. He's founder of the Smart Foundation. Thank you both for being here.</p><p>Scotty, you were supposed to speak at a \"Forget the Fourth\" event in Atlanta. What do you intend to achieve by doing this? I know you're having some health difficulties and may not be able to attend. But what are these protests designed to do exactly?</p><p>SCOTTY SMART, FOUNDER, THE SMART FOUNDATION: Well, these protests are designed to educate people, and to make sure that we have a unity amongst ourselves. When we say Forget the Fourth, a lot of people try to strategically change narrative and make it a hate rhetoric against the Constitution or against the flag and things like that. And that's what it's not.</p><p>But it's also to make sure that we hold America accountable for saying that it provides liberty and justice for us all, which we as Black people don't feel that we are getting in this country. And so when we go to celebrations like this, we voice our opinions and voice ourselves. Because if you look at the history of this country, which a lot of times people try to overlook, it has nothing that been great for Black people.</p><p>Since 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was signed, we haven't necessarily been treated as equals. And so as we move forward--</p><p>ARROYO: So Scotty - so wait a minute, Scotty. So you don't believe Black Americans can celebrate the 4th of July? Is that what you're saying? I mean, you're carving Black America out of the 4th of July, or that's what you'd like to do?</p><p>SMART: I'm not carving out anything. Anyone is free to celebrate however they would like to celebrate. What I'm saying is that we weren't free and our independence - on the 4th of July when the Declaration of Independence was signed, so therefore, we aren't celebrating it. For me personally. Anyone is able to--</p><p>ARROYO: OK.</p><p>SMART: Go ahead.</p><p>ARROYO: I got to get - I got to let Horace in this Scotty. Horace, your reaction. Is July 4th not a holiday for Black Americans or one they shouldn't take part here.</p><p>HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21: This is patent nonsense. First of all, Black Americans, like White Americans, are going to be overwhelmingly on the roads this weekend. We're going to be setting a record of the number of people getting together with their loved ones to celebrate.</p><p>Secondly, at - in 1776, there were thousands of free Black men who joined in the fight to help secure liberty and freedom. It is an absolute insult to the sacrifice that those people made to say that we were not \"free.\" Some are free, some are not free.</p><p>Now, all our free. America has lived up to the model that it set up. This experiment has been remarkably successful. And this weekend is a time that we should all be coming together to celebrate that success.</p><p>ARROYO: Scotty, what's wrong with that?</p><p>SMART: I don't even think Horace to actually believe that what he's saying himself. So let's give Horace a history lesson about Black Americans in this country, because he said it's 1776 that we were free. But Horace, we weren't free until 1865. Is that not correct?</p><p>ARROYO: No, he said some people were free.</p><p>COOPER: That is not true.</p><p>SMART: The Thirteenth Amendment--</p><p>COOPER: See, that's not true. You don't know your history. Stay away from eating the tide pods - stay away from meeting the tide pods and look at the history book. And what you will see is there are a number of Black Americans throughout history who stood on the side of freedom and liberty. This celebration is for everyone who supports liberty. It is not for Whites, it's not for Blacks.</p><p>ARROYO: Horace, I want to let Scotty - let Scotty get in here. Go ahead.</p><p>SMART: So when we talk history, and we talk about the abolishment of slavery with The Thirteenth Amendment, even then, right after that we have Black Codes, which legally made us slave still, because they do incarcerate us for not having homes and not having jobs at that time.</p><p>And then as you move forward through our history, you don't get civil rights and you don't get voter acts until 1965. And so when you go to that point of our history, which is 100 years later, now we're in modern day history. And then talk about how the government has strategically, always systematically--</p><p>ARROYO: Yes, but Scotty - so Scotty, I think - Yes, I think I think Horace's his point is America has fulfilled the promise. It wasn't fully fulfilled early on, but it has been now. Black Americans are - Louis Armstrong is as much a part of the American story as Jackie Robinson and George Washington at this point.</p><p>Two Republican senators, I want to get into this. Two Republican senators Ron Johnson and James Lankford have put forward a bill to replace Columbus Day as a federal holiday with Juneteenth. This is Senator Johnson or he said rather, \"Wee celebrating emancipation with a federal holiday, but we believe we should eliminate a current holiday in exchange. We chose Columbus Day as a holiday that's lightly celebrated, and least disruptive.\"</p><p>Here's my here's my question, Juneteenth came two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation. OK? The Thirteenth Amendment was actually ratified on December 6, 1865, so should we be celebrating (INAUDIBLE)? I mean, is that what we should be celebrating? I'll let you both get a crack at that. Is that what you want, Scotty? You want Juneteenth and no more 4th of July?</p><p>SMART: Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom for us, and I think that is something that should be a national holiday. I appreciate people stepping up and taking that stance. But even then, we talk about systematic oppression throughout the entire history of America, we still haven't gotten equality and justice for all or liberty and justice for all, as the Constitution says.</p><p>So you can look through systematic oppression, through poverty, through probation through, mass incarceration, you can look at several instances within our climate that are controlled by systematic oppression and white supremacy that has not afforded Black--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ARROYO: I need to let Horace get in here Scotty. Yes, I need to let - go ahead, Horace, you respond.</p><p>COOPER: All the Left wing, Marxists drivel aside. There is a fact. The fact is America gave more lives in the Civil War than in any war America has ever been a part of. And as a result of that war, three constitutional amendments came about.</p><p>And as a result of that, America joined together and ultimately has said that it is going to commit - and has done so, committed to the idea that we did at our inception. Every citizen is going to be recognized and supported equally before the law. What they're wanting to do now is to throw that away, and yet, it ignores the marvel of what our country is all about.</p><p>ARROYO: Scotty, I'll give you 30 seconds to respond.</p><p>SMART: Thank you. There's no that that's true Horace.</p><p>COOPER: It's a fact.</p><p>SMART: There's completely injustice within our systematic approach to criminal justice. Black people don't get the same sentences as Whites. You have someone that it was just released who did - who was sentenced to 1,000 years in jail for child pornography that just was - only did seven years was paroled yesterday.</p><p>You have a Black man in Kansas that was sentenced to 12 years for kissing a young White girl, but there was no DNA evidence found upon him. So make sure when you talk facts that you have your facts correct. And you don't use your talking points to make sure you get your paycheck.</p><p>ARROYO: Go ahead Horace. You got to respond.</p><p>COOPER: These are talking points. Read my book - read my book and you'll see a 100-year history of the progress of Americans who happen to be black by policies that are great for all of all of America.</p><p>ARROYO: OK, we're going to leave it there gentleman. And Scotty, Horace, I want you all to come together and celebrate this great country that allows us to converse like this and allows us to support and love one another. And happy July 4th to both of you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>Across the country Americans are fighting to protect their rights and to free themselves from COVID lockdowns by appealing to the courts. Now, yesterday, a Wisconsin judge overturned the City of Racine's COVID-19 ordinance ruling it. \"Likely the strictest and most overreaching COVID-19 order or ordinance in the country.\" Judge Jon Fredrickson also said that, \"no average person of ordinary intelligence can make sense of its sprawling breadth.\"</p><p>It banned public gatherings and much more. This comes after the Wisconsin Supreme Court threw out the Democratic governor's stay at home orders after Republican lawmakers sued over them.</p><p>Joining me now is Mark Trammell. He is the Executive Director and General Counsel of the Center for American Liberty. Now, Mark, Americans seem to be pushing back on these blue states and city officials who used COVID to increase their power at the expense of the public's liberties. What are these cases? And that religious liberty case last week in New York where Cuomo and de Blasio were slapped down? What do they tell us about where the courts are now?</p><p>MARK TRAMMELL, CO-CHAIR, CENTER FOR AMERICAN LIBERTY: Well, thank you, Raymond, for having me on the program. You're absolutely right. Americans are fighting back, because I think everyone is fed up at this point.</p><p>And, you know, let me just start by saying, the Center for American Liberty, we're challenging these restrictions across the country. And kudos to this judge in Wisconsin for getting it right, for having the courage to say that while public health is absolutely very important, and something that we're trying to achieve in this COVID era. But at the same time, they have to act within constitutional bounds. And what happened in Wisconsin, they violated the First Amendment. It was unconstitutionally vague. It was overbroad, and this judge got it right.</p><p>ARROYO: OK. In Los Angeles and Ventura, we touched on this earlier, those counties are closing their beaches this weekend. Here's how la Mayor Garcetti wants you to spend your July 4th instead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARCETTI: Everyone should cancel their in-person plans for July 4th. Gatherings with people who do not live in your household are not allowed. You know how to express your patriotism this year? It's not going to be a firework show. It's not going to be at the barbecue. It's going to be wearing a mask and keeping your distance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Sounds like a barrel of laughs. I'm sure that's exactly how people want to celebrate July 4th. Mark, you filed a lawsuit challenging these beach closures on what grounds?</p><p>TRAMMELL: Absolutely. Well, it violates the California State Constitution. Article 10 Section 4 actually gives residents of California a constitutional right to access the beaches.</p><p>ARROYO: OK. In Palm Beach residents are suing the county over their mandatory mask policy. Now it alleges that the policy infringes on their constitutional rights and forces them to wear quote harmful medical devices like mask.</p><p>Now, Laura Ingraham always says, this is a speech issue, because it limits your ability to communicate and it runs afoul of a host of basic rights. Can you force people to wear masks constitutionally?</p><p>TRAMMELL: You know, I think that's still a question that's being debated. And I think that if we look at the way these cases are playing out broadly, I think courts are going to come down on both sides of that issue, because, certainly in situations mask can be communicative and expressive and have first amendment implications.</p><p>ARROYO: OK, I got to get to this in Rockland County, New York. The host of a house party came down with COVID. Now the party goers are refusing to talk with the COVID tracers. Remember those people hired to go track down the disease? Now the COVID treasures are threatening action. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. PATRICIA SCHNABEL RUPPERT, ROCKLAND COUNTY HEALTH COMMISSIONER: Most people do cooperate with us. But for the smaller number that do not, they have hung up on us, given us a very small amount of information--</p><p>I needed to send eight subpoenas yesterday to obtain the required information for our contact investigations. It worked.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Right away, because it was threatening what was it a $2,500-$2,000 fine for every day that they didn't respond?</p><p>RUPPERT: Up to $2,000 per day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Can they - can a contract tracer force people with subpoenas to divulge their private whereabouts, personal information? Very quickly.</p><p>TRAMMELL: Yes, this raises a lot of constitutional concern - right to privacy, due process. It's fraught with problems, absolutely, Raymond.</p><p>ARROYO: Mark, I thank you coming up. Authorities have caught the alleged ringleader on that attack on Andrew Jackson statue in DC and more. Plus, we'll get into all the polls with Mike Huckabee, Tom Bevan. Stay right there.</p><p>ARROYO: Welcome back to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" I'm Raymond Arroyo. An update to our anti-American most wanted list. The FBI and U.S. Park Service today arrested the man, who they say, orchestrated the attack on President Andrew Jackson's statue in Lafayette Park last week.</p><p>Sources tell fox news that Jason Charter was arrested this morning at his home. He's since been charged with destruction of federal property. Now this comes just days after the feds arrested four other men for their alleged involvement in the same statue attack.</p><p>The authorities did not use ropes or spray paint during those apprehensions. All were allegedly caught in photos or on tape, partaking in the destruction at the insistence of ringleader, Jason Charter.</p><p>A federal law enforcement source says. \"They were very organized. Charter was on top of the statute, directing people. They had acid, chisels, straps and a human chain, preventing police from getting to the statue.\"</p><p>Now, the FBI also alleges that charter took part in destroying the statue of Confederate officer Andrew (ph) Pike in DC. The bureau claims surveillance footage shows Charter standing over the toppled Pike statue, pouring an unknown liquid onto the statue. He is then observed waving others away and squatting behind the sculpture. Seconds later, the statue catches fire charges. Charter seen standing over the flames as it burns.</p><p>Now, after this incident, the FBI says Charter posted a picture of the statue burning on Twitter with this caption, \"Tearing down statues of traitors to the nation is a service to this nation, not a crime.\" On Facebook, he posted the same picture, this time writing sweetly, \"Death to all Confederate statues.\"</p><p>Sources tell Fox that charter has ties to Antifa, the radical anarchist group behind much of the mayhem and destruction we've seen over the past few weeks. Now last week, President Trump issued an Executive Order to prosecute anyone who desecrates military monuments to the fullest extent of the law.</p><p>Lesson of the day. Public statues are not your private domain. Keep your hands, your ropes and your flammables off. Here's some more good news.</p><p>Today's record-breaking jobs numbers smashed expectations. In June, the economy added a whopping 4.8 million jobs, which is 1.8 million more than economists predicted. The unemployment rate fell to 11.1 percent, which is still high, but a massive improvement from last month. President Trump rightfully celebrated the news.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States economy has added almost 5 million new jobs in the month of June. That's shattering all expectations and shattering all record. America's economy is now roaring back to life like nobody's ever seen before. Nobody's going to shatter the American dream.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: But Joe Biden is downplaying the record-breaking boom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're filling a deep, deep job hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to coronavirus. Only one-third of the jobs that were lost in March and April have now come back. Until this President faces what's going on in our country, our economy is going to remain at risk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: I'm worried Joe Biden's confusing his deep, deep hole with the economy, but maybe we can sort that out. Joining me now is Tom Bevan. He's Co-Founder and president of RealClearPolitics. Also with me is Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas Governor and Fox News Contributor.</p><p>Governor, our economy is bouncing back. Why is Biden so unhappy? I mean, it doesn't look bad for him to be dissing the economic recovery?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it's simple, Raymond. You know, Joe Biden doesn't want the economy to come back strong. Because he knows that, as the President gets credit for having built a strong economy before the terrible virus shut everything down, that's why we're bouncing back.</p><p>It was falling like an anvil, but it's coming back like it was on a bungee cord only because the tax policy, deregulation, and aggressive dealings with China and other cheating nations gave us an incredibly strong economy as if we're on rocket fuel. Now, because it was strong, it is coming back and Joe Biden has nothing to take credit for. Nothing whatsoever.</p><p>ARROYO: Tom, I want to get into those national polls in a moment, but Trump is polling higher in almost every poll on the economy, higher than Biden. How important is that and will it be to this reelection bid?</p><p>TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER: It's usage. It's his strongest suit. And if you want to know why, Trump, he's still almost at 50 percent in our Real Clear Politics average on his handling of the economy, and his approval of the economy. His approval of his handling of the coronavirus is down around 40 percent. And so that's why Joe Biden doesn't want to talk about the economy. He wants to shift the narrative back to the coronavirus because that's where Trump is weakest. And obviously, Trump wants to highlight these numbers. And he's going to need a strong economy over the next four months to really press that case because it is by far right now his biggest asset in terms of winning the election.</p><p>ARROYO: Yes. We are hearing a lot about the national Trump/Biden matchups. Currently, Real Clear Politics, the average, has Biden up nine points on Trump nationally. Tom, what are the most important metrics we should be and focused on here instead of that overarching head-to-head?</p><p>BEVAN: Well, obviously, as we learned in 2016 and if you follow the elections, you know we don't have a national election. We have state elections. And so there are six key battleground states that everybody is focused on right now. They are Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and then Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And that's where the election is going to be decided.</p><p>And so really focus on where the race is in those states. And right now Trump is behind in those states anywhere from about three percent to seven percent. Actually, it's not so different from where he was at this point in 2016 against Hillary Clinton.</p><p>ARROYO: Exactly.</p><p>BEVAN: But he is certainly now in a position of being the underdog. But again, the election is not held tomorrow. It's being held four months from now. There's still a lot of time.</p><p>ARROYO: Governor, I want your reaction to the media's take on these polls. Watch this and then react, please.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: There is no precedent, at least in modern times, for the comeback the president must mount.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Polling indicates this isn't even working for his base.</p><p>JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: When historians look back, they're not going to have any question as to why Donald Trump's poll numbers collapsed the way that they did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Governor, your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I think they are celebrating a little too soon. It reminds me of 2016. I don't know how many times, even on FOX, I had arguments with other FOX personalities and hosts because they said there was no pathway for Donald Trump to win. Raymond, I kept saying he is going to win, he is going to win, and I was called an idiot for saying it.</p><p>But here's what I saw. Most of the people saying what they were saying are the people you just showed. They live in the bubbles of Washington and New York and Silicon Valley and Hollywood. They don't live out in the middle of America where people are sick and tired of the swamp. Donald Trump has a lot of people who support him, who are not going to tell a pollster, they're not going to put a yard sign up because they don't want to be called a racist or a xenophobe or whatever \"phobe\" is popular today. But they are going to go vote for him because they know that he is fighting for them, and they realized Joe Biden doesn't even know there is a fight going on.</p><p>ARROYO: Laura, I spoke to her earlier today, and she said the Biden choice means your taxes are going up and Mount Rushmore is coming down. How might this rioting and destruction of statues affect this race, Tom?</p><p>BEVAN: Yes, look, this is rapidly becoming the backup. I think the economy is still going to be a major factor, but this race is also morphing into even beyond protests and police reform. It has now become a contest of do you think America is a great country and a great place to live, and are you thankful to be a part of it, or do you think America -- do you not like America? Do you hate America? Do you think it's a flawed, oppressive society?</p><p>And that's where I think Donald Trump actually, that's not bad ground for him to run on, because Joe Biden may not be a radical, but he is going to represent those radical elements of the Democratic Party. And that is the choice -- elections are usually, when the reelection are referendum on the incumbent, that's what this is going to be for Donald Trump, at least it is right now. The Trump campaign wants to make it a choice and say, look, you may not like my style, you may not like things about me, but if you don't want to vote for me, you have got to vote for this. And they want that to be -- Joe Biden is going to represent all of that, whether it's the economic policy or whether it's the cultural issues that are in play there, that's the debate that is going to take place.</p><p>ARROYO: It feels a lot like 1968 where Nixon tied all of the mayhem to his Democratic challenger. Governor Huckabee, a new \"USA Today\" poll shows there's a massive enthusiasm gap between Biden and Trump. Here's the breakdown, 50 percent of Trump voters are very excited while only 27 percent of Biden voters say the same. How do you think that's going to affect turnout and the final tally, governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Raymond, that is a big, big factor in an election. You always want to have the momentum on your side in terms of your voters will swim across the river at flood stage to go vote for you. And if there is a drop of rain, Biden supporters are going to stay home. I don't see any enthusiasm for him. The only thing Biden can honestly say is, hey, I'm not Donald Trump for you people who hate Donald Trump.</p><p>But what he can't say is, listen to my great vision for America. I've been in politics for 50 years, and I have nothing to show for it except I'm a terrible plagiarist and have been caught time and again stealing other people's material. That's his claim to fame. I don't think it pans out like people think it does. Yes, the president needs to rev it up a little bit, change some things. But I believe he is going to win.</p><p>ARROYO: I want both of you to react very quickly. A new group was formed this week. Former George W. Bush officials are banning together to support Joe Biden. Now, did any of these people vote for Hillary Clinton last time? That's what I want to know. Is this the kiss of death for Biden? Tom Bevan first, then the governor.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BEVAN: Is this the kiss of death for Biden? No, it's not the kiss of death for Biden, and it's certainly not the kiss of death for Donald Trump either. These kinds of groups get a lot of attention in the media, but they don't represent overall a huge number of people. It's a marginal thing, not going to make a difference.</p><p>ARROYO: Governor, we saw physicians, scientists, generals come out against Trump in the last election. None of it had any effect. Will this effort work?</p><p>HUCKABEE: It only revs his base up more. And to those people who think they are important, here is my reaction -- we'll see you after the election.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ARROYO: A wonderful place to leave it, but save the yawns until the end of the hour, Governor.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ARROYO: Tom, Governor Huckabee, thank you both for being here.</p><p>Up next, we ask the question, what do these protesters really want, and who are they? The answer that you have not been told about.</p><p>And breaking news on the COVID therapy front. We'll share new info, a great new study, when we return. Stay there.</p><p>ARROYO: Welcome back to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" The protests in New York City are not dying down, despite the city's promise to cut the police budget. In fact, in terms of rhetoric, things seem to be heating up. Poor policeman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take that badge off, they'll shoot you, too. They don't care about me. Take it off, they'll kill you next. They don't care about you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Think they care about your thug --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If he doesn't know you have a badge, they'll kill you. They don't like you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: What kind of person harasses -- what kind of person harasses a police officer that way? And a black officer no less? And who would attend a protest night after night to do the same? Senator Mike Lee took a stab at answering those questions today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE, (R-UT): Dimwitted, phony drama addicts, failed by an education system and addled by a social media culture that taught them to be victims instead of citizens. A privileged, self-absorbed, crime syndicate trying to find meaning in empty lives by destroying things that other Americans have spent honest, productive lives building.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP).</p><p>ARROYO: My next guest says what we're seeing play out is not a Marxist revolution, but something far broader. And it has everything to do with Donald Trump. Joining me now is Sohrab Ahmari. He's the op-ed editor at \"The New York Post\" and author of the forthcoming \"The Broken Thread, Discovering the Wisdom of Tradition in an Age of Chaos.\" Boy, do we need that. Sohrab, we have been led to believe that these are Marxist protesters. Now, you just wrote a new piece in \"The Spectator\" that makes a very different case. Who are these counterrevolutionaries?</p><p>SOHRAB AHMARI, \"NEW YORK POST\" OP-ED EDITOR: I think there are elements in these movements that are from the hard left, Antifa, other such groups. But what I argue is, first of all, if you see New York and you are in New York like I am, you see a lot of is, let's say, middle-class, upper middle- class, children of the bourgeoisie is some ways. But even beyond that, looking at who is actually in the streets, what's interesting to me is who is supporting this. I don't deny that there is a grassroots element, but I also see it mainly, in a very telling way, as revolution what you might call the laptop class, or the neoliberal elite, people are in the professional managerial class, big tech, large corporations, academia, quote-unquote, the expert class.</p><p>These are all people who were threatened by 2016, which I think was the real revolution. That was the year that voters both here in the United States but also in Europe voted for movements like President Donald Trump, for Brexit, other populist and conservative nationalist movements. And they turfed out a kind of global elite, for the first time they turfed them out of power in decades. And they saw that as a threat.</p><p>And so in the four years that followed, Raymond, they did one thing after another. You'll remember, starting with a collusion probe, then you had the farcical impeachment process. Then in Britain, you had three years of trying to thwart what the British people had decisively chosen at the ballot box, which is to leave the European Union. And I see this as one more element of that process. Everything else has been tried. And if that happens -- and I'm not saying it is a conspiracy. It's just a tendency of a certain class.</p><p>ARROYO: So it's a class war. You are really saying this is a class war. And the question is, why our big companies like Brooks Brothers, Walmart, Netflix, why are they signing onto this movement, Sohrab? It would seem it would undermine their outcomes, it would undermine and their well-being.</p><p>AHMARI: Again, I'm not so sure, because I think the people who are making these decisions for these companies are not dumb. So, if they don't act against their own interest, someone really has to ask, if anyone seriously believes that revolution that threatens the interest of the American establishment, like you said, Walmart, Amazon, Nike, Netflix, the trustees of Ivy League universities, Brooks Brothers, for God's sake, if a movement really threatened those interest materially, would they support it? They wouldn't. I would argue that their material interest lies in things like easier trade with China. And so President Trump and movements like President Trump's in Europe like Brexit have thrown a wrench in their economic workings. And so --</p><p>ARROYO: Very quickly, Sohrab, but the breakdown of the policing and the call to disband the police and defund it, that doesn't quite fit this theory, though, does it?</p><p>AHMARI: Again, I think it does, because, look, some of the wealthiest people in my social circle are also the ones who are supporting defund the police, and it's because they can afford private security. They live in doorman buildings.</p><p>ARROYO: Private security, doesn't affect them. It's always personal, Sohrab. We'll leave it there. Thank you so much. We'll have you back.</p><p>We will drive next into the breaking new COVID treatment study that confirms what \"The Ingraham Angle\" has been telling you for months. Details in moments, and an important programming note. Do not miss this. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not only does hydroxychloroquine not work to fight COVID, it can actually make patients sicker and even more likely to die.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no evidence that tells us that taking hydroxychloroquine is either safe or effective.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is right now, to be clear, no evidence that it works to treat this disease.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Well, a new hydroxychloroquine study has just dropped, and it could have all those experts eating their words. The Henry Ford Health System in Michigan tonight is announcing that hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced death rates among sick and hospitalized COVID patients. In this much anticipated study, researchers analyzed the health outcomes of 2,451 patients over a six-month period. They found that only 13 percent of COVID patients given hydroxychloroquine died, while 26 percent of non-hydroxy patients succumbed to the disease.</p><p>Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui. He is a cardiologist and CEO of Foxhall Cardiology. Doctor, how big is the study for hydroxychloroquine?</p><p>DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST: I think, as President Trump said, it's a game changer in the United States. We have seen excellent outcomes with hydroxychloroquine in Italy, in Spain, in France, in Turkey, Morocco. It seems as though the people that you quoted refused to read any literature that isn't generated inside the United States of America, inside the continental United States. The study shows not just that this drug halves mortality in patients with symptomatic COVID infections, but also it's incredibly safe when used with azithromycin, which is what we've seen in the Northwell Group in Long Island, and we've seen in France with Didier Raoult's 3,700 patient study that was published late last month.</p><p>ARROYO: This was a big one, and Dr. Oskoui, I want to dig a bit into this study and what it found regarding heart problems, the researchers write \"A review of our COVID-19 data demonstrated no major cardiac arrhythmias, specifically no torsades de pointed that has been observed with hydroxychloroquine treatment.\" This would seem to totally refute the media narrative on this, Doc.</p><p>OSKOUI: It does. And it points to the fact that many of the studies that suggested there may have been a problem with hydroxychloroquine in this regard and the safety signals that supposed the FDA was concerned about were unfounded. As we've mentioned before, the Northwell Group in Long Island found no problem. I coauthored a letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal that reviewed this matter in depth. And the truth is that much of those issues probably occur because of sloppy medical care by the providers and using this drug in patients where it was not appropriate, basically patients who were essentially a few steps from the morgue.</p><p>ARROYO: Well, all I can say, when I read this, I thought our personal hydroxychloro-queen, Laura, would love this, seeing this report, so said she's not here.</p><p>CNN medical analyst and Cheney cardiologist Jonathan Reiner says Trump was foolish to put all of his hopes and hydroxy. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: He banked on magical thinking that the warm weather was going to make this go away, that hydroxychloroquine was a magic bullet. And he wished it away, and this is where we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: The good doctor might have been engaging in magical thinking. What does this mean for remdesivir, Dr. Oskoui?</p><p>OSKOUI: I know Jonathan. He's an outstanding clinical cardiologist whose great skills are in the lab, but I think this makes remdesivir irrelevant. Remdesivir has never shown that it drops viral load, it never shows any mortality benefit. We have numerous studies that show this benefit with hydroxychloroquine when used in patients with mild or moderate COVID illness. And I think remdesivir, we bought, apparently, the U.S. supply, we bought something that was worthless. But we can share it with the world. I think the fact that we have 60 million tablets in the strategic reserve is going to great for the southern states where this is going to be desperately needed right now.</p><p>ARROYO: Doctor, I have to get roll. I've got a hard break. Thank you for your time.</p><p>President Trump is following in the footsteps of a past commander in chief. Find out who. Stay there.</p><p>ARROYO: It's time for the last bat. President Trump is taking cues from a past president who is a little out of fashion with the woke left. I'm talking about Teddy Roosevelt who used to say speak softly and carry a big stick. Well, Trump may not be speaking softly, but he was swinging a big stick at a Spirit of America White House event today. He's got that Babe Ruth vibe going.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020070201cb257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608H-GTN1-DXH2-63F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7210\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Leftist Agenda</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Boycott the 4th</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Black Lives Matter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forget the Fourth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New Nation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Juneteenth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID Lockdowns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California Beach Closures</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eric Garcetti</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Contact Tracer Fines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Statue Attacks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jason Charter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antifa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FBI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jobs Growth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DECC</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp;

That is THE STORY of Wednesday, August 7th, 2019. But as always, THE STORY goes on. So we will see you back here tomorrow night at seven o'clock. Have a good night, everybody.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. What's the point at which rhetoric forces action? When do words become incitement? At what point do political attacks become so reckless and unhinged that you can no longer heal the divide they create with politics and force people towards something darker?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, it's hard to know exactly when that point is, but the left is getting very close to it. We could give you many examples of this, we will begin with this exchange from last night on MSNBC. This is frequent guest, Malcolm Nance, accusing the President of the United States of sending secret messages to neo Nazis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALCOLM NANCE, AMERICAN AUTHOR AND MEDIA COMMENTATOR ON TERRORISM, INTELLIGENCE, INSURGENCY AND TORTURE: These people feel that they are the foot soldiers executors of what the disenfranchisement that the white race is feeling and Donald Trump is giving them subliminal orders in their head.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Subliminal orders, whatever his false, you can be certain that Donald Trump is not doing that. Trump is the least subliminal politician in American history. He has no subtext. That's part of the problem, of course, if he is thinking it, he is saying it.</p><p>The claim is ludicrous. But at MSNBC, it wasn't even the weirdest thing uttered on their air yesterday, that distinction goes to Frank Figliuzzi. He is a former F.B.I. official turned talking head conspiracy nut.</p><p>He used numerology to explain the President's coded messages. Watch this, and keep in mind, it is entirely real. We've not edited a single word.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK FIGLIUZZI, FORMER F.B.I. OFFICIAL: It's the little things and language and messaging that matters. The President said that we will fly our flags at half-mast until August 8th, that's eight-eight.</p><p>Now I'm not going to imply that he did this deliberately, but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that's being demonstrated by the White House. The numbers eight, eight are very significant in neo Nazi and white supremacy movement. Why?</p><p>Because the letter H is the eighth letter of the alphabet and to them the numbers eight together stand for \"Heil, Hitler.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Got that? Eight is a racist number. That's what they're telling you on MSNBC. In other words, things are getting dangerously crazy on the left. How crazy? Well, on Monday, former Jeb Bush spokeswoman, Nicole Wallace explained that President Trump is planning a genocide of Hispanic- Americans. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAUL REYES, NBC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He ramped it up again to the invasion, the warning people of the caravan and words like \"infestation.\" What do you do with an infestation? With an infestation? The natural conclusion is to attempt extermination.</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC ANCHOR: President Obama used the power of the Presidency to try to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the Latino community, Latino leaders at the table. You now have a President, as you said, talking about exterminating Latinos.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"Exterminating Latinos,\" keep in mind that Donald Trump as a factual matter, got a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney did.</p><p>It turns out that not all Latinos believe in open borders, a lot of them don't. Some of them agree with Donald Trump on immigration. And yet the left is now telling you and demanding that you believe that anyone who supports Donald Trump is a white supremacist and must be destroyed.</p><p>Now they're telling you that for political reasons, this is election season, obviously, and they want more political power. But there are other reasons, too, that they're saying this. Ever wonder why rich people seem the most hysterical on the subject? Ever noticed that it's the highest paid people on television, who are the most determined to convince you that white supremacy is America's biggest problem? Why is that? Simple.</p><p>Every minute you're angry about race is a minute you're not thinking about class, which of course, is the real divide in this country, working class, people of all colors have a lot more in common, infinitely more in common with each other than they do with some overpaid MSNBC anchor. And if you were allowed to think about that for long enough, you might start to get unauthorized ideas about economics, and that would be disruptive to a very lucrative status quo.</p><p>So they whip you into a frenzy of racial fear so that it never enters your mind. It's a diversion. Everyone else hates each other, they get to keep their money, pretty tricky. Unfortunately, it's also destroying the country. This is the path to civil war, obviously.</p><p>So we want to take a second to pass on a sincere message to official Washington and particularly to our colleagues on the other cable news channels, and it's this, please, for the sake of the nation, calm down.</p><p>Yes, America has problems. Yes, racism is one of America's problems. But so is a fading middle class, so is a terrifying drug epidemic that's killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, so is the national debt that is growing by a trillion dollars a year. These are huge problems. And people know that. People know their country is in decline. And it's making them turn to new political leaders.</p><p>Donald Trump was one of those new leaders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are a couple of others. This is a time of frustration, and it's a time of change. It's a hard time for America.</p><p>But this country is not on the brink of genocide. It's not even close to that. This is not a white supremacist country plotting the slaughter of its own people. It's a kind country full of decent people of all races, who like all people everywhere make bad decisions from time to time, but they mean well, and they generally try their best.</p><p>So going forward, give them the benefit of the doubt, even when you disagree with them, maybe especially when you disagree with them. These are your fellow Americans, cut them a break. They deserve it. And remember, the alternative is disaster.</p><p>Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill\" and he joins us tonight. Joe, in that spirit, I mean, I don't want to increase the temperature or traffic and even more outrage and I am outraged sometimes and sometimes I regret how outraged I've become.</p><p>But I have to say that accusing your political opponents of wanting to commit genocide or sending secret telepathic messages to Nazis does seem like it is ratcheting it up to a point where things start to fall apart.</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: Completely fall apart. I would argue, Tucker, that yesterday was the lowest point in MSNBC's 23-year history because there's another example, in addition to the other two you provided from Nicolle Wallace, and that analyst later on Brian Williams's show, and that was Mika Brzezinski of \"Morning Joe\" who said that the President of the United States wants mass shootings to happen, wants to see the American carnage and slaughter of American men, women and children.</p><p>And no one on the set, not one person could step up and say, ''That is too much. That is too much.\" And as you mentioned, Nicolle Wallace, a former Communications Director in the Bush administration, saying that Latinos are going to be exterminated. I've never heard something so offensive on cable news, and she'll be back on today because she only offered a half-hearted apology that obviously that whole nonsense around August 8th and sending a bad signal to neo Nazis.</p><p>This isn't MSNBC, Tucker. This is MSN-Fo Wars. Alex Jones is watching that and saying, boy, even me that sounds a little bit crazy. So here's what has to happen. This is the only way this gets solved. Brian Roberts is a CEO of Comcast. Comcast owns NBC Universal. Universal NBC News, MSNBC News has a chairman named Andy Lack. Andy Lack needs to get every important person at \"30 Rock\" that's under that news division into a room and says, \"This is enough. You will be fired or suspended if you peddle in these conspiracy theories.\"</p><p>And it's happened at the network before and not too long ago. I don't know if you remember this, Tucker. Martin Bashir, I think this was about six years ago, said that people should defecate on Sarah Palin. And this wasn't something said in the heat of battle passion. It was an impromptu meeting that it was vetted and was scripted, and he was fired from the network.</p><p>And when a Nicolle Wallace says something like that, or you have on a Brian Williams's show somebody saying that, are you kidding me that if the President re-raises flags, that that's a signal to neo Nazis, these people should not be on the air anymore as a result of saying that because obviously, this is the stuff that divides the country, Tucker, as to your point.</p><p>CARLSON: It seems like it's moving towards something awful. I sure hope I'm wrong. Joe Concha. Great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>CONCHA: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Congressman Joaquin Castro was not backing down at all after his decision to target his own constituents for donating to a politician he doesn't like. Instead, he explicitly accused them of being complicit in murder, motivated by racism. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO, (D-TX): There are people right now that are living in fear, and I don't think the President understands that. I don't think those donors understand it, but they need to understand what their money is going to.</p><p>You're giving money for somebody that's going after a community and people have gotten killed because of that.</p><p>Unless you support the white nationalism and the racism that Donald Trump is paying for and fueling, then I hope that you as a person of good conscience, will think twice about contributing to his campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's just one of the sickest things I've ever seen on television. Julian Epstein is a former Chief Counsel at the House Judiciary Committee. He had been in D.C. a long time. He joins us tonight.</p><p>Look, I get why people don't like Trump. I get what people don't like his rhetoric. I get that people disagree with his policy positions, all fine. But to say that anybody who disagrees with my politics is a white supremacist, it's just like the worst thing you can be. That's too freaking far actually, I think.</p><p>JULIAN EPSTEIN, FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL AT THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Look, I think your introduction was good. I think the call for de- escalation of the rhetoric on both sides is good. I think it is tearing the country apart while we are ignoring other issues.</p><p>I think your introduction could have included an urging to the President to also tone down the language, to try to tone down what has been I think incendiary name calling towards immigrant communities.</p><p>I think that has also played a contributory role. That is not to discount -- I mean, the problem with the left and the right, is it's all the \"What about-ism.\" The right always, \"Well, look at the extremist overreaction on the left.\" And there has been extremist overreaction. I agree with that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I don't like the tweets. I mean, I have never liked the tweets, I get.</p><p>EPSTEIN: So, I think the President's rhetoric has played a role in what has been a disastrous kind of civic situation that we have right now. That's not to say that the left doesn't overreact. I mean, this is part of the problem of a political world that's dominated by Twitter and cable news. It's the loudest and most extreme voices that are always getting all the attention.</p><p>CARLSON: But this Castro character is a presidential candidate.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And his brother who tweeted that out is a member of Congress. So, these are not even cable news employees. I mean, these are -- these are a former Cabinet Secretary and a sitting Member of Congress. I mean, these are leaders.</p><p>EPSTEIN: So here's what he would probably say if he were on the show -- it was this -- this kind of tweeting and identifying and naming and shaming of donors has become par for the course in American politics, unfortunately. So why should this be any different?</p><p>CARLSON: I'll tell you because someone is going to get killed, that's why.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My response. That's would be my response.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My response would be is that you are dealing with an incendiary situation right now, and it's time for people on both sides to tone down the language because the last thing we want to see is another tragedy.</p><p>CARLSON: But also -- but here's what's happening and this is what Trump is actually not -- and Trump has said things that are imprecise, that I disagree with that I think are inflammatory, clearly. But here's what he hasn't done, said that anybody on the other side, just by virtue of supporting a politician he doesn't like is evil. Like that's too far.</p><p>If you're supporting Donald Trump, you're a white supremacist. If you don't agree with me, you're a Nazi. Like that is the beginning of Civil War.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Yes. Lincoln's famous words, \"Nobody wanted war to come, but war came.\" And we are headed towards I think -- I think we are in a political cold Civil War right now. And that's bad for the country, really bad for the country. And I think people on both sides have a responsibility.</p><p>I think that it is important to say that I think the some of the President's language and some of the President's rhetoric has given encouragement to extremists on the right. I think it's true, but let me finish my point.</p><p>CARLSON: But let me just be clear. I will -- hold on, if you -- I don't like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I think she's dumb.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I think her policy positions are wrong. If you give money to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, you can be a good person. You just disagreed with me?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I was going to say that.</p><p>CARLSON: Right? I mean, so it's kind of that simple.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I was going to say that. Yes. I was going to say, I think you have to separate. I think while you can say that some of the President's language has given encouragement to extremists, and perhaps even this this mass murderer in El Paso, it is unfair to say that everybody supports the President as a white supremacist or a bad person.</p><p>People may have all kinds of reasons for supporting President Trump, and I just think so -- I think that unnecessarily polarizes and it's this kind of culture of contempt, where everybody on the other side is an evil person, and you look down derisively on them, and that is a toxic climate situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And I just want to be very clear about something because I think that wasn't clear enough. Those tweets calling out and doxing in effect, the donors to Trump from Texas, those came from the Congressman whose brother is running for President. They did not come for the presidential candidate, I want to be totally clear about that.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Julian, thank you for that.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Okay.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: Mass shootings grabbed the headlines, but far more Americans are in danger from the routine violence they encounter in American cities. There's a lot of it. Larry Elder joins us next to discuss that. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Thirty one people were killed in mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso, it was horrifying. And at the same time, it's not as rare as we'd like to tell ourselves. Mass shootings are just a small part of this country's violent crime problem.</p><p>Last week in Chicago for example, the city's deadliest all year and was as destructive as any mass shooting we've seen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the Chicago police ShotSpotter at 18th and Keeler which picked up the sound of shots being fired early Sunday morning.</p><p>It goes on for almost a minute. The gunfire leaving a 33-year-old man dead and eight people wounded. Citywide, seven people were killed and 48 wounded over the weekend, many on the west side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Those seven murders push Chicago to over 300 murders for the year. Most of those have occurred in just a handful of neighborhoods. The city's black residents suffer the most by far, there are 80 percent of murder victims in Chicago.</p><p>Chicago has the most violence in the country, but it's not exceptional. Smaller cities -- St. Louis, Baltimore, Detroit -- are even more dangerous. By the way, that's not what about-ism, it is totally real and it's ignored.</p><p>Larry Elder is an attorney and a radio show host and he joins us tonight. Larry, thanks a lot for coming on. Why is that? Why? By the way, you can deplore and be upset about mass shootings and I think all normal people are and still ask the question, why is the day-to-day carnage ignored resolutely, what's the answer?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST: Well, it's a good question, 17,000 homicides last year, half of those were by black people against black people. The number one cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide. The number one cause of preventable death for young white men is accidents like car accidents. Twenty five percent of young black men have criminal records as opposed to 10 percent of young white men.</p><p>And, you know, arguably two of the most prominent leaders in the last several years -- black leaders -- have been Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. Both of them have had either non-existing relationships or poor relationship with their own fathers.</p><p>In the case of Jesse Jackson, his pregnant teen mother, his mother got pregnant by the married man living next door, and Jesse Jackson grew up with kids taunting him in South Carolina, \"Jesse ain't got no Daddy. Jesse ain't got no daddy.\"</p><p>Al Sharpton had a nice, comfortable middle class life, Tucker, until his father abandoned the family and then down to the ghetto he went. I mention that because 70 percent of black kids are raised without fathers.</p><p>And Obama said, a kid without a dad is five times more likely to be poor, nine times more likely to drop out of school, 20 times more likely to end up in jail and is far and away the number one problem in this country that is being ignored.</p><p>CARLSON: Why, I wonder? I mean, because if you cared, I don't really think there's a lot of debate among sociologists. There are longitudinal studies for the last hundred years on this question, and they all point to exactly what you just said. So if you cared, you would emphasize this, but people don't. Why?</p><p>ELDER: Well, the left does not because they have to create the problem. In 1940, for example, only 14 percent of black kids are born outside of wedlock; in 1965, twenty-five percent. Now, it's 70 percent and I argue that the welfare state has incentivized women to marry the government and allowed men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility.</p><p>It would require the left to go to the mirror and say, \"Oh, my God, I've helped to create this problem. What do I need to do?\" The answer is to undo the welfare state. We know that the welfare state creates dependency, because in 1996, when Bill Clinton signed the Welfare Reform Act, what happened? Welfare rows declined by 50 percent and you can't blame that just on a good economy.</p><p>What happened is, able-bodied people got off the couch and went into the market, and what we've done is distorted people's incentives with the welfare estate, and that requires a real big discussion that people on the left do not want to have.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we should be having that because it matters. I want to ask you about this, too. So the New York City Department of Health is now going after the city's police. The City's Health Commissioner publicly announced that interacting with law enforcement in any capacity is damaging to people's health. A new criminal justice action kit is being distributed to doctors to help them properly care for patients who suffered the trauma of interacting with the justice system. What do you make of that? And what's the long term effect of an announcement like that, would you say?</p><p>ELDER: It's a horrific lie. There was just a paper published in the official journal of the National Association of Science -- National Academy of Science rather -- two researchers from Pennsylvania, and they've been looking at a police shooting, I think it was in the year 2015, every single police shooting in the country, and they could not find any pattern of discrimination against black suspects, whether by a white cop or black cop, it didn't matter. There was no pattern of discrimination whatsoever.</p><p>And that tracks the paper written a black Harvard economist, who also thought he was going to find a disproportionate use of deadly force against black people. He found the opposite that police were more hesitant, more reluctant to pull the trigger against black people.</p><p>What this lie does, it causes young black men to be confrontational with cops instead of cooperating and it causes the cops to pull back for fear that they'd be called racist. And you've seen that what's called the Ferguson Effect in places like Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis outside of Ferguson where cops pulled back and the very people that the left claims they care about, black people were the ones who are most likely to become victimized. So it has a real world consequence. It is a lie.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. And the usual people suffer the people, the people that ...</p><p>ELDER: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: ... no one actually cares about, I've noticed. Larry Elder, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>ELDER: You got it. Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you're hearing demands all of a sudden, mostly from Democrats, but also from some Republicans for new gun control measures. Some, like Beto O'Rourke are demanding outright gun confiscation, but not everyone on the left is on board.</p><p>Jason Nichols is Professor of African-American Studies in the University of Maryland, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks a lot for coming on. So, we don't agree on much. I think you're a man of good faith. I love having you on the show. But we sincerely disagree, I would say on most issues.</p><p>JASON NICHOLS, PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: But in talking off the air the other day, you said something really interesting to me, and I wanted you to explain it more fully for our audience, that you're not reflexively on board with gun control measures.</p><p>NICHOLS: So there are some common sense gun control measures that I think makes sense. Even limiting the capacity of a magazine, we saw, for example, in Gilroy, California, where a guy had a 75-round drum connected to his weapon. I am against that.</p><p>I don't think we need silencers. I think we need universal background checks. But gun confiscation goes way too far.</p><p>When we look at the history of gun control in this country, it has been to keep guns out of the hands of black people and that's indisputable fact. I would point anybody to Adam Winkler's work out of UCLA.</p><p>As a matter of fact, when you go back to the antebellum period, it was to keep guns out of the hands of both enslaved and free African people.</p><p>And then you go to Roger Taney, who wrote the infamous Dred Scott case.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NICHOLS: And one of the things that he said was that he didn't think that black people had rights that white people were bound to respect, in part because he thought if you extended those rights, that they would have the rights to carry and own guns.</p><p>The Ku Klux Klan, the infamous terrorist group -- conservative terrorist group regardless of party --</p><p>CARLSON: A Democratic Party group. I mean, if we are being honest about it.</p><p>NICHOLS: Yes, well, but they're still conservative Christians.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, but I am saying they are Democrats.</p><p>NICHOLS: But at the same time, that group were advocates of gun control. So I think honestly, you know, when you look at the history of the issue, I think that, you know, African-American people should be a little leery about people wanting to come around and take their guns.</p><p>CARLSON: You think? Yes, I'm sorry to laugh, but you make a compelling case, because what you're saying is factually true. And this is a non- racial point, it is a point about human nature.</p><p>But when you want to oppress somebody, you disarm him first, of course. And you've seen that in totally homogeneous countries where race is not a factor, but the first thing the government does is disarm the population before doing something horrible with them, obviously.</p><p>So because what you just said is so clearly true. Why is it so rarely said out loud?</p><p>NICHOLS: You know, I'm not exactly sure. You know, some of our Civil Rights heroes that are oftentimes not acknowledged whether we're talking about the Deacons for Defense, or we're talking about Robert F. Williams. I'm not sure exactly why people don't state this, I think because --</p><p>CARLSON: Was Martin Luther King for gun control?</p><p>NICHOLS: Well, Dr. King, at one point was certainly a gun owner, and at one point, they actually said, a journalist nearly sat on top of a gun in his home and called his home an arsenal, so --</p><p>CARLSON: Martin Luther King's home, an arsenal.</p><p>NICHOLS: Martin Luther King -- but at the same time, there are organizations that have worked against black people that are pro- gun, and they are pro-gun control when it comes to black people like the NRA. So that has a very serious --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I would say -- I would say I'm not here to speak for the NRA. But as someone who believes in the Second Amendment, I believe it's a universal principle that applies. It goes without saying, but I will say it explicitly -- that applies without regard to race, of course. It applies to all human beings. It's a God-given right, the right to self- defense.</p><p>And I think most people of goodwill believe that, how much crap will you take for saying something so obvious on this?</p><p>NICHOLS: I'd say crap every time I'm on this show from one side or the other. So, you know, I think I'm prepared for the crap.</p><p>CARLSON: You're prepared for it. Professor, thank you very much for coming on. I hope that people can rise above the partisanship just for a second and meditate on what you said. Because I think it's absolutely true. Great to see you.</p><p>NICHOLS: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, at least 14 F.B.I. agents were caught leaking information to the press, only four were fired. Now, Peter Strzok is claiming he ought to keep his job. What does that say about the culture of the Federal bureaucracy and specifically about the culture of Federal law enforcement? We will investigate after the break.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Trace Gallagher. President Trump heading back to the White House this hour after visiting the scenes of the two deadly mass shootings that left 31 people dead over the weekend.</p><p>The President and First Lady's first stop was in Dayton, Ohio, where they visited a hospital where many victims of Sunday's attack were being treated. Nine people were killed in that shooting. President Trump then headed to El Paso, Texas to meet with victims and first responders.</p><p>On Saturday, a gunman opened fire at a Walmart killing 22 people. After leaving the hospital, the President toured an Emergency Operation Center. His visit was also marked by protest both in support and against the President in Ohio and Texas.</p><p>Demonstrators blame the President's rhetoric for flaming tensions in the country. I'm Trace Gallagher with news breaks out, we will break in. Now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the F.B.I. is entirely willing and they've displayed it many times to drag American citizens from their beds at night and send them to prison for life if they miss remember what they said and irrelevant e- mails, they are trying to do that right now to a number of people as you know.</p><p>And yet strange that the F.B.I. seems not concerned at all with wrongdoing by its own agents. How do we know this? Well, new documents obtained by Judicial Watch show that 14 separate F.B.I. agents were caught leaking sensitive or classified information, only four of them were fired.</p><p>With an attitude like that, it's no wonder that new F.B.I. leaks were appearing in America's major papers almost every day for the past two years.</p><p>Tom Fitton is President of Judicial Watch and he joins us now. Tom, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: You're welcome.</p><p>CARLSON: So, 14 separate agents caught. These are just the ones who were caught leaking sensitive material and only four fired? How does that work?</p><p>FITTON: If you're the F.B.I., you're a protected class it looks like. You had four of them -- one of whom who was fired was Andrew McCabe, the number two with the F.B.I. Others who weren't fired, they couldn't even -- they weren't even censured or punished the way the OPR initially wanted them to be punished. So, they were actually under punished in many instances.</p><p>CARLSON: So this is not a crime? It's a crime. My understanding is, it's a crime to leak classified information.</p><p>FITTON: And some of it was grand jury, it looks like according to the documents, so you had in 14 instances, the OPR investigate and request the firing of several officials. Some of whom they didn't even fire, they just censured or suspended.</p><p>CARLSON: How can that be at exactly the moment when the F.B.I. is sticking firearms in the faces of Americans who have been just accused of not remembering an e-mail? A totally irrelevant e-mail? How can they hold themselves to such a lower standard?</p><p>FITTON: Well, Andrew McCabe specifically was referred for criminal prosecution on his illegal leaking, and his lying allegedly about it, and that was well over a year ago. But it is a double standard.</p><p>CARLSON: So what does that mean? That means that McCabe will not be prosecuted.</p><p>FITTON: It suggests that nothing is going to be done about firing him.</p><p>CARLSON: Is anyone ever prosecuted for these kinds of crimes within the F.B.I.?</p><p>FITTON: Rarely, by all accounts, certainly we did this analysis, three years, 14 agents, no prosecutions, four firings. And many of the agents got away with lesser punishments than recommended.</p><p>CARLSON: So you're answering the question that we raised yesterday on the show, which is how did Peter Strzok get the kind of hutzpah required to sue the F.B.I. for firing him for clear conflicts of interest in the course of his job? Like, how does he get that attitude?</p><p>FITTON: I mean, we use the phrase \"The Untouchables.\" It's a great old fashioned term. Well, you know, if you've got bureaucrats who think they're untouchable, they behave the way that Peter Strzok behaved. And to me, it's ironic that he is suing the F.B.I. because from our perspective, they've been protecting him for as long as the scandal has been out there.</p><p>He was fired from the Mueller investigation. We didn't know about that for four months. The F.B.I. currently is telling us that we should have to wait 26 months to get all of his communications with his paramour, Lisa Page, and they're withholding all the personal e-mails that he has been sending her. Forty three percent of the total documents he was creating with her were personal.</p><p>Man, you know, this guy has gotten away with a lot. And if anyone is to be sued, he should be sued by people like Donald Trump, who abused it -- and then James Comey, by the way, we caught him. The F.B.I. tells us that he had F.B.I. files at his house. Of course, nothing he has -- specifically D.O.J. --</p><p>CARLSON: Nobody cares. But try that if you're Roger Stone and you'll die in prison. Yes, I get it.</p><p>FITTON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Tom Fitton, great to see you.</p><p>FITTON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar may have committed campaign finance violation. She may have committed tax fraud. Even her marriage history cannot be verified by local reporters and yet somehow, the same press that's fine with harassing random donors to President Trump is not interested in any of this.</p><p>Steve Drazkowski is a Republican State Representative in the state of Minnesota. He and his colleagues have been demanding a formal investigation of Omar for fraud, perjury, and more. He joins us tonight with an update on that effort.</p><p>Thanks very much for coming on tonight. So how much closer to the truth have you gotten?</p><p>STEVE DRAZKOWSKI (R-MN), STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Well, Tucker, when I was with you last time, we asked formally for an investigation with the Office of Congressional Ethics, and they are acting on that at this point at least getting the investigation required going forward.</p><p>I also formed an online petition omartruth.com to take input and encouragement from the citizens across this country to encourage Congress to act. So we did that last time.</p><p>Yesterday, I held a press conference with nine of my colleagues, and we focus specifically on the income tax violations that were exposed by a Minnesota State Agency, where Representative Omar actually filed taxes jointly with someone she wasn't married to.</p><p>And so we appealed to and wrote a letter to both the IRS Commissioner and to the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue.</p><p>So the Department of Revenue knows about it. They received the letter yesterday from us, the IRS knows about it. Congress knows about it, and the media know about it. We are making certain that all of the people that should be investigating this are aware of it.</p><p>CARLSON: So, they are credible allegations that she both married her biological brother in a sham marriage designed to subvert our immigration law, and that in fact, Ilhan Omar may not even be her real name and that she may have come to this country under false pretenses. Are we closer to knowing whether those allegations are true?</p><p>DRAZKOWSKI: Well, I think we're appealing to the right people. As a matter of fact, you're right. It was a sham marriage. She lied to cover it up. Had she had the people not -- had the people actually known what happened, they wouldn't have elected her. She wouldn't be in Congress today. And if Congress would do their job, she might not be there much longer.</p><p>So we're getting the information in front of people. They should be doing the work and we're simply asking them to do their job.</p><p>CARLSON: Has her -- now, last we checked with you, her office was refusing to answer even basic questions about her family, which are not irrelevant. I mean, they are germane to these allegations that she broke our laws to come here and to live here.</p><p>Has her office given any of the details they've been asked to provide? Or are they continuing to stonewall?</p><p>DRAZKOWSKI: No, they continue to stonewall which is the opposite behavior of what you expect to see from someone if they believe that they are innocent of any allegations.</p><p>So the media here in Minnesota continues to just have a blatant disregard for this. And it is a struggle with the media, but they know about it. They've known about it for three years. These agencies know about it. And we're doing our best to make certain that they are prepared and fully equipped to do their job.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I mean, ultimately voters will have a say in this fairly soon, and you know, I hope that you can keep them as informed as possible so they can make their decision with all available knowledge. Representative, thank you very much for that update tonight. Appreciate it.</p><p>DRAZKOWSKI: Thank you. Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the Koch brothers, the famous Koch brothers have dominated the world of Republican politics for years. The question is, not, are they good people? They are good people. Question is, are they conservative in any sense? What have they done to the Republican Party?</p><p>Well, we'll talk to the author of a new book who spent years looking into this question. It's fascinating. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, here's a fascinating little story that tells you everything about how those in power view ordinary people.</p><p>According to police, Isaiah Thompson has delayed hundreds of subway trains with disruptive behavior. He pulls emergency brakes. He rides on the outside of the cars and much more.</p><p>Since July of 2017, that's only what? Two years. He has been arrested 18 times for behavior like this. Thompson is a pest, I am not saying he is a serial killer, but he does makes life much worse for thousands, maybe millions of ordinary people. He is the kind of person authorities are supposed to protect us from. But officials in New York don't see him that way.</p><p>Thompson was caught back in May and despite his many repeat offenses, 18 arrests, he was released on bail. Now, he is already back to his old antics. This week, he was arrested once again for surfing outside of a subway car. He was arrested, but get this, authorities released him, yet again, this time without any bail at all. So he is still free to pester New York City residents, consequence free.</p><p>The subway hasn't even managed to ban him from using the subway. And why would they even try? In Bill de Blasio's New York, helping normal people is not only not a priority, it's a sin.</p><p>For years, brothers, Charles and David Koch have been the two single most important donors on the American right. They've reshaped the Republican Party, according to their personal ideology. They made the party far more libertarian, much more pro-immigration, and more pro-Big Tech.</p><p>Even if the Republican Party has evolved and elected Donald Trump, the Koch brothers remain tremendously influential, more than you may understand. And if you're frustrated, watching the party ignore what its own voters want, it is part of the reason.</p><p>Well, there is a new book out that takes a very close look at the Koch business and political empire. Chris Leonard is the author of it. It's called \"Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America.\" We just spoke with him. Here's what he said.</p><p>CARLSON: So for my perspective -- my interest is the political activities of the Koch's who by the way, I can say, since I know them, are very nice people, personally.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LEONARD, AUTHOR: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: But there's a misconception in Washington that they're conservative. Tell me what you discovered about their ideology after writing this book. Are they conservatives?</p><p>LEONARD: Well, you know, I think you've gotten it exactly right, in the sense that they're not traditional conservatives, as you might think of that today.</p><p>Charles Koch is an engineer and you're right, he is a really nice guy, I interviewed him for this book, I've been around the people who have worked for him for decades. Charles Koch believes he has found the blueprint for how to organize society.</p><p>He is very libertarian. In his view, the best way to structure a society is just a free market exchange system. That's it. And I call it a blueprint, intentionally. You can't argue with a blueprint. If you mess up something in a blueprint, the building will collapse. You can't argue with physics.</p><p>And I think Charles Koch sees his political ideology in that way. He believes that the only way you can structure society is as a market. And when the government intervenes, it ultimately does more harm than good in his view. It causes more problems than it solves.</p><p>CARLSON: So how -- and our viewers can assess what they think of their views. I do bet that most of our viewers disagree with them on immigration. They've been strong advocates, I would say for opening the borders. How powerful are they -- the Koch brothers and Charles Koch, particularly within the Republican Party, would you say?</p><p>LEONARD: Extremely powerful. You nailed it at the beginning. Charles Koch has been patiently executing a political project since the mid-1970s, and that is to make America more libertarian and his goal in that -- his primary goal has been to reshape the Republican Party.</p><p>And particularly since the 2000s, you've seen the Koch network at large, which is a multifaceted machine that includes a grassroots group of people called Americans for Prosperity. It includes one of the largest corporate lobbying shops in the United States. It includes a constellations of think tanks here in Washington.</p><p>All of these resources have been put to bear to shift the Republican Party more toward what Charles Koch would call a classical liberal ideology totally libertarian, basically moving the Federal government back to the size it was in 1776.</p><p>CARLSON: So you've seen from the various Koch organizations, some of which you just listed recently this line that we really don't have anything to fear from Big Tech, that Republicans are being hysterical conservatives. This show for example, being hysterical about Google or Facebook, just calm down, everything is totally fine.</p><p>Why would they -- which is obviously a lie -- but why would they be telling us that?</p><p>LEONARD: So this is all part of the bigger picture in my view, and we have to go back to when Trump won the election and surprised the entire political landscape of America.</p><p>Donald Trump and what this administration is doing is essentially unacceptable to the Koch network, if you will, because Donald Trump has proven that his administration is willing to intervene in the markets to get a beneficial outcomes for the people who voted for him. That's how I would put it. So Trump is willing to use tariffs.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LEONARD: Trump is willing to tear apart trade deals. And that impulse needs to be kept in check if you're part of the Koch political machine. So if you start talking about regulating any company, if you start talking about regulating these tech companies, the Koch network is going to try to push you back off that as aggressively as they can.</p><p>CARLSON: Which you described in this book, which I would recommend to our viewers, are people who care more about ideas and outcomes, who really are ideologues in the classic sense of that term, and you know, maybe that's appealing to people, and we will let viewers make up their own minds.</p><p>But this is an interesting book, \"Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America.\" Thank you very much, Chris.</p><p>LEONARD: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate it. Well, McDonald's has made a lot of noise about protecting the environment by making a switch to paper straws. And yet in one significant way, the new straw at McDonald's is worse for the environment than the old straw. I'll tell you how, after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: It's been about 35 outrage cycles since left decided we need to ban all plastic straws immediately. Last year, to great fanfare, the U.K. branch of McDonald's restaurants replaced all of their plastic straws with new paper straws. The move they said was meant to protect the environment.</p><p>It turns out it was just a sham and a publicity stunt. How do we know that? We know it because McDonald's has now admitted that, well, all plastic straws could be recycled, the new paper ones or not. They go straight to the garbage every time.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the United States, San Francisco just became the first U.S. airport to ban all plastic water bottles. Michael Loftus has been watching all of this carefully. He is a comedian and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So Michael, do you feel you're doing your part by using one of these non- recyclable paper straws?</p><p>MICHAEL LOFTUS, COMEDIAN: Listen, I'm in the shadows of society. I'm still buying straws on the black market. I'm out in the parking lot talking to my straw dealer like, \"Hey, man, you got a crazy straw. I need a crazy straw.\" It's ridiculous. This whole straw thing is insane. Common sense is dead. It was a good run civilization. But I think it's over. This is literally the straw that broke the camel's back.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it's nicely put. I mean, but it'd be one thing to learn that the new straws are not a net benefit to the environment. But to learn that they're actually worse. That is -- there's something about that's just so perfectly -- it's like an electric windmill. It doesn't generate electricity. It takes electricity.</p><p>LOFTUS: Exactly. It's a windmill that runs on a diesel generator. This doesn't even come close to solving the problem. The problem with plastic in the ocean is coming from India and China. So, this is all a feel good thing that's actually worse. It's just -- and when did McDonald's become the point man for this? And when did life turn into a Monty Python skit? When they invented the paper straw, who ran into that board meeting and go like, \"I've done it men, I've done it. It's a straw that will dissolve in liquid,\" and no one thought to say, \"You're going to put it in liquid.\"</p><p>CARLSON: That's a really good point. So plastic water bottles now banned in San Francisco apparently? Is this going to make life better for a single human being? Do you think?</p><p>LOFTUS: No. And it's going to make my line through the TSA that much longer because now people are going to have to come with like metal water bottles, you might as well put your water in a pressure cooker at this point.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, so like, what would be the point? I mean, I'm starting to believe that the point of all of these laws is to make the people who pass them feel like good people. It's a kind of religious observance.</p><p>LOFTUS: Yes, it is. It's like the people who pass our laws, like fell asleep as children in front of a marathon of \"Gilligan's Island,\" and that's what they want our life to look like now.</p><p>Seriously, \"Gilligan's Island\" has got to be the perfect metaphor for the green deal or whatever thing. It's all green energy, just Gilligan on his bamboo bike, and they're eating off of bamboo trays, and the Professor can magically solve other problems. It's not reality, you guys, it's not reality.</p><p>Just everyone needs to take a deep breath and admit that common sense needs to make a huge comeback.</p><p>CARLSON: You know, I like \"Gilligan's Island.\" I've got to be honest, I think of it more like Bulgaria 1975. I'd be happy with a bamboo bike. I think it's going to be worse than that. I think it's me crumbling, concrete apartment blocks with you know, flickering lights, but we'll see. Michael, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>LOFTUS: Good to see you, man.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for us tonight. Tune in every night. 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.</p><p>By the way I am taking several days off headed to the wilderness to fish with my son. Catch some brook trout. Politics is important; fishing with your son sometimes is more important, so I'm doing it.</p><p>But don't worry, some of our favorites will be here while I'm gone. Brian Kilmeade is here tomorrow. I'll be back for a special investigation on Friday that Mark Steyn anchors most of the week and then Tammy Bruce will be here. See you soon, August 19. Have a great night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019080701cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-MKG1-DXH2-60P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 7, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Affirmative Action</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Identity Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ilhan Omar</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Recycling</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X5W</classCode><className>SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001681</classCode><className>TAX LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Then on Friday night, Buttigieg, 37, issued a statement summarizing his projects there. </p><p>\u201cTo the best of my recollection, these are all of my client engagements during my time with the firm,\" Buttigieg said without offering further details, which are currently under wraps in the nondisclosure agreement.</p><p>But critics on the Left say the fact that he worked at the management consulting firm at all makes him suspect. In their view, the McKinsey experience is another check mark in Buttigieg's rise in the establishment, along with his elite education and later military service as a Navy Reserve intelligence officer, becoming a lieutenant and deploying to Afghanistan in 2014. </p><p>That stands in marked contrast to 2020 Democratic rivals like Bernie Sanders, said Nomiki Konst, a supporter of the Vermont senator and former Democratic National Committee member.</p><p>\"He comes in as this mayor of a Midwest town,\" Konst said. \"But his experience is really around the intelligence community, whether at McKinsey or in the military.\"</p><p>For months, Buttigieg resisted calls from her rivals like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and liberal activists to release specifics about his McKinsey work.</p><p>\u201cThere are some candidates who want to distract from the fact that they have not released the names of their clients and have not released the names of their bundlers,\" Warren said last month.</p><p>The jabs by Warren, 70, come as McKinsey draws increasing broad scrutiny over its clients. </p><p>The firm worked with Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid-based painkiller OxyContin, to boost its drug sales. It has also reportedly done consulting work for the governments of China and Saudi Arabia, and, in critics' eyes, assisted those regimes in cracking down on dissenters. And it had to pull all business out of Africa after it was implicated in a massive corruption scheme in South Africa.</p><p>And a recent ProPublica investigation found that in the United States, McKinsey was instrumental in helping the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency construct its detention apparatus that has drawn criticism as inhumane. </p><p>\"I think that the first suspicions rose around the economic crisis where the management consultants took a role in government and motivated Wall Street banks into setting up regulatory standards that maximize profits,\" Konst said. \"They consulted that workers don\u2019t need as many protections or power.</p><p>Buttigieg's \"work in these places ought to be questioned,\" she said. </p><p>None of the recent McKinsey controversies happened when Buttigieg worked there. But skeptics say the nature of the firm's work is consistent with a candidate's platform of incremental, rather than radical, change.</p><p>\u201cThe fundamental question in politics is whose side are you on, who are you fighting for? Working at McKinsey would be fine if he was now challenging corporate interests like big tech and big insurance companies,\" said Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green.</p><p>Photo Caption:Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, South Bend, Ind. mayor, address the National Action Network (NAN) convention, Thursday April 4, 2019, in New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2322433396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP7-1V81-JBHT-D34M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Sign up here. Twitter on Wednesday expanded its coronavirus safety guidance regarding what qualifies as 'unverified claims' to include posts it deems 'could lead to widespread panic, social unrest or large-scale disorder.' The update builds upon March 27 guidance from Twitter saying it will 'require people to remove tweets' that contain certain 'unverified claims' as social media platforms crack down on coronavirus misinformation being spread online during the pandemic. Facebook and Eventbrite recently started removing events that encourage people to defy COVID-19 social distancing regulations as protests to reopen the economy pop up across the country. 'We have broadened our guidance on unverified claims that incite people to engage in harmful activity, could lead to the destruction or damage of critical 5G infrastructure, or could lead to widespread panic, social unrest or large-scale disorder,' Twitter said in a Wednesday tweet.We have broadened our guidance on unverified claims that incite people to engage in harmful activity, could lead to the destruction or damage of critical 5G infrastructure, or could lead to widespread panic, social unrest, or large-scale disorder. \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) April 22, 2020[3]Twitter's mention of 5G, or fifth-generation, wireless infrastructure is in reference to a conspiracy theory that spread across the internet in recent weeks linking the COVID-19 to 5G infrastructure that has led some people in the U.K. to burn cell towers. A tweet mentioning such a conspiracy theory is an example of something Twitter would remove under its new guidelines. US JUDGE BLOCK'S TWITTER'S BIG TO REVEAL GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE REQUESTS[4] Twitter gave other examples of tweets that would be removed under its new policies, including: '#8216;The National Guard just announced that no more shipments of food will be arriving for two months \u2014 run to the grocery store ASAP and buy everything' or '5G causes coronavirus \u2014 go destroy the cell towers in your neighborhood!'' The social media site has removed more than 2,230 tweets 'containing misleading and potentially harmful content' since March 18, when it first updated its safety policies regarding COVID-19 information, Twitter said in another Wednesday tweet.Since introducing our updated policies on March 18, we've removed over 2,230 Tweets containing misleading and potentially harmful content. Our automated systems have challenged more than 3.4 million accounts targeting manipulative discussions around COVID-19. \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) April 22, 2020[5]The site's algorithms have also 'challenged more than 3.4 million accounts targeting manipulative discussions around COVID-19,' the tweet says. A company spokesperson told FOX Business in a statement that while it will not remove every tweet that contains 'disputed or incomplete' information about the virus, it is 'prioritizing the removal of COVID-19 content when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm.' FACEBOOK REMOVING EVENTS THAT DEFY CORONAVIRUS SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES Fake information on social media has been deadly. Last month, Iranian media reported more than 300 people had died and 1,000 were sickened in the country after ingesting methanol, a toxic alcohol rumored to be a remedy on social media. Facebook has made even stricter updates to its platform. Starting as early as January, the company's third-party fact-check team has been working with global health professionals to review and debunk false claims about the virus.

The company is also letting users know when they have 'liked' coronavirus hoaxes posted to the platform of more than 2 billion users. Facebook says it has removed 'hundreds of thousands' of posts containing potentially harmful COVID-19 misinformation.

APPLE, GOOGLE TO TRACK CORONAVIRUS INFECTION VIA SMARTPHONES More than 100 human rights groups issued a letter in early April saying that while technology and social media play an important role in connecting people with accurate information, if governments do not oversee the means by which tech companies gather data, privacy rights issues could arise.The Coronavirus response 'must not be used as a cover to usher in a new era of greatly expanded systems of invasive surveillance.'

However, an increase in state digital surveillance powers, such as obtaining access to mobile phone location data, threatens privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of association, in ways that could violate rights and degrade trust in public authorities,' the groups wrote. They added that 'such measures also pose a risk of discrimination and may disproportionately harm already marginalized communities.' Twitter said it is enforcing its new policy with reports from trusted partners, including public health authorities and local governments.

Most of you probably realized this was nonsense, but it now turns out that not only was the lobbying almost entirely dominated by the legacy copyright players, but a key plank of their lobbying campaign was to falsely allege that all opposition was just Google. If you've been paying attention at all to the crazy fights over the EU Copyright Directive[1], you may have heard some claims being passed around that it's somehow \"Google\" lobbying heavily against the bill. Indeed, all over Twitter, that's the talking point from tons of EU Copyright Directive supporters. </p><p>After the EU Parliament put the breaks on the bill back in July, I even saw a former RIAA exec (who has since blocked me on Twitter, so I can't show it to you) tweet that this was a clear perversion of the \"will of the people\" by Google's corporate lobbying. Of course, it's hilarious for that to come from an ex-RIAA exec, who was heavily involved over the past 3 decades in pushing through all sorts of protectionist, anti-public, anti-musician legislation and trade agreements. But... it's a talking point. And it's one that lots of people have jumped on. Digital Music News, who is always quick to restate the recording industry's talking points, claimed that Google spent more than $36 million lobbying over Article 13[2]. Billboard Magazine published a similar claim[3]. Various music industry groups, in what appeared to be closely coordinated messaging, all started blaming Google and \"the tech giants\" for any opposition to the EU Copyright Directive -- which, mind you, would change the fundamental ways in which the internet works. Yet, in their minds, all of the opposition came from the internet giants. Here's Geoff Taylor from BPI[4]:The US tech lobby has been using its enormous reach and resources to try to whip up an alarmist campaign...And here's Richard Ashcroft[5] from PRS for Music:the Internet giants... have whipped up a social media storm of misinformation about the proposed changes in order to preserve their current advantage.And how about UK Music's Michael Dugher[6] who really wants to blame Google for everything:Some absolute rubbish has been written about the EU's proposed changes on copyright rules. Amongst the ludicrous suggestions from the likes of Google is the claim that the shake-up will mean the end of memes, remixes and other user-generated content. Some have said that it will mean 'censorship' and even wildly predicted it will result in the 'death of the internet'. This is desperate and dishonest. Whilst some of the myths are repeated by people who remain blissfully untroubled by the technical but crucially important details of the proposed EU changes, in the worst cases this propaganda is being cynically pedalled by big tech like Google's YouTube with a huge vested and multi-million-pound interest in this battle.MEP Axel Voss, who was the EU Parliament Member who lead the charge on the Copyright Directive, and who has long been seen as being in the pocket of the copyright interests, even put out a press release[7] recently blaming the tech giants and their lobbying:After the vote, rapporteur Axel Voss (EPP, DE) said, 'I am very glad that despite the very strong lobbying campaign by the internet giants, there is now a majority in the full house backing the need to protect the principle of fair pay for European creatives.'There's been a lot more like that. On Twitter, whenever I talk about Article 13, the same crew that has been falsely attacking my views for years immediately start attacking me, claiming that it's all Google lobbying against Article 13. So... about that. The wonderful site Corporate Europe Observatory, has a very thorough and very in-depth write-up[8] about just who is lobbying on the EU Copyright Directive. And, quite incredibly, it's almost entirely dominated by all of those legacy copyright industries:Since November 2014 there were 765 declared encounters between lobbyists and the Commission with 'copyright' as a subject 1 Over 93% of these were with corporate interests, but the list of main actors might be quite surprising: the lobbyists with the highest access were in fact not big tech, but the collecting societies, creative industries (including big film and music studios) and press publishers. The most frequently listed names are: IFPI - Representing recording industry worldwide (37 meetings) whose members include SonyMusic and Warner Music, followed by the Federation of European Publishers (27) which represents national associations of book publishers, and GESAC - the European lobby for collecting societies (25), whose members include big EU collecting societies such as PRS for Music, the US giant recording label Universal Music Group International (22), and the Society of Audiovisual Authors (22), which represents national collecting societies. Of the top 20 lobbyists by meetings, only two represented tech interests - Google, ranking number seven, and one of the trade associations it belongs to, DIGITALEUROPE, ranking 18th - while one sole NGO, the independent consumer organisation BEUC, ranked 12th.The real story is even worse than that. Because I have abundant free time, I went through the file that Corporate Europe Observatory linked to detailing these lobbying meetings, and I went through all 205 entities and added up how many lobbying meetings were held by legacy entertainment interests, tech interests or public interests. Here's the breakdown:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/ela37a6While\">https://imgur.com/ela37a6While</url> Corporate Europe Observatory lists 765 meetings, their spreadsheet actually shows 784. Also, there were a few organizations/lobbyists/lawyers where it was not exactly clear who they were lobbying for or on what side of the debate. To be as fair as possible, I simply included all of the ones I was unsure of into the \"lobbying for tech\" list. So, uh, for all the talk that Google was the one lobbying here, over 80% of the lobbying efforts came from the legacy copyright industries. That's pretty stunning. Of course, it's also disappointing to see that only 6% of the lobbying came from civil society groups. As CEO notes:The voices of civil society organisations, small platforms, libraries, academics, citizens and even the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression were the collateral damage of the dispute between competing big business lobbies. Lobbyists and groups with a vested interest dominated the debate, while citizens' opinions and interests were crowded out of the discussion.Very depressing. For what it's worth, I included the \"small platform\" lobbying efforts in the \"tech\" list above (again, to be as careful as possible), but many of them view this issue even more strongly than Google, and are more focused on the public interest arguments. Anyway, that chart is just for lobbying the EU Commission. CEO looks at some other available data for lobbying the EU Parliament as well (tragically, not that much info is public), but based on what is public it comes to the same conclusion:Overall, the limited information which is available about lobby meetings shows the intense level of lobbying taking place on the Copyright Directive, but it also interestingly exposes that the biggest lobbies were not in fact big tech companies and their associates, as many headlines claimed, but the publishers, creative industries and collecting societies.Incredibly, the narrative that all the lobbying is coming from Google has caused EU regulators to flat out discount complaints from people warning about problems with the proposal, while treating petitions supporting the Directive very differently. For example, the CEO report notes that organizations supporting both sides of the Copyright Directive set up \"email your MEP campaigns,\" but the reaction to them was... let's just say, uneven.Email your MEP campaigns are a common tool used by civil society organisations who mobilise their communities and supporters to exercise their democratic rights to engage with their elected representatives. Identity verification standards vary according to the tool used, but in this case, it seems that the campaign did not require email verification. That means that technically speaking, people could lie and change their identity in those emails. De Cock explained that when they started the campaign they did not expect that so many people would participate, and so they themselves were surprised by the strength and impact of the campaign. But even then, can it really be labelled a denial of service attack? Such attacks are generally quite hostile, and aim to shut a website down completely. This is a remarkably different objective from that of an Email Your MEP campaign, which aims to ensure that MEPs are aware that there is popular support for certain causes and issues. Astoundingly, ALDE MEP Jean Marie Cavada even said in an interview: 'After having analyzed the platform from which all emails come, I realized that it does not require a valid email address from the 'users' to send emails. Thus, as sometimes we receive dozens of emails per minute, we can conceive that it is actually robots that send all these emails, which luckily makes this movement lose credibility.' Many MEPs simply wrote back to the senders to confirm their identity. De Cock, for instance, was then forwarded several of these exchanges between MEPs and their constituents. It seems Mr Cavada did not write back to the people who had contacted him. It is worth noting that PRS for Music also created a tool to email MEPs in advance of the vote, with the call to action: 'PRS Member - Take 90 seconds to influence the vote'. This tool did not even include a return address, and yet there were no claims that these emails were sent by bots. It is interesting that C4C seem to have been criticised simply because of the volume of emails, which arguably simply indicates the level of concern from constituents on the issue. However, both the C4C and PRS can be criticised for the loose use of internet tools to email MEPs.In other words, because so many more people used the tools to say that they were against Articles 11 and 13, at least some MEPs derided them as fake, while saying nothing about the many fewer people emailing in favor of those articles. Hmm. Oh, and what about that claim of $36 million spent lobbying by Google all against Article 13. Turns out that that number is also bullshit (and Billboard should really issue a retraction).That same week, immediately before the JURI committee vote, the UK Music Industry body published a press release stating that 'figures show Google's \u20ac31m EU lobbying bid' on copyright. UK Music simply took the entire lobby budget declared by Google in 2017, \u20ac6 million, and added to that the budgets of all the organisations and think tanks it is a member of, declaring that the 'The combined value of Google's indirect lobbying of the EU amounts to \u20ac25.5m'. This is a highly problematic and flawed interpretation of the Transparency Register. Google's entire self-declared lobby budget does make it one of the EU's highest spending lobby groups. However, only a portion of the declared \u20ac6 million would likely be spent on copyright, especially as Google is also fighting several other significant lobby battles in the EU (for example on the anti-trust law cases being brought against Android, digital tax, terrorist content, fake news etc). According to available meeting data, it looks like most of Google's lobby meetings were in fact on issues from the Copyright Directive, so it appears that this is not their priority at the moment. The \u20ac31 million figure also assumes that all the associations and think tanks of which Google is a member focused their entire declared EU lobby spending on copyright in 2017. That would include, for example, BusinessEurope, the EU employers' lobby, which are not necessarily active on the Copyright Directive, and if they are would only spend a marginal part of their budget on this issue. In most cases these groups (such as Friends of Europe, Konrad Adenauer-Stiftung, Bruegel etc) did little or nothing at all on the Copyright Directive, so these amounts should clearly not be included in the calculations.Incredibly, CEO reports that much of the lobbying effort... was focused on blaming Google for too much lobbying. No, really.In the copyright discussion, claims that GAFA, and particularly Google, were behind all opposition to Article 11 and 13 were again a strong message from publishers, and harder to counter. For instance, in the lobby newspaper produced by the news agencies, both the text from AFP's editor Katz, and the 'editorial', mention what they call deceptive lobbying. Katz wrote that the 'reform has been fiercely opposed by Facebook and Google, who have campaigned on a complete fabrication: a supposed threat to people's free access to the internet'. He even declared that 'I am convinced that the members of parliament who have been misled by deceptive lobbying now understand that non-paying access to the internet is not at risk.'So, let's be clear: there are lots of corporate interests at play here, and tragically, the voice of the public is getting drowned out. But if anyone claims that any of this process has been driven by the big tech firms, they are flat out lying. Don't let them get away with it.Permalink[9] | Comments[10] | Email This Story[11] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

To say he is elated about Judge <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Victor Marrero</emphasis>\u2019s ruling would be an understatement. </p><p>In a press release issued by T-Mobile and Sprint, which started with a celebratory \u201cSpoiler Alert: WE WON!\u201d, Legere wrote: \u201cLook out Dumb and Dumber and Big Cable \u2014 we are coming for you\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and you haven\u2019t seen anything yet!\u201d </p><p>Quick reminder that Dumb and Dumber (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AT&amp;T</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Verizon</emphasis>) and Big Cable (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Charter Communications</emphasis>) won\u2019t need to worry about Legere. He\u2019s got one foot out of the door. </p><p>In the 173-page opinion, available <url normalizedValue=\"https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/119/517350/127126363060.pdf\"> here</url>, Marrero said antitrust cases require judges to take on the role of fortune teller with \u201ccompeting crystal balls\u201d. He was convinced of two arguments put forward by the defence: that Sprint is too weak to survive on its own and that Dish can be a viable fourth competitor.</p><p>Marrero also said he deemed testimonies from T-Mobile and Sprint executives \u2014 who stand to make a lot of money from the deal \u2014 trustworthy and \u201cbelievable\u201d based on their \u201cmanifested personal and commercial ambition\u201d, \u201cstrength of character\u201d and \u201cresourcefulness and creativity\u201d. (More a judge of character than a competition case? Maybe.)</p><p>For all the \u201cimpressive titles\u201d and \u201ctomes\u201d that fill the CVs of the expert witnesses, Marrero said executives from both companies proved that the merger would have \u201cpro-competitive effects\u201d. </p><p>The ruling capped off an unusual trial in which Marrero had no interest in hearing opening arguments and openly cracked jokes in court. Spotting New York attorney-general <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Letitia James</emphasis> in the gallery, Marrero quipped that the US states had \u201cbrought out the big guns\u201d, and asked whether he should expect US attorney-general <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bill Barr</emphasis> to turn up. Spoiler alert: he didn\u2019t. </p><p>At least <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SoftBank</emphasis>\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Masayoshi Son</emphasis> can breathe a sigh of relief. The Japanese group would essentially have to bail Sprint out if the merger didn\u2019t go through. Although, Marrero couldn\u2019t quite see how:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cSoftBank\u2019s interest bearing debt is also roughly three times as large as its cash and equivalents, further drawing into question how readily it could pay off Sprint\u2019s debts as well.\u201d\u00a0</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Ultimately the states may have inadvertently helped T-Mobile strike a better deal. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis>-owned company is expected to renegotiate its merger with Sprint and the FT\u2019s Lex column thinks cost savings should be possible. </p><p>Shetty\u2019s situation: NMC\u2019s health crisis leaves KKR feeling burnt</p><p>On Monday <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NMC Health</emphasis> \u2014 a hospital operator whose stock is listed on London\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FTSE 100</emphasis> \u2014 put out two separate market statements. </p><p>One was that it had received approaches about a possible takeover from two bidders including the private equity group <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KKR</emphasis>. The other was more explosive. The company said that it had asked its founder to step back from the board. </p><p>To sum up a wordy explanation, it appears that the size of his stake in NMC was \u201cincorrectly reported\u201d. </p><p>It was the latest twist for a company that\u2019s faced a string of problems. NMC has lost about two-thirds of its value since a report by short-seller <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Muddy Waters</emphasis> in December raised questions over its finances and management.</p><p>The collapse in NMC\u2019s share price has diminished the wealth of its founder, the 77-year-old Indian businessman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BR Shetty</emphasis> (pictured above). Shetty rose from humble beginnings to become rich and famous. He bought two floors of Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest tower, according to this profile by the FT\u2019s Simeon Kerr. </p><p>The latest episode highlights the role of NMC\u2019s advisers \u2014 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barclays</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HSBC </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FTI Consulting </emphasis>\u2014 which didn\u2019t prevent the disclosure fiasco, according to our colleague Brooke Masters.</p><p>But all of this raised one other question: what on earth was KKR doing in the first place? </p><p>It seems whatever its intentions were, the buyout shop was not too pleased about being outed by the NMC statement on Monday. </p><p>Sure enough, KKR scrambled to retreat and on Tuesday put out an unusually strong response: it had \u201cnot made a proposal nor discussed with NMC the terms of any possible offer\u201d and \u201cdoes not intend to make an offer\u201d for the company.</p><p>There\u2019s a lesson in the NMC saga for everyone from regulators to retail investors. But KKR has learnt the hard way that looking for bargains in a situation full of fire is one way to get yourself burnt. </p><p>Payments companies: get big or die tryin\u2019</p><p>There are more deals to come in the payments sector, it\u2019s just a matter of when and who.</p><p>Last week <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Worldpay</emphasis> agreed to buy <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ingenico</emphasis>, its fellow French payments company, for $7.8bn. It comes on the back of a flood of payments deals in the past few years after <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIS</emphasis> acquired <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Worldpay</emphasis> for $43bn, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fiserv</emphasis> bought <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Data</emphasis> for $39bn and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Global Payments</emphasis> struck a $21.5bn deal with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TSYS</emphasis>. And those are just the big ones. </p><p>The payments business has a high fixed cost and low variable cost. Growth is high but margins are compressing. So: get big or die tryin\u2019.</p><p>Who is up next? Likely others in the fragmented European market. Insiders point to Italy\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nexi </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sia</emphasis>, the Netherlands\u2019 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adyen</emphasis> and Denmark\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nets </emphasis>as potential pieces of the puzzle.</p><p>Go deeper with the FT\u2019s Rob Armstrong and Nicholas Megaw here. </p><p>Job moves</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heineken</emphasis>\u2019s Europe president <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stefan Orlowski</emphasis> has quit after missing out on the top job to Asia Pacific chief Dolf van den Brink, who will replace current chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer</emphasis> in June. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inter Ikea</emphasis> has named its founder\u2019s former assistant Jon Abrahamsson Ring as chief executive to replace <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Torbjorn Loof</emphasis> who will step down after seven years.

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order seeking to crack down on social media companies after Twitter took the rare step this week of adding fact-checking labels to two of his tweets.A draft of the order, obtained by Business Insider, shows that the president is primarily seeking to empower federal regulators to re-interpret and tweak Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives social-media companies broad authority to moderate speech on their platforms. </p><p>Section 230 also stipulates that tech companies are largely not responsible for comments and other content that users post on their platforms.Trump's order calls for tech companies to lose their Section 230 protection if they do anything to discriminate against users, restrict their access to a platform without giving them a fair hearing, or take other action that isn't in line with the terms of service.The draft also says that within 30 days of its signing, the Secretary of Commerce should file a petition for rulemaking within the Federal Communications Commission for regulations that clarify the scope of Section 230.It says the head of each executive department and agency should review federal spending on advertising and marketing paid to online platforms. Additionally, the order directs the Federal Trade Commission to take action to prohibit \"deceptive or unfair practices,\" and allow people to complain if they think the companies are acting in a way that goes against their own rules and practices.\"As President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the Internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our businesses, our newspapers and our homes,\" the draft reads. \"In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey online.\"Jon Berroya, the interim president of the Internet Association, which represents dozens of technology platforms in Washington including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, criticized Trump's planned executive order as being \"designed to punish a handful of companies for perceived slights,\" adding that the document is \"inconsistent with the purpose and text of Section 230.\"\"It stands to undermine a variety of government efforts to protect public safety and spread critical information online through social media and threatens the vibrancy of a core segment of our economy,\" Berroya added. 'The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump, it does not protect Trump from Twitter' Legal and technology policy experts also told Business Insider that some sections of the draft executive order are not legal at all and other parts would require government agencies to throw out years of judicial interpretation of Section 230.\"It ignores 25 years of jurisprudence broadly interpreting Section 230,\" said Kate Klonick, a professor of internet law at St. John's University, who added that the draft order is mostly pandering to Trump's base of conservative voters who have come to believe internet platform companies are biased against them.\"It doesn't seem like it's enforceable. It will be smacked down relatively quickly by injunction or by litigation and the courts,\" Klonick said.Two of the agencies listed in the executive order, The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, are independent and enforcement of any executive order is ultimately up to them. Historically, the FCC has also had no authority to enforce Section 230.It's also doubtful the FCC will do what Trump is directing them to do, said Ashken Kazaryan, director of civil liberties at libertarian technology policy think tank Tech Freedom.\"Based on the track record of [FCC chairman] Ajit Pai, he has been lobbied to police speech many times and he has not succumbed to any of those pressures,\" she said. \"This is not how the Constitution works. The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump, it does not protect Trump from Twitter.\"But the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which is part of the Department of Commerce, is an executive branch agency and therefore more likely to carry out the president's orders.Adam Candeub, deputy assistant secretary at NTIA has also indicated that he's not a fan of Section 230 and has advocated for reforming it, writing in Forbes[2] last summer that the law \"protects Big Tech censorship in the U.S.\" The government can regulate some speech, but 'not the decisions of private actors' Trump's decision to issue an executive order threatening punishment against social-media giants was catalyzed by Twitter fact-checking his tweets in which he falsely claimed that mail-in ballots in California are \"substantially fraudulent\" and will result in a \"Rigged Election.\"Twitter's alert linked to a \"Moments\" page[3] titled \"Trump makes unsubstantiated claim that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud\" that listed a series of facts contradicting his claims.Specifically, the section pointed out that there is a dearth of evidence supporting the claim that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud; it also noted that only registered voters receive ballots and that multiple states in addition to California use mail-in ballots.On Wednesday, Twitter elaborated[4] on its decision to fact-check the president's tweets, writing, \"We added a label to two @realDonaldTrump Tweets about California's vote-by-mail plans as part of our efforts to enforce our civic integrity policy. We believe those Tweets could confuse voters about what they need to do to receive a ballot and participate in the election process.\"Trump, meanwhile, accused the social media platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election[5]\" and said he wouldn't allow Twitter to stifle free speech.\"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,\" Trump tweeted[6] on Wednesday morning. \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\"The president said his administration would take \"big action\" against the tech company.Trump  teased the executive order again in a Wednesday evening tweet, writing, \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\"Despite the president's threats, however, First Amendment experts say[7] he does not have the power to regulate or shut down social-media companies because he disagrees with them.\"What we mean when we say free speech and First Amendment rights is about what the government can regulate when it comes to speech, not the decisions of private actors,\" said Jennifer Huddleston, director of technology and innovation policy at the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. \"You do not want the government to step in and dictate what private platforms can do.\" Trump's threats are 'mostly bluster' Clay Calvert, a law professor at the University of Florida and director of the Marion B. Brechner First Amendment Project, told Business Insider that Trump has \"absolutely no legal authority\" under his executive-branch powers to unilaterally shut down a social-media platform \"simply because he disagrees with its policies for how it treats and now fact-checks his tweets.\"\"We have the First Amendment to protect the speech of private entities \u2014 Twitter being one of them \u2014 and individuals from government censorship, whether the censorship emanates from the legislative, executive, or judicial branch,\" Calvert added.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, told Business Insider in an earlier interview[8] that Trump's threats were \"mostly bluster\" and he was unlikely to be able to follow through on them.The president could issue executive orders like the one he signed on Thursday, try to push federal agencies to regulate Twitter, or ask Congress to pass legislation on the matter, \"but none will be fast or help him before November,\" Tobias added.That said, the role of social media companies in combatting the spread of misinformation will likely be a recurring issue in the run-up to the election.Indeed, just hours before Trump signed his executive order, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took aim at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, telling Fox News in an interview, \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\"Dorsey hit back at Zuckerberg, tweeting, \"We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.'\"He added: \"Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.\" Read the original article on Business Insider[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2019/06/12/to-protect-free-speech-reform-section-230-dont-put-it-into-the-usmca/#5fcbd2fb6ea2\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2019/06/12/to-protect-free-speech-reform-section-230-dont-put-it-into-the-usmca/#5fcbd2fb6ea2</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/i/events/1265330601034256384\">https://twitter.com/i/events/1265330601034256384</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1265838823663075341\">https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1265838823663075341</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-accuses-twitter-interfering-2020-race-voting-ballot-fact-check-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-accuses-twitter-interfering-2020-race-voting-ballot-fact-check-2020-5</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/can-trump-regulate-or-shut-down-twitter-facebook-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/can-trump-regulate-or-shut-down-twitter-facebook-2020-5</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-threatens-shut-down-platforms-after-tweets-tagged-warning-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-threatens-shut-down-platforms-after-tweets-tagged-warning-2020-5</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-executive-order-twitter-section-230-dead-on-arrival-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-executive-order-twitter-section-230-dead-on-arrival-2020-5</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN105645159068704819925876100180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600X-3DT1-JCMN-Y1MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1888\"/><timeReceived>5:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I take  pictures and videos of the kids. I make digital picture shows and movies. With  a daughter graduating from middle school this year, my wife recently asked me  to make a slideshow with photos of my daughter. My usual method is to use  Google Photos - because the fastest way to find photos of my daughter is to  search on her face using Google's amazing facial recognition technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facial recognition technology works by employing biometric  software to analyze a photo or video in order to create a map of an  individual's face, which can then be used to identify that person; however, not all uses of facial recognition  software are as innocent as a family slideshow. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, facial recognition technology has drawn increasing  scrutiny, as foreign governments use facial recognition to track ethnic  minorities, large retailers try to mitigate shoplifting, and domestic law  enforcement agencies control border access and support criminal investigations.  </p><p>As a former military and federal prosecutor, I want law  enforcement to have all the tools it needs to keep us safe; however, the  primary responsibility of any prosecutor is to pursue justice. When it comes to  the use of facial recognition technology, determining what is justified is an  evolving consideration. Recent events have heightened the attention on this  important technology while also giving regulators and private companies cause  for concern.</p><h>                    NIST Study  Causes Concern                </h><p>In a study  published in December 2019 by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST), facial technology algorithms were tested on a database of 18 million photos comprised of more than eight million people. Remarkably,  the study concluded that Asian, African American and Native American people were up to 100 times  more likely to be misidentified by facial recognition than white men. Women were more likely to be falsely  identified than men, and the elderly and children were more likely to be  misidentified than those in other age groups. Middle-aged white men generally  benefited from the highest accuracy rates. </p><p>         The NIST study was corroborative of previous studies -  which also found high error rates; however, the NIST study examined a wide  variety of technologies, and not all were beset with such high error rates. Nearly  200 algorithms were voluntarily submitted by nearly 100 private companies,  academic institutions and other developers. Some had sharply lower error rates  - suggesting that bias was not ubiquitous. Also, not every technology was  included in the study - because not every developer participated. Amazon's  cloud-based Rekognition technology, for example, was not offered for testing.        </p><p>This leaves open the criticism, asserted by some, that  the NIST study and previous studies are flawed because they used outdated algorithms  and/or did not properly deploy the technology. Nevertheless, the prominence  of the NIST study prompted concern among regulators and legislators. In the absence  of federal regulation, some local municipalities - particularly in California  and Massachusetts - banned the use of facial recognition by public officials. </p><p>In February 2020, two U.S. Senators introduced  legislation - the Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Act - demanding a temporary moratorium on the federal use of facial  recognition to protect the privacy of consumers from rapidly advancing facial  recognition technology and data collection practices that, according to the  sponsors, heighten the risk of over-surveillance and over-policing,  particularly in minority communities disproportionately impacted by the  technology.</p><p>In addition to halting federal use of facial recognition  technology, the legislation would prohibit the use of federal funds to be used  by state or local governments for investing in or purchasing the technology. The  bill includes limited exceptions for law enforcement use of facial recognition  pursuant to warrants issued by a court.</p><h>         Big Tech Joins In       </h><p>Although the federal legislation is since stalled, the recent  nationwide protests and the groundswell of support for social justice reform has  inspired renewed attention - including from some very powerful forces. </p><p>In early  June, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon announced that they were exiting the  facial recognition business or temporarily restricting its use by law  enforcement. </p><p>On June 8, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna sent a  letter to Congressional leaders stating that IBM had discontinued the use of  its facial recognition software and opposed the use of the technology for mass  surveillance, racial profiling, and other violations of basic human rights and  freedoms. IBM called on Congress to adopt a national policy to bring greater  transparency and accountability to policing.</p><p>Microsoft made a similar commitment,  stating, \"We will not sell facial recognition technology to police  departments in the United States until we have a national law in place, grounded  in human rights, that will govern this technology.\" </p><p>Similarly, Amazon announced a one-year ban on the use by police of its facial recognition software.</p><h>New York Passes State Surveillance Law       </h><p>Within days after the announcements by the big tech companies, the New York City Council on June 18 passed the Public Oversight of  Surveillance Technology Act (POST Act), which requires the NYPD to reveal  details on the facial recognition software, cellphone trackers and other  surveillance tools it uses to monitor people. </p><p>         In particular, the NYPD must: publicly describe its  arsenal of surveillance tools; disclose whether a court has authorized it to  use them; publicly post on its website rules regarding who can access its  surveillance technology; and identify which entities outside the NYPD,  including federal authorities, can access the data it collects.        </p><p>         Notably, the POST Act was first introduced in 2017, but  did not gain momentum until the recent nationwide protests.       </p><h>                    Facial Recognition is Not Going Away                </h><p>         Despite the initiatives by these powerful private and public forces, facial  recognition technology is not going away. The big tech companies are not permanently  discontinuing the development of these technologies; rather, they are calling  on Congress to implement appropriate regulation. In any event, these companies  are not the only purveyors of the technology. Other companies will fill the  void.       </p><p>         Discontinuing the use of facial recognition by federal law enforcement  agencies, such as the DEA and ICE, will be a challenge (and perhaps unwise). Congress  must also balance any regulatory initiatives prompted by recent events with the  critical goal of maintaining law and order and combating terrorism.        </p><p>For example, the 2005 REAL ID Act (anticipated to be fully implemented in  2021) requires all U.S. states and territories to verify that individuals have only  one government issued license. Rooted as a response to the events of 9/11, this  is a task predicated on collecting and sharing biometrics, including facial  recognition data. The requirements of that law cannot  readily be met without the robust use of facial recognition technology.</p><p>         Even amidst a global pandemic, researchers are crawling the internet for  photos of people wearing face masks to improve facial recognition algorithms. So,  yes, the technology will continue to evolve and continue to be used. The issue  is what role will Congress play, how will bias be mitigated, and can we balance  the goals of law enforcement and public safety with the rights of all of our  citizens.        </p><p>         Meanwhile, as this issue is debated, I will still be making those picture  slideshows of my kids - putting facial recognition to use to commemorate the  important events of my life. If only all such uses of the technology were as  easy.       </p><p>Timothy J.

The order could be signed as soon as Thursday, and the draft, which refers to what it calls \u201cselective censoring,\u201d would allow the Commerce Department to try to refocus how broadly Section 230 is applied.</p><p>Here is an explanation of the law\u2019s history, why it has been so consequential and whether it is really in jeopardy.</p><p>So why was the law created?</p><p>We can thank \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d</p><p>Stratton Oakmont, a brokerage firm, sued Prodigy Services, an internet service provider, for defamation in the 1990s. Stratton was founded by Jordan Belfort, who was convicted of securities fraud and was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Martin Scorsese film about financial excess. An anonymous user wrote on Prodigy\u2019s online message board that the brokerage had engaged in criminal and fraudulent acts.</p><p>The New York Supreme Court ruled that Prodigy was \u201ca publisher\u201d and therefore liable because it had exercised editorial control by moderating some posts and establishing guidelines for impermissible content. If Prodigy had not done any moderation, it might have been granted free speech protections afforded to some distributors of content, like bookstores and newsstands.</p><p>The ruling caught the attention of a pair of congressmen, Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and Christopher Cox, a Republican from California. They were worried the decision would act as a disincentive for websites to take steps to block pornography and other obscene content.</p><p>The Section 230 amendment was folded into the Communications Decency Act, an attempt to regulate indecent material on the internet, without much opposition or debate. A year after it was passed, the Supreme Court declared that the indecency provisions were a violation of First Amendment rights. But it left Section 230 in place.</p><p>Since it became law, the courts have repeatedly sided with internet companies, invoking a broad interpretation of immunity.</p><p>Last July, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a lower court\u2019s ruling that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">Facebook was not liable</url> for violent attacks coordinated and encouraged by Facebook accounts linked to Hamas, the militant Islamist group. In the majority opinion, the court said Section 230 \u201cshould be construed broadly in favor of immunity.\u201d</p><p>Why is the law so consequential?</p><p>Section 230 has allowed the modern internet to flourish. Sites can moderate content \u2014 set their own rules for what is and what is not allowed \u2014 without being liable for everything posted by visitors.</p><p>Whenever there is discussion of repealing or modifying the statute, its defenders, including many technology companies, argue that any alteration could cripple online discussion.</p><p>The internet industry has a financial incentive to keep Section 230 intact. The law has helped build companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars with a lucrative business model of placing ads next to largely free content from visitors.</p><p>That applies to more than social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Wikipedia and Reddit depend on its visitors to sustain the sites, while Yelp and Amazon count on reviews for businesses and products.</p><p>More recently, Section 230 has also provided legal cover for the complicated decisions regarding content moderation. Facebook and Twitter have recently cited it to defend themselves in court when users have sued after being barred from the platforms.</p><p>Many cases are quickly dismissed because companies assert they have the right to make decisions on content moderation as they see fit under the law.</p><p>What are the problems with the law?</p><p>The criticisms of Section 230 vary. While both Republicans and Democrats are threatening to make changes, they disagree on why.</p><p>Some Republicans have argued that tech companies should no longer enjoy the protections because they have censored conservatives and thereby violated the spirit of the law, which states that the internet should be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">\u201ca forum for a true diversity of political discourse.\u201d</url></p><p>Facebook, Twitter and Google, which runs YouTube, which are the main targets for bias claims, have said they are baseless.</p><p>On the flip side, some Democrats have argued that small and large internet sites aren\u2019t serious about taking down problematic content or tackling harassment because they are shielded by Section 230.</p><p>Mr. Wyden, now a senator, said the law had been written to provide \u201ca sword and a shield\u201d for internet companies. The shield is the liability protection for user content, but the sword was meant to allow companies to keep out \u201coffensive materials.\u201d</p><p>However, he said firms had not done enough to keep \u201cslime\u201d off their sites. In an interview with The New York Times last year, Mr. Wyden said he had recently told tech workers at a conference on content moderation that if \u201cyou don\u2019t use the sword, there are going to be people coming for your shield.\u201d</p><p>There is also a concern that the law\u2019s immunity is too sweeping. Websites trading in revenge pornography, hate speech or personal information to harass people online receive the same immunity as sites like Wikipedia.</p><p>\u201cIt gives immunity to people who do not earn it and are not worthy of it,\u201d said Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University who has written extensively about the statute.</p><p>Is Section 230 in jeopardy?</p><p>The first blow came in 2018 with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">the signing of a law</url> that creates an exception in Section 230 for websites that knowingly assist, facilitate or support sex trafficking. Critics of the new law said it opened the door to create other exceptions and would ultimately render Section 230 meaningless.</p><p>Ms. Citron, who is also vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit devoted to combating online abuse, said this was \u201ca moment of re-examination.\u201d After years of pressing for changes, she said there was more political will to modify Section 230.</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri and a frequent critic of technology companies, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">introduced a bill</url> last June that would eliminate the immunity under the law unless tech companies submitted to an external audit that their content moderation practices were politically neutral.</p><p>While there is growing political will to do something about Section 230, finding a middle ground on potential changes is a challenge.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got here just a few months ago, everybody said 230 was totally off the table, but now there are folks coming forward saying this isn\u2019t working the way it was supposed to work,\u201d said Mr. Hawley, who took office in January 2019. </p><p>PHOTO: On Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a lower court\u2019s ruling that Facebook was not liable for violent attacks coordinated and encouraged by Facebook accounts linked to Hamas.

The First Amendment, not Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, protects it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the most consequential law governing speech on the internet was created in 1996, Google.com didn't exist and Mark Zuckerberg was 11 years old.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The federal law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has helped Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and countless other internet companies flourish.</p><p>But Section 230's liability protection also extends to fringe sites known for hosting hate speech, anti-Semitic content and racist tropes like 8chan, the internet message board where the suspect in the El Paso shooting massacre posted his manifesto.</p><p>The First Amendment protects free speech, including hate speech, but Section 230 shields websites from liability for content created by their users. It permits internet companies to moderate their sites without being on the hook legally for everything they host. It does not provide blanket protection from legal responsibility for some criminal acts, like posting child pornography or violations of intellectual property.</p><p>Now, as scrutiny of big technology companies has intensified in Washington over a wide variety of issues, including how they handle the spread of disinformation or police hate speech, lawmakers are questioning whether Section 230 should be changed.</p><p>Last month, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said in a hearing about Google and censorship that the law was \"a subsidy, a perk\" for big tech that may need to be reconsidered. In an April interview, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California called Section 230 a \"gift\" to tech companies \"that could be removed.\"</p><p>\"There is definitely more attention being paid to Section 230 than at any time in its history,\" said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the United States Naval Academy and the author of a book about the law, \"The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet.\"</p><p>\"There is an inclination to look at Section 230 as one lever to influence the tech companies,\" he said.</p><p>Here is an explanation of the law's history, why it has been so consequential and whether it is really in jeopardy.</p><p>So why was the law created?</p><p>We can thank \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"</p><p>Stratton Oakmont, a brokerage firm, sued Prodigy Services, an internet service provider, for defamation in the 1990s. Stratton was founded by Jordan Belfort, who was convicted of securities fraud and was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Martin Scorsese film about financial excess. An anonymous user wrote on Prodigy's online message board that the brokerage had engaged in criminal and fraudulent acts.</p><p>The New York Supreme Court ruled that Prodigy was \"a publisher\" and therefore liable because it had exercised editorial control by moderating some posts and establishing guidelines for impermissible content. If Prodigy had not done any moderation, it might have been granted free speech protections afforded to some distributors of content, like bookstores and newsstands.</p><p>The ruling caught the attention of a pair of congressmen, Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and Christopher Cox, a Republican from California. They were worried the decision would act as a disincentive for websites to take steps to block pornography and other obscene content.</p><p>The Section 230 amendment was folded into the Communications Decency Act, an attempt to regulate indecent material on the internet, without much opposition or debate. A year after it was passed, the Supreme Court declared that the indecency provisions were a violation of First Amendment rights. But it left Section 230 in place.</p><p>Since it became law, the courts have repeatedly sided with internet companies, invoking a broad interpretation of immunity.</p><p>On Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a lower court's ruling that Facebook was not liable for violent attacks coordinated and encouraged by Facebook accounts linked to Hamas, the militant Islamist group. In the majority opinion, the court said Section 230 \"should be construed broadly in favor of immunity.\"</p><p>Why is the law so consequential?</p><p>Section 230 has allowed the modern internet to flourish. Sites can moderate content - set their own rules for what is and what is not allowed - without being liable for everything posted by visitors.</p><p>Whenever there is discussion of repealing or modifying the statute, its defenders, including many technology companies, argue that any alteration could cripple online discussion.</p><p>The internet industry has a financial incentive to keep Section 230 intact. The law has helped build companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars with a lucrative business model of placing ads next to largely free content from visitors.</p><p>That applies to more than social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Wikipedia and Reddit depend on its visitors to sustain the sites, while Yelp and Amazon count on reviews for businesses and products.</p><p>More recently, Section 230 has also provided legal cover for the complicated decisions regarding content moderation. Facebook and Twitter have recently cited it to defend themselves in court when users have sued after being barred from the platforms.</p><p>Many cases are quickly dismissed because companies assert they have the right to make decisions on content moderation as they see fit under the law.</p><p>What are the problems with the law?</p><p>The criticisms of Section 230 vary. While both Republicans and Democrats are threatening to make changes, they disagree on why.</p><p>Some Republicans have argued that tech companies should no longer enjoy the protections because they have censored conservatives and thereby violated the spirit of the law, which states that the internet should be \"a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.\"</p><p>Facebook, Twitter and Google, which runs YouTube, which are the main targets for bias claims, have said they are baseless.</p><p>On the flip side, some Democrats have argued that small and large internet sites aren't serious about taking down problematic content or tackling harassment because they are shielded by Section 230.</p><p>Mr. Wyden, now a senator, said the law had been written to provide \"a sword and a shield\" for internet companies. The shield is the liability protection for user content, but the sword was meant to allow companies to keep out \"offensive materials.\"</p><p>However, he said firms had not done enough to keep \"slime\" off their sites. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Wyden said he had recently told tech workers at a conference on content moderation that if \"you don't use the sword, there are going to be people coming for your shield.\"</p><p>There is also a concern that the law's immunity is too sweeping. Websites trading in revenge pornography, hate speech or personal information to harass people online receive the same immunity as sites like Wikipedia.</p><p>\"It gives immunity to people who do not earn it and are not worthy of it,\" said Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University who has written extensively about the statute.</p><p>Is Section 230 in jeopardy?</p><p>The first blow came last year with the signing of a law that creates an exception in Section 230 for websites that knowingly assist, facilitate or support sex trafficking. Critics of the new law said it opened the door to create other exceptions and would ultimately render Section 230 meaningless.</p><p>Ms. Citron, who is also vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit devoted to combating online abuse, said this was \"a moment of re-examination.\" After years of pressing for changes, she said there was more political will to modify Section 230.</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri and a frequent critic of technology companies, introduced a bill in June that would eliminate the immunity under the law unless tech companies submitted to an external audit that their content moderation practices were politically neutral.</p><p>While there is growing political will to do something about Section 230, finding a middle ground on potential changes is a challenge.</p><p>\"When I got here just a few months ago, everybody said 230 was totally off the table, but now there are folks coming forward saying this isn't working the way it was supposed to work,\" said Mr. Hawley, who took office in January. \"The world in 2019 is very different from the world of the 1990s, especially in this space, and we need to keep pace.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006643385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS0-MBW1-DYR7-C29F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 8, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

NPR's Brian Naylor reports.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIAN NAYLOR:                 For years, the big tech companies have been given a pretty free rein in Washington to act as they chose. What oversight of the industry there was by Congress focused on whether there was political bias on various platforms. But with Democrats now in the majority in the House, that's changing. Representative Jan Schakowsky is a Democrat from Illinois. She says self-regulation by the tech industry hasn't worked.             </p><p>JAN SCHAKOWSKY:                 In the last two weeks alone, we learned that Facebook exposed individuals' private health information that the consumers thought was in a protected closed group and collected data from third party app developers on issues as personal as women's menstrual cycles and cancer treatment.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 Schakowsky says privacy is among the first tech issues lawmakers should address.             </p><p>JAN SCHAKOWSKY:                 We believe that there ought to be some legislation that sets the terms on privacy. And I think what consumers really want is transparency. They want to know what's actually being collected. They want some control, and then they want some accountability.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 There aren't many issues in Congress with bipartisan support these days, but the need for stricter privacy rules for tech companies is one. Republicans agree that it's time to put some limits on the big tech companies' use of people's data. Oregon Republican Greg Walden is the top GOP member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.             </p><p>GREG WALDEN:                 I've not met a single American who has ever fully read the fine print of some sort of agreement when you download an app or get an update. You know, you're going to update it. And you're going to push agree. And you're not reading the privacy policy of that company. And the question is, do they even follow their own privacy policies or are the privacy policies adequate?             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 Walden, though, wants to make sure that whatever steps Congress takes to enact privacy regulations will supersede any measures enacted by the states. California has already approved its own strict privacy legislation.             </p><p>                Dave Grimaldi of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, which represents Facebook, Amazon and Google, all of which are funders of NPR, says the tech industry is willing to go along with new privacy regulations. But he says the industry can't navigate 50 different laws, nor could consumers.             </p><p>DAVE GRIMALDI:                 The Internet is global. It's most certainly national, goes over state lines. And I think that changing or altering the Internet experience state to state would be something that would be a giant turnoff to consumers and just wouldn't help anyone.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 The tech companies are facing a challenge on another front too - the Federal Trade Commission announced a task force to take a look at recent mergers. It's a step Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center says is long overdue.             </p><p>MARC ROTENBERG:                 I think they probably should have set up that task force more than a decade ago. That was around the time they were approving the mergers that allowed, for example, Google to acquire DoubleClick, the big Internet advertising firm, or Facebook to acquire WhatsApp, which was a competing messaging service. Those deals should have been subject to much more scrutiny than they were at the time.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 Meanwhile, House and Senate committees each have hearings set for tomorrow on the privacy issue.
