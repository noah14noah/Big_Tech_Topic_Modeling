Thirty-eight per cent of all the unicorns in Europe are in the UK and 30pc of the 'futurecorns' [companies with potential to exceed $1bn in valuation] worth $50m to $800m are here.</p><p>\"So not only is the UK light years ahead of the rest of Europe and Israel, across every dimension, even in the last five years its lead has just been accelerating.\"</p><p>Klein, whose father Robin is also a venture capitalist and a venture partner at Index Ventures, adds: \"So the real comparison is regional cities in the UK compared to capital cities in Europe. Right? So Oxbridge has nine, Berlin has 10. Manchester has five. Amsterdam has six.\"</p><p>According to KPMG, London ranks third in the world as a technology innovation hub while the UK as a whole ranks fourth behind the US, China and India.</p><p>The fertile tech scene represents a huge contrast to 17 years ago, when Klein returned to the UK from a spell living in Boston and Seattle, where he experienced the first dotcom investment boom - and its subsequent bust in 2000 to 2001.</p><p>\"When I came back to the UK in 2002, there wasn't much of an ecosystem to speak of - or at least it was very, very nascent,\" he says. \"Most people were kind of dancing on the grave of the internet, like 'stupid kids - we knew they were full of s--t. Thank God they're gone'.\"</p><p>A Cambridge University graduate - who studied English literature not computer science - Klein has arguably surfed the wave of the UK's technology boom more successfully than anyone else has.</p><p>His first big success came after an early investment in Skype, the video chat service, which was sold to eBay for $4.2bn in 2005. \"That also made me realise that you could build a global winner from the UK and Europe, because Skype was global. You could build a company that someone else put an extraordinary value on - $4.2bn, which even in today's money is a very decent exit, but in 2005 it was really big.\"</p><p>He says it was the alumni from Skype as well as LoveFilm and a string of other early London-based start-up success stories who have gone on to found a new generation of companies and have fuelled the industry's growth.</p><p>As in Silicon Valley, the UK now has a significant pool of talent to draw from with experience of building tech start-ups, helping to fuel a virtuous circle of new company formation, especially when founders exit and recycle the proceeds into fresh companies.</p><p>He says more than 50,000 people in the UK have now had experience of working for a technology \"unicorn\" and 2m work for tech companies while about a million job openings exist in the industry.</p><p>What about the impact of Brexit on confidence in the UK? Klein shrugs and looks relaxed: \"The referendum vote was on June 23 2016. You know, the amount of venture capital coming into the market the year after that increased.</p><p>The amount of venture capital coming in the year after that increased and the year after that it increased again.\"</p><p>Warming to his theme, he continues: \"So quite frankly, whatever the political weather, the UK's strength now lies in an ecosystem it's taken 20 years to build, that now has a disproportionate supply of venture capital, a disproportionate supply of unicorns, futurecorns and exited unicorns.\"</p><p>French and German efforts to lure start-ups across the Channel simply will not change this fundamental reality, he says.</p><p>\"A couple of years ago at the height of Macron and Merkel, there was a lot of 'Come to Paris, come to Berlin'. In the UK, we weren't playing to our strengths and the strength really is the facts. You know, we're not throwing in lunch at the Elysee Palace.</p><p>\"It's the facts: Paris is Oxbridge, when it comes to unicorns. London's on another planet. This is a network effects industry where the ecosystems really, really matter.\"</p><p>So what should the UK aim to do next - and how can it build on its record of success in a future outside the EU? Klein, who is also a non-executive at Kano Computing, the chairman of Seedcamp, a board member at both MyHeritage and Mind Candy, and a trustee at Comic Relief, believes a clear opportunity exists for the UK to adopt a leadership position.</p><p>\"The area where the UK can and always has punched above its weight is in terms of value systems - rule of law, democracy, governance,\" he says, stressing that traditionally this is not a field where either the US or China has excelled.</p><p>The UK and London has a 500-year track record. We've had our ups and downs but generally the UK is globally recognised as pretty good at governance. So we're now moving into an era where the governance of technology is maybe more fundamental than the technology itself.\"</p><p>He believes the UK has an enormous opportunity to influence and establish governance norms for technology that could have a global impact. \"We're in a moment in history where people are crying out for some structure.\"</p><p>That's why he believes the UK should spearhead the global push to create a regulatory framework for Big Tech - an area in which it is already leading the way with publication of the Government's Online Harms White Paper.</p><p>The creation of a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation is another step in the right direction, Klein says. \"Where do we want to be number one? I would say values.\"</p><p>And how should the UK technology industry view the country's new government - and an end to more than three years of political uncertainty? \"For me, it's very simple. Just get back on the front foot, which I think people already starting to do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Saul Klein, of venture capital business LocalGlobe, says the UK is in an 'incredibly strong' tech positionFirms clustered around London's Silicon Roundabout are a core part of the burgeoning UK technology scene that is outstripping other European countriesCHRIS RATCLIFFE/BLOOMBERG/GEOFF PUGH</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-155841930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSP-DMC1-DYTY-C01R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1158\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002MJ2</classCode><className>KPMG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

The first involves whether Amazon has too large a piece of the e-commerce business in the United States. The more recent involves its leadership in cloud computing. </p><p>This sort of investigation inevitably leads to what plans the government may have as a solution if Amazon's dominance is judged to hinder market competiveness. The ready answer for this, and similar probes into Google and Facebook, is that a solution could look like the breakup of AT...n 1984. The FTC is not the only threat to Amazon. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon to be broken up[2] immediately. Her reason: 'Today's big tech companies have too much power\u2014too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else.' While she has a long way to go to ever be in a position to do anything about her plan, she has kept the Amazon issue on the front pages. The most obvious case against Amazon is that its rise has permanently damaged the brick-and-mortar retail sector. None of the traditional retailers has been able to create a presence online to compete effectively with Amazon in e-commerce. Among the most visible examples of this is an event Amazon stages once a year. Prime Day, which lasted 48 hours starting at 3 a.m. ET July 15, is an example of Amazon's leverage. Amazon offered over a million products during the short period, blitzing the rest of the retail industry in the process. No other retailer has the ability to stage an event that has even close to this impact. That is, in part, because Amazon has over 100 million Prime members. These Prime members are tethered to Amazon by free shipping packages and its streaming service. Research has shown that Prime members are much more likely to shop on Amazon than people who are not a part of the program. The size of Amazon's e-commerce operation is extraordinary. It holds huge market share and, as mentioned, has contributed to the decline of brick-and-mortar retailers. That, in turn, has triggered the loss of tens of thousands of American jobs, many industry analysts and economists say. E-commerce continues to be Amazon's largest operation. The company posted total revenue of $233 billion in 2018. Of this, its North American e-commerce business contributed $141 billion. Its international business added $66 billion. E-commerce is only the first of the three parts that constitute the operations of Amazon. Amazon is also the world's leader in cloud computing, one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. It is the top provider of global cloud services by far. Its share of the public cloud business was recently put a 62%, followed by Microsoft at 20% and Google at 12%. The cloud division of Amazon is called Amazon Web Services (AWS). It had revenue of almost $26 billion last year and made just more than $7 billion, for an impressive 27% operating profit margin. AWS is the second part of Amazon that could be spun out into a separate company.The revenue for Amazon's third large and another dominant business is rolled into its e-commerce operations, so financially, it is hard to break out. Amazon has a consumer electronics business that, among other things, dominates the market for artificial intelligence products that consumers use in their homes. Amazon also sells computers, e-readers and streaming media hardware. Amazon's Alexa software voice-activated features can control home entertainment, communications, shopping and smart home services, including temperature control and light bulbs and cameras. Estimates are that Amazon has 75% of the smart speaker market. It is almost certain to move these products into the commercial sector soon. Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich argues that the three companies (Amazon, Google, Facebook) could be regulated. Or, he further explains, 'A better alternative is to break them up. That way, the information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.' One part of the debate about Amazon that is often left out is its effect on the overall U.S. economy. Like other mammoth tech corporations, Amazon is among the most profitable companies in the United States and the world, and as such, it can pay its employees very high salaries \u2014 these are America's highest-paying companies[3].  24/7 Wall St. Why Merrill Lynch Value 10 Stocks May Be the Best Bets for2020 <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/12/05/why-merrill-lynch-value-10-stocks-may-be-the-best-bets-for-2020/\">https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/12/05/why-merrill-lynch-value-10-stocks-may-be-the-best-bets-for-2020/</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/disclaimer-and-terms-of-use\">https://247wallst.com/disclaimer-and-terms-of-use</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/amazon-faces-widening-u-s-antitrust-scrutiny-in-cloud-business\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/amazon-faces-widening-u-s-antitrust-scrutiny-in-cloud-business</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/02/senator-elizabeth-warren-says-its-time-to-break-up-amazon-google-and-facebook-and-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-fights-back/#288ef4436791\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/02/senator-elizabeth-warren-says-its-time-to-break-up-amazon-google-and-facebook-and-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-fights-back/#288ef4436791</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2019/04/16/americas-highest-paying-companies-3/\">https://247wallst.com/special-report/2019/04/16/americas-highest-paying-companies-3/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TFS100006157556404684025876100058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TFS-5001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNK-D9M1-F03R-N4MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><timeReceived>4:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>24/7 Wall St.</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

But are they really? Sure, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, a piece of legislation forged in the crucible of the Korean War to mobilize private industry for arms production. But he still refuses[2] to use the act systematically instead of haphazardly to order production of scarce and essential medical equipment. Trump has also joined French President Emmanuel Macron[3], German Chancellor Angela Merkel[4], and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson[5] in their use of wartime rhetoric. </p><p>Calls for collective solidarity or a general mobilization of society are unprecedented since the days of World War II; the glorification[6] of emergency workers as 'heroes,' the framing of general citizens as 'warriors,' and Trump's escalation of anti-immigration policy resemble wartime propaganda. All this rhetoric seeks to fortify the population to bear the sacrifices required of them to fight the pandemic. The problem now is that the propaganda is not being paired with true wartime leadership. A genuine war against COVID-19 would not look like the hands-off, conservative, and woefully inadequate response of the Trump administration. It is high time for the government to mobilize and coordinate all of its national resources to fight the pandemic and mitigate the shutdown's socioeconomic costs. There is no better policy template than the war economies of the last century. In a strange sense, it's precisely the current shutdown of large parts of the national and global economy that beckons the analogy to wartime economic organization. Selective suppression of economic activity is fundamental to war economies. The reallocation of capital, raw materials, and people to factories for military-industrial production and to the front lines required a deliberate demobilization of civilian economies in both World War I and World War II. Car manufacturers, such as Renault in France and Ford in the United States, stopped mass-producing automobiles and began turning out tanks. Comprehensive rationing also forced civilians to spend less on consumer goods. This suppression of the consumer economy increased household savings and encouraged the purchase of war bonds. In Nazi Germany, where the war economy[7] was arguably taken furthest, the Reich economic ministry and Reichsbank devised a sophisticated system[8] of 'silent war finance' (geruschlose Kriegsfinanzierung) as an alternative to raising taxes. Extreme rationing forced households to deposit their surplus savings in local banks. The banks then invested the surplus in government bonds and other debt instruments to finance rearmament. But if current shutdown policies do not disqualify the war economy model, there is a more urgent reason to embrace it more fully. The United States is suffering the costs of an unprecedented demobilization of the civilian economy, without the remobilization necessary to win the battle against COVID-19. Unemployment claims have hit record highs[9], unmatched since the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve reported[10] a whopping drop of 5.4 percent in total industrial production in March, the largest since 1946. The automotive industry has been hit hardest, as all major factories have shut down[11] across the nation. But the U.S. government is not organizing\u2014neither directly through mass purchasing and mass production, nor indirectly through mass investment and partnership with private business\u2014any national reallocation of capital, labor, and vital materials toward the health care economy: the front-line sector. Trump's symbolic[12] invocation of the Defense Production Act plus the issue of a one-time $1,200 stimulus check to eligible U.S. residents and his pretensions of being a 'wartime president[13]' do not come close to a war economy. Just contrast that with the steps taken by the United States upon entering World War II, when the War Production Board gave the federal government powers to order procurement and production of armaments. This included the authority[14] to organize the supply of vital raw materials. Until the United States sees a similar kind of government mobilization of the economy, its present crisis may never end. Select industries that have closed shop should be systematically incentivized to produce test kits, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and, when the time comes, vaccines. Production and wage subsidies, tax deductions, and guaranteed government contracts could all encourage this conversion. Instead, conversion of existing industries has only occurred voluntarily and haphazardly. Without this remobilization, infection rates[15] will continue to soar. Dire shortages of medical supplies will continue to delay the conditions for a sound reopening. The United States currently faces the costs of an incomplete war economy, without its benefits. Hoarding, profiteering, shortages, inflationary pressures[16], business concentration, depleted morale, curtailment of civil liberties, sharpened inequalities, and increasing protests have become fixtures of our pandemic society. These are classic pathologies of a war economy. The shutdown has already become unbearable for those suffering its greatest economic hardships. Popular protests pressuring authorities to reopen before it is safe to do so are perhaps already becoming irresistible. Yet despite all their leaders' war rhetoric, virtually no OECD government has adopted signatory war measures to mitigate the crisis. Neither price controls nor rationing has been introduced. The price of N95 masks in the United States has jumped[17] at least sixfold from $1 to $6 apiece. In Europe, it easily surpasses 10 euros, nearly $11. To combat rocketing price inflation and mitigate scarcities during World War II, the United States joined other belligerents in creating a price control agency, the Office of Price Administration, which set maximum price and wage regulations. Panicked hoarding[18] of essential medical products and foodstuffs is now contributing to critical shortages and price-gouging. France has made the first move to impose price ceilings on surgical masks (capped at 0.95 euros[19]) after mounting calls from the political opposition. Such interventions have remained off the table in the United States. Rationing in both world wars had two purposes: to manage real shortages and to establish a sense of fairness and mitigate discontent among those who suffered disproportionate economic hardship. Without an overall policy, grocery stores, distributors, and producers have taken the initiative to implement their own quotas[20] on the sale of staple foods. This haphazard approach to rationing not only is inefficient, but it also risks fueling popular discontent and encouraging further supply chain imbalances. Corporate excess profit taxes may also be called for. Studies[21] confirm[22] that the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating[23] economic inequalities. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany all began taxing what they defined as excess profits at the end of World War I. They did so again in World War II. This helped to allay popular outcries against profiteers and speculators who enriched themselves from the wars. The measures helped promote a sense of fairness by redistributing some of the war's unequal sacrifices, while also raising[24] needed government revenue. Although most companies are suffering severe losses under the pandemic, a few are racking in massive gains. Big business\u2014and big tech first of all\u2014has expanded its market power as brick-and-mortar shops across the nation go under. Amazon's share price has risen[25] 30 percent this year, and sales soared[26] by 50 percent in March. Meanwhile, Standard &amp;#38; Poor's 500 index reported one of its strongest monthly returns[27] in April since 1987, though the market dipped again in May. In a true war economy, the government would step in to attenuate these growing inequalities, arrest rising monopoly power (by directing perhaps more bailouts to small and medium sized business), and manage distributional conflicts to maintain popular morale. We should not be fooled by Trump's high-minded rhetoric[28] of being at war against an 'invisible enemy.' He may certainly be waging a war against immigrants and threatening war with China and Iran. But this is to distract Americans from the economic war his administration refuses to wage. Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis will require a version of wartime mobilization led by government coordination of the national economy. A reorientation toward productivity-enhancing policies that also redistribute the costs and benefits of the shutdown in a more egalitarian way are essential to sustaining the fight against this virus. Unfortunately, a Republican government ideologically hostile to state intervention in the economy may prefer only to preach the urgency of war. A rising death toll, galloping inequalities, more monopoly power, mounting protests, and potential revolt all await inaction.

But it has since become a monopolistic juggernaut with the ability to censor information and radically affect countless American small businesses at a whim.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I work for one of those small businesses. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nativ3.io/\">Nativ3</url> is a full-service web development and digital marketing agency based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I run our office in Washington, DC and all of our business development. Our gritty team of 11 works long hours to ensure our clients feel at home in the digital space and are well-equipped to operate within it.</p><p>There are tens of thousands of small businesses like ours - yet none of us have the expansive representation Facebook retains (both formally and informally) in Washington. Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/how-much-google-facebook-amazon-and-apple-spent-on-lobbying-in-2019.html\">spent $16.7 million</url> on direct lobbying in 2019, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90424503/facebook-google-amazon-are-ramping-up-their-secretive-influence-campaigns-in-dc\">countless millions more on direct donations</url> to conservative policy shops like AEI, CEI, Cato, Heritage and the State Policy Network. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/08/rachel-bovard-donald-trump-tech-protections/\">(RELATED: Trump's Order Ignites Overdue Debate On Big Tech Protections)</url></emphasis></p><p>Facebook leverages these massive donations and sponsorships to \u201cfree-market\u201d policy shops that will push policies that improve Facebook's bottom line, like leaving content moderation unregulated and allowing Facebook to determine what is and isn't in the public interest to have on their platform.</p><p>Groups like the Cato Institute and AEI have gone as far as to host policy events with Facebook and Google employees as panelists, frequently with <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/facebook-google-donate-heavily-to-privacy-advocacy-groups\">Big Tech companies splitting the bill</url>. Such was the case when deregulation advocate Pat Hedger was <url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/power/washington-left-flocks-to-google-policy-conference/\">caught attending an all-expenses-paid conference</url> at a swanky Silicon Valley hotel with rooms at over $500 per night.</p><p>It's rare that any of these advocates have worked in the digital space. Most of their unremarkable careers consist of bouncing from highly-paid think tank job to think tank job. The only distinguishing factor about them is they're a willful shill for greedy corporatists in Silicon Valley.</p><p>And what are they using their massive influence in Washington for? While Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly advocates for light regulation, Facebook's army of willing servants heavily encourage complete deregulation of the tech sector, arguing that to do otherwise is \u201can infringement on freedom of speech.\u201d</p><p>The problem is, Facebook is a monopoly that has surpassed the might of government to protect free speech. There has never been a single company in world history that had the trove of information that Facebook currently possesses. Even the world's largest newspaper, The New York Times, has two million subscribers, 2% of Facebook's one billion users. This isn't even counting the fact that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50838013\">Facebook owns four out of the five tech companies</url> that have over one billion users.</p><p>When a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/16/facts-about-americans-and-facebook/#:~:text=Around%20four%2Din%2Dten%20U.S.%20adults%20(43%25)%20get,6%25)%20and%20other%20platforms.\">plurality of Americans get their news from Facebook</url>, it presents a major problem.</p><p>The American Principles Project (APP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocating for the family in politics, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/18/politifact-disqualifies-itself-in-debate-over-ad-on-girls-sports/\">was censored by Facebook</url> when they attempted to spend $4 million on a Facebook ad in Michigan. They were immediately fact-checked and Facebook told APP's intended audience that their ad was \u201cmissing context,\u201d though everything in the ad was true.</p><p>When you have a monopoly on information, you control reality.</p><p>And Facebook does. It manages a faceless bureaucracy of content moderators and AI bots to determine what is and is not allowed on their platform, frequently resulting in censorship and even hard bans from the platform itself. We've experienced this with several political clients who have been censored or banned from advertising without explanation, and then must wait weeks or months for a response to their help desk ticket while their opponent is able to advertise unencumbered. In these circumstances, Facebook clearly puts its thumb on the scale (intentional or not) in favor of certain political candidates and movements across the country. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/17/facebook-coronavirus-spam/\">(RELATED: Facebook Users Look For Answers As Company's AI Goes Haywire After Moderators Were Sent Home)</url></emphasis></p><p>But don't let personal anecdotes on the fallibility of AI sway you: Read the headlines yourself. \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/murky-messaging-facebook-allowed-death-to-america-advertising-but-censors-u-s-back-to-work-rallies\">Facebook allowed 'Death to America' advertising but censors US back-to-work rallies</url>,\u201d \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist\">In less than 24 hours, Microsoft's AI ChatBot turned into a Nazi on Twitter</url>,\u201d and \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/02/ubers-self-driving-cars-ran-through-6-stoplights-in-california-ny-times-says/#:~:text=According%20to%20internal%20documents%20seen,vehicles%20in%20San%20Francisco%2C%20California\">Uber self-driving car runs 6 stoplights in one day</url>.\u201d</p><p>Facebook is ill-equipped to defend your data privacy, your free speech and even what you're allowed to see online. Never has such a bureaucracy had this level of power to alter the way we communicate with one another and view the world.

There are many solutions out there, such as creating a government agency charged with regulating digital platforms, enforcing antitrust regulations, etc., though all these solutions could potentially take decades to litigate.</p><p>A much simpler, short-term solution would be to regulate Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-would-facebook-regulation-look-like-start-with-the-fcc/\">the same way the FCC regulates broadcast media</url> - by utilizing the public interest framework to protect American citizens from the far-reaching powers of online media. The FCC currently is allowed to ensure there is adequate competition between media companies, prohibit disinformation broadcasting and even ensuring that lewd and explicit media is not broadcast for general consumption on television. Who's to say we couldn't use the FCC to regulate Facebook and other Big Tech companies who frequently flout antitrust laws and the common interest?</p><p>It remains an open question, but we're running out of time to answer it. It's time for small businesses like ours to demand a seat at the table and push back on the mindless talking points repeated by Facebook's paid lackeys in Washington. We must put a stop to Facebook's monopolistic control of digital information before the Big Tech apparatchik slithers its way to controlling how you consume information with no oversight-indefinitely.</p><p>Nick Solheim is the Director of Business Development at Nativ3, a digital marketing and web design agency.</p><p>The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Really!? Everything that Alex Jones and everyone working for InfoWars have said is hate speech? How are they going to justify that in a court of law? How on earth has InfoWars been in business for so long? How have these omnipotent Masters of the Universe failed to notice every minute of every video InfoWars published was hate speech? What made all of these Social Media platforms suddenly notice this and come to this conclusion on the same day?Why don't we ask the U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT)? He is calling on social media monopolies to \"do more than take down one website,\"[1]. What has he to do with Silicon Valley's simultaneous conclusion to throw out the first amendment? This entire assault on the first amendment rights of free speech and freedom of the press sounds like collusion between Senator Murphy and Silicon Valley Social Media giants.How far does Murphy want to go?  If America had a media that was worth a damn, Murphy would be asked for a list of these \"websites\" he would like to see de-platfomed and disappeared. Unfortunately, the same media outlets that claim the First Amendment is being violated whenever they are criticized, have joined in this unholy and un-American crusade to silence their critics on the political right. Who else is involved? What's more, Murphy's call for these big companies to remove websites is not a small deal. As a sitting United States Senator, he has the power to threaten and regulate these corporations to do his bidding. Murphy couldn't do that by himself. He needs help in congress. Obviously, he already has CNN in his pocket.[2] What other senators are waiting in the background while point man Murphy leads the charge against the U.S. Constitution?

He wants to change them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON \u2014 At a hearing this summer about the rising power of the country\u2019s biggest tech companies, Representative David Cicilline zeroed in on Amazon. Unhappy with a response from one of the company\u2019s top lawyers, he delivered a biting retort.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI may remind you, sir: You are under oath,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech companies are under various antitrust investigations, including by the Justice Department, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html\">Federal Trade Commission</url> and state attorneys general. Those inquiries could lead to lawsuits against the companies to enforce existing laws.</p><p>But Mr. Cicilline has a more ambitious goal \u2014 one that may be the greater threat, in the long run, to Big Tech\u2019s practices and profits. He\u2019s trying to build evidence, and a bipartisan consensus, for changing the laws themselves. </p><p>When his party took control of the House this year, Mr. Cicilline, a five-term Rhode Island Democrat, became <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html\">chairman of the subcommittee</url> that oversees antitrust law. In June, he opened an investigation into possible anticompetitive practices by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Under his direction, the panel has held hearings and collected thousands of documents from the companies. The lawmakers have requested countless more records, including emails among top executives. </p><p>He has made clear to the companies that he is not messing around. When he found the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html\">July testimony of industry witnesses</url> incomplete, Mr. Cicilline sent the companies follow-up questions. His list: 181 questions for Google, 45 for Facebook, 158 for Amazon and 43 for Apple.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the only group,\u201d the 58-year-old lawmaker said in a recent interview, \u201cthat has the ability to actually propose the solution.\u201d</p><p>Antitrust experts say this is the most serious congressional inquiry into potential anticompetitive corporate behavior in decades. Among the people at Mr. Cicilline\u2019s side are Slade Bond, the subcommittee\u2019s top lawyer, and Lina Khan, a young antitrust scholar whose writing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html\">makes the case for curbing Big Tech\u2019s market power</url>.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long game being played here \u2014 interrogate, educate and prepare for antitrust reform,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline seems an unlikely inquisitor of Big Tech. He is a criminal defense lawyer turned politician \u2014 in the Rhode Island General Assembly, as mayor of Providence and then in Congress. He has no track record in antitrust. </p><p>But people familiar with Mr. Cicilline are not really surprised by his recent turn. Darrell West has closely followed Mr. Cicilline\u2019s career since the early 1980s, when Mr. West was a young assistant professor of political science at Brown University and Mr. Cicilline was his student. </p><p>The political scientist\u2019s report card on Mr. Cicilline: intelligent and hardworking with grade-A political instincts. </p><p>His sure sense of political timing was notably evident when Mr. Cicilline ran to unseat Vincent A. Cianci Jr., the longtime Providence mayor known as Buddy. Mr. Cicilline announced his candidacy before Mr. Cianci was indicted on racketeering charges, Mr. West recalled. Mr. Cicilline was elected to the first of his two terms as mayor in 2002, while Mr. Cianci went to federal prison.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been impressed by how canny he is at sizing up the moment,\u201d said Mr. West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that now again.\u201d</p><p>After the 2016 election, with Donald J. Trump in the White House and Republicans in the majority in the House, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, urged Mr. Cicilline to become the ranking minority member on the antitrust subcommittee. Mr. Cicilline said he was reluctant at first. Antitrust had been dormant in Congress for years. </p><p>But as they talked, Mr. Cicilline became convinced that the stagnant incomes of middle-class workers and the growing wealth gap in America were at least partly related to an increasing concentration of economic power. He decided to take on the assignment. </p><p>Over the next two years, one antitrust topic kept coming up: the market clout of the tech giants. Until then, most of Mr. Cicilline\u2019s experience with tech had been as a consumer. He drives a Tesla, writes his own tweets, and sometimes buys books and movies on Amazon.</p><p>\u201cThe more I learned, the more alarming it became,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said.</p><p>His panel plans to complete its investigation and publish its findings and recommendations early next year. The prospect for legislative action someday hinges on several unknowns. The most significant include what the subcommittee finds, the 2020 election results and the strength of public support for curbing the tech giants.</p><p>There is no realistic chance that antitrust legislation will be taken up next year, in the heat of a presidential election campaign. But the House investigation does point to a renewed congressional interest in the economic and social impact of concentrated market power and wealth, after years of neglect.</p><p>In the past, congressional inquiries laid the foundation for antitrust reform. Investigations led by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html\">Senator Philip A. Hart</url>, a Michigan Democrat, in the 1960s and 1970s paved the way for antitrust actions in industries from telephones to breakfast cereals, and for new legislation that strengthened oversight of corporate mergers. They also led to new powers for the Justice Department.</p><p>\u201cThat was a major contribution to antitrust enforcement, and today\u2019s House investigation could be an important step in the same direction,\u201d said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chairman of the F.T.C.</p><p>The congressional antitrust revival is not just a preoccupation of Democrats like Mr. Cicilline. Republicans also say it is time for scrutiny of the tech companies.</p><p>In September, when the House team <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html\">sent lengthy information requests</url> to the chief executives of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, the letters bore the signatures of four congressmen: Mr. Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on Judiciary; Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican on the antitrust subcommittee; and Mr. Cicilline.</p><p>At the hearings, the comments and questions from the Republican and Democrats have shown divisions. The Republicans emphasize that being big is not being bad and that success should not be punished. The Democrats speak of competitors stifled and consumers exploited.</p><p>They do share concerns. \u201cThese are some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, and it\u2019s important for us to understand the dynamics of this new industry,\u201d Mr. Collins said in an interview.</p><p>Specifically, he said, the tech giants should be restrained from buying up nascent competitors.</p><p>In their investigations of Facebook, the F.T.C. and the states are examining that issue. Did the social network buy Instagram, the photo-sharing service, and WhatsApp, the messaging service, as steps in a strategy to squelch emerging rivals?</p><p>Limiting the freedom of large tech companies to acquire upstart competitors, legal experts say, would require modifying the antitrust laws.</p><p>In the House hearings, the topic of \u201cpredatory acquisitions\u201d has come up repeatedly. Another idea discussed by some expert witnesses at the House hearings is the creation of a new regulator empowered to respond more quickly to allegations of anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>Antitrust traditionalists regard both proposals with skepticism. The changes would be a shift from the current enforcement model, in which courts rule on individual cases. Instead, government officials would need to predict the path of innovation, said Maureen Ohlhausen, a former F.T.C. commissioner who testified at one of the hearings led by Mr. Cicilline.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what markets are good at, not government,\u201d said Ms. Ohlhausen, a partner at Baker Botts, echoing the view of the tech companies and free-market adherents. </p><p>Mr. Nadler, Mr. Cicilline\u2019s boss as head of the Judiciary Committee, was reluctant to say where the inquiry would lead. He called the investigation \u201cthe beginning of a long process.\u201d</p><p>Not even Mr. Cicilline is sure where it will go. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fairly easy to identify the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cCrafting the solutions is much more difficult.\u201d</p><p>But he is glad that he agreed to Mr. Nadler\u2019s recommendation. </p><p>\u201cIt turned out, of course, to be a really good decision,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said.</p><p>PHOTO: Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, leads the Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee.

If it works, it could potentially save you money and give you new ways to watch television.</p><p>The proposal aims to increase the number of companies that build and sell set-top boxes, injecting competition into the industry. Whether it's\u00a0big tech firms\u00a0like Apple\u00a0or\u00a0small, independent developers,\u00a0the new rules could\u00a0make it easier for some to challenge the cable industry - and lower your cable bill.</p><p>It would allow non-cable companies to make new set-top boxes,\u00a0customizing search functions, menu designs and other aspects of the user interface that consumers might not currently enjoy from their provider, officials say.</p><p>Right now, most people rent their boxes directly from their cable or satellite TV providers, to the tune of $20 billion a year, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Consumers pay, on average, about $20 a month to rent their boxes from cable providers, a congressional probe found last year.</p><p>              [You're paying a shocking amount to rent cable boxes every year]           </p><p>\"Ninety-nine percent of pay-TV subscribers are chained to their set-top boxes because cable and satellite operators have locked up the market,\" according to an agency fact sheet released Wednesday.</p><p>The proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler would require operators to behave differently in several ways. In general, they'd have to provide much of\u00a0the information that their own set-top boxes already rely on to other companies. That includes\u00a0everything related to a cable firm's channel line-up - such as which networks appear on which channels, and what programming can be found there.</p><p>Cable providers will also have to relay basic data about privileges and permissions, such as whether a device can record shows for later playback. And, of course, the companies will have to make the actual shows available to third party devices, as well.</p><p>              ['A soup of misery': Over half of people say they'd abandon their cable company, if only they could]           </p><p>This isn't the first time the FCC has tried to crack open the set-top box. But changes in technology are demanding new approaches to the issue, senior FCC officials told reporters Wednesday.</p><p>The cable industry's supporters\u00a0are\u00a0opposed to this move, lashing out at what it views as government overreach and a threat to consumers. Many of them joined a new group\u00a0that launched Wednesday called the Future of TV coalition.</p><p>\"Innovation and competition should drive the creative marketplace, not government mandates that have the potential to undermine and impede the best TV market in the world,\" the group said in a release.</p><p>The FCC's proposal will be voted on at its Feb. 18 meeting. If it's approved, it will open up a proceeding to allow for public feedback before the rules are finalized during a later vote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8adcedb54a044752801a2396da4ec7bc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HYB-BTM1-DXKP-J28W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><timeReceived>7:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 27, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Jurisdiction</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg0OUQ4QzVBOTdFNDY2RTlBN0YwQTVBNjA4NDVGRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RE3</classCode><className>CABLE SYSTEM REGULATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTZGRjRGMTBDNjBFNDQ3NDk4Qjc1MUMwRTRDNDMyNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNFQTlENUZGNUIyNEUyMzhEOEZFNUEzNzYzNEE4Qzg</classCode><className>Cable Systems</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Anyone out there doing this just right?\"Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, is a big-city mayor whom de Blasio might use as a role model when it comes to tech.

New York needs to stop only looking back to San Francisco and [Silicon] Valley and start looking ahead to London from where future competition will come.\"</p><p>Q: With so much private money flowing into tech firms, does public policy really matter? Why?\"Public policy does matter; it matters much more than public money matters. The private capital markets have been putting money into NYC companies, but they will continue to do so only as long as NYC is a good place for tech companies. Public policy has a large impact how good a place NYC is for tech.\"</p><p>Q: W here should the mayor start? What's the single most important thing tech needs from the city?\"The mayor should start with the easiest and least expensive of the four areas [listed above], promotion. He should speak often about the importance of tech to NYC, and how NYC is such a great place for tech. Whatever the mayor of New York City says is, by virtue of his saying it, newsworthy and will generate press coverage - not only locally but also across the country and around the world.\"</p><p>\"One Last Thing\" is a Q&amp;A that runs most Friday afternoons with an executive who's recently tackled a big project, accomplished something notable or navigated a tricky problem.

The coronavirus appears to have accelerated the future of the hospitality industry, with many turning to tech to help them recover.    As businesses turn to find ways to stay afloat, high tech solutions have been used to preserve many of these establishments \u2013 and not just online ordering.    \u201cRestaurants are switching gears now. Going to kiosks, mobile or online ordering, using a third-party delivery source - that\u2019s what your future is,\u201d said Sam Zietz, the CEO of GRUBBRR,  a payment technology company that focuses on contactless payment, ordering systems and other technologies.    According to Zietz, it\u2019s been a long time coming for hospitality, calling restaurants \u2018notorious laggards in technology\u2019 with the \u2018if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix\u2019 mentality.  He likens the movement toward other industries, such as in travel or banking.    \u201cWithin other industries, they had a similar evolution. Tellers and banks, what happened? We went to online banking and ATMs. Very rarely do you see tellers anymore,\u201d said Zietz.    Comparing to restaurants, the role of cashier may seem obsolete. By cutting out the middleman, businesses save money, and every penny can count when the Big Apple still stomachs unknowns with the fate of indoor dining.              Grubbrr  Credit: GRUBBRR    Effective last Friday, indoor dining resumed at 25 percent capacity across the state of New Jersey, including similar measures for movie theaters and indoor performances. During the same week, New York is still facing backlash for not having any plans in place.    In a news conference last Wednesday, Mayor de Blasio noted the concerns and offered a timeline to finalize the decision.    \u201cWe\u2019ve been honest with the restaurant industry about the challenge. But I\u2019ve also heard back that folks just want a final answer so they can make their plans up and down. I think it\u2019s our responsibility to give them as clear an answer in the month of September as possible of where we\u2019re going,\u201d the mayor said.    To that end, during a teleconference that same day, Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u201cwould like to see restaurants open\u201d but put the emphasis on a lack of compliance on bars and law enforcement.    With restaurants left in the dark, forward thinking can become a guiding light. SevenRooms CEO Joel Montaniel strongly feels that personalized service, using tech to create a \u2018360 degree\u2019 view of the consumer, is necessary going forward with Covid.    SevenRooms is a hospitality guest experience platform using solutions from reservation management, contactless order and pay, guest profiles and marketing.    \u201cMost importantly, we are helping restaurants build on their guests. For anyone who has opted into the restaurant marketing, we\u2019re using that information to reach back out to guest automatically in a personalized manner,\u201d said Montaniel.    In his example, if you typically order delivery twice a month, but you haven\u2019t ordered anything in the last month, the system will automate a personalized \u2018we miss you\u2019 and offer a favorite, complimentary item in your next order.    According to Montaniel, an interesting trend has been seeing an uptick of fine dining establishments now turning to this tech, which historically they have shied away from. \u201c    They launched it out of necessity. The contactless ordering at the table, it\u2019s really picked up. We see new clients and those we\u2019d never have guessed would have done given the circumstances,\u201d Montaniel said.    To him, it\u2019s doing whatever is necessary to survive as he shared his clients\u2019 biggest concern is the feeling of uncertainty \u2013 \u2018how long will I have to do this?\u2019. However, it is the fighting uncertainty with regulation. Based off of a recent YouGov and SevenRooms study , more than 1 in 5 Americans specified that they would revisit a restaurant given a promotion or deal.    According the same study, 13% of Americans will only dine out at restaurants with contactless options. In the same vain, one NYC restaurateur is taking contactless to another level \u2013 launching a completely zero human interaction quick service restaurant dishing up dumplings.    Founder of Brooklyn Dumpling Shop, Stratis Morfogen originally concocted his own idea in 2019, keeping the Amazon locker system in mind. To him, coronavirus only reinforced the contactless demand with a twist return of the old-fashioned automat.    \u201cIn 2019 I actually wrote a business plan bringing back the automat. The automat is the most effective, cost-efficient way to deliver a product. I started researching Horn &amp; Hardart, the founder of the automat in 1895 and how it exploded,\u201d he said.    He likens the current times to post-Spanish Flu in the early 1900s.    \u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with same the thing we did 100 years later with a pandemic. When I created Brooklyn Dumpling Shop, it was more about economics first before safety,\u201d said Morfogen.              Brooklyn Dumpling Shop  Credit: Brooklyn Dumpling Shop    The idea behind the East Village shop launching this Fall is simple. You order your food online or over a phone, receive a barcode once ready and get assigned your individual food locker - temperature customized to hold your meal. Lockers even feature U.V. lights to ensure sanitation before you grab-and-go.    The idea of a contactless option is not new to the city. Japanese ramen food establishment ICHIRAN, with three New York locations, made blocking out distractions in mind, with solo dining in cubby-like booths. Eventually, moving forward with indoor dining, perhaps this idea would interest intro and extroverts alike taking Covid into consideration.    ICHIRAN has more than 60 locations in Japan, with restaurants in Hong Kong and Taipei. The idea of less human interaction in the food industry is not foreign beyond state lines. Montaniel related this to his customers in Singapore and recent trends in the U.S.    \u201cI don\u2019t think we saw that coming so fast in the States. If you go to China, you have this whole culture of everything is done through your phone ordering and paying, and we thought that world was going to be much slower to come to the U.S.,\u201d Montaniel said.    To this entrepreneur, the tech response to consumers does not entirely rule out the full-service experience. It just means business owners should be more conscious of the consumer who now prefers contactless \u2013 and not lose out on the opportunity of serving them.    Owner of the West Village restaurant The Banty Rooster, Delores Trono-DePierro, unfortunately was forced to shut down her full-service establishment because of the virus. When asked during an interview, if she would ever reopen a business in New York again, her response was mixed.    \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would do a full-service restaurant in New York again. I might look at something smaller, whether it\u2019s a walk-up window kind of thing. But I increasingly feel like something where you can do the sales but have a smaller overhead footprint,\u201d she said in a previous interview with NBCNew York.    Taking an intimate spin on the NYC dining experience is Resident. The company takes the current dining experience off the sidewalks and into an empty penthouse or luxury apartment, while following Covid regulations, using unused terraces. A private chef is there to cook a multi-course meal while you enjoy some of the city\u2019s most exclusive residential spots.              Resident  Credit: Resident    Founder of Resident, Brian Mommsen, is surprised with the growth in demand but also mentioned, due to Covid, the increased interest from real estate.    \u201cPartners are actually finding us to engage us. Because what we\u2019re doing is creating value for a piece of their space in the building that is otherwise sitting idle,\u201d Mommsen said.    To this hospitality entrepreneur, the coronavirus has \u201creinforced our desire to actually see one another.\u201d  Food is what brings people together and has the potential to unite.

Marchers, dressed all in yellow, carried purple lotus plants, yin-yang symbols, and other traditional Buddhist icons. But it was their giant banners, held aloft or mounted on small floats, that indicated this was not just a religious rally. \"Keep away from the Chinese Communist Party. Stop the persecution of Falun Gong.\" A religious movement that emerged in China in the mid-1990s, Falun Gong surged in popularity nationwide before it was banned and brutally suppressed on the mainland in 1999. But it continues to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the territory's greater human rights protections. For decades now, Falun Gong protests against the Chinese government have been a common sight on the city's streets, with practitioners setting up gory mock surgery scenes to raise awareness about , and handing out free copies of the Falun Gong-linked newspaper, Epoch Times. Protesters have also targeted Chinese politicians and offices in the city, and regularly take part in mass anti-government rallies and marches. A woman watches as supporters of the Falun Gong spiritual group, banned in mainland China, take part in a march in Hong Kong on April 27, 2019, to observe the 20th anniversary of a large demonstration in Beijing which led to a crackdown against the movement. Crossing the border by bus from China and seeing Falun Gong practitioners handing out anti-Communist Party leaflets was once one of the most visible signs of Hong Kong's relative autonomy from Beijing. All that could soon be deemed illegal under a sweeping new security law passed by China for Hong Kong last month that criminalized \"acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.\" Similar laws in China have been used to go after Falun Gong practitioners, which Beijing denounces as an \"evil cult\" that \"preaches heretical fallacies that are anti-humanity and anti-science\" through the control of people's minds. Falun Gong practitioners reject these charges and maintain they have been unfairly targeted and suppressed by the Chinese authorities. Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are believed to be held \"at various prisons and extralegal detention centers\" in mainland China, according to Washington-based rights group Freedom House -- an accusation Beijing also denies. \"The new National Security Law will act like a sharp knife hanging over the (association) and the heads of every Falun Gong practitioner in Hong Kong,\" said Ingrid Wu, spokeswoman for the Hong KongFalun Dafa Association. \"We are very concerned.\" Hong Kong officials have claimed the new law is necessary and will only affect a handful of individuals. In early July, Chief Executive Carrie Lam pushed back against the suggestion the law would undermine people's freedoms. \"The legal principles that we attach a lot of importance to, like presumption of innocence and no retrospective effect and so on, are being upheld,\" she said. \"Instead of spreading fear, the law will actually remove fear and let Hong Kong people return to a normal, peaceful life.\" A government spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions about concerns regarding religious freedom under the law. Hong Kong has long been a safe haven for entities which could never operate in China, from banned religious movements and labor rights NGOs, to big tech firms blocked by the Great Firewall. The fate of groups like Falun Gong -- fierce opponents of Beijing who, while not the immediate targets of the law still come within its broad remit -- will test those assurances to the hilt. Falun Gong practitioners have long been a vocal and organized part of Hong Kong's broader anti-government movement. New age religion Founded by Li Hongzhi in northeastern China in the early 1990s, Falun Gong blends traditional Chinese qigong practices and new age beliefs. It was once promoted by the Chinese government and state media as part of a nationwide qigong craze, but as Falun Gong grew in size, attracting millions of followers, the authorities turned on the group. Li encouraged a blistering public relations strategy in a bid to win over the critics, and between 1996 and 1999, the group staged some 300 protests and demonstrations, historian David Ownby writes in \"Falun Gong and the Future of China.\" This culminated in an audacious, and strategically disastrous, demonstration around central government headquarters in Beijing involving around 10,000 practitioners. It was the biggest protest the capital had seen since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and was the beginning of the end for Falun Gong in China. The protesters in Beijing were calling for the removal of restrictions placed on the faith, but the Chinese authorities responded with a massive crackdown and huge propaganda push demonizing Falun Gong. \"I was shocked,\" said Rose, a Hong Kong-based Falun Gong practitioner. \"I had friends who were traveling between Hong Kong and Beijing, they told me a crackdown was about to take place, but I said this was impossible, Falun Gong was just a belief, nothing political.\" Originally from mainland China, Rose began practicing Falun Gong after moving to Hong Kong in the late 1990s. CNN is withholding her full name due to fears of prosecution under the new security law. Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi seen in New York in 1999. He left China several years before the group was banned there. After Falun Gong was banned, Rose's husband and several of her close friends urged her to keep a low profile, to just do her exercises and readings at home. But she was sure there had been some sort of mistake, and so, just has her fellow practitioners had done in Beijing, she sought to appeal to the government, to make the case for Falun Gong. \"A group of us went to the Liaison Office,\" she said. \"But no one came out, we stayed there for 24 hours.\" The Liaison Office is the Chinese government's Hong Kong headquarters, long a symbol of Beijing's influence over the city. Days turned into weeks, then months. Every day, Rose and a small group of fellow practitioners gathered outside the office on 160 Connaught Road to attempt to have their message heard. One day the protesters were joined by a group of Swiss practitioners who had originally hoped to travel to Beijing to protest but were denied visas. Police attempted to remove the group, which, according to court documents never numbered more than 16, and was \"peaceful and largely static.\" Police moved to clear the protest, however, and charged the Falun Gong protesters with obstruction, among other offenses. The case eventually wound up at the Court of Final Appeals, where Hong Kong's top justices ruled strongly in favor of the right to protest and use \"reasonable force to resist being subjected to unlawful detention.\" The case was a major victory not just for Falun Gong but for anti-government protesters in general, securing -- until last year's anti-government protests -- the right to stage protests outside the Liaison Office. A woman adjusts banners in support of Falun Gong in Tung Chung, an area popular with tourists from the mainland, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. New restrictions While Falun Gong practitioners are not the primary target of the new security law -- which is at times clearly designed to criminalize acts seen during last year's anti-government protests -- they and other groups like them could still fall foul of its broad remit. In particular, the new offense of subversion makes it illegal in many circumstances to advocate \"overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China.\" Given that the PRC government is indelibly intertwined with the Communist Party, Falun Gong efforts to get people to quit the Communist Party in protest, or otherwise harm its activities, could be deemed criminal. The new crime of \"collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\" could also be used to target Falun Gong. While not a top-down religion like the Catholic Church or other similar faiths with large numbers of followers in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is headquartered in the United States, where Li Hongzhi has lived since 1996, and this is where the group's main media and lobbying arms are also located. Under Article 29 of the new law, anyone who \"conspires with a foreign country or an institution, organization or individual outside (China), or directly or indirectly receives instructions, control, funding or other kinds of support\" from such organizations, could be prosecuted if they are found to be \"provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People's Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.\" Pedestrians walk past banners criticising the Falun Gong spiritual movement displayed along a pavement in Causeway Bay, a popular shopping district, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. With initial prosecutions under the security law all related to recent protests, Falun Gong practitioners could find themselves -- if the law's critics are correct -- being a test case of another sort, an expansion of the law's remit to ban activities that have long been verboten on the mainland. \"How the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong evolves in the coming months and how much of the repression leaks over from the mainland is a very important space to watch,\" said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and author of \"The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance under Xi Jinping.\" Outside of the protest movement, Falun Gong is among the most vocal and visible opposition to the Communist Party, in both Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world. While the group is somewhat detached from the mainstream opposition in Hong Kong due to its conservative religious beliefs, this has not stopped its presence in the city being symbolic, and many followers take a sort of pride that even Falun Gong can operate in Hong Kong, given the huge antipathy Beijing has towards the group. \"The ability of people in Hong Kong to practice Falun Gong legally and openly is important both symbolically and practically,\" said Erping Zhang, a US-based spokesman for the group. Zhang said that as well as the new crimes created under the law, he was concerned about the broad rights it gives Chinese security services to operate in Hong Kong, even extending Chinese jurisdiction over certain cases and allowing people to be taken for trial on the mainland. \"It could truly take a horrific toll on Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong and create huge losses for those who have benefited from the practice and activists' awareness raising activities,\" he said. Cook, the Freedom House researcher, said that any curtailment of Falun Gong in the city \"would be a bad sign and a potentially worrying precursor to a crackdown on the broader religious community in Hong Kong.\" \"Within China we've sign time and again since 1999 how the rules, tactics, and even security forces initially created to persecute Falun Gong are then expanded to other targets,\" she added. \"It may only be a matter of time before we see that in Hong Kong too, unfortunately.\" But not all religious groups are alarmed. In a letter to the religious newspaper Church Times this month, Paul Kwong, Archbishop of Hong Kong, praised the new security law and pushed back against criticism from figures including Cardinal Maung Bo, president of the Asian Bishops' Conferences. \"Many critics do not accept the fact that we are part of China,\" Kwong said. \"They only emphasize two systems, not one country. I cherish our Hong Kong freedoms -- in particular the freedom of religion and way of life -- as much as anyone, and I don't think this law will change any of that. I am also proud to be living in China.\" A Falun Gong activist (left) holds a sign next to men from a mailand Chinese tour group in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong on January 6, 2019. Freedom of speech Numerous concerns have been raised about the new law's potential effects on freedom of speech in Hong Kong, with people already moving to scrub their social media and remove posters and pamphlets criticizing the government from shops and restaurants. Media groups have expressed alarm about the law, with the Foreign Correspondents' Club writing to the city's leader Lam \"seeking clarity on specific areas where the new law is vague and where terms are undefined, particularly regarding the press and freedom of speech.\" Lam previously said \"the law has clearly defined the four types of acts and activities which we need to prevent, curb and punish in accordance with the law.\" \"If the Foreign Correspondents' Club or all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100% guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same,\" she added. Here again, Falun Gong may find themselves at the inadvertent frontlines of Hong Kong's battle for civil liberties. During a recent protest against the law on July 1, Falun Gong practitioners could be seen handing out flyers saying \"Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party\" as well as copies of Epoch Times. The newspaper, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners and remains closely linked to the group, is one of the most vocally anti-government publications in the city. Its Chinese edition refers to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Communist Party virus,\" has called on the West to \"fight back\" against the Party, and regularly publishes stinging critiques of Beijing. Representatives for Epoch Times in Hong Kong and New York did not respond to a request for comment. Like Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid owned by tycoon Jimmy Lai, currently facing charges related to last year's protests, Epoch Times could be a canary in the coal mine for Hong Kong's media freedoms. Both papers have cultivated influence in Washington -- something that could both help or harm them, leading to politicians speaking out in their defense, but also Beijing casting them as colluding with foreign forces. Lai has long been close to Republican Party politicians, leading to claims of his being a foreign agent in Chinese state media, while the English edition of the Epoch Times since 2016 has aggressively targeted Trump voters, with opinion content taking on an increasingly right-wing stance. In 2019, the paper was barred by Facebook from running ads on its platform, after finding it violated the company's policies with pro-Trump campaigns. Falun Gong members meditate as policemen watch demonstrators during a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong on May 18, 2016. Uncertain future Hong Kong and Beijing officials have repeatedly claimed that the security law is both necessary and restrained, and will only affect a tiny handful of individuals in the city, mainly violent separatists. Paraphrasing former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about Hong Kong's success after China took control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this week that under the new law \"horses will run faster, stocks will be more sizzling, and dancers will dance more happily.\" But with moves to ban books and expand police powers of surveillance and censorship, the scope of the law would appear to be expanding. Falun Gong practitioners, as well as many other groups in Hong Kong opposed to Beijing, may not immediately feel the sting of the new regulations, but they were poised for the worse. After years of suppression in China, however, the group is better prepared than most for how to function behind the scenes, even if that will require a complete overhaul of its Hong Kong operation. Zhang, the US-based spokesman, said that within China still, people \"continue to practice Falun Gong in private and many go out and discretely disseminate information to help other Chinese see through the CCP's lies and cover-ups.\" Many practitioners in Hong Kong are in the city because they fled China, and Wu, the local spokeswoman said some may choose to go overseas should the law target them. \"The Falun Gong community is diverse; each person makes their own decision based on their family and other situations,\" she said. \"But most of Falun Gong practitioners that I know plan to stay in Hong Kong. We feel it is our responsibility to continue our peaceful efforts of raising awareness of the persecution and calling for justice, and tell the world what is happening in Hong Kong.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The company is willing to comply with the guidelines once the government publishes the data protection bill. Some of the big tech companies like Amazon and Google are yet to comply with these guidelines whereas chat messaging platform WhatsApp has agreed to follow the data localisation policy.</p><p><br/> Storing data of Indians within the country will give a sense of security to Indian users, especially in the light of the recent data breaches involving tech companies. India's banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had made it mandatory for payment firms to store data locally. RBI's notification on Payment Data Storage 2018 and, the guidelines for government departments show the government's focus on data localisation.<br/> Various factors including security of the data of its citizens, national security and economic development of the country were the major reasons behind the introduction of such a policy. Global tech companies working in India collect enormous amount of data and this data contains sensitive information.<br/> Kaspersky Lab's Managing Director, Stephan Neumeier was speaking at 4th Asia Pacific Cybersecurity Annual Summit. He clarified that Kaspersky Lab wants to comply with the proposed requirements. However, the company will do it once the data protection bill is released.<br/> The company has already discussed the matter with India's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Chief Gulshan Rai. Kaspersky plans to start a Transparency Center in India, along with a data center. The date center will have capabilities to store Indian data within the country's borders.<br/> Neumeier added, \"We have all the support that we can imagine from the Indian government. However, we need to look into specific requirements before we make a decision where we are going to open that facility. One is obviously location. We want to fly in people there. It needs to provide easy accessibility. So, India is probably, for Asia Pacific, not a perfect place because it is not very, very central.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10714365</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK9-W5W1-DYDW-7531-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 26, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0006M4M</classCode><className>LABORATORIYA KASPERSKOGO ZAO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0008UMH</classCode><className>RESERVE BANK OF INDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The news sparked a rally in CA shares that drove the company's market value up to $15 billion, which means a buyout would be the biggest since Dell Inc.'s management-led takeover in 2013.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal has a much more realistic chance of occurring than a leveraged buyout of Citrix Systems Inc., the $12 billion cloud-computing company whose discussions with private equity firms over a take-private deal have reportedly become bogged down. That's because BMC is essentially a strategic buyer that can afford to pay up because of the potential synergies it can extract. If that sounds familiar, it's because it's the same dynamic that facilitated the most recent (and only) megabuyout since Dell: Apollo Global Management's $12.3 billion acquisition of ADT Corp., which was combined with Protection 1, another home-security company owned by the New York firm.</p><p>So how would the math work? Even including an average 25 percent deal premium, CA isn't expensive at around 11.1 times its projected fiscal 2018 Ebitda or 4 times its revenue:</p><p>Bain and Golden Gate will likely have to come up with a chunk of equity, but that can be minimized if CA's largest shareholders -- Martin Haefner and Careal Holding AG, the holding company of Haefner and his sister -- commit to rolling all or part of their collective 25 percent stake in the company. Apart from that, a $20 billion debt package may be required.</p><p>CA's enterprise value, including a deal premium, is already roughly $16.5 billion and BMC itself already has more than $6 billion of outstanding debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would result in a leverage ratio of almost 9 times the combined company's Ebitda, which is high, but not uncommon for software companies. Solera and Tibco Software, which were each taken private by Vista Equity Partners, had post-transaction leverage of 8 and 11 respectively, according to Moody's. These companies had no problem attracting yield-hungry investors to their debt when it came time to borrow owing to their recurring cash flow, and a combined BMC-CA shouldn't either.</p><p>There is one potential sticking point to a deal: Jefferies analysts have flagged potential antitrust issues in the mainframe market, which they describe as an oligopoly controlled by CA, BMC and IBM. Still, it's a good time to test the leveraged-finance market, where banks are likely willing to chase lucrative lending deals now that President Donald Trump's Treasury Department is poised to ease the regulatory burden.</p><p>Where some banks may have previously passed on a deal like BMC-CA at the risk of getting called out for doing it (as happened with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and its financing of the Ultimate Fighting Championship buyout last year), the indication that regulators may not be as strict about imposing current guidelines will probably make them feel they have the leeway.</p><p>No doubt, this megadeal will test the buyout market. Assuming a transaction can get done, and there's a good chance it will, it'll prove that size is no longer a roadblock.</p><p>This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.</p><p>Gillian Tan is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering deals and private equity. She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. She is a qualified chartered accountant.</p><p>The Haefners inherited their stake from their father Walter Haefner who obtained it in 1986 when CA acquired University Computing.</p><p>This assumes percent annual Ebitda growth for BMC, whose financials haven't been available since its buyout. For context, CA and IBM have seen Ebitda slowly decline over time, but BMC's CEO has said publicly that the company's Ebitda is improving (this is likely due to operating improvements and cost savings imposed by its private equity owners).</p><p>To contact the author of this story: Gillian Tan in New York at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gtan129@bloomberg.net\">gtan129@bloomberg.net</email></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bewilliams@bloomberg.net\">bewilliams@bloomberg.net</email></p><p>cc2017 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LASCRU-31082726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LASCRUCMNG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NV9-H691-DYT4-V487-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">280046</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Las Cruces Sun-News, a MediaNews Group Newspaper All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Las Cruces Sun-News (New Mexico)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 21, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001XCE</classCode><className>BMC SOFTWARE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000248A</classCode><className>CA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002BYW</classCode><className>DELL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0002AYT</classCode><className>CITRIX SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0007DRX</classCode><className>ADT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002OYI</classCode><className>CAREAL HOLDING AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009LNC</classCode><className>GOLDEN GATE CAPITAL LP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001USN</classCode><className>BAIN CAPITAL LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009ZY9</classCode><className>APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000CUZ3</classCode><className>VISTA EQUITY PARTNERS LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002DVS</classCode><className>TIBCO SOFTWARE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>CA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>CTXS (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>ADT (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>APO (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000238</classCode><className>BUYINS &amp;

But over the last few years, reporters and regulators have learned that Big Tech companies are really bad at protecting that data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One tech startup -- Duality Technologies, founded in 2016 -- admits that Silicon Valley has created a privacy problem, but thinks they could also solve the problem instead of resorting to regulators' plans of breaking up Big Tech.</p><p>Duality's solution? Homomorphic encryption. And some Big Tech companies are already interested in it.</p><p>For co-founder and CTO Kurt Rohloff, figuring out how to balance consumer privacy and tech companies' need for data to provide better goods and services has always been a dilemma.</p><p>For example, using people's medical data to conduct more research on cancer could get us closer to a cure, he said, but how do you make sure you aren't compromising or exposing very personal medical data in the process?</p><p>\"Where we're starting to push on is to enable analytics more broadly while being computed, which is where some companies have started to go,\" Rohloff told InsideSources. \"A handful of academics and startups and big tech firms are developing a set of technologies called PETs, or privacy enhancing technologies, to allow people to share data privately and pull analytics without impacting privacy.\"</p><p>This is where homomorphic encryption comes in. Homomorphic encryption allows a tech company to analyze people's personal data while it is still encrypted. Hypothetically, this enables a tech company like Google to learn from its user data and improve products and services -- like Google search results -- without ever actually decrypting and seeing personally identifiable information (PII) like your social security number, or your mother's maiden name.</p><p>Facebook's recent foray into cryptocurrency technology (with the launch of Libra) means Big Tech could be interested in some of the privacy technologies -- like homomorphic encryption -- associated with blockchain and cryptocurrencies. (Some cryptocurrencies use homomorphic encryption.)</p><p>Just last month, Google rolled out a homomorphic encryption tool for its business partners. According to Google's blog post accompanying the rollout, \"This technology can help advance valuable research in a wide array of fields that require organizations to work together without revealing anything about individuals represented in the data.\"</p><p>Rohloff calls it a \"growth\" of end-to-end encrypted messaging.</p><p>\"Different versions of this technology have been around for a decade plus, it's only been in the past three years that it's become very active, and it's become an area of the largest major companies,\" Rohloff said. \"The early adopters have been in the regulated data industries, like healthcare and finance, where there are very strong regulatory concerns. But what we're seeing is that a lot of these liability issues and really embarrassing data breaches, like Cambridge Analytica, have been driving companies not necessarily in data-regulated industries to adopt these PETs to better protect themselves from liability and the privacy of their user base.\"</p><p>The tech industry may still need strict privacy regulation, but Rohloff thinks PETs \"could help in some very serious ways.\"</p><p>\"We're starting to see this in our work in the financial industries,\" he said. \"Up until now, if big banks wanted to coordinate to fight financial fraud, they'd basically have to sign some very strong legal agreements and then share data in the clear to build up financial fraud cases. Now what we're starting to deploy is banks' ability to encrypt their transaction data so they can run joint analytics with no leakage of sensitive information.\"</p><p>As tech companies continue to gather more data on internet users every second, software engineer Andreas Poyiatzis said its more important than ever that they address privacy concerns -- with homomorphic encryption.</p><p>\"Fast forward few years from now and imagine this fictional scenario: Facebook can use your chat history to give you a personal intelligent agent that can respond to chats in your messenger on your behalf with the exact same writing style as yours,\" Poyiatzis wrote in a blog post. \"Also, you can give Amazon all your banking details and roll out specifically crafted shopping/grocery lists (now that acquired Whole Foods) that match your financial status and preferences! A new genome company can use your DNA sequence to give you a detailed list of medicines that would work really well on you.\"</p><p>\"As you can see,\" he added, \"all of these come at a cost. The cost of giving away your privacy, to access all these services.\"</p><p>Because homomorphic encryption can allow tech companies to continue to improve products and services while retaining user privacy, Poyiatzis thinks it will be the \"cornerstone\" of the future of privacy.</p><p>\"PETs allows folks to have better control of data and less centralization of data clearinghouses and less trusted parties for performing joint analytics on data, which philosophically gets at some of the libertarian aspects of cryptocurrency and blockchain and things like that,\" Rohloff said.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Image Credit: AP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scrutiny of giant technology companies and the inevitable anxiety that follows are now so commonplace that they have become rote. Once terms like \"techlash\" become household words, it's easy to become numb.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But truly, Monday was a noteworthy day. The attorneys general of 48 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico announced an antitrust investigation into Google parent company Alphabet Inc. For those in need of a civics lesson, that is nearly every possible top lawyer from a US state. The lone exceptions are those from California and Alabama.</p><p>The substance of their investigation is not surprising, but when a red-state attorney general from Texas and his blue-state counterpart from the District join forces, you know something weird is happening. Antipathy about giant tech companies may be the single bipartisan issue that can unite people like President Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate.</p><p>Already, the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, US congressional committees, Europe's anti-monopoly authority and a different batch of state watchdogs are looking into whether Alphabet, Facebook Inc. and other tech superpowers are using their influence to unfairly advantage themselves over competitors and give people worse products and services or fewer alternatives. I would call this a laundry list of government investigations into the American tech giants, but no one's wardrobe is this big.</p><p>It's easy to brush off the announcement by the attorneys general as just another version of the semi-permanent regulatory background noise that won't materially hurt the tech companies. Google has been through the antitrust investigations merry-go-round for the better part of the last decade, including a long federal antitrust inquiry that ended in 2013 without significant adverse findings.</p><p>It's hard to prove that Google's mixed track record in state, federal and international legal investigations has hurt its standing with the public or significantly dented a company with an $830 billion stock market value.</p><p>What's different this time is the persistence and volume of these various government inquiries combined with the tech giants' huge size and the public's souring feelings about them. That stew of forces could make these fresh investigations sting even if no one finds a smoking gun.</p><p>Regulators and particularly elected officials are divining rods of the public mood. Their willingness to poke and prod the tech giants shows they think it's not just policymakers who wonder whether big tech is too powerful and too unaccountable. The existence of the investigations is another sign that public trust in tech giants isn't ironclad, and headlines about the investigations or subsequent revelations from them could form a feedback loop that further contributes to the erosion of consumer trust.</p><p>That matters for Silicon Valley and beyond because tech companies can thrive only if people trust them. The more people think twice and ask themselves why they're getting a particular answer from Google, why Facebook thinks they should join a specific online group, why Amazon suggests they buy a certain bath towel, or why they should track health information with the Apple app, the worse it is for tech companies. Those rapidly firing human neurons are not good.</p><p>Those kinds of hesitations may happen only on the margins, but the world's biggest tech companies rely on thousands of seemingly inconsequential choices by their customers. If a small share of people takes a break from Instagram, believes without evidence that Google is squashing the circulation of conservative news or rethinks that once-reflexive weekly Amazon purchase, it could have ripple effects.</p><p>It's both good and bad for Google, Facebook and the others that government investigations can drag on and on. Political winds can shift, and outrage may move to other areas.</p><p>More likely, though, America's tech superpowers will need to figure out how to survive now that they're regarded not with a special affection by the public but with the same kind of lukewarm-at-best feelings they have about more conventional companies. Big tech, in short, needs to learn to live with the same level of public affection as airlines or banks.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/98/156811689161.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/98/156811689161.jpeg</url></p><p>Facebook<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-153638043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X17-4TF1-F11P-X474-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

As part of our response to her proposal,[4] we shared a couple of headlines from 2007 claiming that MySpace had an unassailable monopoly in the social media market.Tommaso Valletti, the chief economist of the Directorate-General for Competition (DG COMP) of the European Commission, said[5], in what we assume was a reference to our posts, 'they go on and on with that single example to claim that [Facebook] and [Google] are not a problem 15 years later That's not what I would call an empirical regularity.'We appreciate the invitation to show that prematurely dubbing companies 'unassailable monopolies' is indeed an empirical regularity. It's Tough to Make Predictions, Especially About the Future of Competition in Tech No one is immune to this phenomenon. </p><p>Antitrust regulators often take a static view of competition, failing to anticipate dynamic technological forces that will upend market structure and competition.Scientists and academics make a different kind of error. They are driven by the need to satisfy their curiosity rather than shareholders. Upon inventing a new technology or discovering a new scientific truth, academics often fail to see the commercial implications of their findings.Maybe the titans of industry don't make these kinds of mistakes because they have skin in the game? The profit and loss statement is certainly a merciless master. But it does not give CEOs the power of premonition. Corporate executives hailed as visionaries in one era often become blinded by their success, failing to see impending threats to their company's core value propositions.Furthermore, it's often hard as outside observers to tell after the fact whether business leaders just didn't see a tidal wave[6] of disruption coming or, worse, they did see it coming and were unable to steer their bureaucratic, slow-moving ships to safety. Either way, the outcome is the same.Here's the pattern we observe over and over: extreme success in one context makes it difficult to predict how and when the next paradigm shift will occur in the market. Incumbents become less innovative as they get lulled into stagnation by high profit margins in established lines of business. (This is essentially the thesis of Clay Christensen's The Innovator's Dilemma[7]).Even if the anti-tech populists are powerless to make predictions, history does offer us some guidance about the future. We have seen time and again that apparently unassailable monopolists are quite effectively assailed by technological forces beyond their control.

(twx[24]). Competitors to Instant Messenger, such as Microsoft Corp. (msft[25]) and Yahoo! Inc.

The authors just cannot help themselves. A March 2012 BBC article[54] 'The Future of Technology Who Knows?' derided the naysayers who predicted doom for Apple's retail store strategy. Its kicker?And that is why when you read that the Blackberry is doomed, or that Microsoft will never make an impression on mobile phones, or that Apple will soon dominate the connected TV market, you need to take it all with a pinch of salt.But Blackberry was doomed and Microsoft never made an impression on mobile phones. (Half credit for Apple TV, which currently has a 15% market share[55]). Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman wrote a piece[56] for Red Herring magazine (seriously) in June 1998 with the title 'Why most economists' predictions are wrong.' Headline-be-damned, near the end of the article he made the following prediction:The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'\u2014which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants\u2014becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.Robert Metcalfe himself predicted in a 1995 column[57] that the Internet would 'go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.' After pledging to 'eat his words' if the prediction did not come true, 'in front of an audience, he put that particular column into a blender, poured in some water, and proceeded to eat the resulting frappe with a spoon.' A Change Is Gonna Come Benedict Evans, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, has the best summary[58] of why competition in tech is especially difficult to predict:IBM, Microsoft and Nokia were not beaten by companies doing what they did, but better. They were beaten by companies that moved the playing field and made their core competitive assets irrelevant. The same will apply to Facebook (and Google, Amazon and Apple).Elsewhere, Evans tried to reassure[59] his audience that we will not be stuck with the current crop of tech giants forever:With each cycle in tech, companies find ways to build a moat and make a monopoly. Then people look at the moat and think it's invulnerable. They're generally right. IBM still dominates mainframes and Microsoft still dominates PC operating systems and productivity software. But It's not that someone works out how to cross the moat. It's that the castle becomes irrelevant. IBM didn't lose mainframes and Microsoft didn't lose PC operating systems. Instead, those stopped being ways to dominate tech. PCs made IBM just another big tech company. Mobile and the web made Microsoft just another big tech company. This will happen to Google or Amazon as well. Unless you think tech progress is over and there'll be no more cycles It is deeply counter-intuitive to say 'something we cannot predict is certain to happen'. But this is nonetheless what's happened to overturn pretty much every tech monopoly so far.If this time is different \u2014 or if there are more false negatives than false positives in the monopoly prediction game \u2014 then the advocates for breaking up Big Tech should try to make that argument instead of falling back on 'big is bad' rhetoric. As for us, we'll bet that we have not yet reached the end of history \u2014 tech progress is far from over.

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.<br/>  However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.<br/> During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.<br/> Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing. Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.<br/> The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"<br/> An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information. Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.<br/> What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.<br/> The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons. A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.<br/> Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.<br/>  The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.<br/> \"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"<br/>  The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.<br/>  The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10676771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDG-SGP1-JBYT-H2H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Our old-fashioned democracies are confused and busy, The danger is, while we citizens so great that it's the power of the tech giants grows just out of our reach. Moscow State Circus Our thanks to the again before Christmas. who are touring the country Facebook is so powerful, why does it It's good to see you, Jamie. If LAUGHTER need Nick Clegg? I think nick Clegg is actually quite a smart thing for them, in some respects, because they achieve job at the moment is to try and convince their shareholders and users that they care about data and privacy. Their reputation has almost been in freefall, along with their share price, which has declined significantly over these Cambridge Analytica stories the Nick Clegg, people may dislike him over student fees, but his was been pretty good over civil liberties, so his job is to try and convince us and shareholders that they really care. And also to lobby government, that's why he's been chosen. They are not as powerful as you make out. Companies like Facebook are worried that the power of government could disrupt their business model. If government ruled that Facebook was a publisher, in the same way as a newspaper or a broadcaster is a publisher, that would disrupt their business model big-time I think they vanish overnight, to be honest. I don't think that's going to happen. I don't think they will rule that way. There are good reasons why they should and reasons why they shouldn't. I'm trying to suggest that, if you look at the next ten, 20 years of economic development through these technologies, we are bringing in Internet enabled devices into our home. Who runs the infrastructure that controls them? Our cities will be smart, the lamp posts will be connected. Who runs that infrastructure? These technology companies are building often the basic infrastructure, the flying cars and the drones and autonomous vehicles that we will increasingly rely on in years ahead. Especially as artificial intelligence gets more powerful, more and more influence and power is going to accrue to these companies, and I think it's going to be harder and harder for governments to be able to regulate them, if they don't get on top of them now. What do you make of that? Michael. Well, I'd take Jamie seriously, although I don't entirely understand the shape of what he is describing in the future. But I think a couple of things are pretty clear to me. One is that the amount of innovation and imagination that in the tech companies completely eclipses the imagination and innovation of politicians in democracies, because innovation and imagination seem to be entirely lacking. The second thing, and I like to remind people that democracy is quite an experimental bent there are only 11 democracies in 1941 and it rose to about 100, but that means most of them are less than 80 years old. In a way, it is very much an tested, and there are signs that people are tired of democracy they see failings with it. The EU is not democratic. In many ways, it appears to be anti-democratic. What people are looking at is not so much the need for democracy is the need for free expression, to be able to make something of their own lives, free speech, and the tech companies offer that to them, but of course, in Jamie's emerging world, they can also deny it to them in future. I think, at that level, democracy is going to find that this is a very serious competition, and it looks to me as if one of these is on the rise, the tech companies, and the other is on the decline, democracy, though I don't know where this ends up, but I think Jamie is right to talk about this danger of I thought Jamie was right to say that Nick Clegg will have more power at Facebook than he did as Deputy Prime Minister. If you went to his local parish council, he would have had more power. But I think you picked a bad day to make this argument. I am not on social media, but I do know</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-36aef18e5e5d4672a6abc9a80de63537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK3-MYN1-JBH6-C42S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

The truth is, in future, it won't be any of these crumbling old power bases. The stage is set for Big Tech to dominate our lives in every way, from the infrastructure of our smart cities to the Internet of Things, to artificial intelligence and drone fly-ways. We've now seen tech companies enter the world of corporate philanthropy and even attempt to cure cancer and ageing. </p><p>While governments - slow, unpopular and devoid of solutions - lag behind, Big Tech charges ahead. In fact, it's assuming more and more of the functions that were once the preserve of governments. Little surprise, then, that Nick Clegg has followed many other political players to Silicon Valley. In fact, he probably has more power at Facebook than he did as Deputy Prime Minister. Of course, we've always had business-politics merry-go-rounds, but this new balance of power is different. Big Tech firms aren't just able to buy political influence. As data miners and media outlets, they can control the way we see the world and how politicians connect to voters. They've become major players in big political battles in recent years, including the last US presidential election and the Brexit referendum. Even though we are increasingly worried about the power of Big Tech, we love and are addicted to their snazzy products. That can make it more difficult for us to notice that they are building monopolies across industries that lack accountability. The political circus is moving to Silicon Valley. Our old-fashioned democracies have been left spinning. The danger is, while we citizens are confused and busy, the power of the tech giants grows so great that it's just out of our reach. Our thanks to the Moscow State Circus who are touring the country again before Christmas. It's good to see you, Jamie. If Facebook is so powerful, why does it need Nick Clegg? LAUGHTER I think nick Clegg is actually quite a smart thing for them, in some respects, because they achieve job at the moment is to try and convince their shareholders and users that they care about data and privacy. Their reputation has almost been in freefall, along with their share price, which has declined significantly over these Cambridge Analytica stories the Nick Clegg, people may dislike him over student fees, but his was been pretty good over civil liberties, so his job is to try and convince us and shareholders that they really care. And also to lobby government, that's why he's been chosen. They are not as powerful as you make out. Companies like Facebook are worried that the power of government could disrupt their business model. If government ruled that Facebook was a publisher, in the same way as a newspaper or a broadcaster is a publisher, that would disrupt their business model big-time I think they vanish overnight, to be honest. I don't think that's going to happen. I don't think they will rule that way. There are good reasons why they should and reasons why they shouldn't. I'm trying to suggest that, if you look at the next ten, 20 years of economic development through these technologies, we are bringing in Internet enabled devices into our home. Who runs the infrastructure that controls them? Our cities will be smart, the lamp posts will be connected. Who runs that infrastructure? These technology companies are building often the basic infrastructure, the flying cars and the drones and autonomous vehicles that we will increasingly rely on in years ahead. Especially as artificial intelligence gets more powerful, more and more influence and power is going to accrue to these companies, and I think it's going to be harder and harder for governments to be able to regulate them, if they don't</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-b6687568bf3b4b37bd5c071ef5f3afc0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK3-MYN1-JBH6-C426-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

People are right to be horrified by the antics of Cambridge Analytica, but contrary to what Mark Zuckerberg would have you believe, their behaviour is neither new nor unique. Political data mining really found its feet with Barack Obama back in 2008. And it got into its stride with Trump and Brexit. Don't forget, Hillary Clinton used it, too. </p><p>Everyone's at it. And when data mining really learns to run, it could undermine democracies the world over. Outrage has focused on the assault on social media users' privacy. But for the most part, Cambridge Analytica were only using social media in the way the big tech firms designed them to be used. Free services in exchange for your data. Facebook likes have always been harvested and analysed to identify your emotional vulnerabilities and then exploit them to nudge you into buying a pair of trainers or a holiday. So why can't the same techniques be used to recruit you to a particular political cause? Wave after wave of data collection, analysis and targeting we are subject to subtle forms harms our democracy because it means of manipulation and control. But the data dons have discovered something even scarier. Emotive and divisive language and images outperform dry, rational arguments. That encourages us to vote according to our most basic, often irrational prejudices. It's the digital age's equivalent of old-fashioned populism. And we know from the experience of the last century what lies at the bottom of that slippery slope. This is the tragic irony of the age of big tech. It was once assumed that the internet would make politics hyper-rational, that people would make informed decisions on the basis of an abundance of information. But the opposite has happened. We are constantly distracted, addicted, manipulated and angry. But the worst is yet to come. Mark Zuckerberg hasn't reacted to the Cambridge Analytica scandal by promising to stop data harvesting. He's just promised it to be better. But when artificial intelligence really gets into its stride, our democracies will be undermined in new and unexpectedly sophisticated ways. We need to act now, before it's too late. Thank you to the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley. Digital campaigning attempts to pull people's heartstrings. What is new about that? Nothing, that is what politics has always been about, but this is a combination of using emotive messages but on a massive scale and in a way that is so perfectly targeted at individual users. That creates other problems, like it can be very difficult for regulators, or even other people, to know what each of us is receiving. If we have a perfectly tailored, targeted message, directed at our inner thoughts and feelings but nobody else sees it, it is hard for us to engage in broader public debate. We just have private, little debates. So it atomised is politics? Yes. And that really worries me. The only reason public debate works is if everyone roughly understands what everybody else is receiving and talking about. If you fundamentally change that, you are changing completely the way politics works. Is this a legitimate concern? That was one of the most articular films we have ever had and I learnt a lot from it. I don't know whether to be concerned.

But that also raises the question: \u201cIs this change permanent?\u201d   Brian Bogosian , CEO of sticky.io , joined Karen Webster for our latest This Week In Payments conversation to discuss that and other key developments affecting the industry this past week. Here\u2019s a rundown of what they discussed:   Will The Digital Shift Stick Around?     Bogosian said the digital shift was already in motion even before COVID-19, but the pandemic has certainly accelerated the trend. After all, traditional supply chains have been interrupted, and many manufacturers of consumer goods and other wares have faced disruptions to their traditional distribution methods as retailers closed.   \u201cThe landscape has been permanently altered, and I think that people will take things delivered online \u2014 even things that they would have gone to the grocery store or the drugstore for\u201d as part of their routines, Bogosian said. \u201cI think that what we\u2019re seeing now is just the beginning of a trend to move distribution of products online. And I think [it\u2019s] permanent.\u201d   Webster agreed, noting that consumers couldn\u2019t choose where to buy their products during pandemic-related lockdowns; they had to buy them online. She added that while lockdowns have lifted in some locales, many consumers still prefer digital channels because they\u2019ve established a habit of going online. They like the convenience and ease of online shopping, and eCommerce outlets have made the experience simple, she said.   Bogosian concurred, adding that financial distress at many retail chains is only speeding up consumers\u2019 digital shift.   \u201cA lot of these firms have been burdened with large amounts of debt \u2014 they certainly weren\u2019t able to modernize [and] they can\u2019t carry the inventory,\u201d he said. \u201cAs consumers go back to what they would consider to be a normal pattern of buying and then find that the things they will usually get aren\u2019t in the store, it\u2019s just going to further accelerate this movement to purchasing things online.\u201d   The Rise Of DTC    Bogosian said many mass-market brands are realizing they need to create a direct-to-consumer (DTC) relationship to maintain their position in people\u2019s homes. He predicts that as a result, more and more consumer-goods makers will be going DTC.   \u201c[Those retailers] will still be there for whatever they can do, but for \u2026 companies with quarterly earnings and drive to profitability, there\u2019s just no way they can get there without rapidly accelerating their initiatives internally to going direct to the consumer,\u201d Bogosian said.   Webster added that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which released quarterly earnings recently, made large shifts to DTC partly out of necessity, as physical channels where people consume soft drinks \u2014 stadiums, bars, restaurants, etc. \u2014 are mostly closed. If the soft-drink makers want to make up the lost volume, they have to find ways to reach customers directly, she said.   Meanwhile, Bogosian said a few startups are seeking to disrupt the traditional 7-Eleven distribution channel for convenience items, directly delivering the kinds of products that consumers usually buy at those kinds of stores.   \u201cIf you can get those things and at the same price and delivered to you, I think  \u2026 that\u2019s driving this mentality of not going to the retailer and [instead] doing things online,\u201d he said.   With such a sea change under way, Bogosian has invested in a company that builds carts that will tackle the last-mile challenge of grocery delivery.   \u201cIt\u2019ll drive up to your house and you\u2019ll unlock it from the secured cage \u2026 and then the vehicle\u2019s on its way to the next person,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the mentality of this is going to get people a lot more familiar with this whole idea of consuming from their computer or their mobile device \u2014 and also be able to get it pretty rapidly, cost-effectively.\u201d   Big Tech Takes On Capitol Hill    Also this week, the CEOs of Big Tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook faced lawmakers in a hearing before a House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.   Webster told Bogosian that she thought some of the hearing\u2019s most interesting questions and dialogue centered around competition and whom Big Tech sees as rivals. Bogosian observed that \u201cin static industries, that\u2019s a lot easier to see how competition goes. But technology is anything but static. Things are always changing, and who may be your ally today may be a \u2018frenemy\u2019 tomorrow.\u201d   He added, \u201cI think there is a role for government and regulation and monitoring because if a search engine tends to advantage a certain channel \u2026 then those kinds of things have to be monitored.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Study: Subscription Commerce Conversion Index \u2013 July 2020     Staying home 24/7 has consumers turning to subscription services for both entertainment and their day-to-day needs. While that\u2019s a great opportunity for providers, it also presents a challenge \u2014 27.4 million consumers are looking to cancel their subscriptions because of friction and cost concerns. In the latest Subscription Commerce Conversion Index , PYMNTS reveals the five key features that can help companies keep subscribers loyal despite today\u2019s challenging economic times.

Those who reneged on Amazon and its online shopping empire have had no choice but to place an order to stock up these days. The few who were not yet subscribed to video platforms like Netflix have ended up succumbing to the slow running of hours. Even those who promised that they would never order food at home through Deliveroo or UberEats have yielded to the demands of the little ones.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Foroohar:</emphasis>\"Not only will the greats grow bigger, their political power will increase\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Confinement has made technology companies a fundamental part of our new daily life.</emphasis> At this stage it is clear that these groups will be the real winners of the global health crisis caused by Covid-19 disease. If they were already giants, with billions of dollar bills, they will now be even more so. And if they already knew a lot about our behaviors, hobbies, tastes and even ways of thinking, that control will also be strengthened.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Unfortunately, I think they will become even more powerful,\"</emphasis>Financial Times columnist and editor Rana Foroohar warns by email in statements to EXPANSION. \"Not only will the big ones get bigger in the midst of the crisis - any company that is rich in cash, debt-poor and virtual will be in a good position to buy smaller players - I also suspect that their political power will increase,\" he says.<br/>Size<br/>In her book Don't Be Evil (Penguin Random House), published late last year, the author was already alerting about the enormous power and influence these companies were amassing and the need to control their size. It's what American politicians like Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been calling for for months. The two slumped already from the presidential lock.<br/>The pandemic, however, has frozen that opposite climate of opinion. Priority is no longer about investigating your practices or preventing Amazon or Google from limiting competition from your rivals. The important thing is to contain the virus and anything that may be useful is well seen by legislators. \"We will see how they will try to make further progress in areas related to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">health and finance where regulators didn't want them before,</emphasis>but which are now turn a blind eye because anything that can help cushion the Covid-19 crisis is considered the most important thing,\" says Foroohar.<br/>Google and Apple, for example, are working together on a health app to map the contacts of people infected with the virus. \"Things we would have thought impossible months ago because they are deeply unethical, such as mobile tracking of people's medical data, now seem to be widely accepted,\" says Paulo Cardullo, a researcher at the UOC's Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3), says from Italy.<br/>Change in attitude<br/>Financial is another sector where experts said their influence could increase once the crisis passes. \"I<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon enter the personal finance business and lending.</emphasis>Stripe, the payment company, has grown so much that it has created its own risk scoring system using its data. Amazon surely has enough information to do the same thing,creating her own loan credit assessment systems,\" says Lucie Greene, an innovation consultant and author of Silicon States: The Power and Politics of Big Tech and What It Means for Our Future. Loans that are going to be much needed for economic reconstruction once the health crisis has passed.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greene:</emphasis>\"In their desperation to return to normal, people will give in more data about their health\"<br/><br/>Beyond regulator restrictions, what has made the presence of these groups in the field of health or finance no greater is the resilience of many users to share their most sensitive data. Something that might be close to changing. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"In their desperation for things to return to normal, people are becoming more open to sharing information with technology.</emphasis> This can lead to a radical change in the way people view health and finance managed by Big Tech. Efficiency and ease can replace privacy concerns,\" says Greene.<br/>Michael Cusumano goes a step further and believes that this change in perception by the public has already occurred. \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There is no doubt that the coronavirus has changed our view of digital platforms.</emphasis> Much of the work, socialization, education, and entertainment that we used to have face-to-face now we see that it is possible to do it more safely over the Internet,\" says the professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by videoconference. Cusumano believes that this intensive use of online services \"will continue for a year or two and probably a portion of users will continue to use them later.\"<br/>Solidarity<br/>Every crisis is an opportunity, and in the case of Silicon Valley companies, it can help repair your image after years of sanctions and criticism for restricting competition and violating user privacy.<br/>Since the pandemic began, companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple or Microsoft, among others, have shown their most supportive side: mobilizing millions to help companies, opening their platforms for free, donating masks and sanitary equipment or getting involved in the fight against misinformation. Also tycoons such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos or Twitter founder Jack Dorsey have aboarded the man. The first contributed $100 million to U.S. food banks, while Dorsey announced that he will donate $1 billion to charitable causes.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cardullo:</emphasis>\"This \"solidarity\" more closely resembles a marketing campaign hidden behind a humanitarian face\"<br/><br/>It's what Greene calls big tech philanthropy. \"That<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">these companies help is certainly a positive thing, but donations are scarce compared to what could be achieved if they will pay all their taxes,\"</emphasis>the author says. An investigation by the US Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that during the first year of Trump 91's tax reform of companies confirming the Fortune 500, the largest in the country for revenue, they managed not to pay a single dollar to the Treasury. The report points to Amazon or Netflix among the firms that paid no tax in 2018.<br/>In this line, Cardullo, of the UOC, believes that these companies should be more involved, especially considering that they will benefit big when everything happens. \"The effects of these measures are likely to generate more long-term benefits for these digital giants. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This \"solidarity\" is more like a marketing campaign hidden behind a face</emphasis>humanitarian,\" he says.<br/>The Italian researcher believes that the main unwanted effect of this crisis will be \"intensifying the surveillance of high-tech companies and states over citizens.\" \"I am afraid that the totalitarian accessibility of these new technologies will last a long time,\" he adds.<br/>Cusumano, of MIT, warns that \"increased use also increases a potential misuse of customer data for political and other purposes.\" And remember that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"platforms still need to focus more on user security and governance rules, rather than just growing and earning more and more money.\"</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-11990440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSW-2KC1-DY1R-B433-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Everything is evolving at an almost unimaginable speed. New tools, techniques, iterations, breakthroughs, and game-changing discoveries happen almost daily. Today, just staying on top of what's happening is practically a full-time job. </p><p>This raises a question: If free unencumbered commercial enterprises are struggling to keep up with the pace of change, what hope do governments have? We've seen this question asked many times this year. Facebook, Google, and Twitter all testified before Congress about data privacy. The big telcos have been lobbying for favorable pathways to 5G. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect, and American legislators are thinking about a version suitable for the United States. But all of this is symptomatic of a larger problem. We have evolved past our current business rules, regulations, and laws.  Our Founding Fathers were exceptionally smart, well-educated people with a common goal. Many of them were very deep thinkers. So, it should not surprise you that Thomas Jefferson, principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776), the second vice president of the United States (1797-1801), and the third president of the United States (1801-1809), thought deeply about laws and institutions. Here's an excerpt from a letter Jefferson wrote to Samuel Kercheval on July 12, 1816. I added the paragraph breaks to make it easier to read. The text in bold is carved into panel four of the Jefferson Memorial. He writes: Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the arc of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment. I knew that age well; I belonged to it, and labored with it. It deserved well of its country. It was very like the present, but without the experience of the present; and forty years of experience in government is worth a century of book-reading; and this they would say themselves, were they to rise from the dead.I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.It is this preposterous idea which has lately deluged Europe in blood. Their monarchs, instead of wisely yielding to the gradual change of circumstances, of favoring progressive accommodation to progressive improvement, have clung to old abuses, entrenched themselves behind steady habits, and obliged their subjects to seek through blood and violence rash and ruinous innovations, which, had they been referred to the peaceful deliberations and collected wisdom of the nation, would have been put into acceptable and salutary forms.Let us follow no such examples, nor weakly believe that one generation is not as capable as another of taking care of itself, and of ordering its own affairs. Let us, as our sister States have done, avail ourselves of our reason and experience, to correct the crude essays of our first and unexperienced, although wise, virtuous, and well-meaning councils. And lastly, let us provide in our constitution for its revision at stated periods. What these periods should be, nature herself indicates. By the European tables of mortality, of the adults living at any one moment of time, a majority will be dead in about nineteen years. At the end of that period, then, a new majority is come into place; or, in other words, a new generation.Each generation is as independent as the one preceding, as that was of all which had gone before. It has then, like them, a right to choose for itself the form of government it believes most promotive of its own happiness; consequently, to accommodate to the circumstances in which it finds itself, that received from its predecessors; and it is for the peace and good of mankind, that a solemn opportunity of doing this every nineteen or twenty years, should be provided by the constitution; so that it may be handed on, with periodical repairs, from generation to generation, to the end of time, if anything human can so long endure. Jefferson's words are still prescient and profound 202 years on. It is time for smart, well-educated people to debate the scientific and technological issues facing the United States (and the rest of the world) and then empower our government to act in the best interest of the people. We can start with climate change and AI. Proper strategies to deal with both of these by-products of human innovation and technological progress will go a long way toward solving most, if not all, of our other issues.This Can Never HappenYes, it can! First, become well educated on climate change, on AI, or on both of those subjects. Commit to the practice of lifelong learning and advocate to your inner circle - the people you influence the most. Empower them to do the same. Social media will do the rest. I don't have the answers to the problems of climate change or how to regulate or control the advent of AI, but Thomas Jefferson's thoughts make me optimistic about our potential to come together for our common good. If we don't, we won't be doomed to remain ever under the regimen of our barbarous ancestors we won't be here at all. Author's note:This is not a sponsored post.

At a strike price of \u20ac17.50 ($21.44), once the bonds are converted the investment will give Silver Lake a 7.5% stake in Thomson.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The investment is Silver Lake's biggest to date, the first from its recently closed $3.6 billion second fund, and its first direct investment in a European-quoted company. \"This investment underscores our confidence in Thomson's growth and value potential,\" David Roux, a founding principal of Silver Lake, said in a statement. Roux, who will join Thomson's board pending shareholder approval of the deal, did not return calls for further comment.</p><p>Thomson, which owns the Technicolor and Grass Valley film services companies in the U.S., said the deal was designed to accelerate its development and would be accompanied by a management overhaul, a warrant issue and plans for a share buy-back.</p><p>Shares in Thomson, quoted on Euronext Paris, have fallen 9% since the beginning of the year. Thursday they added 5.1% to \u20ac15.43. One Paris analyst, who declined to be named, said: \"Capital development companies rarely invest in technology companies and usually do so when they know a company is spectacularly undervalued.\"</p><p>Thomson is chaired by former UBSinvestment banker <person><nameText>Frank Dangeard, </nameText></person>who is to become chief executive. He was formerly deputy chief executive, but went non-executive in 2002 when he was hired by France T\u00e9l\u00e9com SA along with former Thomson executive chairman Thierry Breton to help restructure the over-borrowed operator.</p><p>\"Silver Lake is not first and foremost about cash. It is a strategic relationship and a validation of who we are,\" Dangeard said in a conference call.</p><p>Thomson shareholders will vote on the deal at a special meeting Sept. 15.</p><p>Roux is already a director of French software group Business Objects SA, in which Silver Lake acquired a stake last December after it acquired Palo Alto, Calif.-based Crystal Decisions Inc.</p><p>Richard Morrissey, a partner at Thomson's legal adviser, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP, said Dangeard and Roux would make a formidable industrial team.</p><p>\"Roux has been an operating guy all his life,\" said Morrissey, \"and Dangeard is one of the great business leaders in Europe today. He used to be a banker, but his day job is fixing companies.\"</p><p>The Thomson deal follows another big tech investment by Silver Lake that closed earlier this year, the $2.05 billion buyout of Electronic Data Systems Corp.'s UGS PLM Solutions unit with Bain Capital LLC of Boston and Warburg Pincus LLC of New York.</p><p>It also follows the establishment of a new California investment firm, Elevation Partners, by one of Silver Lake's chief founders, Roger McNamee, former Electronic Arts president John Riccitiello and ex-Silver Lake director Marc Bodnick. McNamee is an advisory director at Silver Lake.</p><p>Elevation Partners, which invests in consumer media and entertainment businesses, gained further notoriety in June when rock group U2's lead singer, Bono, joined as a managing director.</p><p>News of the Silver Lake deal Thursday accompanied first-half results from Thomson that were hit hard by exceptional restructuring charges that ate into the company's cash reserves. Operating income rose \u20ac7 million to \u20ac146 million on revenues that increased 8.2% to \u20ac3.87 billion. But net losses doubled to \u20ac189 million after \u20ac105 million of restructuring charges.</p><p>Dangeard, however, said second quarter growth had exceeded the company's expectations and 2004 earnings before interest, taxation and amortization should rise 40% from last year's \u20ac252 million.</p><p>He also confirmed regulatory approvals have been granted for the merger of Thomson's consumer electronics business with that of TCL International Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong. He said the joint venture, which enables Thomson's phased withdrawal from consumer electronics, would be fully operational by the end of the month.</p><p>Besides its movie-making technology assets, Thomson is a world leader in DVD technology, and in May it agreed to pay up to $400 million for the set-top box making plants of Hughes Network Systems Inc. of Germantown, Md.</p><p>Thomson said part of the proceeds could be used for a \u20ac400 million share buyback announced Thursday of 10% of its equity.</p><p>Thomson took investment banking advice from a Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. team lead by Jean Rabey. The bank has advised Thomson on a string of recent deals, including the acquisition of Technicolor. The bank was also advised by a team from BNP Paribas SA.</p><p>A Sullivan &amp; Cromwell team that included Morrissey in London and Richard Pollack in New York provided legal advice.</p><p>The deal is the latest in a winning run in France for Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. The firm advised Alcan Inc.'s $5.98 billion acquisition last year of French rival Pechiney SA and guided pharma group Aventis SA on its $61 billion merger with Paris rival Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo.

I am David Thomson, Chairman of Thomson Reuters. I shall be chairing the proceedings today.</p><p>We regret being unable to meet in person this year. The health and safety of our communities, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders are our top priority during these unprecedented times. We decided to hold today's meeting virtually, in light of ongoing developments regarding COVID-19, similar to most other public companies that have held AGMs this spring. We have webcast our annual meeting for several years. But this is the first year that AGM is completely virtual. Our goal is to approximate the experience of a meeting held in person, including the opportunity to participate in the meeting and for shareholders and proxy holders to vote and submit questions.</p><p>I am joined on the webcast today by Steve Hasker, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board; Mike Eastwood, our Chief Financial Officer; David Binet, our Deputy Chairman; Vance Opperman, our Lead Independent Director; Tom Kim, our Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary; Mary-Alice Vuicic, our Chief People Officer; Alex Thompson, our Chief Communications Officer.</p><p>This is the first AGM for Steve and Mike as our new CEO and CFO. Steve joined us in February and Mike has been with Thomson Reuters for about 20 years in different finance leadership roles. I'm delighted to welcome both of them to the annual meeting and introduce them to you, our shareholders. Other members of the Board of Directors and the company's senior management team are also joining us today by teleconference on a dedicated line or through the webcast. The company's auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are also on the dedicated teleconference line today.</p><p>I would like to briefly outline the format of the meeting. First, I will deal with the formal business of the meeting as outlined in the circular. I will then make a few general comments on our business. Our CEO, Steve Hasker, will then comment on our 2019 performance and the company's response to and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following that, we will answer questions or comments from shareholders.</p><p>While the format I have outlined will assist in the handling of the formal matters, it is not intended to discourage anyone from asking a question or making a comment. In reference to any resolution after it has been proposed and seconded. We will address any questions that directly relate to a particular resolution at the appropriate time during the meeting and we will save general questions for the question-and-answer period following the formal business of the meeting.</p><p>I will now go through the instructions that will allow shareholders and proxy holders to vote during the meeting and submit questions. If you logged into the meeting as a guest, you will be able to listen to the meeting, but you will not be able to vote or submit questions.</p><p>(Operator Instructions) Later in the meeting, Alex Thompson, our Chief Communications Officer, will read questions which will be addressed by an appropriate member of Thomson Reuters management or the Board. If there are questions on the same topic or that seem to be repetitive, we will look to address one of them and mention that we received other similar questions.</p><p>(Operator Instructions) We will respond to as many questions as possible during the meeting. If we are not able to address any questions during the meeting, we plan to post questions and answers on our website after the meeting. We also plan to post a recording of this meeting on the thomsonreuters.com website after the meeting.</p><p>I would like to note that today's meeting contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks discussed in reports and filings that we provide from time to time to regulatory agencies. You may access these documents on our website or by contacting our Investor Relations department.</p><p>Now on to voting. As is generally the case, the vast majority of shareholders have submitted their votes in advance of the meeting and only a very small number of shareholders have decided to vote at the meeting. I want to thank all those shareholders who exercised their vote -- their right to vote, in advance.</p><p>Voting during the meeting can only be done through our virtual meeting platform. To vote, you should have logged into the meeting as a shareholder by following the log in instructions contained in the voting information and how to attend section of the circular. If you voted in advance of the meeting and you do not wish to revoke your previously submitted proxies, you should have logged into the virtual meeting platform as a guest.</p><p>If you previously voted and logged into today's meeting as a shareholder, you should vote again during the meeting. A voting panel will be displayed on your screen when it is time to vote on a particular resolution or item of business. After you vote, a message confirming that your vote has been received should appear. If you do not click for, against, withheld or abstain as applicable when voting is open, your vote will not be recorded, and you will be considered to have abstained from voting.</p><p>Voting will remain open for all matters being voted on until the last item of formal business has concluded. Votes may be changed up to the time that voting is closed.</p><p>We will have 4 items of business today for shareholders to vote upon: the election of directors, the appointment of the auditor, an advisory resolution on executive compensation and a shareholder proposal. All of the matters to be considered today require the approval of a simple majority of votes cast.</p><p>The polls are now open on all matters. I've asked Tom Kim to act as Secretary of the meeting, and I would like to ask Tom to table the notice, calling the meeting and proof that such notice and the related circular and proxy forms, have been distributed or made available to shareholders.</p><p>THOMAS SANG KIM, CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER &amp; COMPANY SECRETARY, THOMSON REUTERS CORPORATION: Mr. Chairman, I have done so.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Tom. I will ask Tom and Steve to move and second motions put before the meeting as proxy holders. Shareholders and proxy holders logged into the virtual meeting platform will be able to vote on each resolution or item of business.</p><p>I have appointed representatives of our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, to act as scrutineers of the meeting. They have advised me that a quorum is present. We will conduct the vote on each resolution by ballot. The ballots will be tabulated and the results announced before the end of the meeting.</p><p>I will now ask Tom Kim to table the consolidated financial statements of the corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the auditor's report thereon.</p><p>THOMAS SANG KIM: Mr. Chairman, I have done so.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Tom. A copy of the annual report, including the financial statements, has been made available to shareholders and is available in the Investor Relations section on your website at thomsonreuters.com.</p><p>Steve Hasker will be commenting upon these results in a few minutes. Should anyone have any questions relating to the annual report, the financial statements or questions of a more general nature, we would be pleased to respond to them following Steve's remarks.</p><p>The first item of business is the election of directors. 12 directors are to be elected at the meeting this year. Information regarding the nominees proposed for election as directors is set out in the circular that accompanied the notice of this meeting.</p><p>I now declare the meeting open for nominations.</p><p>THOMAS SANG KIM: Mr. Chairman, I nominate David Thomson, Steve Hasker, Kirk E. Arnold, David W. Binet, W. Edmund Clark, Michael E. Daniels, Kirk Koenigsbauer, Vance K. Opperman, Kim M. Rivera, Barry Salzberg, Peter J. Thomson, and Wulf von Schimmelmann as directors of the corporation to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are duly elected or appointed.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Tom. I note that Sheila Bair and Kristin Peck are not standing for reelection this year, and I will thank them for their service in a few minutes.</p><p>Alex, have we received any questions or comments on this item?</p><p>ALEX THOMPSON, CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER, THOMSON REUTERS CORPORATION: Mr. Chairman, no, we have not.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Alex. If there are no further nominations, I declare the nominations closed.</p><p>We will now proceed with voting on this matter. If you have not voted yet, please look now by selecting for or withhold as it appears below the name of each individual director on the voting panel.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: We will now proceed with the next item of business, which is the appointment of the auditor. I now ask Tom to make this motion.</p><p>THOMAS SANG KIM: Mr. Chairman, I move that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the appointed auditor of the corporation until the next annual meeting of shareholders and that the directors be authorized to fix their remuneration.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Tom. I now ask Steve to second that motion.</p><p>STEPHEN JOHN HASKER, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, THOMSON REUTERS CORPORATION: Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Steve. Alex, have we received any questions or comments on this item?</p><p>ALEX THOMPSON: Mr. Chairman, no, we have not.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Alex. If you have not voted yet, please vote now by selecting for or withhold for this item.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: The next item of business is the advisory resolution on our approach to executive compensation described in the circular. As this is an advisory resolution, the results will not be binding on the Board. However, the Board intends to take the voting results into account. As appropriate when considering future compensation matters. This type of resolution is often referred to as a say-on-pay vote. This item of business is described in the circular. I now ask Tom to make this motion.</p><p>THOMAS SANG KIM: Mr. Chairman, I move that the advisory resolution on executive compensation set forth in the 2020 management proxy circular be approved.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Tom. I now ask Steve to second that motion.</p><p>STEPHEN JOHN HASKER: Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Steve. Alex, have we received any questions or comments on this item?</p><p>ALEX THOMPSON: Mr. Chairman, no, we have not.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Alex. If you have not voted yet, please vote now by selecting for or against for this item.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: The final item of business before Steve Hasker and I make our remarks and you have an opportunity to ask questions, is a shareholder proposal submitted by the B.C. Government and Service Employees Union General Fund and the B.C. Government and Service Employees Union Defense Fund.</p><p>The shareholder proposal is set out in Appendix B of the circular. Appendix B of the circular also includes a statement from the Thomson Reuters Board of Directors, explaining the reasons why we have recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal.</p><p>At this time, I would ask Emma Pullman, the representative of the B.C. Government and Service Employees Union General Fund and the B.C. Government and Service Employees Union Defense Fund, present the shareholder proposal and make a motion that it be put to a vote.</p><p>I understand that Amandeep Sandhu will then second the motion.</p><p>EMMA PULLMAN: Good morning, shareholders. BCGEU shareholder proposal, as outlined in Appendix B of the proxy circular, asks Thomson Reuters Board to prepare a human rights risk report related to its contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, known as ICE, to provide its CLEAR software.</p><p>Proxy advisory firm, ISS, agrees that Thomson Reuters shareholders need more information on whether Thomson Reuters has breached its obligations under the UN Global Compact and whether Thomson Reuters should be adopting the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Glass Lewis states, and I quote, \"Given recent controversies concerning the use of technologies such as Thomson Reuters' CLEAR by ICE, the company's product offering could present significant reputational and human rights related risks.</p><p>Glass Lewis' own research into this controversy points to troubling media reports that indicate that ICE is using the CLEAR software to circumvent regulations that might prevent the government from directly collecting certain types of information such as information on social media. Glass Lewis believes that Thomson Reuters needs to provide additional reporting on how the company is mitigating adverse human rights impact from its product and it recommends that Thomson Reuters shareholders vote in favor of this proposal.</p><p>In its response to the proposal, Thomson Reuters points to its trust principles and says that it must remain impartial on the topic of whether its products are contributing to human rights abuses. It says it cannot take sides.</p><p>Thomson Reuters relies on click wrapped confirmation from ICE agents that the use of CLEAR is consistent with domestic U.S. law. This mouse button confirmation constitutes the entirety of Thomson Reuters' due diligence into whether its products are being used to carry out violations of international human rights.</p><p>Thomson Reuters' defense does not stand up to scrutiny. Instead it lays bare serious concerns with Thomson Reuters' approaches to risk management. The outcome of this vote is predetermined. Woodbridge will likely vote at 327 million shares against the proposal in the hopes that this issue and us will go away, but we will not go away. By voting against the proposal, Woodbridge is saying that it is comfortable with the company's exposure to human rights risk. Perhaps Woodbridge, through its 4 board seats, has ample information to support this position. As Glass Lewis points out, however, this information, if it exists, has not yet been shared with minority shareholders.</p><p>We call on all shareholders, including Woodbridge to support the following resolution and require the company to properly assess the risk of these adverse human rights impact. Resolved, shareholders request the Board produce a human rights risk report at reasonable cost and admitting proprietary information addressing how Thomson Reuters assesses its role in contributing to and being directly linked to human rights impacts by end users, how Thomson Reuters mitigates its role in contributing to adverse human rights impact from end users.</p><p>Whether Thomson Reuters remains in compliance with the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, and whether Thomson Reuters' failure to invoke the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights is out of step with fair market practice, particularly where reputational damage may have a material adverse effect on the company's business.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Ms. Pullman. May I have a seconder for that motion?</p><p>AMANDEEP SANDHU: Yes. This is Amandeep Sandhu and I second that motion.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Mr. Sandhu. Ms. Pullman, we appreciate your comments, and I would like to acknowledge the thoughtfulness of the shareholder proposal.</p><p>Prior to this meeting, Thomson Reuters engaged in a dialogue with the shareholders, which provided us with an opportunity to hear their perspectives and for us to share ours. Perhaps we could take a minute to comment on the proposal.</p><p>While the proxy circular contains a detailed response from our Board, I would like to ask Steve Hasker to make a few remarks.</p><p>STEPHEN JOHN HASKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I'd be happy to. As the new CEO, it's been evident to me that Thomson Reuters employees take their roles as good corporate citizens very seriously. Our people consider our company a place that helps them play a positive role in society. I'll summarize a few points about the thoughtful proposal, which tackles an important topic.</p><p>For those not familiar with them, the investigative products that we provide are primarily used by law enforcement and government agencies to assist them with the challenging work of tackling crime and threats to global security and public safety. These tools provide information in a simple way for professionals to use in the course of their work.</p><p>Importantly, the use of these tools and some of the data reflected in them are regulated under U.S. law. The people who can use these tools are restricted and the purposes for which they can be used are restricted. Each time an authorized vetted professional logs in, they must certify that they are using the tool for a specific legally-permissible use. And finally, employers can review the use of these products in detail. If we were to discover illegal use, it would be investigated and action would be taken.</p><p>For the reasons outlined in the proxy circular, our management team and our Board of Directors are confident in the various mechanisms we have in place to reflect our company's commitment to respecting human rights.</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to share this, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Steve. Alex, have we received any questions or comments on this item?</p><p>ALEX THOMPSON: Mr. Chairman, no, we have not.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: If you have not voted yet, please vote now by selecting for, against or abstain for this item. I would like to remind you that the Thomson Reuters Board of Directors has recommended voting against this proposal for the reasons outlined in the circular. If you haven't already and wish to do so, please ensure you have cast your votes through the online platform. The polls will close momentarily.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: While we are waiting for the results of the voting, we will proceed to the other business of the meeting.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. The virtual nature of our gathering is a symptom of uncertain times. Our thoughts are with everyone affected directly or indirectly, by recent events in Minneapolis, St. Paul, where a great number of our employees are based. They are happening whilst we confront the worst global health crisis in generations, trust in information and institutions is coveted.</p><p>For our business, the confluence of content and technology continues to disrupt our customers' working lives. Regulatory complexity continues at pace. The sectors and customers we serve, rely upon us, and especially so in trying times. Reuters journalists and photo journalists have offered the world an extraordinary array of facts and imagery during the COVID crisis. We are better informed through their passion, integrity, courage, independence and freedom from bias. We are privileged to support our customers and the work they do to strengthen society.</p><p>The trust they place in us is sacred. Thomson Reuters has long prided itself on deep customer relationships, buttressed by world-class products and exceptional talent. Our leading positions, subscription model and strong balance sheet allow us the stability and confidence to look beyond the horizon. With this foundation, we look to the future with optimism, prudence and humility. We shall continue to innovate and empower talent to our customers' advantage. We aspire to lead through every stage of their digital transformation, providing the insights and tools required to enable their decisions with confidence.</p><p>As I stated in my last year's comments, the customer will define our success. We shall endeavor to deliver an enriched experience and pursue new horizons alongside them. The goodwill of our shareholders has been a hallmark of our company since its inception. We remain truly grateful for their unswerving support. Lastly, our employees warrant our sincere gratitude for selfless dedication and effort amidst difficult times indeed.</p><p>Three new directors have joined our Board since our last shareholder meeting: Kim Rivera, Kirk Arnold and Kirk Koenigsbauer. We welcome their rich experience and unique perspectives to the boardroom. I also extend my deep gratitude to our outgoing directors: Sheila Bair, who has been with us since 2014, served on the Audit Committee and as Chair of the Risk Committee; Kristin Peck, who has been on our Board since 2016, served on the Corporate Governance and HR committees. Sheila and Kristin have both made significant contributions to Thomson Reuters, and we extend our gratitude and warmest wishes.</p><p>I would also like to acknowledge Jim Smith and Stephane Bello, whose stewardship has allowed our company to realize its potential to date. Jim spent over 3 decades with our company and had served as our CEO since 2012. While Stephane assumed the role of CFO in 2012 after joining our company in 2001. We thank them both for their long dedicated service and thoughtful leadership, as well as their continued efforts to support the transition.</p><p>It is my privilege to welcome Steve Hasker, the company's President and CEO since March 15 to make some remarks. Steve's strong intellect, people skills and passion for innovation make him a welcome addition to our company, and all of us are delighted that he's taken the helm.</p><p>STEPHEN JOHN HASKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, this is my first time joining you for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting since my appointment as President and CEO in March. It's truly a pleasure to be here even virtually with you all.</p><p>When I joined Thomson Reuters, it quickly became clear that this company has incredible people, smart, talented and dedicated. This has proven to be particularly true during this challenging time. So first and foremost, I want to acknowledge and extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to all of our associates across the business and in every market as they step-up for our customers and our partners. Their well-being and safety will continue to be our #1 priority.</p><p>I also want to thank the frontline workers across the world, who are supporting us through COVID-19. This includes our fantastic Reuters journalists, who work hard to undercover the unbiased truth, bringing facts and insight around the globe. We can't thank them enough for their courage and their dedication.</p><p>Reinforcing the Chairman's earlier remarks, our associates in Minneapolis have been deeply impacted by the recent events there. In response, Thomson Reuters will both invest to help rebuild local communities and enable greater volunteer time amongst our associates there.</p><p>The work that our associates do matters. Thomson Reuters provides trusted information, expertise and insight that people and businesses can act on. When you take a step back and you look at a world in flux, our people are helping to strengthen the foundations of society. The strong position we find ourselves in today is thanks in part to the efforts of leadership before us, including most recently, Jim Smith and Stephane Bello. So I am deeply grateful for this opportunity to build on their efforts and to steward the business through its next phase. I want to thank them for their continued guidance.</p><p>I'd also like to acknowledge the hard work and service of our 2 outgoing directors: Sheila Bair and Kristin Peck. We thank them for their contributions to the company, and we wish them the best.</p><p>Today, I'll focus my remarks on 3 areas: first, I'll give a brief recap of our recent performance, including expectations for the rest of this year. Second, I'll share with you why we believe Thomson Reuters is well positioned to navigate the challenges brought on by the pandemic. And finally, I'll touch on ways Thomson Reuters is helping our customers, communities and economies move forward.</p><p>Clearly, the world we find ourselves in is vastly different from where we were in 2019 or even just a few months ago. But our performance in 2019 shows the underlying resilience of our business and how we're now on our firmest footing in many years. 2019 was the first full year since the company sold the majority interest in our former financial and risk business, which created Refinitiv. We achieved organic revenue growth of 4%, which marked the eighth consecutive year that Thomson Reuters met or exceeded its guidance targets.</p><p>Our Q1 2020 performance was also solid, with reported and organic revenues, both up 2%. Our big 3 segments: Legal Professionals, Corporates and Tax &amp; Accounting Professionals, which make up 80% of our revenues, recorded 4% organic growth. Importantly, recurring revenues, the subscription sales that are bedrock of our business, were also up 4% organically.</p><p>Given the level of uncertainty from the pandemic, we felt it was important to be as transparent as possible in sharing the potential impact on our business. So when we announced our Q1 earnings in May, we updated our business outlook to reflect how we expect to perform over the remainder of the year. We now forecast full year 2020 revenue growth to be between 1% and 2%, with organic growth between 0% and 1%. Our lower revenue growth forecast as compared to our original outlook, is primarily related to the Reuters Events business, which has had to cancel its in-person conferences as well as lower one-off transactional revenues. Two additional factors are projected: lower sales in the big 3 segments and lower global print revenues.</p><p>As part of our update, we also provided new full year 2020 guidance for our big 3 segments. We expect revenues for these businesses to grow between 3% and 4%, and achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin between 36% and 37%. I also want to be clear that our updated guidance reflected a current view at the time. Our Q1 report includes more information about the different scenarios and assumptions that we considered in developing the new forecasts. We'll provide another update on our outlook when we report our second quarter results in August.</p><p>Now I'll take a few minutes to tell you why I believe Thomson Reuters is better positioned than most companies to weather this storm and how we will remain focused on helping to advance the industries and communities that we serve. We're fortunate to have a very diverse client base of around 500,000 customers across varied markets, with no individual customer other than our Refinitiv partnership, accounting for more than 2% of total revenues.</p><p>Let's look at our big 3 core businesses that comprise nearly 80% of our total company revenues, the Legal, Corporates, and Tax &amp; Accounting segments. Each of these businesses is predominantly subscription-based, has very high retention rates and enjoys leading positions.</p><p>Within the Legal Professionals segments, all of the Global 100 law firms are customers; for Corporates, the same goes for all of the Fortune 100 companies; and in Tax &amp; Accounting, all of the top 100 U.S. CPA firms. This powerful, diverse customer base depends on our much must have products and solutions. These businesses have historically been resilient over decades, including through other challenging situations like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>Time and again, clients rely on us to help them navigate uncertainty and now is no exception, and we've seen product usage remain high. This really speaks to the quality and value of our premium, digital and increasingly AI-powered solutions and we're always working hard to expand these offerings.</p><p>In 2019, we bolstered the already successful Westlaw Edge with Quick Check, an AI-based review analysis tool for lawyers. And we launched Checkpoint Edge, an innovative AI-driven tax and accounting research tool. Increasingly, our products not only provide access to critical content and data, but also help our clients manage their workflow, while collaborating with peers and in turn with their clients. I continue to believe that Thomson Reuters is well positioned financially with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position that will allow us to maintain our focus and investments where they need to be, on our customers.</p><p>We are also operationally strong. In March, the company swiftly adapted, moving 98% of our workforce to working from home. It was impressive to see. Our customers have to go through the same. In so many industries and markets, changes that might have taken years are now happening in a matter of weeks. Lawyers and accountants are in need -- a real need of more cloud-based and technology-driven models. Law firms have long recognized the need to digitize and invest in technology in order to best compete. But now they must do so in order to properly serve their clients.</p><p>On the government side, agencies as well as federal, state and local courts have traditionally taken time to adopt new technologies and ways of working. But given today's circumstance, they must accelerate, and we will help them through this.</p><p>So how are we helping businesses and communities move forward? At the start of the pandemic, we launched a COVID-19 resource Center on our website, tr.com, to provide free resources created by our legal and tax experts. To date, thousands of customers joined these free webinars.</p><p>In the U.S., as many courts around the country closed, our court case management system worked quickly and effectively to help get them up and running virtually. And our Government business is actively contributing to the fight against COVID-19. They have been using investigative analytic and data science skills to help the U.S. government prevent the unlawful importation of counterfeit COVID-19 test kits and other unlicensed medical equipment. And as mentioned, Reuters News has been delivering outstanding coverage of COVID-19. They've been covering this story from every angle in a way that no other news organization could, while strictly adhering to the trust principles of integrity, independence and freedom from bias. They've also consistently been ahead of competition on coronavirus news, building new levels of audience engagement.</p><p>I separately want to congratulate the Reuters team on yet another Pulitzer Prize win. This time, in the Breaking News Photography category, for their coverage of the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. They were also named a finalist in international reporting for their series of exclusives and investigations into the same story. Under the leadership of Editor-in-Chief, Steve Adler, Reuters has earned nearly 1,000 journalism award recognitions and won 7 Pulitzer Prizes in the last 8 years. It's great to see the team's talent and dedication now regularly recognized by some of journalism's highest honors.</p><p>And finally, I'd like to underscore the work we're doing to combat misinformation, both promoting media literacy and partnering with big tech companies to help them verify fact from fake. That will become more and more important.</p><p>So during this extraordinary time, you can see that the work we're doing is becoming more, not less, valuable to our clients. Amid rapid transformation and uncertainty, we are here to support them in every way possible. Not only should this lead to deeper relationships with our clients. But I believe this can help create a stronger and more informed society on the other side.</p><p>I hope this short summary of where we are today has been useful, and I look forward to hearing from and getting to know more of you in the weeks, months and years to come.</p><p>We would now like to take this opportunity to take questions or comment. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.</p><p>ALEX THOMPSON: Mr. Chairman, we have no questions at this time.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Alex. I will now report on the voting tabulation.</p><p>I'm pleased to report that the 12 directors standing for election have been elected as directors of the corporation, to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are duly elected or appointed.</p><p>I can also report that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been appointed as auditor of the corporation until the next annual meeting of shareholders and that the directors have been authorized to fix their remuneration.</p><p>I can confirm that the advisory resolution on our approach to executive compensation has been approved. And finally, I can confirm that the shareholder proposal set forth in the circular has not been approved.</p><p>The details of the voting results will be made publicly available in the next few days. I believe Tom has a motion to terminate the meeting.</p><p>THOMAS SANG KIM: Mr. Chairman, I move that the meeting terminate.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Tom. I now ask Steve to second that motion.</p><p>STEPHEN JOHN HASKER: Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.</p><p>DAVID KENNETH ROY THOMSON: Thank you, Steve. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this meeting. I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for attending our virtual annual meeting today.</p><p>On behalf of Thomson Reuters and our Board, we wish you -- wish for you health and safety. This meeting is now terminated. Thank you all.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

I am pleased to have with me today Mr. David Craig, President of the Financial and Risk segment of Thomson Reuters, the Company's largest division. David joined Thomson in 2007 as Chief Strategy Officer, before becoming founder and President of the Governance and Risk &amp; Compliance business. He was previously a partner at McKinsey. So, thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID CRAIG, PRESIDENT FINANCIAL &amp; RISK, THOMSON REUTERS CORPORATION: Thanks, Andre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDRE BENJAMIN: So I'll just jump in with a few questions here and hopefully leave some room for those that have some at the end. First, Thomson is a pretty big collection of diverse businesses -- and what some would argue unrelated businesses -- between the Financial and Risk business and then the Legal, Tax, and Science business.</p><p>You're in the middle of a turnaround. I guess, once that turnaround is complete do you think that we should be talking about separating the business, or not?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, the market segments are quite diverse, Tax to Legal to IP &amp; Science to Financial Services. However, we've been pretty deliberate, saying that we are going for an enterprise strategy.</p><p>As well as running Financial and Risk I have another job, which is I am for our ExCom in charge of platforms and content platforms across the Company. We are starting to build and extract leverage from that opportunity.</p><p>Just one example: we probably scrape on any day across all of our businesses 100 million websites. Rather than have 100 million tools to go after 100 million websites, we've decided that we're having a single approach, what we call an enterprise content platform, to do that.</p><p>We get leverage from sharing that technology, that capability. It also means that we can actually link our data and join our data and make it more valuable to each business unit.</p><p>A great example: company data. We probably have more company data than any other corporation in the world. We have introduced a [non-elective] share symbology that can identify companies. We are rolling that out that every piece of content across all of our businesses use the same company identifier.</p><p>What does that mean? It means when I pull patent data for a company into, say, our Financial Services, it's automatically linked to the companies that own the patents. Investors want to see that. Traders want to see that.</p><p>Likewise, I can share Risk data to our supply chain software products in Tax &amp; Accounting. So we start to see a lot more leverage and synergy on the content side.</p><p>Another great example, take data centers. We now share our technology infrastructure across all of the businesses. We're highly intense data businesses. We share the data centers; we share the technology underneath it; we share the operations staff that support them.</p><p>So we get tremendous leverage around the world. It means we can shut down some centers. We can reduce costs. We can put best practices in place to do that.</p><p>Then last but not least on the enterprise side, banks -- you may not have noticed this -- are big consumers of legal advice and legal services (laughter). Because of our relationships we have with the largest banks, we actually sell a lot of Legal services under the brand of Thomson Reuters and the idea that we can provide a single trusted relationship, a single brand to do that. And that's been a big growth driver for our Legal business.</p><p>Those three things, honestly, we have only just started. We are probably 12 months into the journey, and there is a lot more we can do to continue the cost-saving and the leverage and the flow-through.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: That is helpful. So the Financials business, as I did mention, is undergoing a bit of a -- a number of major migrations. These include the legacy FX platforms, the buy-side customers shifting to a unified platform, and rationalizing some headcount, and a few other initiatives.</p><p>Could you maybe update us on where you stand in those efforts, how you're progressing maybe versus some of the original benchmarks you put out there for the Street? And any new developments since you last reported?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, let me just talk about that. For the three years I've been in this role, we've been radically simplifying and turning ourselves basically from a product company to a platform business.</p><p>Yes, we started with over 850 products. Very complex, very siloed. We have radically reduced that; we're somewhere around about 200 at the moment, and we're deliberately going to three platforms.</p><p>Now that journey is well underway. Well over halfway through that.</p><p>You mentioned three big programs that we are executing on this year and next: the new network, the BON migration to Elektron, asset management, FX. BON migration to Elektron, this has been a massive rewire of the world's financial centers and the trading floors around the world, thousands of them. We are delighted; couldn't be happier with the progress.</p><p>We have a brand new network out there. It's the leading network for real-time connectivity in financial services. We are well on target. We'll be done by the end of the year.</p><p>But it's not just about the tens of millions of costs that takes out. It's faster, it's cheaper for us and our clients.</p><p>Just an example, August 24 when the Chinese market corrected, that was an extraordinary day of high volatility. We supported 33 billion message updates on that network that day. We ran 8 million at peak.</p><p>Broke any record that we've ever seen before in a network, and it just goes to show: in this world, where data is exploding, having that kind of capability is a huge asset for us to have that with our customers. So, could be happier with the progress and the way we're going to complete that this year.</p><p>AM, FX, we're about halfway through. We aim to complete them next year. About half of the revenue has migrated.</p><p>We have got a new FX platform. It consolidates the access to liquidity and makes it a lot easier. It removes technology from our client side, which reduces costs for them -- which they like, of course -- and it's a better proposition.</p><p>Then on the AM side, slightly different. What we're actually doing is migrating a whole set of 10 or more products for asset managers, private banks, and others, putting them on to Eikon. It's going really well. The feedback is fantastic.</p><p>It has been a long program. We're actually experiencing that in many accounts where we are doing this migration we are getting additional sales as well, which has been a positive surprise to us. But I think it goes to show the strength of the product that we're rolling out there.</p><p>So very happy with where the programs are. Delighted that Elektron is going to be done by this year and that we can then completely focus on the other two programs next year. But still more work to do. We haven't got everything onto those three core platforms yet.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: So everything is on track and as I said no -- nothing materially new has occurred since you last spoke to us at the end of last quarter. I guess one notable item from the last quarterly report was that it was the first quarter of positive sales in a few years for the business. I guess things seem to be moving in the right direction.</p><p>Are you currently on track to have a second consecutive quarter of positive sales, as we saw last quarter?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: We hit positive sales last year. We hit positive revenue in Q2, which of course we're delighted to have done that after several years in decline.</p><p>It was significant for us not just because of the optics of that, but actually it was also the first quarter where we saw a flow-through to the bottom line from revenue growth. It's a really important part of our business model, which is, because we have gone to a platform approach, as we get incremental sales of products onto the platform the flow-through is very, very high. On the downside, if you don't get retention up the flow-through can be negative.</p><p>So what were the drivers of that? Well, there were many drivers.</p><p>Retention: we are aiming for 90%. We're almost there. Every region is above 90%, other than Europe; we see that coming very soon.</p><p>New product, new capability: delighted with that. We have got some downs, some headwinds if you like, with some of the recoveries data, which is coming down; so that will negate some of that effect this year.</p><p>So we'll be kind of bouncing around the zero for the rest of the year. But the overall trend we see continued, positive net sales and therefore revenue growth coming.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Okay. What is the pricing environment like today? I know you had recently talked about you're experiencing some downward pressure from some of the migrations, but you're also getting a bit of an uplift from those that were already migrated as they come up for another round of renewal.</p><p>How are those trends evolving? And are those still the right two offsetting factors?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. We have been very clear that we have had a pricing adjustment in FX, a commercial realignment to do that. That has been quite a headwind. A little bit still further to go.</p><p>The pricing uplift is really important to our model. We generally get about 2% price increase per year through that. I don't expect that to change.</p><p>It's based on continuously improving the breadth and the content and the capabilities that are in our products as well. So yes, there is always pressure. People want to force things down.</p><p>Big adjustment in the FX side, which we're largely through that now. But we also see -- we get price uplift every year; we also see some price recognition of what we can do as we lift everyone up to our standard prices as well.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: So in terms of the mix, I guess it sounds like the fact that you're mostly through the FX piece and the rest of the business is more or less cycling through to lapping the conversion, that it should be a net tailwind going forward.</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. That's right.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Okay. Could you maybe talk a little bit about where you stand in terms of converting users to the latest version of Eikon? I think it's the Eikon 4, if I remember correctly.</p><p>And now that you're moving onto more of a formal system as opposed to products, if we should expect some steady refresh cycle, kind of like how the big tech companies like Apple have gotten us used to over the years.</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. Well, I mean, I just remind ourselves that our desktop business is just around 40% of our total business. So it's significant; it's important; but it's not by far or any means the largest part of our business.</p><p>We rolled out Eikon 4. It's been fantastic feedback on Eikon 4.</p><p>We're not doing a forced march to upgrade everyone. Actually it's pulling through on its own. If I think about the latest figures we are seeing, over half of our users have pulled themselves through onto Eikon 4, so we don't feel the need to rush that through.</p><p>I think whereas in the past we did some big releases, Eikon 3, Eikon 4, what we're doing now -- particularly as it's a more SaaS delivery model -- is we can do incremental updates every four weeks, every five weeks of additional functionality that comes through. So a much more smoother upgrade process.</p><p>So I'm sorry; we're not going to do anymore kind of Steve Jobs wiz-bang big releases (laughter) a more regular pattern and a regular update, which actually works great. Because clients see continuous paths of innovation, this conveyor belt of new functionality coming, rather than big-bang releases as well -- which we think is a good part of the model.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: I guess if we just think in terms of categories or major areas that we could see some improvements, are there any that you would like to highlight as areas of focus for innovation going forward?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: I mean, we're always innovating. We're always building new products, capabilities.</p><p>Our Risk business, which is seeing fantastic double-digit growth -- it's a market leader in many categories. We just launched our KYC service. In fact, it's a year and a half into operation.</p><p>Seven core clients; it's a market leader. Really pleased with how that is going and how that is creating a marketplace that radically simplifies the onboarding process for clients.</p><p>We see clients now reducing onboarding time by 80% as well as taking the cost out. So we see that as one of our biggest innovations that we've done.</p><p>We're continuously upgrading our content. I think sometimes I don't talk enough about us being a content company. Deb Walton and her team have done a tremendous job getting that closed-feedback loop with customers for their content enhancements. Thousands of them that we get through our business are updated and ingested into our content sets that we have out there. So that is a continuous program of enhancements as well.</p><p>So there is no magic big-bang, here is the big shiny new product coming, but a set of incremental improvements of content, of APIs, of our feeds, of our Risk business, of new releases. In areas like supply chain we have got new releases coming out. So, yes, there is a lot happening, a lot of exciting things ahead.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Well, the world has not been a boring place since you last reported. We have had emerging markets like China and Brazil, experience some volatility. The FX markets have been volatile. Discussion of banking headcounts has not necessarily been positive as well.</p><p>So, any color on how we should be thinking about how all these different forces are pushing your results versus maybe what your initial expectations were going into the year?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. I mean, the correction in China obviously had effects on the markets around the world. I talked about the volatility increase that we saw.</p><p>One thing I'll mention about China is how our news file broke the main story. It was first again; it was the most-read news for it.</p><p>So often we think about volatility as bad. Uncertainty sometimes can be good for our business, because people have more demand for what is happening, more insight, more information, more news. So we see that actually sometimes as a positive driver.</p><p>Yes, it's hard to predict how things are going to play out. I don't necessarily see another big market shock coming in the way that we had for the last few years.</p><p>I think it's also important to remember that the sell-side institutions have been in cost-cutting mode now for five years, and they know they are not done. And that hasn't changed. It has stabilized quite a bit; the balance sheets are a lot healthier than they used to be.</p><p>You have some banks, particularly the US banks, looking in danger. They might get to ROEs in double figures. But that hasn't gone away, and I don't think that's been affected by the events of the last few months.</p><p>And it is something that actually our business is well geared up for. A lot of the time the discussions we're having with our clients is: we can help you reduce spending. We can help you on our platform consolidate the number of data vendors you have.</p><p>We can help you on connectivity, because we connect all the venues around the world. You don't have to spend that money yourself. You can do that on our platform.</p><p>We can then give you a better offering on the desktop and give you breadth of offer across feeds and desktops to save money as well. So we've grown in the last three years, understanding the cost drivers and how our business can actually help to it.</p><p>I sometimes say to the team: there is a cost crisis happening; hurry up before it's over; we don't want to waste it. Because actually a lot of the time it's a driver for our business.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: I guess to deaggregate or decouple a few of the things I flagged, China is definitely a topic du jour. Is there anything that we should look to say: all right, based on what's happened in China these are the direct impacts on your business?</p><p>I note you mentioned news. But whether it is the feeds or the desktops or the FX platforms, or any of the other stuff?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: I don't see it. I mean, one of the strengths is because of our feeds and our data platform being larger than desktop, particularly with that trend continuing, all through the crisis the demand for more data has increased and the spending on data has increased, not decreased. And even when we have had clients that had significant headcount costs and restructuring, generally our feeds actually stays flat or even increases. That actually is a continuum that we see.</p><p>You take MiFID II for example; what is that going to do? Well, it's going to hook up maybe 400 new venues for market data. It may double the amount of data that is required out there.</p><p>Clients are going to have to absorb that, but they don't want to double their spending on market data. They are going to have to have someone who can do that at scale.</p><p>That's where we see our opportunity to be that platform, that utility provider that can connect them into that market data explosion without them having to double their costs in doing so.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: The second part of my question on the trading platforms, I know last quarter you talked a bit about you weren't necessarily seeing as much of an uplift in your realized revenue and monetization of the volatility, because people were basically a bit afraid to trade as much as you would have expected. Are -- you still think that as a trend? Or how should we think about the correlation between volatility and your revenue?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. I mean the dynamic we have now is because basically capital rules. There is less prop trading happening, so you see big swings in volatility not accompanied by the volume increases that you saw in the past, just because there's less sell-side banks actually in the market trading.</p><p>It's created a different problem dynamic around risk exposure as well. If I look at what happened with China, the demand on data and information was driven a lot by the wider swings in volatility, not just in the Shanghai Composite but actually in other markets around the world as well.</p><p>But you're right. That trend I didn't see has gone away; the capital rules haven't changed. In fact, people are still implementing many of them.</p><p>So yes; that isn't something that I see changing. That said, the transaction volumes are very healthy and I think will continue to be healthy for us.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Got it. I guess, how would you characterize the market for selling data and analytics to some of the global financial service companies? You mentioned you didn't want to waste this cost-cutting push.</p><p>So I guess if we were to talk to some of your customers, or as you're having these conversations, are they indicating interest in actually increasing spend on certain surfaces? I guess another way of asking this, is the market growing or are you stealing share from others because of the cost-cutting push? How should we think about the environment for business these days?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. There is a slightly different dynamic sell-side, buy-side. We're seeing a lot more growth in the buy-side for our business, as you would expect, just structural dynamics of the two.</p><p>What is interesting on the buy-side is the demand. There is a race for analytics and a race for data on the buy-side. That is creating a lot of pull in demand, not just for desktop but actually more for real-time, non-real-time data and analytics on the buy-side.</p><p>The other dynamic that is happening too is risk and regulation is hitting the buy-side in similar ways that it did with the sell-side. Just look at KYC and AML rules now hitting fund managers, hedge funds, and others.</p><p>So we're seeing a lot of growth on the buy-side in risk, in feeds, in enterprise, real-time, non-real-time, pricing data, valuation pricing -- all of those areas that we do, which is very, of course, healthy for us. We see that more than offsetting what is happening in the sell-side in our business at the moment.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Got it. The march towards 30% margins, we've been talking about this for a few years now. You continue to progress, getting closer and closer. I believe that the target is maybe by the end of this year we should be getting there.</p><p>Could you maybe talk about how you think about upside versus downside risk to that number, and how we should evaluate the trade-offs between investing for growth, which has been a clear focus of the Company, and this push to get to 30% margins?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. I mean I think the biggest driver for this year was the MPLS BON migration, which as I said earlier is well on track. So pretty happy and comfortable about the march to 30% will continue.</p><p>I think the important dynamic is that flow-through point I said well, which is now we are starting to see the benefit of top-line growth coming to bottom line. That should help margin progression as well.</p><p>So there is still -- you never stop focusing on costs. There will still be cost reductions coming. There are still big cost reductions that are actually going to come from the enterprise that we've talked about earlier in our analyst [report].</p><p>But we're going to focus, too, on growth. We're going to focus on growth because we know and we've seen the flow-through that we get around the world.</p><p>We have an unparalleled distribution platform in data connectivity to every single corner of the world, to every trading floor and investment house. Every time we sell an additional feed, additional data set, additional Eikon, we see incredible flow-through from that because we've got leverage at the sales team, we've got no new technology requirement to install or build that capability in the way that we've designed our platform. So the real absolute margin and cash improvement we see from focusing on top-line revenue growth over the next quarters.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: FactSet, one of your competitors, has continuously said that it's taking share from your competitors. When we look at some of the data from some of the people that attempt to aggregate all of this, that does appear to be the case. However, you have had an increased level of success selling -- actually gaining in sales for the first time in a while in the last couple quarters.</p><p>So how should we reconcile it? Is it simply that they are no longer taking share from you, and they are taking share from somebody else, or there is some other interpretation to those dynamics?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, I mean they have done very well. We compete in slightly different segments as well. We are more sell-side versus buy-side for it. We have the feeds and the risk and the data capabilities for the buy-side that they don't have.</p><p>So there is not quite a like-for-like apples-for-apples comparison between the two. We see their results; they have clearly done well. So there's a dynamic that has been happening there.</p><p>Our old legacy products had lower retention on the buy-side, so maybe they picked some of that up. But as we're now rolling out Eikon and the retention rates of Eikon are far, far higher, I think that's a dynamic that will change at least on the desktop for the segments that we compete in. I think on the sell-side we are still a lot stronger.</p><p>But again, it's not just about desktop. It's about feed data, pricing data on the buy-side as well, which is not their space. That is a space that we can compete more effectively in.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Are you seeing any change to the competitive dynamic in any of those spaces? I mean the financial data and services market has been relatively stable in terms of who the biggest players are. There have been small guys on the margin come in and out. But are you seeing any meaningful changes in the competitive dynamic there?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, I mean, there is a data revolution going on at the moment. People talk about 20,000 fin-tech companies who are out there trying to disrupt the old incumbents. There is certainly a lot happening in data discovery, data mapping, data analytics, whole wide areas.</p><p>We don't sit on our laurels and not pretend that -- there is new things we've got to do in how we map our data, how we use symbology, how we invest to do that. We also see our platform as a platform which small startups, small companies looking at data and analytics can actually leverage our data, leverage our capabilities.</p><p>We have got a number of companies now in our innovation labs that are using our data to try new models and new analytics. We launched open Eikon, now Eikon App Studio this year. It enables third parties clients and ourselves to build applications within our framework.</p><p>And one of the things you realize about this competitive dynamic and the one thing these small companies lack is they don't have distribution. Because to a lot of big banks and a lot of big firms they're like viruses: they can't get in the firewall.</p><p>Well, what we have done is we've got the wires and the cables locked and inside the firewalls, so we have that distribution and we can do commissioning and all these other things that are difficult to do. So this is a model that we actually see continuing. We want the platform to be right in the middle of that kind of innovation so these companies are working with us to innovate.</p><p>A great example: we launched Tradesignal earlier this year. It's a trading analytics app; it sits within the Eikon framework. It's permissioned inside that.</p><p>It's got great usage, great response. It's just the first of many that are coming, with a very healthy pipeline.</p><p>So I think the big story around competitors is there is a lot of innovation, a lot of new models, a lot of Big Data experimentation coming. We are investing a lot in that space. We are investing in areas like symbology, metadata, using the tools that we have.</p><p>But we're also attuned to the fact there's a lot of small companies that are doing an incredible job out there. And we want our platform to be enabling that innovation as well.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Got it. We talked a little bit about this earlier, but one area that Thomson has highlighted in the past as an attractive growth opportunity is the investment management space. Maybe talk a little bit more about how that effort is going. I know you mentioned you're actually seeing some additional uptake; probably more than you were expecting. Maybe a more detailed update on where that stands and what we should be looking for going forward.</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, we are halfway through the process. We had from a history of acquisitions -- a lot of which from the Thomson Financial side -- a lot of great, distinct, individual products there. In fact one of the ironies: a lot of our users didn't actually know they were Thomson Reuters; they knew them by their original brand.</p><p>That migration is -- I don't see it just as a product migration. This is putting us back in the core of the workflow of the buy-side.</p><p>We spent over a year and a half focusing several hundred people in the development teams on things like portfolio analytics and making sure we had the best portfolio analytics on Eikon we could get. Really concentrating on that.</p><p>The success in all regions has been very good. The biggest market, the biggest opportunity we have is in the Americas. That is the biggest buy-side share of our market.</p><p>There is a lot more that we have to do their because the demand, the requirements are higher. In Europe ironically we're actually further ahead on that journey because it's a rather simpler market to do that; less competitive in some elements.</p><p>So, yes, this journey will continue into next year. It's been a big focus for us particularly on our content side.</p><p>For example, we've more than quadrupled the number of companies we cover in our news file to make sure that we're covering not just the normal suspects, the large caps, but also the mid-caps and the smaller companies and the private companies that investors want to cover as well.</p><p>So this has been a sustained effort of not just a new desktop and new Eikon capability but the entire platform from its services, content, and its partnerships deployed into the buy-side. Because that's where we believe the growth will come from for the foreseeable future.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Two more things I want to touch on and then maybe see if anyone in the crowd has any questions. Symphony is being launched by a bunch of Wall Street banks as an effort to go head-to-head against your messaging service as well as Bloomberg's. In light of that as well as competition from others, how are you thinking about the positioning of the Eikon Messenger platform, the importance of the fact that you're open versus Bloomberg is closed, and any other (technical difficulty) like that?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, we see messaging like dialtone; I mean it's sort of connectivity through phone systems that has to work. We're very pleased with our messaging platform, where it is; we have got over 21,000 firms actually using it, half of which are on the buy-side, which is a big shift from where we were even 12 months ago.</p><p>Total directory is 230,000. It's a big network. It's handling 6 million to 10 million messages a day.</p><p>But we firmly believe in open messaging. What do we mean by that? We connect to AOL; we connect to Yahoo!; we don't believe in a closed phone system in the same way that our friends talk to each other.</p><p>It would be crazy to think that we have to carry three phones so we can support three different networks. Telephone standards have taken care for that.</p><p>One of the things we find is a lot of our customers are saying actually Symphony alongside Eikon is a great offering, because it solves two problems. We're all-in for that. That interoperability between Eikon and Symphony is something that we would very much welcome and do it.</p><p>So I don't see it as actually competitive. I see it as another messaging system that we want to connect to.</p><p>We believe in that open messaging. To do it, we've proven that model over the years.</p><p>I don't think the industry wants another closed system. They want dialtone to work and to interoperate.</p><p>And last but not least, I wouldn't underestimate the energy and focus we've put on compliance. One of the reasons we have seen a lot of growth for the last few months is the efforts we've made into complaints capabilities on messaging to ensure that many of the sins of the past can't be repeated in the future and that our customers actually can control what is going on, who's in the chat rooms, who's interacting.</p><p>Some basic things, but complex to implement. If you get it wrong, it can be risky, and that's been a real focus for us to get right.</p><p>So I see this as interconnectivity between several systems is I think how this will end up. A lot of clients are looking forward to Symphony because they see it as an opportunity to displace some competitors in there. They also see that us with Symphony is a great combination, and we're open to do that.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: For those that don't fully understand, how would that exactly work? Like, if I had two windows open on my desktop and I'm typing my messages through Symphony, how do they actually complement each other? Do they use you for a certain type of function and Symphony for another? Or why would they be complementary in that (multiple speakers)?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, I know clients who have -- one had 12 messaging systems.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Correct.</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: So I think many clients are used to the fact they don't have one messaging system already. But the basic way it works is they just sit alongside each other as you described, in the way that many messaging systems do today.</p><p>If we get the right interoperability, then actually you could then interface it from a directory and a message level. It would be more seamless.</p><p>To do it that way with AOL and Yahoo! that is pretty much how it works; messages travel between them. So, it could evolve that way, or it could just sit alongside each other; and therefore the best integration might be cut and paste.</p><p>But we would hope for something better than that. I just think it's useful and important to remember there are at least 10 messaging systems out there today, and clients really want to rationalize that. They want to get them interoperable, which is what we fully support.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: I guess my last one would be an open-ended opportunistic question for you. I guess you talk to a fair number of investors; you run the business clearly. What do you think are some of the things that are most misunderstood about the Company that we may or may not have covered today that you would like to highlight?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, that's a good question. We've had good meetings with investors today. We enjoyed the discussions.</p><p>I mean I think what hopefully people are seeing is we are moving from a product business into a platform business. We are often associated with -- it's just Eikon. We're incredibly proud of what we have done with Eikon; it has been a tremendous hard work and effort, and the results and the feedback are fantastic.</p><p>But it is important to remember that is just one part of the platform. It is connected to the whole network. I describe it as the TiVo box on the end of the cable.</p><p>It is 40% of our business in desktop. We think we see growth. We see growth because of the strength of that, but actually the higher growth is coming in the feeds, the data, and the content, and the other areas of the platform because they work together.</p><p>And because companies like and enjoy the fact they can buy a breadth of capabilities from us, we see extraordinarily good flow-through as we drive the top line. So I think something that's been misunderstood is that we're just about a desktop. We're actually about a platform; we're about the content and the capabilities and connectivity, real- and non-real-time and that Eikon is an incredibly important part of that. But it is the viewer, it is the TiVo box into that rich content.</p><p>I think the other thing that is not maybe as well understood is that in order to just increase that breadth of content our model for partnerships is something that is quite unique in the industry. We have well over 1,000 partners. We are extending that partnership approach, leveraging our distribution to do so and effectively becoming that utility distributor for it.</p><p>So to us that's a really, really important part of the model that we will continue to build on, as we focus on getting that out in a richer proposition to our customers. I would say that's it.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Cool. Anybody in the crowd have any questions? This gentleman here.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks. A while back we saw Bloomberg acquire Businessweek. We saw a couple big properties come on the market from Pearson. Curious: were those things that were of interest, mild interest, strong interest? Or is it the kind of information that those services provide -- meaning The Economist and the FT -- something that you guys would have a hard time monetizing off your platform?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: I mean we've been very clear and Jim Smith, our CEO, was clear a couple years ago that we were focusing on a much more organic growth strategy than before. And we're now enjoying some of the benefits of doing so.</p><p>Because what is wildly underestimated is the cost of integration to resource, to culture, to platforms, to other areas. Frankly a lot of the challenges we had three or four years ago were caused by acquisition after acquisition not well implemented, not well integrated onto upper platform.</p><p>We're not done yet. We started with 850 products, a lot of which had come from acquisition, and we're down to just over 200. We've got a little further to do.</p><p>We've got a very focused drive; and frankly it has allowed us to focus on customer service, complete digitization of our support desk, our analytics, our users. So firstly, I am actually glad Jim did that. It has given us the space to focus on organic growth and delivery and a platform capability.</p><p>To the specific question, our Reuters news file has also enjoyed investment and focus on doing the things that we need for our customers. Its speed is better than it's ever been; its coverage is better than it's ever been; its brand is better than it's ever been.</p><p>I don't see how those other assets would have really helped that. I think that would have caused more integration pain, and it's enabled us to focus on what we're doing well now.</p><p>So we didn't really worry where that was happening or what was going. We focused on actually getting the organic investment and the performance of Reuters News -- incredibly important to our business -- so we could drive on that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I guess if I could ask on the flipside, kind of like my wife's wardrobe, sometimes things no longer fit in. So are there assets as you go through this process of simplification -- would we be surprised if we see some non-core properties get sold and then proceeds reinvested in organic growth?</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes, I can't really comment on your wife's wardrobe, but what I've been doing for the last three years is throwing --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Neither do I.</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Yes. Throwing -- we've actually done quite a few disposals of things that we didn't felt fit with the core platform. Largely -- never say you're done, but largely we're done with that. We actually think what we have now fits.</p><p>What we haven't been doing, we've been shutting things down and migrating customers, which often is a lot harder than just selling things, even though selling can be hard. But we've have been doing the hard work of shutting things down and migrating customers.</p><p>Bridge Network last year, a great example. Painful and hard work to do, but now we're in a really successful place where our equities business is -- actually it was in growth in Q2. So I think largely we're done; the wardrobe is looking good. A few tidy clothes to clean up a little bit, but it's not a disposal exercise.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN: Any others? All right. I think everyone is tired and wants to go get a drink. I thank you for your time, David.</p><p>DAVID CRAIG: Thank you, Andre.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Over the course of CNN's 14-hour television extravaganza, Democrats' leading 2020 presidential candidates explained their positions with respect to climate change and floated a variety of proposals to cut Americans' energy use and, ostensibly, to stop the climate from changing. A central theme of the night was sacrifice[3]. Many of the candidates' climate change strategies require vast amounts of capital, from Joe Biden's $1.7 trillion to Bernie Sanders' $16.3 trillion. </p><p>Who is going to end up paying that bill? There was very little difference among the candidate positions on CO2-induced climate change, which they all claim is the most dangerous threat the world has ever faced, surpassing the human toll and carnage of any preceding economic or military-related disaster, including the Holocaust and World War II[4]. According to the candidates, our world has only 12 years to reverse the coming climate apocalypse[5], so we had all better shape up and climb aboard their policy prescription bandwagons and get moving to avoid it. Because CNN says it's a 'crisis[6],' Democrats were free to offer one insane prediction after the next. CNN was not interested in the fact that the United States is the only country in the world[7] that has reduced emissions over the past decade-and-a-half while growing its economy,and it certainly wasn't to expose the ignorance and extremism of the Democratic field, yet that is what happened. Given 40 minutes apiece, the aspiring Democratic contenders showed that they are willing to de-industrialize the U.S. economy, put millions of people out of work, and lower the standard of living for tens of millions more, all for the sake of 'science' they cannot explain and do not understand. But the candidates weren't fully to blame, as CNN kept making 'scientific' claims that ranged from half-truths to pure nonsense. More than once moderators suggested that Hurricane Dorian was caused by climate change, or a sign of things to come, when it wasn't. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 'U.S. Hurricane Strikes by Decade' data, reaching back to 1851, can be accessedhere[8]. They show that there has been a 50 percentreductionin the number of major hurricanes making landfall in the United States since the 1930s. For the entire period, there is a slight downward trend in frequency, but the decline since the 1930s is remarkable. So, if anything, hurricanes havebecome less frequent[9], not more, during the period of allegedly man-made global warming. Partial credit, however, must be given to CNN for noting that plans like the 'Green New Deal' will hurt mining and agricultural communities, which fell on deaf ear with some of the candidates. Among the worst ideas[10]: TAXING 'CARBON POLLUTION.' Some called it a 'carbon fee'; others called it a 'carbon tax.' Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX)was the only one offering a 'cap-and-trade' system as an alternative. All believe that you should be paying more for fuel. None suggested making it revenue-neutral   say, by lowering payroll taxes   though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would redistribute the money to the poor. BANNING FRACKING. With the possible exception of former vice president Joe Biden (who agreed last month at the second debate that he would 'eliminate' fracking) and former HUD Secretary Julin Castro (who would back bans at state and local levels), all of the Democrats want to ban the one innovation that has made the greatest difference for our planet in the last twenty years, powered the economic recovery, and made us less dependent on the Mideast. ENDING OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION ON PUBLIC LANDS. The Obama administration tried it, too. Never mind that some public lands have been specifically set aside for oil and gas development. There seems to be little thought about the impact that would have on the U.S. economy, on fuel prices, and on national security. Nor is any credit given for industry advances in environmental-friendly technology (except as a warrant for more regulation). BANNING NUCLEAR ENERGY. Perhaps with Nevada   the fourth state in the 2020 primary contests   in mind, most of the candidates objected to nuclear energy because of challenges around nuclear waste storage. Only businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) offered defenses of nuclear power as a zero-emissions alternative, with Booker making the obvious argument: if you believe we need to reduce emissions quickly, nuclear is the only way. BANNING PLASTIC STRAWS, DISCOURAGING MEAT, ELIMINATING INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBS. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) admitted that paper straws are useless, but wants to ban the plastic ones anyway, based on pseudoscience. Booker, a vegan, says you can eat what you want   thanks!   but the rest want you to find another source of protein. And the candidates mocked Trump for halting the imposition of energy-efficient bulbs   seemingly ignorant of health risks. But there was even more craziness: Biden blamed[11] climate change for the cancer and the genocide in Darfur. Buttigieg said[12] he would explain climate change to folks in the heartland by telling them God thought greenhouse gases were a sin. Bernie Sanders suggested[13] global population control, encouraged by organizations that promote abortion abroad. All wanted to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords, none wants to submit them to the Senate for ratification, but several want to eliminate or evade the filibuster to pass the 'Green New Deal', the 'green' socialist manifesto written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Climate change as nothing new The earth has experienced[14] 'Climate Change', Global Warming, and Global Cooling since its birth 4 billion years ago. Most of the myth about climate change are based on reports (recently retracted or drastically revised) of the UN's IPCC, where only a minority of the 2500 \"scientists\" on the IPCC are in fact are meteorologists. View here: UNIPCC Scientist Debunks UNIPCC Lies - YouTube[15] Restated below is what I've heard from various climate experts over the past few years andThe Heartland Institute's[16] NIPCC report[17] (Nongovernmental International Panel of Climate Change).There is no scientific, verified, meteorological, peer reviewed, evidence that EXTRAORDINARY 'global warming' or 'global cooling' is underway; which is why the left has switched to 'climate change'.  There is no scientific, verified, peer reviewed, evidence that man made, (anthropogenic), 'climate change' is underway, nor anticipated. ALL projections to the contrary have proven false! If the U.S. eliminated every bit of its carbon emission producing activities TODAY, to zero emissions, there would be no significant impact on the environment by the year 2100. Major producers of carbon 'pollution' The major producers of carbon 'pollution' are China and India[18] who are increasing their activities, (coal plant construction), and have no plans to do otherwise. Therefore, anything we do is futile until that changes, dramatically. From a worldwide, strategic, geopolitical viewpoint, 'climate change' efforts supported by the democrats are economically detrimental to the USA, and advantageous to China, Russia and India. Progressives seem to delight in inconveniencing the masses for no reason. Consider the plastic straw ban. Even National Geographic[19]   hardly an anti-environmentalist publication   admits that plastic straws comprise just 0.025 percent of the plastic in the oceans. China, alone, produces around a third[20] of the ocean's plastic waste.In addition, CO2 emissions are greater than the U.S. and Europe combined[21], and keep going up. Do Democrats really believe in climate change? Consider the following written by Allum Bokhari on Sept. 6, 2019 and the answer should become apparent, If Democrats cared about the environment they'd talk about China[22]: \"If Democrats really believe that climate change is an existential threat to humanity, why are they proposing draconian and pointless curbs on the behavior of ordinary Americans? Why aren't they going after multinationals that continue to do business with the world's biggest polluter, without demanding any environmental commitments from them? The real reason Democrats won't go after China is that they are now the party of global elites, and global elites are constantly salivating about the profits that can be made from China's market of 1.4 billion people. They look to Europe and America and see a dwindling middle class with a declining population. There's no money in that, not long-term anyway. Maybe the problem could be fixed with pro-natal policies like Hungary's, but why bother? It's far easier to simply go overseas, to a country that does have a booming population and rising middle class. That's the same reason, by the way, that global elites are so vociferously opposed to President Donald Trump and his agenda. Trade restrictions on China, to protect American jobs? An outrage! The elites can't make money off American jobs, you see. They're just so much more expensive than Chinese jobs! Ask yourself, why is big tech so determined to work with China, despite the political pitfalls? Did Google, which once boasted the hipster motto 'don't be evil,' really think they'd suffer no blow back for developing a censored search engine designed to appease Chinese state censors? Or that working with the Chinese military but not the American one would somehow escape notice? Of course not   but for all its professed 'values,' there's no way a profit-seeking multinational like Google can resist the temptation of a 1.4 billion-person market. But plastic straw bans, meat bans, and one-child policies won't solve the problem. They simply cause unnecessary pain to ordinary people. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE DIRTY COAL FURNACES KEEP ON BURNING.\" It is amusing that adherents to Climate Change, once called Global Warming in the 1990's, and Global Cooling, (A new Ice Age was predicted) in the 1970's, now say they believe in Climate Change. Isn't belief a philosophical or religious function, NOT a scientific function? In that human CO2 is known to cause global warming with high certainty, and confirmed by observations, is but a climate myth[23]. No science is ever 'settled'. Science deals in probabilities, not certainties. When the probability of something approaches 100%, then we can regard the science, colloquially, as 'settled.

Over the course of CNN's 14-hour television extravaganza, Democrats' leading 2020 presidential candidates explained their positions with respect to climate change and floated a variety of proposals to cut Americans' energy use and, ostensibly, to stop the climate from changing. A central theme of the night was sacrifice[3]. Many of the candidates' climate change strategies require vast amounts of capital, from Joe Biden's $1.7 trillion to Bernie Sanders' $16.3 trillion. </p><p>Who is going to end up paying that bill? There was very little difference among the candidate positions on CO2-induced climate change, which they all claim is the most dangerous threat the world has ever faced, surpassing the human toll and carnage of any preceding economic or military-related disaster, including the Holocaust and World War II[4]. According to the candidates, our world has only 12 years to reverse the coming climate apocalypse[5], so we had all better shape up and climb aboard their policy prescription bandwagons and get moving to avoid it. Because CNN says it's a 'crisis[6],' Democrats were free to offer one insane prediction after the next. CNN was not interested in the fact that the United States is the only country in the world[7] that has reduced emissions over the past decade-and-a-half while growing its economy,and it certainly wasn't to expose the ignorance and extremism of the Democratic field, yet that is what happened. Given 40 minutes apiece, the aspiring Democratic contenders showed that they are willing to de-industrialize the U.S. economy, put millions of people out of work, and lower the standard of living for tens of millions more, all for the sake of 'science' they cannot explain and do not understand. But the candidates weren't fully to blame, as CNN kept making 'scientific' claims that ranged from half-truths to pure nonsense. More than once moderators suggested that Hurricane Dorian was caused by climate change, or a sign of things to come, when it wasn't. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 'U.S. Hurricane Strikes by Decade' data, reaching back to 1851, can be accessedhere[8]. They show that there has been a 50 percentreductionin the number of major hurricanes making landfall in the United States since the 1930s. For the entire period, there is a slight downward trend in frequency, but the decline since the 1930s is remarkable. So, if anything, hurricanes havebecome less frequent[9], not more, during the period of allegedly man-made global warming. Partial credit, however, must be given to CNN for noting that plans like the 'Green New Deal' will hurt mining and agricultural communities, which fell on deaf ear with some of the candidates. Among the worst ideas[10]: TAXING 'CARBON POLLUTION.' Some called it a 'carbon fee'; others called it a 'carbon tax.' Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX)was the only one offering a 'cap-and-trade' system as an alternative. All believe that you should be paying more for fuel. None suggested making it revenue-neutral \u2014 say, by lowering payroll taxes \u2014 though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would redistribute the money to the poor. BANNING FRACKING. With the possible exception of former vice president Joe Biden (who agreed last month at the second debate that he would 'eliminate' fracking) and former HUD Secretary Julin Castro (who would back bans at state and local levels), all of the Democrats want to ban the one innovation that has made the greatest difference for our planet in the last twenty years, powered the economic recovery, and made us less dependent on the Mideast. ENDING OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION ON PUBLIC LANDS. The Obama administration tried it, too. Never mind that some public lands have been specifically set aside for oil and gas development. There seems to be little thought about the impact that would have on the U.S. economy, on fuel prices, and on national security. Nor is any credit given for industry advances in environmental-friendly technology (except as a warrant for more regulation). BANNING NUCLEAR ENERGY. Perhaps with Nevada \u2014 the fourth state in the 2020 primary contests \u2014 in mind, most of the candidates objected to nuclear energy because of challenges around nuclear waste storage. Only businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) offered defenses of nuclear power as a zero-emissions alternative, with Booker making the obvious argument: if you believe we need to reduce emissions quickly, nuclear is the only way. BANNING PLASTIC STRAWS, DISCOURAGING MEAT, ELIMINATING INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBS. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) admitted that paper straws are useless, but wants to ban the plastic ones anyway, based on pseudoscience. Booker, a vegan, says you can eat what you want \u2014 thanks! \u2014 but the rest want you to find another source of protein. And the candidates mocked Trump for halting the imposition of energy-efficient bulbs \u2014 seemingly ignorant of health risks. But there was even more craziness: Biden blamed[11] climate change for the cancer and the genocide in Darfur. Buttigieg said[12] he would explain climate change to folks in the heartland by telling them God thought greenhouse gases were a sin. Bernie Sanders suggested[13] global population control, encouraged by organizations that promote abortion abroad. All wanted to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords, none wants to submit them to the Senate for ratification, but several want to eliminate or evade the filibuster to pass the 'Green New Deal', the 'green' socialist manifesto written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Climate change as nothing new The earth has experienced[14] 'Climate Change', Global Warming, and Global Cooling since its birth 4 billion years ago. Most of the myth about climate change are based on reports (recently retracted or drastically revised) of the UN's IPCC, where only a minority of the 2500 \"scientists\" on the IPCC are in fact are meteorologists. View here: UNIPCC Scientist Debunks UNIPCC Lies - YouTube[15] Restated below is what I've heard from various climate experts over the past few years andThe Heartland Institute's[16] NIPCC report[17] (Nongovernmental International Panel of Climate Change).There is no scientific, verified, meteorological, peer reviewed, evidence that EXTRAORDINARY 'global warming' or 'global cooling' is underway; which is why the left has switched to 'climate change'.  There is no scientific, verified, peer reviewed, evidence that man made, (anthropogenic), 'climate change' is underway, nor anticipated. ALL projections to the contrary have proven false! If the U.S. eliminated every bit of its carbon emission producing activities TODAY, to zero emissions, there would be no significant impact on the environment by the year 2100. Major producers of carbon 'pollution' The major producers of carbon 'pollution' are China and India[18] who are increasing their activities, (coal plant construction), and have no plans to do otherwise. Therefore, anything we do is futile until that changes, dramatically. From a worldwide, strategic, geopolitical viewpoint, 'climate change' efforts supported by the democrats are economically detrimental to the USA, and advantageous to China, Russia and India. Progressives seem to delight in inconveniencing the masses for no reason. Consider the plastic straw ban. Even National Geographic[19] \u2014 hardly an anti-environmentalist publication \u2014 admits that plastic straws comprise just 0.025 percent of the plastic in the oceans. China, alone, produces around a third[20] of the ocean's plastic waste.In addition, CO2 emissions are greater than the U.S. and Europe combined[21], and keep going up. Do Democrats really believe in climate change? Consider the following written by Allum Bokhari on Sept. 6, 2019 and the answer should become apparent, If Democrats cared about the environment they'd talk about China[22]: \"If Democrats really believe that climate change is an existential threat to humanity, why are they proposing draconian and pointless curbs on the behavior of ordinary Americans? Why aren't they going after multinationals that continue to do business with the world's biggest polluter, without demanding any environmental commitments from them? The real reason Democrats won't go after China is that they are now the party of global elites, and global elites are constantly salivating about the profits that can be made from China's market of 1.4 billion people. They look to Europe and America and see a dwindling middle class with a declining population. There's no money in that, not long-term anyway. Maybe the problem could be fixed with pro-natal policies like Hungary's, but why bother? It's far easier to simply go overseas, to a country that does have a booming population and rising middle class. That's the same reason, by the way, that global elites are so vociferously opposed to President Donald Trump and his agenda. Trade restrictions on China, to protect American jobs? An outrage! The elites can't make money off American jobs, you see. They're just so much more expensive than Chinese jobs! Ask yourself, why is big tech so determined to work with China, despite the political pitfalls? Did Google, which once boasted the hipster motto 'don't be evil,' really think they'd suffer no blow back for developing a censored search engine designed to appease Chinese state censors? Or that working with the Chinese military but not the American one would somehow escape notice? Of course not \u2014 but for all its professed 'values,' there's no way a profit-seeking multinational like Google can resist the temptation of a 1.4 billion-person market. But plastic straw bans, meat bans, and one-child policies won't solve the problem. They simply cause unnecessary pain to ordinary people. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE DIRTY COAL FURNACES KEEP ON BURNING.\" It is amusing that adherents to Climate Change, once called Global Warming in the 1990's, and Global Cooling, (A new Ice Age was predicted) in the 1970's, now say they believe in Climate Change. Isn't belief a philosophical or religious function, NOT a scientific function? In that human CO2 is known to cause global warming with high certainty, and confirmed by observations, is but a climate myth[23]. No science is ever 'settled'. Science deals in probabilities, not certainties. When the probability of something approaches 100%, then we can regard the science, colloquially, as 'settled.

The promise was to take all the world's information and make it useful to everyone -- almost like magic -- with just a single word, \"Search.\" Google and Facebook were both founded by mathematicians who promised to create a free flow of information. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998 while Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. </p><p>Their site was named after a googol -- the name for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros -- found in the book \"Mathematics and the Imagination\" by Edward Kasner and James Newman. Facebook was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates The \"how\" of making money soon became an issue, which was solved through tracking individual's searches. Google could tell whether you were Republican or Democrat or gay or straight. Such information building blocks were used to construct individual profiles to sell on the Internet through targeted ads to the users. Google was able to convince people it was well meaning and not harmful. Google even adopted a corporateslogan in 2003, 'Don't be evil,\" but evil was never defined. After all, Google did have a clean homepage to convince users it was harmless; nevertheless, once people started going directly to websites so Google couldn't track them through searches, Google built a browser, Chrome, to track them wherever they were. Google also came up with an operating system (Android) for smartphones that tracks what you're doing \u2014 even when you're not online. Google likewise built apps like Google Docs and Google Maps and other platforms to collect even more data about people. Public Acquiesce Why are people so accepting that the data Google and Facebook collects isn'tgoing to be used to manipulate them.An unconscious mind is being built by Google and Facebook that is filtering the world for us as they control the portals to information which makes us easier to control and manipulate. People possibly tellGoogle more than they would tell their wives or close friends. Google reads emails in order to send you targeted ads. Google even tracks your drafts that you didn't send The reason lies in the fact that both Google and Facebook give people things they want and don't want to give up. Google offers quick web searches and free e-mails, while Facebook offers the ability to connect with others and then being able to say whatever they want. Algorithm filter and manipulate our thought Algorithms are behind the system of manipulating what we see by filtering out results and ranking them in order. You want the answer, not billions of webpages, so Google sorts through the hundreds of billions of webpages in its system to give back useful and relevant results in a fraction of a second. This creates a problem when it comes to political issues, because it will always favor one candidate over another, ensuring that a handful of people at the big technology companies will determine what a billion people think. Rarely do people go to the second page of search results, meaning that Google's Search EngineBias for one candidate can shift lots of votes. As stated by filmmaker, Andrew Marcus[1], 'What big tech has done to conservative and other undesirable publishers is nothing short of a digital Kristallnacht.\" As such, Facebook delivered for Democrats in the midterms by erasing two billion GOP page views, thereby eliminating conservative content to suburban females. While in 2016 suburban voters and women would checkFacebook pages and get conservative news, it's no longer true. These same voters went Democrat in the midterms. Facebook and Google say they are not legally responsible for things people say on their sites, claiming they operate on a neutral platform; however, the companies do take very aggressive editorial control and should not hide behind the law. As to why our government doesn't interfere? Bias exists as our federal government uses Google tools, including Gmail. In that the Federal government runs on Google, how could it regulate it? Then too, Google and Facebook regularly lobby state legislatures against passing stronger privacy legislation. Here is an excellent article by Tom Wu of 11/13/2018, detailing how big tech companies get by without regulation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-curse-of-bigness/\">https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-curse-of-bigness/</url>[2] Google censorship and blacklisting Google maintains a very dangerous blacklist called the quarantine list. It contains millions of websites that Google doesn't want you to see. And there are no relevant regulations and no oversight. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, a Canadian professor who appears in the documentary, had his videos censored on Google-owned YouTube, which had received millions of views, because in his videos he was critical of using certain pronouns when it comes to referring to people. Google also shut off his Gmail account. The company said he violated their policy. But no explanation was given. Dr. Epstein found out the hard way that Google can block a website through Firefox and Safari \u2014 even though those aren't his browsers. It happened to him a day after he wrote an article[3] about whether Google could tip an election. Epstein found that Google could influence elections by 10 percent through the top search results given by Google. The day after his article was published, Google blocked Dr. Epstein's website from the internet, claiming it had been hacked. As to Google's plans for the future, a recent article by Heather Kelly[4] of CNN Businessrelates how Google wants its virtual assistant in every room of your house. Google (GOOGL[5]) imagines people living, parenting and even sleeping surrounded by its products. Voice assistants may have started in a single room for playing music, but Google's house previews a future where almost every room has an always-listening microphone, a speaker, camera and a screen of some sort. Undermining Democracy Google and Facebook can be likened to 1930s fascism in Italy when the government fused with large corporations, but it's being done more cleverly now as we all opted into Google and Facebook, trusting them to make right and good decisions for us. An unconscious mind is being built by Google and Facebook that is filtering the world for us as they control the portals to information which makes us easier to control and manipulate and has the power to undermine democracy without us knowing it. We must be aware of what we are putting into our computers and what our computers are putting into us, since the entire Internet is based on surveillance. If action isn't taken soon it will be harder to fight back, as all large tech companies, as totalitarian forces, are trying to control more and more of our lives.
