The response was firm and reassuring, repeated by others before the president rowed back. Cue a collective sigh of relief that our beloved NHS is safe from grasping American interference. Only, of course, it isn't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'' Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, was quick to point out one area where the NHS is already \"on the table\" - American companies can bid for contracts such as Babylon Health's GP advice service - and another that is not. The United States wants the NHS to pay more for drugs and could try to incorporate a new reimbursement structure in a trade deal.</p><p>It is unlikely that any UK government would cede to such a demand, particularly when Big Pharma is battling Big Tech to be public enemy No 1 in America. The US took a similar proposal off the table in talks with Australia and New Zealand. Yet it remains a risk, especially for a weakened Britain desperate to replace lost European Union trade after Brexit.</p><p>But there is another area where the NHS is on the table, and it relates to all of us. Our patient records, a treasure trove of data for developers of next-generation medical devices, could be on the table in a trade deal and we wouldn't even know about it. US technology firms could sweep our anonymised health data back to the US, mine it with algorithms in their vastly powerful servers, develop a new set of must-have medical tools or apps and sell them back to the NHS.</p><p>It would not be privatisation in the traditional sense, but it would be an appropriation of NHS assets, only in a more sophisticated way, one more suited to the modern data economy, and the upshot would be that US companies pocket more of the UK's \u00a3170 billion annual health budget, even if they don't actually own more of the NHS.</p><p>Trade negotiations have transformed in the past few years. In recent deals, a new \"digital trade\" chapter has appeared, setting agreements on ecommerce and data access, and similar terms can be found in the White House's \"negotiating objectives\" for a UK trade deal, published in February.</p><p>One of those objectives is to prohibit local data storage, which would allow UK information to be held on servers in the US. Another is to provide full market access for US medical devices. Yet another prohibits \"disclosure of computer source code or algorithms\". Add it together and it looks like the US wants data access, powers to use that data under its own laws, full intellectual property protection for its algorithms and an unrestricted market in which to sell the final product.</p><p>In principle, it is a perfectly fair demand. The UK would get the same in return. But the playing field is not level. The arrangement favours America, particularly when it comes to health data. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Oracle and Salesforce, six giant US tech firms, are moving into the healthcare space, vacuuming up data to mine it with smart algorithms in super-powerful servers for correlations that lead to new cures. The bigger the dataset, the better the chance of discovery and no health provider holds more comprehensive and extensive data than the NHS.</p><p>To establish how important digital trade is to America, you need only look at the new Nafta, the USMexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA for short. During the talks, Canada objected to American demands on cross-border datasharing. It had no problem with US firms building data storage \"clouds\" in Canada, where the information would be subject to Canadian law, but it was not keen for Canadian information to be held in the US, where it would be subject to US law and possibly trawled through under US Patriot Act powers.</p><p>Washington would not buckle, though, and Canada caved. The final agreement included a demand for open government data, \"to expand access to government information with a view to generating business opportunities\". For Michael Geist, a professor of ecommerce law at the University of Ottawa, \"the digital trade chapter raises many concerns, locking in rules that will hamstring online policies for decades by restricting privacy safeguards and hampering efforts to establish new regulation in the digital environment\".</p><p>Of course, digital trade is much bigger than health. Ecommerce is growing more than twice as fast as overall trade. In the UK, 70 per cent of online shoppers use American sites, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. Britain and the US are each other's main trading partners in online sales of goods and services and America has an $8 billion trade surplus with the UK in digitally enabled services such as banking, telecoms and accounting.</p><p>But, given the ageing demographics across wealthy economies, the potential in medical devices, apps and services is huge - promising the US an even larger digital trade surplus. For the US to grasp the opportunity, though, it needs access to data - lots of it - and, at the moment, the EU's digital privacy laws are an obstacle.</p><p>Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, wrote last year that \"as currently envisioned, GDPR's implementation could create unnecessary barriers to trade\", specifically citing \"medical data\" as an example. After Brexit, Britain will be able to choose a new data protection regime. One that America would like us to have, perhaps, with \"state-ofthe-art rules to ensure the UK does not impose measures that restrict cross-border data flows\", as the US negotiation objectives put it.</p><p>The USMCA clearly sets out the way America wants to go, a way of open government data and closed source codes. Legally, according to Paul Taylor, professor of health informatics at University College London, anonymised data is public, not personal, which potentially puts it up for grabs in a US trade deal.</p><p>The danger, as Annemarie Naylor, policy director at the charity Future Care Capital, says, is \"our healthcare data becoming bargaining chips\" in a bigger trade deal. Make no mistake, one way or another, the NHS is on the table.\"</p><p>Philip Aldrick is Economics Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-149980624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W93-YB41-DYTY-C4HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1025\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 8, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

On Thursday, it picked a fight of its own with Apple and Google, setting the stage for a courtroom brawl that, if successful, could have far-reaching ramifications for the two tech juggernauts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Epic Games, maker of Fortnite, on Thursday sued Apple and Google in separate lawsuits over \"anticompetitive conduct\" after both companies kicked the game's app off their app marketplaces Epic Games released a feature that lets users choose how they want to pay for inapp purchases - either through Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store, or from Epic directly, which saves up to 20 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple generally takes a cut of 30 per cent of payments made in apps obtained through the App Store. Google Play Store generally takes a similar 30 per cent cut.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not long after Apple removed its app early Thursday, the video game maker filed a 65-page lawsuit in federal court in Northern California that appeared to anticipate Apple's actions. A few hours later, it filed a similar 60-page suit against Google.</p><p>Fortnite is one of the most popular video games in the world. Last year, Epic Games boasted the game had about 250 million active accounts a month. According to market research firm Sensor Tower, Fortnite was downloaded 2.4 million times on the App Store over the last 30 days and generated $43.4 million in consumer spending through the iOS app over that period. Since it was created, it has tallied 133.2 million installs and accounted for $1.2 billion in spending.</p><p>Getting kicked off Apple's App Store means new users won't be able to download the mobile app. Users who already have it on their phones will still be able to use the game for now but won't be able to update it to new versions.</p><p>Epic's suit against Apple calls out the tech giant's payment practices.</p><p>\"Apple's removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100 per cent monopoly over the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market,\" the filing reads.</p><p>Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz said the company removed Fortnite from the store after Epic violated its guidelines.</p><p>\"Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services,\" he said in an emailed statement.</p><p>Google removed Fortnite from its Play Store as of late Thursday, although users can still download Fortnite directly from Epic's website.</p><p>\"In 1998, Google was founded as an exciting young company with a unique motto: \"Don't Be Evil,\" the lawsuit against Google alleges. \"Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize.\"</p><p>Google spokesperson Dan Jackson said in a statement that the app was removed from its Play Store for violating its policies, but it is still available on Android. \"For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users,\" he added.</p><p>Epic's legal battle against Apple is the latest episode in a war between app developers and the tech giant. In recent years, Apple has grown more powerful because of its App Store, which controls which apps can be installed on iPhones. By contrast, developers can bypass Google's Play Store with different Android app stores or offer their programs to download from their own sites. The App Store is more lucrative, though, because iPhone users spend more money online. And when businesses designed around mobile apps have proven successful, Apple has increasingly encroached into those areas, using its power over the App Store to advantage itself.</p><p>The App Store has drawn the attention of lawmakers investigating Apple and other tech giants over competition concerns. Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended the App Store cut in front of Congress when big tech executives were grilled as part of the investigation.</p><p>In recent years, as Apple has grown more powerful and competition in the smartphone industry has withered, developers have begun to fight back. Most prominently, music streaming service Spotify made public complaints in Europe, leading to an investigation by the European Commission into Apple's business practices.</p><p>Even as companies push back, Apple has grown more aggressive in enforcing its cut. In the past, Apple had allowed developers to collect subscription fees outside the App Store, so long as those alternative options were not advertised on the App Store. Companies like Amazon and Spotify had taken advantage of that loophole. But when email service Hey tried to do this, Apple stopped approving updated versions of its mobile app.</p><p>Companies like Spotify and Epic Games argue that Apple's fees are artificially high because of Apple's monopoly over the App Store, and they say the benefits Apple provides as the curator of the store do not merit a 30 per cent fee.</p><p>Spotify spokesman Adam Grossberg said the company applauded Epic Games'decision to \"take a stand against Apple and shed further light on Apple's abuse of its dominant position.\" He added, \"Apple's unfair practices have disadvantaged competitors and deprived consumers for far too long. The stakes for consumers and app developers large and small couldn't be higher and ensuring that the iOS platform operates competitively and fairly is an urgent task with far-reaching implications.\"</p><p>And Vidhya Murugesan, a spokeswoman for Match.com, which has also taken aim at Apple over its fees, said \"We fully support Epic Games'efforts today to show how Apple uses its dominant position and unfair policies to hurt consumers, app developers and entrepreneurs. Regulators across the globe have expressed similar concerns and are examining Apple's arbitrary practices. Match Group supports all efforts to ensure everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of a fair app ecosystem.\"</p><p>Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney had already criticized Apple for the practice earlier this summer.</p><p>\"The iOS App Store's monopoly protects only Apple profit, not device security,\" he said.</p><p>Members of Congress asked Cook if the company would ever increase its 30 per cent commission, but the executive sidestepped the question. He stated the company has never increased subscription fees.</p><p>Apple has made some exceptions to the 30 per cent fee, including for Amazon videos earlier this year. But those exceptions appear to be one-off deals. Apple also does not collect fees on purchases of real-world goods, such as items shipped from Amazon, coffee bought from Starbucks or cars ordered through apps like Uber and Lyft.</p><p>Fortnite was released as a free game in 2017 by Epic Games. While it initially failed to make a splash, the game quickly pivoted toward the then-growing battle royale game genre, which drew more fans every month. The game's popularity skyrocketed in March 2018 when Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, the world's most popular video game streaming personality, played matches of Fortnite with rappers Drake and Travis Scott, and NFL star JuJu Smith-Schuster.</p><p>Fortnite then became a global cultural touchpoint, becoming so popular that national sports leagues grew concerned about lax player training schedules, and Netflix executives cited the game, and not HBO or Hulu, as its biggest competitor.</p><p>The game remains one of the mostwatched on Twitch, the streaming platform owned by Amazon.</p><p>On Thursday, shortly after its app was taken down by Apple, Epic rolled out a website and a video that spoofed Apple's famous 1984 Super Bowl commercial. Back then, IBM was the juggernaut and Apple was the upstart.</p><p>The commercial used George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984 to paint IBM as Big Brother.</p><p>\"On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984,\" the commercial said.</p><p>Now, Epic Games sees Apple as having taken IBM's place. \"Epic respectfully requests this Court to enjoin Apple from continuing to impose its anti-competitive restrictions on the iOS ecosystem and ensure 2020 is not like 1984. \"Epic's suit says the payment system is used to effectively \"gag app developers\" from even mentioning other payment options outside the app.</p><p>\"Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation,\" the suit reads.</p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Park contributed to this report. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Andrew Harrer, Bloomberg;

Fintechs were generally against rules that mirrored those of established firms, arguing that the heavy regulatory burden would drive costs too high and frustrate innovation.</p><p>The Competition Bureau says the tiered approach it recommends for regulation would create a level playing field for smaller players because \"functions whose failure poses lower risks to the financial system should not necessarily face the same strict oversight as those whose failure poses higher risks.\"</p><p>At the same time, the Bureau concluded that regulation based on a financial product or service - rather than on the technology or device used to get it - would \"ensure that all entities that perform the same function carry the same regulatory burden and consumers have the same protections when dealing with competing service providers.\"</p><p>The competition watchdog makes a number of recommendations aimed at lowering barriers and fostering innovation within the system in its report, which notes \"Canada lags behind its international peers when it comes to fintech adoption.\"</p><p>For example, regulators are urged to promote greater access to core infrastructure and services, including the payments system, to \"facilitate the development of innovative new fintech services.\"</p><p>The Competition Bureau is also urging regulators and industry players to explore the potential of digital identification verification, a technology that is billed as a cost-effective way to verify client identity to satisfy financial regulations and global know-your-client obligations.</p><p>\"This would reduce customer-acquisition costs for service providers, ultimately reducing the costs of switching for customers and facilitating regulatory compliance,\" the report says.</p><p>In another recommendation, policymakers are urged to \"embrace\" systems that provide better access to consumers' data so \"fintech can help Canadians overcome their inability or unwillingness to shop around and switch between their service providers.\"</p><p>The Competition Bureau is encouraging more collaboration throughout the financial services sector, including between fintechs and regulators, and suggests that expansion of fintech across Canada, and even internationally, would be aided by harmonized regulation across geographic boundaries.</p><p>\"Greater collaboration will enable a clear and unified approach to risk, innovation and competition,\" the report says.</p><p>While there has been some harmonization between provinces, such as a joint statement from the Canadian Securities Administrators on cryptocurrencies, regulators such as the Ontario Securities Commission have adopted regional tech innovation hubs on their own.</p><p>The competition watchdog urged policymakers to identify a country lead for fintech, which it says would create a one-stop resource for information and \"encourage greater investment in innovative businesses.</p><p>Fintech has been evolving in Canada and internationally, from initial disruption in the sector to more collaboration. Some traditional banks have embraced fintech platforms that reduce costs and make it quicker and easier for clients to sign up for financial products and services.</p><p>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, for example, forged a partnership with Montreal-based small business lender Thinking Capital. On CIBC's website, prospective borrowers are referred to Thinking Capital and told they can apply for funds in minutes and receive a loan of between $5,000 and $300,000 in as little as 24 hours.</p><p>Bank of Nova Scotia forged a similar partnership last year with Atlanta-based fintech Kabbage Inc. to provide \"fully automated\" small business loans of up to $100,000 in Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Amid the shift, some industry watchers have cheered disruption-driven tech innovations in traditional lines of business, while others questioned whether it is only a matter of time before collaboration between fintechs and traditional banks gives way to consolidation, with clear winners and losers emerging.</p><p>In its report, the Competition Bureau urges policymakers to review regulatory frameworks frequently to ensure they \"remain relevant\" and do not \"unnecessarily inhibit competition.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Big Tech surveillance capitalists[1], such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, which had been in the public crosshairs only weeks earlier suddenly became essential to survival. With worldwide lockdowns, everything that could be moved online went digital, handing us the purest test yet of Big Tech's usefulness for our very day-to-day survival\u2014from work to school to telemedicine, entertainment, and sadly even goodbyes. Despite complaints of Zoom fatigue, jittery connections, the many challenges[2] of online learning, and more, the internet mostly held up[3]. Throughout the spring, it seemed as if Big Tech was perhaps on its way to earning back some public affection[4] and becoming the good guys again. </p><p>But the goodwill was short-lived; in July, four of the biggest Big Tech CEOs were hauled up and grilled[5] remotely from Capitol Hill. In August polling, 45 percent[6] of American adults said they wanted presidential candidates to be more critical of the industry, a 5 percent jump from the previous year. The House antitrust panel chair, Democratic Rep. David Cicilline, is finally poised to rein in[7] the industry. This month, the Justice Department will brief U.S. states on its plan to launch a landmark antitrust suit against Google[8], and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights[9] will hold a hearing on enforcement of antitrust laws. Some analysts advocate for action to break up[10] the big four. Others believe[11] that the industry should be regulated as a public utility. Although interesting in theory, neither action is practical, and neither solves the most fundamental challenge, made amply clear by the pandemic: the broken state of internet access and its disastrous implications for digital inclusion and justice. Even those who advocate breaking up[12] big tech firms would separate tech platforms from services that also use the platform. That is, they would seek to prevent a dominant platform, like Google, from giving unfair advantage for its own service, like the navigation app Waze. Many experts question the wisdom of a breakup at all. 'To what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?'asked[13] Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. 'Will the search engine work as well without Waze, Gmail, YouTube, and so on?' questioned[14] Jean Tirole, a Nobel laureate and industrial organization scholar. Still others doubt[15] that a breakup would succeed in the courts, given the hostility on the federal bench to antitrust action. As for regulating Big Tech as a utility, doing so would require an act of Congress to redefine a diverse body of platforms as 'common carriers[16]' and the creation of an entirely new regulatory agency. It is unlikely that lawmakers will come together on such drastic steps, especially in an election year and with a polarized Congress. Although the history of antitrust action on tech is not encouraging for those advocating breakups, it does point to some ideas for a solution. The 1956 federal consent decree against theBell System[17]kept the telephone monopoly intact after a seven-year legal saga. In exchange, the company was required tolicense all its patents royalty-free[18]to other businesses, unlocking thetransistor[19], thesolar cell[20], and thelaser[21]to the world through Bell Labs. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years, and the company wasn't broken up either. Instead, IBM agreed toseparate pricing for its hardware and software products[22], giving rise to a software start-up that eventually became Microsoft. When it was Microsoft's turn to face antitrust action, which lasted from 1998 to 2001[23], again, there was no breakup. As part of a settlement, Microsoft agreed toensure its products were compatible[24]with competitors' software. This opened the door to a plethora of competing web browsers and numerous apps and innovations. There are lessons here for today. No question, the world is now facing many technology crises: limited choices of search engines, social media platforms, and e-commerce sites; digital misinformation, concern about which is heightened[25] this year; and accumulation of data by Big Tech, which raises concerns about privacy, breaches, and abuse of power. But the pandemic has put a spotlight on an even more fundamental crisis that begs an urgent response: the extreme unevenness of internet access at a time when such access gaps are truly devastating. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 21.3 million[26] Americans lacked broadband internet in 2019, a number the FCC chairman attempted to fudge[27]. A Microsoft analysis puts the figure at a staggering162 million[28]in 2019. What is clear is that the United States is poorly connected, and broadband access is among themost expensive[29]in the world. Moreover, the gaps are unevenly spread. Data[30] from Tufts University's Fletcher School, where I am the dean of global business, shows that states where schools with the greatest need to be run remotely[31] because they have not met public health guidelines overlap with those that fail 'digital readiness[32]' tests. The problems extend into other key areas, from telemedicine[33] to the state of employment[34] or government services online, where the United States performs poorly overall[35]. Even worse, the access gap is wider[36] in poorer neighborhoods, with Black and Hispanic households less able to connect than white households. Families have to drive to public libraries or even Taco Bell restaurants[37] to find free Wi-Fi hot spots to educate children. This ought to be unacceptable in the world's largest economy. Since history tells us that antitrust action takes a long time and doesn't usually lead to a company breakup, it is worth fast-forwarding to the endgame and settling with Big Tech now. Lawmakers have the leverage now, and the industry has the resources to spare to meet their demands. Whatever else Congress does, the foundation of a settlement ought to be a requirement to help close the access gaps. They ought to be required to do so in ways that provide affordable, inclusive, and reliable internet access to all while ensuring that none becomes an access gatekeeper. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are not just good at e-commerce, beautiful devices, social media, and search. Each has cutting-edge competencies in providing internet access. They know how to solve this problem. Facebook's Internet.org launched in 2013 to provide free access to a limited version of the internet to those without access. The service, created in partnership with local telecommunications operators, spread to more than 60 countries, despite criticism[38]. Currently, it offers an entire portfolio of access initiatives under Facebook Connectivity[39], including high-altitude platform stations and satellite technology, 'internet exchange points' to make access cheaper, efforts to lower the cost of deploying fiber, and open-source software platforms to allow operators to establish mobile networks in remote areas. Google has a project for fiber internet deployment[40]. Its parent company, Alphabet, also has an initiative, Loon,[41] that uses balloons, unmanned aircraft, high-altitude stations, and terrestrial networks to deliver internet access worldwide. Google is winding down[42] its Google Station program to provide free Wi-Fi in railway stations in several developing countries, but that could be revived. Amazon has plans for deploying more than 3,000 low Earth orbit satellites[43], with the goal of offering broadband service everywhere\u2014for a price. Apple has a similar project[44] in the works. Much ink has been spilled on surveillance capitalists and how to rein them in. But the pandemic has revealed that the most fundamental of our digital vulnerabilities is one that Big Tech can help solve. It is time to turn to that deal from ancient tech history, when in the 1930s Bell System was permitted to maintain a monopoly in exchange for ensuring universal service, to solve for a problem that ought not exist in 2020. Every household in the United States should have the opportunity to complain about Zoom fatigue and to thank the surveillance capitalists for making that problem universal.

As well as the day job at Fire1, which is developing a remote monitor for heart failure, he is chairman of the Irish Medtech Association (IMA); sits on the board of EnterpriseIreland; and lectures in enterprise at University College Dublin (UCD), his alma mater.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For good measure, Hanley has just started playing five-a-side football and is determined to learn how to surf. Unsurprisingly, the targets on the activity app on his Apple Watch are set to their maximum level. \"I try to keep busy,\" he says. Fire1 alone is a big undertaking. The venture raised (EURO)40m last year from heavyweight investors, and has 30 staff between offices at Dublin City University's Alpha innovation campus and UCD's Nexus research centre.</p><p>The office walls carry quotes from heart failure patients, and Hanley is clearly highly motivated. \"We are trying to solve heart failure,\" he says.</p><p>\"It helps on a Monday morning commute to have a purpose to your work. Building a business is a long, hard journey, so it's important to keep that focus on why you're doing it.\"</p><p>Fire1 has developed its core technology and is \"moving into the clinical roadmap\", says Hanley. That will involve a lengthy period of testing and certification before Fire1 products are available. With his IMA hat on, meanwhile, Hanley represents 450 medtech companies that employ a combined 38,000 people and account for exports worth more than (EURO)12.5bn a year. Not as sexy as big tech or as high-profile as pharma, it is an industry that prioritises \"substance over style\", he says.</p><p>Ahead of the 2020 budget, the IMA is calling on the government to improve tax incentives for entrepreneurs and co-fund a (EURO)42m advanced manufacturing centre in Limerick. Its pre-budget submission warns that, post-Brexit, the UK will surely try to use lower taxes and incentives to lure business from Ireland.</p><p>\"There is a phenomenal opportunity for Ireland to be one of the dominant centres for healthcare solutions,\" says Hanley, slipping slightly into jargon about the internet of things. \"A lot of the building blocks are here but we need to ensure we don't lose that opportunity.\"</p><p>Hanley's CV makes him a decent poster boy for the sector. He attributes his business inclinations partly to his father, who had his own business as a consultant engineer.</p><p>One of four children, Hanley grew up in Foxrock, south Dublin, and went to St Michael's College in Ballsbridge. He moved on to UCD to study chemical engineering, graduating in 1990.</p><p>He did well enough to score a scholarship to do a PhD at Pennsylvania University in Philadelphia, which claims the distinction of being the first higherlevel institution in America to refer to itself as a university. Hanley specialised in nanotechnology and spent five years at the university.</p><p>\"I loved the meritocracy and the can-do attitude in America,\" he says. \"A lot of it was hard work but it gave me a foundation for what I do - tech and innovation with a really global focus.\"</p><p>He went to work at Air Products &amp; Chemicals, an industrial chemicals multinational based in Pennsylvania. One of the world's largest producers of indusemerging trial gases, it employs about 16,000 people and is valued at $50bn ((EURO)45bn) in New York.</p><p>Hanley got wide experience with Air Products in the US and Europe, including working on a project in Belgium to bring nitrogen into beer cans to keep the beer bubbly. In the late 1990s, he was involved in the launch of the first hydrogen fuel cell car in London.</p><p>His next step was a scholarship to do an MBA at Insead, the famed graduate business school at Fontainebleau in France. Hanley enjoyed the course and loved France.</p><p>\"It was quite a transformative experience. At Insead, you meet a huge diversity of people from different backgrounds, all with global ambitions.\" By the time he graduated from Insead in the summer of 2001, Hanley had been out of Ireland for 11 years. He does not mind admitting he was motivated to come home in pursuit of his now wife, Grainne, who was in Ireland.</p><p>\"I believed Ireland had transformed in that time, and I wanted to come back and get involved in something,\" he says. \"I wanted to try to consolidate the various elements of my career up to then.\"</p><p>In Dublin, he joined Ntera, an earlystage nanotechnology company that had been spun out from UCD research. Founded by college professor Donald Fitzmaurice, Ntera raised about (EURO)40m in funding to develop hi-tech displays for electronics products but ultimately went into liquidation in 2011.</p><p>Hanley left in 2004 and still speaks highly of the experience. \"It was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"Donald is a great visionary. and Ntera's employees have gone on to do many other ventures.\"</p><p>He can count himself among them.</p><p>With his multinational experience, MBA and start-up stint, Hanley had a desire to do something of his own and narrowed his focus to the healthcare sector.</p><p>\"I had an itch I still wanted to scratch,\" he says. \"There was a lot of talk at the time about technology transforming healthcare and helping people to live longer. I became obsessed.\"</p><p>With two academics from UCD's school of electronic and electrical engineering, Conor Heneghan and Philip de Chazal, he co-founded the medtech outfit BiancaMed. It developed a wire-free sensor for measuring sleep and breathing, with the potential to detect conditions from sleep apnoea to heart failure.</p><p>ResMed, a US specialist in medical products for sleep and respiratory disorders, was a seed investor. BiancaMed raised about (EURO)10m in total, with backers including DFJ ePlanet Ventures, Seventure Partners in France, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland.</p><p>The company licensed in some technology and did its own development in Dublin. Its product was manufactured in Shenzhen, China, and launched in Japan, and also sold through Apple stores.</p><p>In January 2011, ResMed bought out the other investors and took 100% ownership of BiancaMed for about (EURO)25m. Following the acquisition, Hanley joined ResMed, which invested in expanding the R&amp;D facility in Dublin. Over five years at the US group, he ran its chronic disease management solutions division, its cardiology business, and its ventures and initiatives business units. \"I was Dublin-based but spent 70%-80% of my time abroad, from San Diego to Sydney, to Tokyo,\" he says. \"That whole period was very helpful for me in terms of learning from peers in different business units and environments.\" In 2016, he was hired to run Fire1, which had been launched two years earlier by the Foundry, a Californian medtech incubator. Fire1 was the 15th company from the Foundry but the first it located outside the US, says Hanley.</p><p>\"They liked the talent and the medtech base in Ireland,\" he says. \"It was very early-stage when I joined, but with a great investor base and core talent.\"</p><p>In tandem with Hanley's hiring, the company raised $7.5m from healthcare group Covidien and venture capitalists Lightstone Ventures and New Enterprise Associates. In January last year, it raised a further (EURO)40m, with Gilde Healthcare, Gimv and Seventure Partners joining the existing investors.</p><p>For many of the financial backers, it was their first deal in Ireland. Hanley knows it was an eye-catching amount for a company that few people knew existed. \"It is a big number for Ireland and even in a European context,\" he says. \"I would say the investors and I are equally ambitious about what we can achieve.\" The company may raise more funding depending on its needs, he says.</p><p>\"It's the nature of this sector. We are continuing to grow the team, and thinking of second and third versions of our products.\"</p><p>Hanley still travels widely to keep on top of trends in medicine, technology and regulation. The US sucks up a lot of medtech investment and China is an power, but Ireland holds its own, especially in talent, he says.</p><p>\"I interact a lot with universities, and with doctors and healthcare professionals. The calibre of our doctors and researchers is world-class. Ireland is a great place to innovate.\"</p><p>Hanley is doing his bit on the education front, as a part-time associate professor of electronic engineering at UCD, where he teaches a module in entrepreneurship in engineering. The class promises to explain what it is like to start a company, including \"all its chaos, uncertainty, impossible deadlines [and] conflicting input\".</p><p>Having been through all that in real life, Hanley has a confession, however.</p><p>\"I don't think of myself as an entrepreneur,\" he says. \"I'm just driven by whatever project I'm working on, by the team and the innovation we're doing.\"</p><p>With some help from those earlymorning swims, of course.</p><p>THE LIFE OF CONOR HANLEY VITAL STATISTICS Age: 50 Home: Monkstown, Dublin Family: Married to Grainne, a doctor, with two children: Louise, 9, and Michael, 7 Education: Engineering degree from University College Dublin, PhD in chemical engineering from Pennsylvania University, and MBA from Insead, France Favourite book: Bruno, Chief of Police series, by Martin Walker Favourite film: Jiro Dreams of Sushi, pictured, a Netflix documentary about a top sushi chef WORKING DAY I go for a swim at 6.30am, have breakfast, then get in early to avoid the traffic.

The very same discretionary power used to censor Jones is being used to single out ideas that you may like as well. It's inevitable, given that \"hate speech\" is an entirely subjective term with no legal definition.</p><p>Case in point: A 2017 ProPublica analysis of Facebook's internal documents found that \"at least in some instances, the company's hate-speech rules tend to favor elites and governments over grassroots activists and racial minorities.\" In 2017, for instance, Facebook censored self-described \"queer rights activists\" for using words such as \"dyke\" and \"fag.\" Boston poet and Black Lives Matter activist Didi Delgado deplored \"the increasingly common Facebook censorship of black activists,\" some of whom use the nickname \"Racebook.\"</p><p>Or look at Jones himself. He's been fomenting his particular brand of online vitriol for over a decade. Just last month, Facebook defended his free speech rights on Twitter. Today he's persona non grata.</p><p>The very vagueness of these \"hate speech\" policies - each one of them worded differently - allows social media companies to act arbitrarily, sometimes in rash response to public pressure.</p><p>Entrusting these powerful private-sector companies to decide what we can see, hear and discuss online is, simply put, a very bad idea.</p><p>So what is to be done? The solution implicates both the creators and the users of social media.</p><p>Big tech needs to get out of the business of policing speech and institute policies that adhere to the bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment as declared by the Supreme Court: \"Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\"</p><p>Both Congress and the courts have paved the way for this option. In its first law regulating the Internet, the Communications Decency Act of 1996, Congress essentially immunized online platforms for anything posted by a third party. And in an important ruling last year, the Supreme Court lauded social media as a \"quintessential forum for the exercise of First Amendment rights\" and the most important space for the exchange of views - even those we loathe.</p><p>A 2016 report about counterspeech on Twitter concluded that hateful and other \"extremist\" speech was most effectively undermined by counterspeech rather than by censoring, in part because of the futility of trying to remove anything once it's been posted.</p><p>By allowing social media companies to outlaw certain types of speech, we're denying ourselves the opportunity to take a stand.</p><p>Strossen, the John Marshall Harlan II Professor of Law at New York Law School, is author of \"Hate: Why we Should Resist It With Free Speech, Not Censorship.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYNWS-NY0077649380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0R-C691-JBM5-R3TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Daily News, L.P.

As I sit in any given upmarket caf\u00e9, all bright natural light, ceramic crockery and green houseplants, the menu presents me with some equally Instagrammable options. I could have pancakes with maple syrup and bacon, but can I really swallow bacon when meat, the documentary Cowspiracy tells me, is ruining the planet's health? How can I happily consume another life that's never got to see the sun? What about the milk in my coffee?</p><p> I could have almond - but when it takes five litres of water to grow one single almond, is it really a decent alternative? As for the maple syrup, is it really necessary to import sweet stufffrom Canada when honey would do? Avocado, eggs and toast might seem the better option, but did the avocado reach Hackney by way of a Mexican drug cartel? And are the hens that laid the eggs forced to bristle against each other in tiny cages for the rest of their fertile days? I'm young, I'm woke, I understand my white privilege and that gender lives on a continuum. Yet when it comes to knowing what the hell I should eat, I'm bound up in knots. What do we do about meat? How do we source our alternatives? Are technological advances here to help us or make others rich? What is the human cost of my veg drawer? And that's just the start of it.</p><p>\"When it litres of a single almond a decent to cow's Let's begin with meat. There are now 3.5 million people identifying as vegan in the UK, one survey says, with another from 2016 concluding that 22 per cent of the country's vegans are Londoners. Fashionable restaurants serving 'vegan soul food' and 'plant-based' cuisine abound. You can join the queues for Temple of Seitan's deep-fried 'chicken' burger and get Allplants to deliver vegan frozen meals to your door.</p><p>Most people, though, still eat meat. Even millennial favourite, Nando's, happily details on its website a costbased refusal to serve free-range chickens. So is there a way to eat meat ethically? The Worldwide Fund for Nature cites ambitions to 'moderate meat consumption' and 'buy food that meets credible certified standards' - a sentiment echoed by Kath Dalmeny, chief executive of Sustain, which campaigns for better food and farming. 'Meat is an expensive part of your shopping basket,' says Dalmeny. 'If you eat a bit less of it, you make a bit more room both financially and ethically to consider things like free-range and organic.' When it comes to choosing whether to eat meat from the UK or abroad, she argues in favour of the former. Not only is the carbon footprint lessened and you're buying into a system that is trying to improve, but 'free range and organic are regulated terms, so no one can make any dodgy claims to them'. Some tweaking is needed, she admits, 'because if you're buying a whole leg of pork, the labelling will be great, but if you get a pork casserole in a ready meal, you may not get any information about how it was reared'.</p><p>What about meat alternatives, which have seen a surge in popularity among meat-eaters and non meat-eaters alike? Mycoprotein (used in Quorn), seitan (pure gluten, a protein, not just an allergen), tofu and jackfruit can be found in supermarkets and on restaurant menus, in part because of veganism's confluence with the dirty food movement. But are these options really as virtuous as they seem? Dr Tara Garnett, who heads up the Food Climate Research Network at Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, argues that fake meat must be 'part of a mixed approach to shiftpeople away from a heavy meat diet. Because in some ways, it props up approaches to eating that aren't especially sustainable, which are based on highly processed foods.' takes five to grow almond, is milk really alternative Perhaps the bigger issue we milk?\" need to address, then, is what Garnett describes as 'our protein fetish' - apparent in everything from Pret's 'protein pots' to the prettily wrapped 'protein balls' you'll find stacked up in your local Whole Foods.</p><p>This also applies to the newest addition to the table - so-called 'clean meat', or, in layman's terms, 'lab-grown' meat. Using foetal bovine serum, scientists are working on the development of lab-grown protein that is uncannily similar to meat yet reduces greenhouse gas emissions. But Dan Crossley, executive director of the Food Ethics Council, is concerned. 'There are unknowns,' he says. 'Will it be viable and affordable? Will it increase the disconnection lots of people have from nature and how food is produced? It could also dramatically change our landscape - 70 per cent of our land is used for agriculture, and livestock plays a part in looking after our landscape for us.' Finally 'who will own the technology, who will it empower and disempower?' Garnett already has an inkling, suggesting it's not right for 'young white men in Silicon Valley to solve our global food security problems'. After all, if recent scandals concerning social media giants have taught us anything, it's that tech can surpass our ethical bounds.</p><p>It isn't just when debating the ethics of lab-grown meat that questions of big tech's influence on what and how we eat is relevant. Planning a takeaway tonight? How are you ordering it? We have more ways than ever to get food from 10 minutes' walk away, packaged and delivered to our doors. However, eating this way, says Garnett, amounts to 'instant gratification and takes away from what it really means to cook'.</p><p>O\"For those with the there's ne way to solve that problem could be joining London's community food gardens, suggests Delmany. You wouldn't be alone; thousands have cropped up in the past 10 years. And embracing, where possible, a grow-your-own ethos can also help address another major ethical dilemma. After all, the average supermarket's fruit and veg section reads like a diplomat's passport stamps: Spain, Turkey, Kenya, Thailand, Israel, Brazil. Dalmeny worries that this makes it harder to keep tabs on food produced further away. 'Though we hope a British value is to trade fairly, unfortunately there is slavery in the [global] food chain, and it's hard for people to vote with their wallet on that one,' she explains. 'Do you know whether the rice you ate last night came from a savoury situation?' Then, of course, there's the environmental cost of importing food from the other side the world - though Crossley warns that, for those principally concerned with the environment, there's more to consider than just how far a piece of fruit or veg has flown. 'Food miles are a consider how far fruit or veg useful way of getting people to think of where their food comes from - and local food typically has positive effects on communities - but it also depends on whether something is in season or if it's grown in a greenhouse.' We also need to consider, he says, 'our shopping miles - we might be driving to the supermarket'. Plus, he's keen to stress the social impact of where we shop and how we shop.</p><p>Should we, as some do, boycott food from countries we feel aren't doing the right thing? Sanctions on South Africa worked to topple apartheid - but Crossley is wary that 'in isolation a food boycott might not do much, but if you're also signing petitions, writing letters, if it's part of a menu of different actions you're taking, that's more powerful.' 'Buy-cotts', in which traders are encouraged to stock ethical products rather than see their questionable products collect dust, encourage positive change, too.</p><p>A far bigger question around international trade, though, is Brexit. Campaigners have highlighted the possibility for food standards to plummet once the UK is no longer subject to EU regulations. As Dalmeny puts it, 'London has always had people and trade from all over the world, it's just wonderful. What we don't want, though, is to sell offour standards to the highest bidder. We've already had America say we'd have to accept its meat standards. An unfettered trade deal without an idea of what kind of food we want to be eating is a big concern.' Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has suggested that Brexit might even present British consumers with the prospect of genetically modified livestock. It's enough to make you want to head straight to the pub - that is, if you don't mind beer and wine being made with the help of fish organs, which are commonly used as a filter in the brewing process.</p><p>concerned environment, more to than just piece of So is the answer is to curl up and do nothing, starving ourselves out of existential guilt? If our food, our necessary fuel - already problematic for some - is under pressure to reflect our moral superiority, where are we left? Indeed, who falls under the most pressure to become an ethical eater is an ethical has flown\" issue in itself, as Garnett says: 'Whether it's women who have had this dumped on them as the people more likely to fill the trolley, or whether women are just more interested in these things is a question.' The point, Crossley explains, isn't to feel burdened by these questions, but encouraged, and to add to them. Because it's not just about us, it's about the companies that sell to us and the governments that regulate that sale. And we can put the pressure on them instead. 'If we all ask more questions of the people we're buying food from, about where it comes from, how it's produced, the people selling food may or may not know the answers, but will have to find out,' he says. 'If we ask questions, they're more likely to improve things.'</p><p>\"When it takes five litres of water to grow a single almond, is almond milk really a decent alternative to cow's milk?\"</p><p>\"For those concerned with the environment, there's more to consider than just how far a piece of fruit or veg has flown\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOGRAPH BY PATRICE DE VILLIERSAlamy.

You wouldn't be alone; thousands have cropped up in the past 10 years. And embracing, where possible, a grow-your-own ethos can also help address another major ethical dilemma. After all, the average supermarket's fruit and veg section reads like a diplomat's passport stamps: Spain, Turkey, Kenya, Thailand, Israel, Brazil. Dalmeny worries that this makes it harder to keep tabs on food produced further away. 'Though we hope a British value is to trade fairly, unfortunately there is slavery in the [global] food chain, and it's hard for people to vote with their wallet on that one,' she explains. 'Do you know whether the rice you ate last night came from a savoury situation?'</p><p>Then, of course, there's the environmental cost of importing food from the other side the world - though Crossley warns that, for those principally concerned with the environment, there's more to consider than just how far a piece of fruit or veg has flown. 'Food miles are a useful way of getting people to think of where their food comes from - and local food typically has positive effects on communities - but it also depends on whether something is in season or if it's grown in a greenhouse.' We also need to consider, he says, 'our shopping miles - we might be driving to the supermarket'.</p><p>Plus, he's keen to stress the social impact of where we shop and how we shop. Should we, as some do, boycott food from countries we feel aren't doing the right thing? Sanctions on South Africa worked to topple apartheid - but Crossley is wary that 'in isolation a food boycott might not do much, but if you're also signing petitions, writing letters, if it's part of a menu of different actions you're taking, that's more powerful.' 'Buy-cotts', in which traders are encouraged to stock ethical products rather than see their questionable products collect dust, encourage positive change, too.</p><p>A far bigger question around international trade, though, is Brexit. Campaigners have highlighted the possibility for food standards to plummet once the UK is no longer subject to EU regulations. As Dalmeny puts it, 'London has always had people and trade from all over the world, it's just wonderful. What we don't want, though, is to sell off our standards to the highest bidder. We've already had America say we'd have to accept its meat standards. An unfettered trade deal without an idea of what kind of food we want to be eating is a big concern.'</p><p>Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has suggested that Brexit might even present British consumers with the prospect of genetically modified livestock. It's enough to make you want to head straight to the pub - that is, if you don't mind beer and wine being made with the help of fish organs, which are commonly used as a filter in the brewing process.</p><p>So is the answer is to curl up and do nothing, starving ourselves out of existential guilt? If our food, our necessary fuel - already problematic for some - is under pressure to reflect our moral superiority, where are we left? Indeed, who falls under the most pressure to become an ethical eater is an ethical issue in itself, as Garnett says: 'Whether it's women who have had this dumped on them as the people more likely to fill the trolley, or whether women are just more interested in these things is a question.'</p><p>The point, Crossley explains, isn't to feel burdened by these questions, but encouraged, and to add to them. Because it's not just about us, it's about the companies that sell to us and the governments that regulate that sale. And we can put the pressure on them instead. 'If we all ask more questions of the people we're buying food from, about where it comes from, how it's produced, the people selling food may or may not know the answers, but will have to find out,' he says. 'If we ask questions, they're more likely to improve things.'</p><p>Click here for<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/vegan\">Just Eat discount codes</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-44360406</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFK-T2B1-JCJY-G3SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1602\"/><timeReceived>9:44 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 31, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A0KR</classCode><className>MEAT FREE DIETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000895</classCode><className>IMPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp; SURVEYS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX000261</classCode><className>CARTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM7V</classCode><className>FREE RANGE LIVESTOCK</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A6IE</classCode><className>VEGETARIAN RESTAURANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A68H</classCode><className>POULTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097FD</classCode><className>MEATS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X0F</classCode><className>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000765</classCode><className>FROZEN FOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

As these breaches are so common, we&amp;#x2019;ve become almost unphased by them. Not a day goes by where our mortgage information, our passwords, and even our old emails aren&amp;#x2019;t wrapped up in some sort of endpoint security failure that attacks our digital privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cynic would suggest this is the new normal, that we have made a Faustian bargain with big tech to choose convenience over security and privacy. While news reports highlight companies behaving badly, change may be on the horizon, both in terms of companies&amp;#x2019; attitudes towards customer privacy and in the regulatory compliance landscape. While fines and further legal ramifications should be enough to drive businesses to take customer privacy seriously, customers also need to take responsibility and push change.</p><p>Increased regulation, improved privacy</p><p>All businesses are aware of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union&amp;#x2019;s privacy regulation, which launched last May. GDPR arose as a holistic approach to update existing, inconsistent and conflicting laws and regulations across the EU and strengthen the protection of individuals&amp;#x2019; personal data. Through the &amp;#x2018;right to be forgotten&amp;#x2019; measure, increased controls and the enforcement of severe financial penalties for any mishandling of data have encouraged a rethink of data ownership.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>There are many examples of &amp;#x2018;the right to be forgotten&amp;#x2019; in action. For instance, in Spain, a citizen demanded that outdated information about his house being repossessed was removed from search listings. His claim was upheld after both the Spanish Court and the EU Court of Justice examined the merits of the case, and the information was removed from the public domain.</p><p>The awareness of GDPR is being felt well outside of the EU. It has also paved the way for the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), offering similar protections for Californian consumers, demonstrating the growing importance of regulation globally. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. The regulation puts guidelines on personal information collection and usage by businesses, giving Californians significant visibility and access to what data is gathered, how it is shared and control over its deletion.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>With these new regulations, businesses must be more cautious on the issues of consent and provide stringent enforcement of checks and balances across the stack.</p><p>Trust is the gateway to customer privacy</p><p>In the case of technology, repeated breaches, both accidental and malicious, have destroyed trust, created legal issues and hurt organisations&amp;#x2019; bottom lines. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, a global survey of consumer trust done annually, only 55 per cent of respondents think technology is performing well in protecting consumer data.</p><p>This suggests that privacy is becoming a front and centre issue for businesses and governments alike. But can it be a strategic advantage? According to fingerprint identification company, IDEX Biometrics, 75% of UK consumers are concerned about the security of personal data shared with organisations.</p><p>Handling privacy proactively and transparently offers significant upside to businesses of all sizes. This means understanding how to practically think about protecting customers&amp;#x2019; data, and there are some broad, simple rules that make data privacy and transparency significantly easier for businesses:</p><p>Don&amp;#x2019;t collect unnecessary data: If you don&amp;#x2019;t need a user&amp;#x2019;s credit card number, national insurance number, or any other sensitive information, don&amp;#x2019;t collect it. If you don&amp;#x2019;t store the information, it can&amp;#x2019;t be stolen or even leaked by accident. It&amp;#x2019;s a prudent, responsible decision that reduces risk for companies, teams, and individual developers.</p><p>Don&amp;#x2019;t share unnecessary data: There are times when you must collect the data but that doesn&amp;#x2019;t require you to also share it. Data sharing needs to be scoped to both the use case and the user and dynamically shifted when necessary.</p><p>Always monitor: Too much mobile app development is developed without input or co-ordination from their Security or Operations teams. Developing a better working relationship to establish a baseline of &amp;#x201C;normal&amp;#x201D; and investigating anything beyond it is key to limiting unwanted exploitation of privacy and data. While we won&amp;#x2019;t always catch an attack in progress, the faster we detect, stop, and fix breaches, the less we will suffer legally, financially, and professionally, and this begins with the business apps we develop.</p><p>Be transparent: The same policies and practices that worked in 2010 do not work in 2020. At a policy level, we need better privacy policies with clear language to explain customers&amp;#x2019; rights and responsibilities. At a technical level, we need to take proper steps to limit what data we share, how we share it, who we share it with, and how those parties may use it and must protect it.</p><p>As is always the case, the devil is in the details. But proactively considering data privacy offers businesses a chance to showcase commitment and transparency to customers in an age of waning trust, in addition to avoiding the regulatory headaches of an increasingly complex compliance. This will help give customers confidence that their details will be secure when they engage with your business, which is increasingly front of their minds.</p><p>Secure your privacy online with the best VPN.<br/>Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-164524780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y03-MFT1-F11P-X017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

That left FIs scrambling to \u201crapidly figure out how to get that same emotional and engagement outcome when the possibility of face-to-face is virtually nonexistent,\u201d Randy Piatt , head of product solutions at card technology firm Ondot Systems , told PYMNTS in a recent conversation.   Piatt noted that FIs have come up with a variety of solutions, like beefing up call centers or creating drive-thru-only banking services. Piatt said FIs have also increased their focus on debit offerings, as consumers slowed down credit card usage in recent months in response to financial uncertainty.   \u201cMore generally, financial institutions are now in the position of having the highest [level of U.S. consumer savings] ever, and they have to figure out how to drive their noninterest income and get folks spending,\u201d Piatt said. \u201cThey want to shift those deposit dollars sitting in those savings and checking accounts onto the debit card and other card products to be spent.\u201d   And FIs want to help consumers spend money in the places where they  want  to spend money \u2014 which, in the wake of COVID-19 \u2014 is largely online.   Piatt said card-present transactions have fallen by as much as 20 percent during the pandemic, but card-not-present transactions have bounced up by 40 percent. Meanwhile, contactless card payments are up 150 percent year on year, pushed by consumer demand that\u2019s growing by the day as customers fear touching point of sale (POS) terminals that they fear could carry germs.   In other words, time is officially up for FIs to dither when it comes to digitizing. \u201cIt really has highlighted the digital divide in financial services between the organizations that had formulated and executed a true digital strategy prior to COVID and those that didn\u2019t,\u201d Piatt said.   Those that are behind the curve \u201chave to rapidly evolve, and in some cases create new processes just to compensate for the increases in digital interaction,\u201d the product solutions chief added.   How should those that have fallen behind make the first leap forward before they find themselves disrupted out of business by the big banks and FinTechs already ahead in this race?   Simple: Start with the cards.   Recreating The Card For A Digital-First World    Cards are the most frequent touchpoint that FIs have with consumers \u2014 more important than branches, ATMs or even online banking pages or apps.   Piatt said that\u2019s become particularly true in the pandemic era, when a rising wave of online shopping has combined with a U.S. coin shortage and a general squeamishness about handling cash. He said that means FIs need to double down on improving their card products to meet customers' emerging needs.   That starts with upgrading the onboarding process to include instant digital card issuance to a customer\u2019s chosen mobile wallet . \u201cWith digital issuance, you now have the ability to accelerate the entire process,\u201d Piatt explained. \u201cThe customer can get the card activated immediately on the digital side into the wallet so they can spend using their mobile device while they're waiting for the physical plastic.\u201d   That\u2019s a win/win all around: Customers are delighted because they aren\u2019t waiting for a card, while issuers don\u2019t lose consumer spend while the person waits for a piece of plastic to arrive in the mail.   Moreover, Piatt said getting a slot in a consumer\u2019s digital wallet is critical in today\u2019s era of changing payment preferences. After years of incredibly sluggish adoption, many consumers are suddenly drawn to contactless payments due to COVID-19.   Piatt said figures show that 76 percent of consumers who\u2019ve made the switch to contactless intend to continue using it even after the pandemic has passed. \u201cSo, consumers can adjust habits and change those card usage reflexes very quickly if the right motivation is provided to them, and as they realize that using a phone to pay is so much quicker than digging through a wallet or purse to find a card.\u201d   He added that customers aren\u2019t going to wait for FIs to catch up with their needs. If necessary, they\u2019ll just switch to competitors who already meet them.   Moving Forward     For all of the challenges the pandemic has created for financial services , Piatt said, it also presents an incredible opportunity to build closer, more connected relationships with customers \u2014 if institutions are willing to do so.   But FIs that fail to offer their customers premium experiences \u2014 like digital issuance and a full suite of digital card journeys \u2014 will find that megabanks, digital banks and Big Tech and FinTech players will.   Piatt\u2019s warning to financial firms that dawdle: \u201cMake no mistake, these are the players who are coming for your transaction volumes and your customer relationships.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

But the Morrison government's decision is a direct hit on a tech industry whose worst case scenario here was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/morrison-government-unveils-world-leading-privacy-competition-regulation-of-tech-giants-20191212-p53j8r.html\">tougher regulations later in the year</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Details about how the government's proposed payment model will work are yet to be determined by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. It is unclear whether any payments by Facebook and Google to publishers will be material enough to help offset the loss of advertising revenue, exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis. Nor do we know exactly which publishers will be the beneficiaries.</p><p>However, it is safe to assume the new rules will damage Facebook and Google's bottom lines in a country where they collect <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/frydenberg-puts-facebook-and-google-on-notice-over-market-power-20190707-p524z2.html\">about $4 billion in gross revenue</url> - and pay little tax. More worryingly for the tech giants, competition regulators across the world are watching Australia closely. The use (and misuse) of people's personal data, by Facebook in particular, the rise of fake news and the decline of traditional media outlets have made Big Tech an easy target for regulators outside the US. Indeed, the ACCC has led the charge globally, with its 18-month inquiry the most comprehensive investigation into these concerns undertaken in the world.</p><p>The next step for the regulator is to determine how to appropriately charge Google and Facebook for content when the two platforms are very different. Consideration will also need to be given to whether any smaller digital companies will be caught in the net in future. Google and Facebook's lobbying arm, DIGI, has previously criticised onerous regulation as a hindrance to entrepreneurs and start-ups.</p><p>News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch and his chief executive, Robert Thomson, have led<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/murdoch-s-news-corp-to-take-aim-at-google-and-facebook-20180502-p4zcxd.html\"> a long and aggressive campaign against the tech companies</url>. They have called for the likes of Google to be charged carriage fees in the same way a pay-TV operator pays studios such as National Geographic to broadcast their channels.</p><p>Tech companies argue this approach won't work because their business model is different. For example, Facebook does not host content when news is shared through users posting links. Nevertheless, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/broadcasters-to-ask-competition-watchdog-to-go-further-in-facebook-google-inquiry-20190212-p50xbo.html\">media companies are supportive, with Nine's chief executive, Hugh Marks, arguing</url> that news enhances the experience for users on social media sites but the creator of that content does not benefit adequately. (Nine is the owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.)</p><p>Another more likely option could be rules that enforce sharing of advertising revenue between the digital platform and the publisher. Such payments have the potential to reignite debates about whether an exclusive news story - which is then followed up by other outlets - should be given prominence in search results.</p><p>Regardless of what charging model is adopted, the government's decision will change the way the digital giants view their responsibilities for content on their platforms. Facebook has historically described itself as a place for users to share information, such as a noticeboard in a town square, with limited responsibility for what is posted outside of removing dangerous or illegal content.</p><p>It is arguably Google that will feel the impact most. The ACCC measured the way people accessed news media websites in the 2017 financial year and found 44 per cent of people went straight to a news organisation's page. Google was the source of 32 per cent of views and Facebook totalled 18 per cent over the same period.</p><p>What remains to be seen is how much the digital giants will have to pay for this news content and whether it will be enough to help publishers stay afloat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520266600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPP-8C01-JBJ7-N35Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Newsgroups have been an integral part of the internet from its early days. Each newsgroup dealt with a different topic, and people who were interested in that group participated. Often the newsgroup dealt with the bizarre - Batman's obsession with Joker (and vice versa); or the sublime - latest findings around dark matter - and everything in between. The communities were largely unmoderated, and it was usually a no-holds barred conversation. News of various kinds has always been discussed and debated on the internet. And while topics of interest to the mainstream were discussed, there were other newsgroups that discussed conspiracy theories, extremist propaganda, anti-science rants, anti-feminist outrages, extreme forms of religious imposition, and more. Those too found their communities.</p><p>In more recent times, social networking was a sleepy old place until news got added to the mix. For those old enough to remember Orkut and Myspace - these were spaces to be social - and mostly focused on talent, hobbies, and other things that we do socially. Both platforms died, primarily because most of us didn't know what to do beyond saying hello. If you look at the early days of Twitter, it was boring. People posted what they ate, what they drank, how they felt. And, there is not much else that you can do with that information. It was when social networks transformed to provide news, both in terms of feeds emanating from news companies, or as live events being microblogged by diverse crowds, that it became ubiquitous. The 2008 attacks on Mumbai, the Occupy Wall Street protests - after the 2008 financial meltdown - the Arab Spring, were all tweeted and live blogged, changing forever the world of news.</p><p>While different audiences consume varying levels of news, it is this consumption that is possibly the glue that holds social media platforms together. And platforms like Facebook and its algorithms pick what we read, when we read it, and how we pass it forward. The science of engagement applies clinically to us.</p><p>When audiences consume vast quantities of news on social media - for free - this has implications on the revenue streams of most news platforms. How much do we consume? In India it is estimated that 52 per cent of the total audience consumes news on Facebook and WhatsApp (also owned by Facebook). In the USA, this figure is 68 per cent.</p><p>With Facebook and Google being the gateways to news, it was very difficult - if not impossible - for any news platform to walk away from either tech giant. However, now there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel. The Australian government, a few months ago, had asked the Australian Competition Commission to look at the relationship between news publishers, Facebook and Google. In particular, the government asked the competition Commission to take a look at how news publishers could be financially compensated for the consumption of their content on a social media platform.</p><p>In a terse release in August, Facebook responded, \"Australia is drafting a new regulation that misunderstands the dynamics of the internet and will do damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect\". Google, on the other hand, warned Australian readers of a bleak future: \"The way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk from new government regulation.\"</p><p>Whatever be the outcome of the stand-off between Big Tech and Australia, the latter has shown an interesting way of capping the power of these tech giants whose algorithms decide what we consume, and what we think - with impunity.</p><p>Big Tech tends towards monopoly. It is the massive investments in infrastructure and the deep learning that they have about us that allows it to know you better than anyone else and makes it ubiquitous in our lives. As it knows us well, it knows what to do to keep us engaged, and as we get more engaged with social media platforms, it learns more about us. And so on. It is this combination that makes both Facebook and Google so attractive to advertisers. Between them, they control almost two-thirds of digital advertising - an almost monopsony of engaged customers.</p><p>However, as a recent report, Big Tech in India, points out, given that competition commissions look at monopolies when there is a price implication for customers, Big Tech does not charge customers - and hence, it might be difficult to apply competition rules to them. However, it is definitely possible for Big Tech to pay part of the advertising revenues that it earns from other people's content, to the creators of that content. This seems only fair.</p><p>And, while they are at it, the competition regulators may want to consider one other aspect. Big Tech earns its money by harvesting our data and selling it to advertisers. Technically speaking we, the members of social networks who provide them with the traction, should get a share of the pie too.</p><p>The writer works at the intersection of digital content, technology and audiences.

Newsgroups have been an integral part of the internet from its early days. Each newsgroup dealt with a different topic, and people who were interested in that group participated. Often the newsgroup dealt with the bizarre \u2013 Batman\u2019s obsession with Joker (and vice versa); or the sublime \u2013 latest findings around dark matter \u2013 and everything in between. The communities were largely unmoderated, and it was usually a no-holds barred conversation. News of various kinds has always been discussed and debated on the internet. And while topics of interest to the mainstream were discussed, there were other newsgroups that discussed conspiracy theories, extremist propaganda, anti-science rants, anti-feminist outrages, extreme forms of religious imposition, and more. Those too found their communities.   In more recent times, social networking was a sleepy old place until news got added to the mix. For those old enough to remember Orkut and Myspace \u2013 these were spaces to be social \u2013 and mostly focused on talent, hobbies, and other things that we do socially. Both platforms died, primarily because most of us didn\u2019t know what to do beyond saying hello. If you look at the early days of Twitter, it was boring. People posted what they ate, what they drank, how they felt. And, there is not much else that you can do with that information. It was when social networks transformed to provide news, both in terms of feeds emanating from news companies, or as live events being microblogged by diverse crowds, that it became ubiquitous. The 2008 attacks on Mumbai, the Occupy Wall Street protests \u2013 after the 2008 financial meltdown \u2013 the Arab Spring, were all tweeted and live blogged, changing forever the world of news.   While different audiences consume varying levels of news, it is this consumption that is possibly the glue that holds social media platforms together. And platforms like Facebook and its algorithms pick what we read, when we read it, and how we pass it forward. The science of engagement applies clinically to us.   When audiences consume vast quantities of news on social media \u2013 for free \u2013 this has implications on the revenue streams of most news platforms. How much do we consume? In India it is estimated that 52 per cent of the total audience consumes news on Facebook and WhatsApp (also owned by Facebook). In the USA, this figure is 68 per cent.   With Facebook and Google being the gateways to news, it was very difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 for any news platform to walk away from either tech giant. However, now there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel. The Australian government, a few months ago, had asked the Australian Competition Commission to look at the relationship between news publishers, Facebook and Google. In particular, the government asked the competition Commission to take a look at how news publishers could be financially compensated for the consumption of their content on a social media platform.   In a terse release in August, Facebook responded, \u201cAustralia is drafting a new regulation that misunderstands the dynamics of the internet and will do damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect\u201d. Google, on the other hand, warned Australian readers of a bleak future: \u201cThe way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk from new government regulation.\u201d   Whatever be the outcome of the stand-off between Big Tech and Australia, the latter has shown an interesting way of capping the power of these tech giants whose algorithms decide what we consume, and what we think \u2013 with impunity.   Big Tech tends towards monopoly. It is the massive investments in infrastructure and the deep learning that they have about us that allows it to know you better than anyone else and makes it ubiquitous in our lives. As it knows us well, it knows what to do to keep us engaged, and as we get more engaged with social media platforms, it learns more about us. And so on. It is this combination that makes both Facebook and Google so attractive to advertisers. Between them, they control almost two-thirds of digital advertising \u2013 an almost monopsony of engaged customers.   However, as a recent report, Big Tech in India, points out, given that competition commissions look at monopolies when there is a price implication for customers, Big Tech does not charge customers \u2013 and hence, it might be difficult to apply competition rules to them. However, it is definitely possible for Big Tech to pay part of the advertising revenues that it earns from other people\u2019s content, to the creators of that content. This seems only fair.   And, while they are at it, the competition regulators may want to consider one other aspect. Big Tech earns its money by harvesting our data and selling it to advertisers. Technically speaking we, the members of social networks who provide them with the traction, should get a share of the pie too.

But take a closer look and it's evident that Fuda may have more in common with his new employers, the Malaysian-Singaporean Quek-Kwek dynasty, than initially meets the eye.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The son of a Calabrian tailor, Fuda was transplanted as a teenager from southern Italy to the sprawling Sydney suburbs in the early 1980s. The young Fuda couldn't speak English when he got to Sydney, and struggled with it for some time after. Even today, 37 years and an international banking career later, his conversation is accented.</p><p>\"It took about seven or eight years, by the time I got to university, to adjust,\" Fuda recalls.</p><p>But Fuda got through English lessons and an economics degree to start a banking career; first with Australia's CommBank, then Barclays in Sydney before landing at Citibank's Australian division, where he spent 16 years, including brief stints in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.</p><p>\"When I went to Citi, it opened up my mind,\" Fuda tells Asiamoney. \"It was a global company.\"</p><p>Fuda's last job at Citi was as chief operating officer for southeast Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand. He joined DBS in Singapore in 2010 as an executive in its consumer banking and wealth management divisions, before coming to the Queks' attention in 2016 for the top slot at Hong Leong Bankin KL.</p><p>Fuda's journey from the hardscrabble of Italy's impoverished Mezzogiorno region to the sleek boardrooms of some of the world's richest people has been an immigrant success story that Hong Leong's Quek clan themselves would readily understand and appreciate.</p><p> I think Malaysia, actually not just Malaysia, Asia, is very well banked. It's extremely competitive. So you've got to be on your guard, on your toes - Domenic Fuda </p><p>Two generations earlier, clan patriarch Kwek Hong Png \"\" a penniless, 15-year-old son of a Chinese peasant from impoverished Fujian province \"\" landed in Singapore in 1928. The young Kwek was uneducated and struggled with local tongues but was no less determined to seek his fortune.</p><p>Kwek started off by helping in his brother-in-law's humble hardware store, and by the time of the Second World War, he had founded a small trading company, which he called Hong Leong, the terms denoting abundance and prosperity.</p><p>Kwek would come to have plenty of both: when he died in 1994, Kwek was one of Singapore's richest men, with interests across property and finance in the fast-developing city-state, and famously controlled Singapore's largest private land portfolio.</p><p>Today, Hong Leong is a household brand name across Singapore and Malaysia. Kwek's heirs and relatives front all-but-separate sister empires in Singapore and Malaysia, gathered under the mutual Hong Leong banner.</p><p>Quek Leng Chan, 77, runs Hong Leong Malaysia, while his cousin Kwek Leng Beng, also 77, stewards the group's Singapore operations. Collectively, the cousins are estimated to be worth around $15 billion.</p><p>Hong Leong Bankhas been in the family fold only since 1994. But it started out more than a century ago as a remittances shuffler for Borneo's Chinese trader diaspora; from those humble Sarawakian roots, HLB eventually became Malaysia's fifth-biggest bank.</p><p>It's a franchise anchored in Malaysia's commercially active Chinese community, who make up about a quarter of Malaysia's population of 32 million, behind the majority ethnic Malay community. Serving conservative Chinese communities and family business networks across Malaysia, HLB vies for the Chinese sector's attention with market leader Maybank and third-placed Public Bank, which is still run by its 88-year-old founder, Teh Hong Piow. That conservatism is evident in HLB's non-performing loans, which at a marginal 1% are the second-lowest among Malaysian banks after Public Bank.</p><p>The bank came into the Queks' orbit when they bought Malayan United Bank, or MUI Bank, in 1994 from fellow Malaysian tycoon Khoo Kay Peng. Rebadged Hong Leong, the bank has since become a key plank of the wider family's substantial wealth, particularly in Malaysia. According to Anand Pathmakanthan, analyst at Macquarie Research, 95% of the bank's loan book is domestic Malaysian. Digital at the core</p><p>Under Fuda, HLB has adopted the slogan \"~digital at the core'. It's a task that the 51-year-old Fuda, a self-described techie, has taken up with some gusto. It's a facelift, Fuda says, that's not just designed to shore up HLB's defences from franchise-threatening fintechs, but to position HLB as Malaysia's leading digital bank in the 21st century \"\" and stay there.</p><p>\"We've been around for more than 100 years, and the biggest thing we have is culture,\" Fuda explains. \"We are a traditional bank, (but) fintech and the big tech, they're putting a lot of emphasis on the customer. It's changing our culture, the way we work. You can't sit on the sidelines.\"</p><p>As he explains it, \"everything the customer does, we're trying to do digital. And everything else behind is the traditional way. So we have this thing, it's digital at the core, so even internally, whether it's HR, training, the way we collaborate, the workspace we are creating or whatever, has to change for us to be digital. But the core banking system will not be changing.\"</p><p>As he surveys Kuala Lumpur's sprawl from his executive eyrie in suburban Damansara Heights, Fuda points out that \"there are dangers coming from all over the place. Once upon a time, you could sit here, look out the window and you could physically see your competitors; CIMB, Maybank\"\u00a6 now who's your competitor? You can't always see them, they are all over the place.\"</p><p> We are a traditional bank, (but) fintech and the big tech, they're putting a lot of emphasis on the customer. It's changing our culture, the way we work. You can't sit on the sidelines - Domenic Fuda </p><p>The plan is to position HLB as a fintech hothouse, a tech laboratory with the idea that the startup atmosphere will infuse HLB's culture.</p><p>\"The fintechs are finding slivers of business lines, through remittances, peer-to-peer lending, small business, small payments, that type of stuff,\" Fuda says. \"But startups don't have the customers, so we say you can come and work with us, some of my guys become mentors. We give access to our own technology, so they can actually test the product with our customer base. So hopefully that gives them another leg up in getting a better product to market.\"</p><p>Fuda wants the experience to inspire staff at HLB.</p><p>\"Sometimes you've got to show staff that this is what other people are doing, the way they work it, agility, everything on the cloud, whatever. So I get my people in front of them and, hopefully, we carry some of that thing back into the bank, the enthusiasm, the energy. We've got to change the culture.\"</p><p>Fuda is one of the few Westerners to ever run a Malaysian bank, and the first one to helm HLB \"\" though not the first foreigner, as Fuda took over as chief executive from the Singaporean Tan Kong Khoon, who now heads Hong Leong Financial Group, HLB's parent.</p><p>His digital transformation of HLB is being noticed, both on the bottom line and in the market.</p><p>\"We regard HLB as being one of the leaders among its Malaysian peers in terms of articulating a clear digital bank transformation strategy,\" notes Citi banking analyst, Robert Kong, in a recent report. \"This means not only the transformation of the customer experience, but middleware and back-end systems as well. HLB's transformation has begun to save HLB real money.\"</p><p>Kong says in his report that HLB's transformation from a conservative traditional bank isn't just a \"front-end digital makeover but instead encompasses a well-thought-out medium-term view, making pervasive changes to the entire technology platform, business strategy and even company culture.\"</p><p>Digital transactions now account for around 70% of HLB's total transactions through its 250-strong physical branch network, up from 60% in 2016. Branch network</p><p>Fuda says the branch network is steadily being upgraded and transformed. Greater digitalization means that 70% of branch staff are now dealing directly with customers, he says, which allows for a more personal user experience and enhanced opportunities to cross-sell HLB products.</p><p>Citi analyst Kong approves, describing the HLB upgrade as \"radical personalization\", adding that it enables \"persuasive user engagement at the right time\".</p><p>\"Suppose a customer purchases a flight ticket,\" Kong posits. \"The system can make a decision whether this customer can be offered to buy insurance or to book a hotel through their credit card. This is ostensibly more effective and a large improvement from sending batch product offers without any context.\"</p><p>Kong sees profits at HLB soaring as a result of its transformation, from the RM2.145 billion ($521 million) it posted in the 2016/17 financial year, to RM3.012 billion by 2020.</p><p>DBS analyst Sue Lin Lim expects net profit of RM2.89 billion for HLB by 2020.</p><p>Italian by birth, Fuda nevertheless keeps a close eye on matters in his adopted home down under, in particular Canberra's ongoing royal commission into misconduct in the Australian financial sector. He sees lessons in it for his own patch in Malaysia, and Asian banking beyond.</p><p>\"We looked into it,\" Fuda says of the Australian banking inquiry. \"I don't know the ins and outs of the whole inquiry,\" but he says he asked the auditors to look into the matter to make sure everything was sound.</p><p>\"One of the things we have is trust, as a system\"\u00a6 it will take banks in Australia years to recover. I feel that Asian regulators are much more hands-on,\" he says. \"I think Malaysia, actually not just Malaysia, Asia, is very well banked. It's extremely competitive. So you've got to be on your guard, on your toes.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1b3xpgwzq23bk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGT-5SV1-F0GS-H0N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0008GOH</classCode><className>HONG LEONG BANK BHD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>C (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>C (BMV)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>8710 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001110</classCode><className>MEN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N523120MC</classCode><className>SECURITIES BROKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000887</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

According to Jason Lee, interim VP at NEM.io Foundation Ltd - a Singapore-based organisation that promotes NEM, an enterprise-grade blockchain technology platform - Malaysia is leading in certain areas but lagging in others. </p><p>\"Malaysia has demonstrated leadership by providing licences to cryptocurrency exchanges, peer-to-peer financing, equity crowdfunding and fintech sandboxes. This provides clarity and allows for ecosystem players to operate within a defined area, as long as regulation does not suffocate innovation. </p><p>\"Specific areas for improvement include the acceptance of emerging technologies like blockchain, which is gaining prominence thanks to Facebook's Libra project, and more organisations developing blockchain solutions,\" he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR). </p><p>Adlin Yusman, co-founder and COO of PNMB Payfo Sdn Bhd - the fintech arm of Percetakan Nasional Malaysia Bhd (PNMB) - shares similar sentiments, as he views Malaysia to be at an \"interesting intersection\" whereby the country currently has over 40 licensed e-money operators, most of whom - if not all - are attempting to create their own e-wallets, while over 90% of the population is receiving banking solutions in one form or another. </p><p>\"If you look at it as a microcosm, financial services in Malaysia seem to be doing well. However, we still have gaps in how we (banks and financial institutions) offer services and financial education to the public,\" Adlin told TMR. </p><p>He pointed out that opening a bank account, for example, still requires \"stacks of paper and ridiculous waiting times\", while consumers are charged \"ridiculous\" interest rates when taking up housing loans. </p><p>\"Our financial solutions may cover those that are employed - with their requisite tax and Employees Provident Fund deductions taken into account - pretty well, but for the micro business owners (such as nasi lemak stalls and e-commerce sellers) who live outside the norm, they have either no access to formal financial instruments or have no interest to find them,\" he added. </p><p>Mohammad Ridzuan Abdul Aziz, president of the Fintech Association of Malaysia (FAOM), believes that instead of viewing fintech as a race against other countries, the focus should be on ensuring the key internal stakeholders - namely policymakers, regulators, fintech firms, incumbents, consumers and educators - are able to collaborate closely to strengthen financial inclusion in Malaysia. </p><p>The successful adoption of fintech requires a radical rethink and approach to the business model, involving talent, funding, effective communication, relevant technology adoption and conducive environment for fintech firms to start, grow and scale up, he told TMR. </p><p>Apart from fintech companies, consumers also play an instrumental role in developing the ecosystem, as the companies can only be successful if they have enough users. </p><p>Within the Klang Valley, the payments space appears to be thriving, with nearly every major merchant now accepting at least one e-wallet by way of displaying said e-wallet sticker on their facade. In fact, plenty of shops now sport multiple e-wallet stickers. </p><p>How open are Malaysians to using fintech? Despite the proliferation of e-wallets locally, several industry observers comment that not quite everyone uses e-wallets just yet. </p><p>\"Malaysians in particular are attracted by freebies, so they'll sign up for an e-wallet if there's a discount or promotion offered. But the moment the discount expires, they'll move on to the next e-wallet. Stickiness and brand loyalty are hard to come by,\" said an observer. </p><p>Adlin concurred, noting that while incumbent wallet companies said they have received millions of sign-ups and have onboarded thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of merchants, the adoption curve remains the same as with any technology platform. </p><p>\"The real question is, how sticky are these users once all the rebates get pulled back? The fintech companies need to find sustainable solutions that address real problems, and when this happens, I would expect quite a fair bit of consumer hesitation would be mitigated,\" he said. </p><p>Mohammad Ridzuan, who also previously served as CEO of Sedania Innovator Bhd's fintech subsidiary, Sedania As-Salam Capital Sdn Bhd, said urbanites are generally ready to use fintech, while those who live away from major cities are less likely to do so. </p><p>\"This is because urbanites have a better understanding of fintech, have been exposed to fintech use-cases and are likely to have experienced fintech one way or another,\" he said. </p><p>The non-urban population, despite having access to news online and offline, are unlikely to have similar experiences with fintech and, therefore, tend to be sceptical about developments that are new, fast-changing and hard to fathom. </p><p>\"We believe with collaboration between the key stakeholders - policymakers, regulators, incumbents, fintech firms, consumers and educators - fintech will be accepted by the majority of the society and contribute significantly towards Malaysia's digital economy progress,\" Mohammad Ridzuan said. </p><p>What is the government doing to encourage the growth and adoption of fintech? Lee, who is also a founding member of FAOM, said the government is doing a lot to boost the fintech space, as seen most recently with the Malaysian Digital Economy Corp's inaugural Malaysia Tech Week 2019 last month, which was held in conjunction with Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) MyFintechWeek (MyFW) 2019. </p><p>\"Government agencies have led the way by introducing many fintech initiatives, and regulators are pro-innovation. The key is to find the right balance to allow talent to thrive in Malaysia by promoting cross-border talent movement,\" Lee said. </p><p>Mohammad Ridzuan said the government also provides a variety of monetary incentives and support programmes for start-ups, and is now recalibrating various agencies to improve awareness and efficiency in facilitating efforts for digital economy development. </p><p>Putrajaya is also embarking on reskilling public servants, facilitating more public-private partnership programmes, consulting industry experts and professionals to be part of various joint working groups, and facilitating the creation of regulatory sandboxes to develop newer business models. </p><p>According to EY's Asean FinTech Census 2018, 45% of respondents said it's \"difficult\" to conform to local financial sector regulations in Malaysia, while a further 45% rated the difficulty level as \"moderate\". </p><p>The study, which received 170 responses from across Asean and 81 responses from non-Asean countries, found that Thailand and Indonesia had the toughest regulations with regard to fintech, while Singapore-based firms had a relatively easier time conforming to regulatory requirements. </p><p>So, are regulations on fintech players in Malaysia too tight? Mohammad Ridzuan believes it's not about whether financial regulations are too tight, as they could be amended, suspended and/or exempted, where necessary. </p><p>\"It is more effective to aim for mutual understanding among key stakehol- ders, especially between the industry and regulators - for the regulators to take a positive view of the new and innovative business models, and for the fintech firms to be able to approach regulators for discussion and necessary support,\" he said. </p><p>He also supports BNM governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus' call for a national cyber-security agenda at MyFW 2019, where the central bank chief spoke of the need to be cognisant of potential technology- associated risks as fintech and big tech firms could pose \"system-wide vulnerabilities that can shock the financial system\". </p><p>\"The governor is right about being cognisant on risks associated with innovation, new business models and generally with fintech. These new developments bring with them a new spectrum of risks owing to the volume of data, extreme speed and a borderless online ecosystem. These elements are indeed the key enablers for new business models that enable real-time data management, fast transactions and seamless connectivity. On the flip side, they could also heighten cyber-security threats including ransomware, phishing and, eventually, compromise customers' data,\" Mohammad Ridzuan said. </p><p>Meanwhile, Adlin said BNM's move to obtain industry feedback ahead of setting up a virtual banking framework shows that a more collaborative atmosphere is in place, which can only spell positive things for the ecosystem. </p><p>\"When the Australian regulators awarded the licence to Xinja Holdings Ltd and Volt Bank Ltd, it was after an exhaustive year-long period of going back and forth with the two players to craft a framework that would allow new disruptive companies to apply innovative solutions to a space that hasn't been disrupted (at least in Australia) for over 30 years. </p><p>\"I'm sure Malaysia would have to go through a similar trajectory, but the aim as we've been made to understand is to ensure that the system remains robust and secure, and that any innovative solution should work within that framework,\" he said.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

After their spirited chat, he later asked Gladwell if he would like to be involved in their self-driving car doc.</p><p>While <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Autonomy</emphasis> is decidedly pro-autonomous cars, it does a commendable job of presenting the arguments both for and against the emerging technology. And while I\u2019m fascinated by all the futuristic gadgetry\u2014<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Minority Report</emphasis> is a sci-fi favorite\u2014I was also interested in speaking with Gladwell about the various controversies that have engulfed him, from allegations of plagiarism to his recent controversial column on the dangers of marijuana. This is our chat.</p><p>You know, before we get into autonomous cars, I\u2019m curious what you think of these electric scooters we\u2019re seeing zipping all over Austin. </p><p>Oh, I was going to use one to go back to my hotel\u2014for the first time. I think they\u2019re fantastic. For built-up urban spaces, they\u2019re ideal.</p><p>I personally think they\u2019re a public menace. But let\u2019s talk <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Autonomy</emphasis>. Did your involvement in the doc change your perception of autonomous cars?</p><p>I now believe it is inevitable. The film did two things: one, it convinced me that it\u2019s absolutely happening; and two, that it\u2019s happening sooner than I\u2019d ever imagined. It didn\u2019t change my subjective evaluation of it but it changed my understanding of the phenomenon. I have no more insight into when more than anyone else, but the limiting principle is probably not the technology, the limiting principle is almost certainly going to be the regulatory environment, and political jurisdictions to allow it. But it does seem like we\u2019re awfully close to a self-driving car that\u2019s safer than a human-driven car, so at that point it\u2019s just up to others to pull the switch.</p><p>The film dedicates a bit of time to the effects that this will have on the economy, since long-haul truck driving is one of the most popular jobs in the U.S. What do you think the consequences of autonomous cars will be? It seem like there are going to be a ton of people out of work and who\u2019d need to seek retraining. </p><p>I understand it will disrupt people\u2019s lives but then again, every single technological change does that, and that process is ongoing in a million different areas already. It\u2019s not as if this transformation is going to happen overnight, and do you know how many long-haul truck driving vacancies there are? There\u2019s a lot. So it\u2019s happening in an atmosphere of full employment\u2014knock on wood. And also, it may not create as many jobs as it displaces in the short-term, and it doesn\u2019t create the same kinds of jobs, but it does create a new set of jobs. This is part of a larger move toward the internet of things, which is an astonishing transformation that is going to take a huge amount of human power. If you think about embodying objects with digital connectivity\u2014which we want to do to every object, not just the car\u2014the amount of people we\u2019re going to need to write that software, install it, fix it, train people in it, on and on\u2026</p><p>\u2026But that\u2019s a highly-skilled job. That takes a ton of training. </p><p>True, but being a long-haul truck driver takes a lot of training and a certain degree of skill. I don\u2019t think we believe that those jobs are outside the ability of people who are currently employed in driving trucks. I always think of, if you want to introduce \u201cthe internet of things\u201d to my mother\u2019s apartment, well you\u2019d better have someone spending a lot of time with her to tell her how to use things, and to fix it when it goes wrong\u2014which is going to happen a lot when you have inexpert users.</p><p>There appears to be a divide along party lines when it comes to the future of automation. They do seem to be more forward-thinking on the Democratic side when it comes to thinking about automation, how it\u2019s displacing jobs, and how to potentially replace those jobs. The Republican Party does not seem to have given this as much thought. </p><p>I\u2019m not sure I necessarily agree with that. I think the public rhetoric of Democrats is different than that of Republicans, but I think privately, both are unavoidably caught up in this transformation. Regulations are going to come before Congress, we\u2019re going to have to devise regulatory frameworks for these kinds of vehicles\u2014both parties will be intimately involved in that, and it\u2019s not like one party is turning its back on the process.</p><p>You don\u2019t think there\u2019s more reluctance to technological change on the part of the Republican Party? Look at the fossil fuel industry versus green energy. </p><p>That\u2019s different, though.</p><p>It\u2019s still a resistance to technological change. </p><p>I don\u2019t know. Do you think the automobile industry is aligned more with one political party than the other?</p><p>*</p><p>COPY CHIEF</p><p>Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s Plagiarism Problem</p><p>Lloyd Grove</p><p>*</p><p>RED BLOWING SMOKE</p><p>Malcolm Gladwell Is Wrong. Marijuana Is Not a Gateway Drug.</p><p>Tanya Basu</p><p>BEAST INSIDE</p><p>Yes. I think they\u2019re aligned more with the Republican Party, because they\u2019re more aligned with the fossil fuel industry and those two things go hand in hand. </p><p>So, who\u2019s behind this a hundred percent? The automobile industry, right? So, to the extent that they\u2019re deeply interested in this development, and they\u2019re aligned with the Republican Party, the Republican Party is going to be in the middle of it. The state of Arizona, the most Republican of states, has been the most willing to allow that experimentation in self-driving cars to go forward.</p><p>Not really the reddest of states anymore in light of Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s midterm win. It\u2019s definitely getting a bit more purple, but I hear ya. </p><p>Although I would raise an eyebrow a little bit at the idea that much of this imagined future is something that we can plan for. The real lesson of technology is you actually can\u2019t plan for technological change, you can only react smartly and quickly to it. We really have no idea. With each of these new waves, the modal response to waves of technology is surprise, not \u201cI knew this was going to happen.\u201d There is no consequential part of the downside of the internet that was predicted. The two biggest problems we would say with the internet are: it seems to have a toxic effect on the quality of democracy, which nobody saw coming; the second thing is, we now think it probably is implicated in a profound way with the mental health of young people. Nobody saw that coming. So, can we plan? We can imagine. There are certain scenarios which we could make more likely. We could reconfigure urban spaces so the introduction of autonomous vehicles is easier, but do we know how people are going to use this technology? No. We have no clue.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren just spoke at SXSW about how she wants to break up the big tech companies\u2014Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. And it does seem like many of these companies have exhibited patterns of abuse\u2014both of information and employees. </p><p>Oh, I\u2019m so in favor of breaking them all up. I would smash them to tiny pieces. I mean, find me a human being on the planet who thinks the breakup of AT&amp;T was a bad idea? Find me a human being on the planet who thinks the breakup of Standard Oil was a bad idea? In retrospect it was absolutely clear it is not a good idea in technologically fluid situations to have one company with overwhelming amounts of power.</p><p>Sounds like you\u2019re describing Amazon.</p><p>Oh, don\u2019t even get me started on Amazon.</p><p>Well, you\u2019re a New Yorker like me and we just had this big fight over its planned corporate headquarters in Queens. I was sort of agnostic, to be honest, and found people on both sides of the debate to be a bit hysterical over the whole thing. </p><p>I\u2019m of two minds about this: if you have a strictly utilitarian economic analysis of the Amazon deal, would the city as a whole have benefitted? Were we going to get more back than what we were going to lose in whatever tax credits we were extending to them? The answer to that of course was yes, we would get more back. At the same time, does Amazon\u2019s behavior disgust me? Yes, it does. They made a great pretense that they were choosing the place for their headquarters based on all these objective criteria\u2014is this the right community for our workers, is their a knowledge base there, etc. But it turns out, what was it really about? Who gave them the sweetest deal. I just find that, for one of the most powerful companies in the world to go sniffing around money-grubbing like that. Google didn\u2019t ask for that kind of deal. I\u2019m just sick of the idea that where we are as a democracy in 2019 is that governments exist to bail out governments and rich people, so to the extent that we sent a message that we\u2019re not willing to do that anymore, I think is just fine. Sadly, however, someone else will just give them the same deal. But it is time for corporate welfare to come to an end.</p><p>You\u2019re on social media, so I\u2019m sure you see the vitriolic replies and all that. But\u2014and this is an admittedly broad question\u2014how do you feel about the state of social media in 2019?</p><p>If you\u2019re asking me if we\u2019d be better off if Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t exist, I actually think we <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">would</emphasis> be better off. But of course you can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle.</p><p>Speaking of pushback, I want to discuss your recent <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Yorker</emphasis> piece on marijuana. I had several issues with it. It did seem to rely too heavily on anecdotal evidence versus scientific evidence. And there\u2019s one portion in particular that a lot of people, myself included, took issue with concerning the rise in murder and aggravated assault in Washington. </p><p>OK. First, two comments. One is, the article was in large part a representation and a rephrasing of the National Academy of Medicine report, which was a report written by basically the 15 or 20 foremost experts on cannabis in the world. I was not representing anecdotal evidence in that sense, I was representing the state of knowledge in the scientific community. They are the ones who say we don\u2019t know enough, not me.</p><p>There was a lot of correlation implying causation in your piece.</p><p>Hold on, hold on. Part two, I said that since we don\u2019t know everything, let me give you the worst case scenario, which was this book. Now, I freely say throughout the article that the book\u2019s [Alex Berenson\u2019s T<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence</emphasis>] arguments are alarmist, one-sided, there\u2019s a lot of correlation without causation, and you have to know how bad it\u2019s going to be.</p><p>But isn\u2019t that alarmist in itself? </p><p>Of course! But you have to engage the worst-case scenario if you are going to make up intelligent and thoughtful analysis. You can\u2019t pretend that you are in the Magic Kingdom. And by the way, the positive response to that piece outnumbered the negative response by many, many orders of magnitude. But the cannabis-lovers who so objected to that are people who have put their hands over their ears, closed their eyes, and are simply drowning out all the noise. Look, if you were to put a label on an ounce of marijuana, what would the label say? Can you tell me whether someone who is pregnant should smoke this? You can\u2019t. Can you tell me at what age someone should safely start smoking it? You can\u2019t.</p><p>Look, I agree there should be more research done on it, but\u2014</p><p>\u2014But that\u2019s all I was saying. There has never been a drug of that power legalized in this country without asking those basic questions. We are so far into uncharted territory here, and that\u2019s all I was saying.</p><p>But I want to go back to Washington State. In the piece you directly correlated the rise of violent crime in the state to the legalization of marijuana. </p><p>I was just saying, look, the dude says\u2026 by the way, have you read that book? I <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">so</emphasis> backed off 98 percent of that guy\u2019s claims. I did want to point out though that it is a little odd that they have a violent crime problem in the state of Washington.</p><p>That\u2019s because income inequality has risen in the state\u2014including over the period in question, 2014-2017. It\u2019s the 10th highest when it comes to income inequality in the U.S. </p><p>That would be a correlation without causation.</p><p>I think increased income inequality plays a far greater role in the rise of violent crime than the increased usage of marijuana, wouldn\u2019t you? </p><p>How do you know?</p><p>Oh, come on. You really think that?</p><p>The city with the greatest income inequality in America is probably New York City. New York City is probably one of the safest cities in America.</p><p>I would say San Francisco is probably the city with the biggest income inequality in America, and New York is not one of the safest cities in America. </p><p>New York is an insanely safe city. It\u2019s one of the safest cities in the world. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re on firmer ground than me.</p><p>You did a podcast that caused a bit of an uproar too, where you called Tina Fey\u2019s Sarah Palin impression on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SNL</emphasis> \u201ctoothless.\u201d Now, I think a lot of the political sketches on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SNL</emphasis> are pretty uninspired these days. They seem to mostly be regurgitating what Trump and his cohorts say every weekend. </p><p>I don\u2019t really watch much <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saturday Night Live</emphasis>. I haven\u2019t watched in years. I don\u2019t think that was a very successful podcast episode. I thought it was a difficult subject that I took a crack at, and I don\u2019t think I took a particularly good crack at it.</p><p>What did you think was wrong with it in the audit? </p><p>I don\u2019t know exactly what was wrong with it. I didn\u2019t have a clear idea of what I wanted to say. There are some of those episodes where some don\u2019t work, and that was a B-minus.</p><p>I\u2019ve read several of your books, and I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s weird to be pegged as the \u201c10,000 hours\u201d guy, and then to have many people in the scientific community\u2014evolutionary biologists, etc.\u2014pretty much debunk that theory. </p><p>Well, there were many problems. One was the idea that it was most misused in the realm of sport, and my book was unconcerned with sport. So the idea was taken away from me, distorted, and reflected back on me unfairly a little bit. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been\u2026 I was uninterested in the number, I was simply interested in the notion that the gestation period for mastery is longer than we generally think. That was my only interest in that, which is a thoroughly uncontroversial notion\u2014and the evidence for that continues to mount. But it\u2019s fine. Whatever. You lose control of arguments once you write about them.</p><p>I\u2019m also curious about an incident that occurred a few years back, where two online sleuths found some passages you\u2019d written that were quite similar to those written previous. Your response to it was to point to your 2004 essay when you yourself were plagiarized, and ultimately called it \u201cthe narcissism of small differences.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s plagiarism.</p><p>We\u2019re under a president now that\u2019s trying to poke holes in the fabric of journalism\u2014the integrity of it\u2014and I want to ask if you still believe that it\u2019s \u201cthe narcissism of small differences,\u201d and that it\u2019s unimportant for journalists to maintain that fabric. </p><p>Well, let\u2019s be clear: I\u2019ve written several million words in my life. Two guys, who would not identify themselves, identified about a sentence from an article ten years ago\u2014</p><p>\u2014It was two passages.</p><p>\u2014Two passages that were not identical, and I also credited the source of the passage. So, first of all, that\u2019s not what I call plagiarism. Plagiarism is when you represent the words of someone else without giving any credit whatsoever. I, a) did not use the exact words, and b) gave them credit. So what they were doing was those were two people trying to make a little bit of a splash. I was resolutely untroubled by that, as was anyone who knows anything about journalism. And as far as my submitted response, I said, \u201cDude, that\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about?\u201d The issue with any kind of creative work is when people appropriate someone else\u2019s ideas without giving them credit. That\u2019s the core issue. The fact that a couple of nonessential adverbs show up, the idea that that\u2019s what you want to spend your time zooming in on? Get a life! My answer, way back when, was talking about a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">real</emphasis> issue of plagiarism where someone took my words\u2014and took them in totality, took paragraphs of them without giving any credit. And my response to that, which I think should be the response of anyone who\u2019s plagiarized in that way, is: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">so what, whatever</emphasis>. Who cares? The person took the words and made something new. I\u2019m fine with that! Why is this what we\u2019re talking about? Like, there are so many more consequential things we need to be discussing.</p><p>You don\u2019t think plagiarism is a journalistic sin? </p><p>I mean, it\u2019s bad manners. Who cares. Someone can use all the words of mine they want. What I get angry at is when I have an idea that I think is original and consequential, and someone steals it and doesn\u2019t credit me, that makes me mad. But if you want to go through my books and you find a paragraph, and you think that paragraph describes something really well and want to stick it in your book, go ahead!</p><p>So if I wanted to release<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Blink </emphasis>under my name you wouldn\u2019t sue my ass into oblivion? I\u2019m kidding obviously. </p><p>Well, not the whole book! But the book is an idea. There\u2019s a story in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Blink</emphasis> about a Marine Corps general, and if you think it\u2019s a great paragraph and you want to take it, I hope you credit me. But if you don\u2019t credit me, am I going to knock on your door and ask for you to be fired from your job? No! Life goes on, man. People have to have some sense of judgment about these things. These are not crimes; they are misdemeanors. If I saw you jaywalking, would I ask for you to be fired from your job?</p><p>You don\u2019t think a journalist should be fired for plagiarism? </p><p>It\u2019s bad manners. I don\u2019t think the person who plagiarized me should have lost her job. I don\u2019t care.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2189867668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMD-VTC1-DY0W-41FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Gladwell, Malcolm</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Internet of Things</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Plagiarism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Etiquette</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Automation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Books</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Employment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political parties</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: Automotive industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: Donald J.

Dans les all\u00e9es du Salon, cependant, les entreprises ont poursuivi leurs annonces de produits collectant toujours plus de donn\u00e9es, notamment autour de la maison connect\u00e9e. Amazon a annonc\u00e9 lundi que son assistant intelligent Alexa \u00e9tait d\u00e9sormais int\u00e9gr\u00e9 \u00e0 200 millions d'appareils, un nombre qui a doubl\u00e9 en un an.</p><p>Le g\u00e9ant de Seattle a annonc\u00e9 de nouvelles int\u00e9grations, du pommeau de douche de Kohler \u00e0 la station d'essence d'Exxon, en passant par les t\u00e9l\u00e9viseurs de Samsung et LG. Google n'a pas voulu \u00eatre en reste et a annonc\u00e9 que son assistant \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9 par 500 millions de personnes chaque mois, le premier chiffre communiqu\u00e9 par l'entreprise \u00e0 ce sujet.</p><p>Malgr\u00e9 la multiplication des enqu\u00eates des autorit\u00e9s, le secteur continue d'afficher son optimisme. Dans les h\u00f4tels de Las Vegas, l'impression qui se d\u00e9gage est que rien ne va changer drastiquement dans un avenir proche. La majorit\u00e9 des participants assure de toute fa\u00e7on que pour d\u00e9velopper des services reposant sur l'intelligence artificielle, la collecte de donn\u00e9es est in\u00e9vitable.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> \u00ab Les r\u00e9v\u00e9lations sur l'\u00e9coute de certains enregistrements audio par des salari\u00e9s d'Apple ou Amazon ne vont pas emp\u00eacher l'adoption des enceintes intelligentes. Un sondage montre que le premier obstacle \u00e0 l'adoption des haut-parleurs intelligents, c'est que ces objets ne sont pas encore assez intelligents. Le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e arrive en deuxi\u00e8me seulement. Mais plus les objets sont intelligents, plus les probl\u00e8mes de vie priv\u00e9e se posent \u00bb</emphasis>, souligne Razvan Todor, directeur de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la maison connect\u00e9e chez l'entreprise de cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9 Bitdefender.</p><h>Pouvoirs limit\u00e9s</h><p>Les d\u00e9bats avec la FTC (l'agence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale charg\u00e9e du commerce et donc des droits du consommateur) ont aussi clairement montr\u00e9 que ses pouvoirs \u00e9taient limit\u00e9s et loin de ses \u00e9quivalents europ\u00e9ens.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab La FTC est une agence tr\u00e8s petite, avec un budget de 300 millions de dollars annuel, qui avait 50 % de salari\u00e9s de plus au d\u00e9but de l'administration Reagan qu'aujourd'hui, alors que l'\u00e9conomie a grossi consid\u00e9rablement et notre mandat aussi \u00bb</emphasis>, a d\u00e9plor\u00e9 Rebecca Slaughter, l'une des commissaires de l'agence.

Who knows how much longer it'll be? Will the company's thought police come for me next?</p><p> How about you? If you are a non-leftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.P. Morgan Chase ...., you need to ask questions and get answers. On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America's very own version of the Chinese social credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished and eradicated. First, some background: Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that 'after careful consideration,' the financial institution could 'no longer support' his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine. Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase's payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe and PayPal before losing his bank accounts. When I asked on Twitter in February why we can't have just one financial institution that doesn't cave to social justice warriors, the official ChaseTwitter account tweeted me back: 'Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.' I pointed out that Chase's letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account. 'So if not for political reasons,' I asked, 'why, 'after careful consideration,' did you close his account?' The social media manager of Chase's corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: 'For privacy reasons, we can't say more.' Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how: \u2014One Chase employee blamed 'clerical' issues on Tarrio's account cancellation. \u2014Another stated: 'I see nothing that indicates any reason why the account should be closed. I don't see any outstanding transactions or anything ridiculous.' \u2014Another explained: 'Chase is not involved with any like, you know, alt-right people or anything.' Those with 'no moral character' are people that 'the bank usually doesn't get involved with in any 'business relationships, period.' \u2014Several repeated a company line in Tarrio's mysterious file: 'Decision is not reversible.' Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Markota's, Loomer's and Biggs' removals 'clerical' errors or unfounded or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a 'moral character' assessment? More questions arise: How exactly is J.P. Morgan Chase's $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC left-wing operatives being put to use? Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to 'destroy' its political enemies on the right? What comment does Chase have now that SPLC's top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace? Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers' political speech on social media platforms? Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC? One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter for BigLeaguePolitics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws \u2014 even though Paypal's own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that 'violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.' Tarrio warns of the speech-squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: 'First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked. It's a very dangerous trend.' He is not alone. Former Toronto mayoral candidate and social media commentator Faith Goldy told me: 'To date I've been banned from: PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram. I've committed no crime! My only fault is loving my country and quoting government statistics to a camera from my kitchen table. The nature of big tech censorship is imperialistic and these Silicon Valley nerds won't stop until every freethinker is snuffed or scared into submission.' As for Chase Bank, I sent all my questions to chief communications officer Patricia Wexler, who challenged the authenticity of one of the employees recorded by Veritas (O'Keefe showed proof of the Chase New York media relations number dialed and had audio of the employee identifying himself as a Chase rep) and ignored the substance of the report.

They helped him through critical parts of his presidential campaign and are guilty of felony charges that could land them in prison for decades.</p><p>A jury in Virginia has found former campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty of eight financial crimes, it's the first case special counsel Robert Mueller's team has taken to trial.</p><p>The jury could not reach a verdict on 10 counts against Manafort but they did find him guilty on five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of hiding foreign bank accounts.

Glad to be here.</p><p>CHURCH: Two of Donald Trump's men facing justice Tuesday. In Michael Cohen's case, his guilty plea directly implicates a sitting president. Michael Cohen says he paid women hush money at the direction of candidate Donald Trump and this is what Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, tweeted.</p><p>\"Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election.</p><p>\"If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?\"</p><p>Wow. So what is your reaction to that?</p><p>Is he right, did Donald Trump commit a crime here?</p><p>COATES: It certainly says he did, according to the statements made by Michael Cohen. I can't impress upon you enough the gravity of this. You have a sitting president, one of his right-hand man, who knows him best of all, known as his fixer, comes out in a court of law saying --</p><p>[02:05:00]</p><p>COATES: -- he acted with the direction and in cahoots with the President of the United States to commit a felony offense and more than one.</p><p>This goes back to the understanding of what the executive branch does. The President of United States overseas the Department of Justice, it is his job to ensure that he is abiding by the laws of the land.</p><p>To have him implicated in this crime is astounding. Having said that, the campaign finance laws here in the U.S. are quite clear. There is a cap on the amount of money that you give to an election campaign.</p><p>There's also a reporting requirement that corresponds with whatever money you give. You can't simply circumvent those laws by having somebody pay it in advance and pay them back later through a loan, before or after the election.</p><p>If you did that, there would be no point of having the election campaign finance laws, because you could just wait until you win in order to have that money be shielded. What you are seeing here is the President of the United States being taken to task for actions and activities that influence the presidential election. That is shocking.</p><p>CHURCH: So if President Trump committed a crime here, what happens next?</p><p>Because you can't indict a sitting president.</p><p>COATES: Well, there is a policy at the Department of Justice. And the policy is not necessarily the rule of law. It doesn't come with the same precedential value as a Supreme Court decision.</p><p>But it says, under the DOJ policy, we don't want to throw the government into complete chaos by having a president be indicted and sitting in a criminal trial. But the notion is very nuanced, it must be a sitting president, it does not mean that if impeachment proceedings came about and impeachment was the result, you could not then indict a no longer sitting president.</p><p>This is ironically very similar to what happened in Watergate, where you had Richard Nixon, named as a unindicted co-conspirator, based on that same policy that you couldn't indict a sitting president.</p><p>Ultimately he did not face the criminal charges, because of what happened next in America. But certainly, a president could have the political consequence and could, once he is not the President of the United States, still face the same charges. But really we are in uncharted territory here.</p><p>CHURCH: This is the situation, two legal blows for the President of the United States, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. Now those two legal blows are fueling this chatter about a possible impeachment.</p><p>But what would the process be next?</p><p>Surely, Michael Cohen would need to prove he was directed by Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump could say he is a liar.</p><p>COATES: He could. There is a court of law, felonies and misdemeanors, corresponding to different levels of charges, then under the impeachment, you've got high crimes and misdemeanors.</p><p>They don't necessarily correspond to your normal viewpoint of what is a felony and what is a misdemeanor. Essentially crimes that are committed that undermine the power and the credibility of the office, including things certainly like trying to get involved in campaign finance violations or any felony offense.</p><p>The process normally for impeachment are articles of impeachment drafted in the House, meaning the House serves as kind of a jury, a grand jury, to say we think there has been a wrong, a high crime or misdemeanor or equivalent. We would like this person to be tried for impeachment.</p><p>Then it goes to the Senate and they have a trial-like proceeding. That is all incumbent on a willing House and a willing Senate to do either of those two things. That normally has a partisan affiliation to it. As you know, here in the United States, it's run by the Republicans on both the House and the Senate sides.</p><p>There's not a whole lot of incentive to (INAUDIBLE) the Republican Party, particularly before the midterm elections. If that shifted this coming November, perhaps there's different incentive to do so.</p><p>But ultimately, it all rests with the political process. One final thing, Robert Mueller, his job as special counsel, is to write a report to Rod Rosenstein, who is acting in place of the recused Jeff Sessions.</p><p>He will write a report that goes to Congress to recommend all of his findings. And you can be sure that part of it will be that the President of the United States was implicated in committing felony crimes in the state of New York, with somebody who was his right-hand man. That will be part of the calculus that they will consider, in Congress, about whether or not to impeach a sitting president.</p><p>CHURCH: You would see Robert Mueller getting involved in this?</p><p>Not all legal analysts agree on that particular matter.</p><p>COATES: Robert Mueller did farm out the case of the Southern District of New York because the crimes that were alleged with Michael Cohen did not come out necessarily of his directive of collusion, looking into collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia.</p><p>Michael Cohen may have been the right-hand man of Donald Trump but he wasn't technically part of the campaign, although we are seeing --</p><p>[02:10:00]</p><p>COATES: -- campaign finance violations that came out of it.</p><p>So he farmed it out. Because you farm a piece of it out, it doesn't mean that he doesn't retain some greater authority in the long run to reclaim portions of it. Ultimately, he will have the task of drafting a report that encompasses all the different aspects of the case.</p><p>Now the case involving Michael Cohen came out of his mandate, in the sense that, if you think about the collusion investigation, they have the directive to be able to investigate a murder in a home. In the process of looking into that murder, they've passed by a coffee table with a mound full of drugs.</p><p>They are not required to walk by it, ignore it and not press charges simply because their ultimate directive was the homicide investigation. Michael Cohen, in many ways, is the coffee table with drugs, to say we saw this. We presented it to somebody else to more effectively deal with it.</p><p>But I can still incorporate it because it fell under the umbrella of things that I was entitled to look at under my mandate and, because of that, it will be included in the report.</p><p>CHURCH: That's a good analogy there, Laura Coates, we thank you always for your legal analysis.</p><p>COATES: Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: Pornography star Stormy Daniels feels vindicated after Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law. As we heard earlier, Michael Cohen implicated Donald Trump in the illegal payment of $130,000 to silence her over an alleged affair.</p><p>And now her attorney, Michael Avenatti, tells CNN's Chris Cuomo, he is coming after Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL AVENATTI, STORMY DANIELS' ATTORNEY: I know for a fact that Michael Cohen is cooperating and providing information to federal prosecutors, so there is no reason why they would've entered into this plea agreement were he not cooperating. Michael Cohen has a lot of information.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: So you don't need a cooperation deal to be cooperating?</p><p>AVENATTI: Exactly, and I think that point is critical. You don't have to have it in writing in the documents to have an agreement in place. I am highly confident, in fact, I know, Michael Cohen has been providing information. Prosecutors at SDNY are expecting him to continue to cooperate because, if he doesn't, they have the ultimate hammer.</p><p>That is, at the sentencing stage, which will take place in December, they can ask for either an upward departure or the maximum. They have a significant hammer in their toolbox in the event Michael Cohen doesn't cooperate.</p><p>CUOMO: Same with Manafort?</p><p>AVENATTI: Same with Paul Manafort. We have a pending motion ability to depose Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. I think there's zero chance we don't get a deposition of Michael Cohen. And I think there is a significant likelihood that we will get a deposition of Donald Trump.</p><p>What that will mean is, I will have an opportunity to ask Michael Cohen and Donald Trump questions under oath. Under oath -- it is one thing to lie to you or other members of the press. It's an entirely different thing to lie under oath.</p><p>I will be able to ask difficult questions of Michael Cohen and Donald Trump about what they knew, when they knew it, what they did about it and what they did to cover it up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: And with Michael Cohen's guilty plea, we are witnessing an extraordinary U-turn in his relationship with Donald Trump.

Now 89 Korean families are forced to separate yet again. They spent 12 hours together over the past three days, not nearly long enough to make up for all that time apart. Soon, their South Korean relatives will return home and thousands of others are still hoping to live long enough for their own chance at one of these long- awaited reunions.</p><p>Our Paula Hancocks is live in South Korea, joining us now. Paula, as this round of family reunions came to a tearful end, are there any plans to make these events more regular, including more of the 57,000 people still waiting to reunite with their loved ones?</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary, that is the hope from the South Korean side. But it always has been the hope from the South Korean side, it's not just up to one of the Koreas. Pyongyang has to agree.</p><p>It is really only when relations between North and South Korea are good that these reunions happen. So we are here where, just a couple of days ago, very excited families were getting on a bus, heading to the North Korean side of the DMZ and meeting with families that they haven't seen in decades, that in many cases they didn't even know whether they were --</p><p>[02:25:00]</p><p>HANCOCKS: -- still alive. We have certainly seen some very emotional images from those reunions in the North. But they have already said their goodbyes. They are heading down on their buses, back to South Korea. They will be here in a couple of hours.</p><p>So they have already said goodbye, they know they are very unlikely to see those family members again. This is something that the head of the Red Cross, when I spoke to him here in South Korea, was talking about, that they want to make sure that, once they have had these reunions, that is not it, because at this point, they have no further communication.</p><p>They don't see each other again but he wants to try to make sure that there is some kind of communication between the two sides afterwards as well. The president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, himself from a separated family and was part of one of these family reunions in the past with his mother, meeting his auntie for the first time, he said that this is a top priority for him, from a humanitarian point of view, to try and make sure there are more of these reunions.</p><p>Of course the South Korean side can say all it wants. The U.N. secretary-general has called for more reunions. It is up to Pyongyang if they want to do this again.</p><p>CHURCH: It is a heartbreaking situation.</p><p>Paula, do we have any idea when the next round of family reunions will likely happen?</p><p>Have there been any discussions moving in that direction?</p><p>HANCOCKS: There are going to be more reunions later this week, this is within this reunion this time, there's going to be families from North Korea that have applied to be part of these reunions.</p><p>And the South Korean counterparts will be heading north to meet them. So there is this second round that is coming up. But beyond that, we don't know whether there will be any in the future, certainly, as I say, there have been calls for many more to happen, 57,000 people from the South Korean side were eligible for these reunions.</p><p>They are still waiting. We have spoken to some of them, there's bitter disappointment they have not been involved. Even a couple of days ago here, one man came to protest that his 90-year-old father was developing dementia and so soon he wouldn't even be able to remember his relatives from a medical point of view, let alone the fact that he has been parted from them for many decades.</p><p>So it is a desperate race against time to try to reunite as many of these families as possible and to reunite them in a more permanent sense than just three days in North Korea.</p><p>In a couple of hours' time, we'll see 89 families descending from a bus, having been in North Korea, this is the most heartbreaking moment, knowing that that is probably it, that they won't see them again in the future.</p><p>So there is really a couple of elements to this, yes, there needs to be more reunions. Yes, these reunions need to encompass a larger number of separated families. But there needs to be, according to the Red Cross head, a continued communication once they have met.</p><p>CHURCH: Let's hope that happens. It is so very sad.

Donald Trump's former lawyer admits he broke campaign finance laws in 2016, and that then candidate Trump directed him to do so. Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts including bank and tax fraud. He arranged payments to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Facebook and Twitter have removed hundreds of accounts that they say were part of a coordinated disinformation campaign. Some of the accounts originated in Iran, others in Russia. Meantime, Microsoft removed six phony websites saying they were created by hackers tied to Russian military intelligence. After briefly reuniting in North Korea, 89 families torn between the North and South now have to separate again.</p><p>They spent 12 hours together over the past three days trying to catch up with relatives they have not seen in nearly seven decades. South Korea's president is vowing to make more family reunions a top priority. All right. Back to our top story now, Michael Cohen, the man long known as Donald Trump's fixer could face roughly five years in prison for his guilty plea on Tuesday. But that sentence could depend on whether Cohen chooses to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>As of now, there's nothing to suggest he will do so, and cooperation is not part of his plea deal. Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, one count of false statements to a bank, one count of causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of excessive campaign contribution. The deputy U.S. attorney says the charges reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty that are especially significant when done by a lawyer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT KHUZAMI, DEPUTY UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to two campaign finance charges, one for causing an unlawful corporate contribution and the second one for personally making an excessive personal contribution both for the purpose of influencing the 2016 election. In addition, what he did was he worked to pay money to silence two women who had information that he believed would be detrimental to the 2016 campaign and to the candidate and the campaign.</p><p>In addition, Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement for that money by submitting invoices to the candidates company which were untrue and false. They indicated that the reimbursement was for services rendered for the year 2070 when in fact those invoices were a sham.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Well, several hundred kilometers away at nearly the same time as Cohen's plea, a jury found President Trump's former campaign chairman guilty of financial crimes. Jessica Schneider has that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A guilty verdict for Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who faced a 12 day trial for financial crimes. The six men and six women on the jury finding Manafort guilty on five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one charge of hiding foreign bank accounts. But the judge declaring a mistrial on 10 other counts. As the verdict was read, Paul Manafort remained stone-faced while his wife Kathy sat a few rows behind him expressed no emotion.</p><p>Her hands clasped in her lap. Manafort's defense team had projected optimism throughout the four days of deliberation.</p><p>KEVIN DOWNING, PAUL MANAFORT'S LAWYER: Mr. Paul Manafort is disappointed of not getting acquittals all the way through or a complete hung jury on all counts.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: This jury considered 18 complicated counts of tax evasion, bank fraud, and hiding foreign bank accounts. The jury asked for clarification on the counts just twice. Last Thursday, they asked the judge for further explanation about the standard for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. Tuesday morning they asked what they should do if they couldn't reach unanimous decision on a single count.</p><p>[02:35:04] The judge instructed them to go back to the jury room and try again. Hours later, they emerged with their verdict. Prosecutors made their case against Manafort with 27 witnesses and more than 300 documents explaining that Manafort made more than $60 million from his lobbying work in Ukraine, and that he allegedly hid it in 31 foreign bank accounts. They also showcase Manafort's extravagant purchases including five homes spanning from Manhattan to Virginia, a $15,000 ostrich coat, and a $10,000 karaoke machine.</p><p>But they acknowledged we're not in the courtroom today because Mr. Manafort is wealthy. It is because Mr. Manafort filed false tax returns. It is not a crime in this country to be wealthy. The defense did not president any witnesses and Manafort himself did not testify. But during their closing arguments, the defense pointed to Manafort's decades of work as a political consultant for Presidents Ronald Reagan, and Gerald Ford, and President Trump.</p><p>PAUL MANAFORT, AMERICAN POLITICAL CONSULTANT: Today at around 7:30, Mr. Trump will be the nominee of the Republican Party. So we're excited about that.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: The defense team also argued Manafort was a victim of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation telling the jury no one seemed concerned about Manafort's dealings with banks until the special counsel showed up and started asking questions saying clearly their goal was to stack up the counts. Manafort's is the first case brought to trial by the Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election, a probe often dismissed by the president as a witch hunt.</p><p>But now, one of his former top aides found guilty. The president so far has been quiet when it comes to offering his former campaign chairman a pardon, but he has made his disdain for the trial known.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, it's a very sad thing that happened. This has nothing to do with Russian collusion.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: Our thanks to Jessica Schneider for that report. So let's bring in former federal prosecutor and CNN Legal Analyst Michael Zeldin who also worked with Robert Mueller at the Department of Justice. Thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>MICHAEL ZELDIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ANALYST: My pleasure.</p><p>CHURCH: So two of Donald Trump's men facing justice Tuesday. Michael Cohen's case, the biggest story with him pleading guilty and implicating a sitting president. Cohen says he paid women hush money at the direction of a candidate that of course being Donald Trump. This is what Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis tweeted. Today, he stood up and testified under oath. He's doing that Cohen there obviously. That Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election. If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump? Is Cohen's attorney right there? Did Donald Trump commit a crime and will Cohen be able to prove he was directed by Mr. Trump in this instance?</p><p>ZELDIN: So that's the $64,000 question. Cohen's side of the story is that Donald Trump directed me to do this. It has to be verified that that's the case, but that's the story that Cohen said under oath in court while entering his plea of guilty. If it's able to be proved to be true, then, yes, Donald Trump would be aiding and abetting or conspiring with Cohen to violate campaign finance laws, and candidate Cohen -- candidate Trump would have an additional charge of filing a false campaign report with the Federal Election Commission that left out that payment, and that's a separate five year lying to federal officials crime. So if provable, this is serious stuff.</p><p>CHURCH: So how big a problem could this proved to be for President Trump? And will this be something that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation will look into?</p><p>ZELDIN: I don't think it would be in Mueller's, you know, bailey wig. It's mostly going to be in the Southern District of New York's ambit. However, where this falls for the president is because the President of the United States by Justice Department policy cannot be indicted himself. This becomes a political evaluation by the House of Representatives to determine whether or not this activity amounts to something that should invoke an inquiry into impeachment.</p><p>CHURCH: Do you think it would go that far?</p><p>ZELDIN: Well, you know, in a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, it's not likely to go that far. In a Democratic House of Representatives, I would think that they would open an inquiry whether it goes there, you know, all the way through to the end remains to be seen. But it's serious stuff when you encourage somebody to lie about the, you know, authenticity of your election.</p><p>CHURCH: How concerned do you think Mr. Trump would be right now?</p><p>[02:40:07] ZELDIN: I think he should be concerned. It's not, you know, something that one would feel comfortable when your lawyer says under oath in a federal court that Mr. Trump told me to commit a crime. That can't make you comfortable. And in fact, if you look at Giuliani, Trump's legal representative who speaks to the media's statement on this. He said, well, Cohen didn't say that we committed a crime.</p><p>He just said and he's trying to, you know, deconstruct somehow that we were involved. So he's really parsing words, Giuliani, to keep the president, you know, sort of clean in this case, but it's really not going to be that way.</p><p>CHURCH: And if this is in -- if this isn't enough, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes, how will that likely impact President Trump? ZELDIN: So you think what a day within an hour of one another his personal lawyer and his campaign chairman each are found guilty of felonious conduct. That can't make you feel comfortable. Whether or not the Paul Manafort case involves the president will be determined on whether or not Manafort now having been convicted and facing another trial on almost identical charges in the District of Columbia will decide that it's time for him to cooperate with Robert Mueller.</p><p>And if he has something to say like for example, he, Manafort, can testify that the president knew about the June 9th meeting when the Russians came over to give dirt on Hillary Clinton then maybe he has a bargaining chip with Mueller that Mueller will accept in exchange for some sort of reduced sentence.</p><p>CHURCH: So two of the president's men in a lot of trouble here within hours of each other, where does all of this leave the U.S. presidency and of course what are the optics?</p><p>ZELDIN: Well, I think the optics are terrible. Where it leaves the presidency is that those who are supporters of the president I think aren't going to be discouraged. Nothing seems to have shaken their confidence in him and would be surprised if this does too. But what will be interesting is whether or not any of the House Republicans who are running for election find themselves needing now to distance themselves from this president, and if so, that could be a bit of a game changer for the president as he moves forward in his presidency.</p><p>CHURCH: Michael Zeldin, thank you so much for your analysis. Always appreciate it.</p><p>ZELDIN: Thank you very much.</p><p>CHURCH: And coming up, heart problems, breathing issues, even more deaths expected, so why is the Trump administration allowing more carbon emissions into the air? We'll take a look at that. And a week after a scathing grand jury report, a new case of abuse involving a Pennsylvania priest and a teenage girl.</p><p>[02:45:42] CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, the Trump administration will now let's state set their own carbon emission standards for coal fuel power plants.</p><p>Environmental and medical groups say rolling back important safeguards will be bad for the health of Americans. And even the agency backing the plan admits the extra pollution could lead to more premature deaths.</p><p>We're looking at the numbers here. It is estimated the increased emissions could lead to 36,000 additional deaths over the next decade. And 630 thousand cases of respiratory ailments in children. CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more now on some of the dangers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: When you're looking at this particulate matter, P.M. as they're called, there's nothing that you'd see. They're 130th the size for example of a human hair.</p><p>But, you take them into your system and for people who are especially at risk of heart and lung disease, this can be really problematic. It can cause premature death in those folks. It can cause non-fatal heart attacks, it can interfere with the normal conduction of one's heartbeat, increase asthma. All the things you see on the list.</p><p>Of most people, if I never seen a coal-fired power plant, you don't know what it looks like. But people see cars driving around all the time. If you looked at the Clean Power Act and the impact, by the year 2030, it would have been sort of like taking 160 million cars off the road.</p><p>Under these new regulations, again, they're still being defined but projections are maybe more like taking 8 million cars off the road.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, there. So, let's talk with Janet McCabe about this year's the former head of the EPA air office that devised the Clean Power Plan during the Obama administration. Good to have you with us.</p><p>JANET MCCABE, FORMER ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF AIR AND RADIATION, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CHURCH: So, the EPA's own estimate says this new rollback would result in 1,400 more premature deaths per year as of 2030. What do you make of this new rule?</p><p>MCCABE: Well, it's a -- it's a quite a change from the Clean Power Plan that was enacted in 2015. Those additional deaths that they themselves are identifying are the result of the particulate matter and other air pollutants that come along for the ride with the CO2 that's emitted by coal-fired power plants.</p><p>And this rule would require so much less reduction that we would have coal plants running more in this country. And as a result, emitting more of those traditional pollutants that are the ones that cause those more immediate health impacts.</p><p>CHURCH: And supporters of this rule, say it would help the middle class. Let's just listen to what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: The so-called Clean Power Plan they dreamed of would have had no meaningful effect on global emissions. It would, however, have packed up middle-class American jobs and sent them right overseas.</p><p>It would have piled a heavier burden onto the most vulnerable families, lower-income Americans, or hit the hardest when energy costs take off. And this plan was projected to yield double-digit percentage increases in electricity costs in 40 states, of course, including Kentucky.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: So, what's your reaction to what he was saying, mate?</p><p>MCCABE: Well, there just a lot of things in that statement that I disagree with as a matter of fact. One of the most striking ones, since he was talking about impacts on lower income people, is that the Clean Power Plan was actually projected to lower energy bills.</p><p>And there's a difference between energy prices and energy bills. What we found in 2015, was that one of the cheapest ways to reduce carbon dioxide which, of course, is what the Clean Power Plan was all about was reducing pollution is through energy efficiency.</p><p>And that is happening in the normal course of the development of technology. Every time you buy an electronic device, it is much more efficient than the one you had before. And that's continuing to be a very, very cost-effective way to reduce emissions.</p><p>So, as the system gets more efficient, people's bills go down. And we actually projected that by 2030, the average electricity bill would be about eight percent lower than it would be without the Clean Power Plan. So, that -- so we're just on the same page in terms of the impact on people.</p><p>[02:50:17] CHURCH: Right, of course, we know too that California has been at the forefront of setting environmental regulations and the state's Attorney General has said, he may sue the Trump administration over this. Is that the right way forward do you think?</p><p>MCCABE: Well, it's really unfortunate that our system has ended up with being so divided. We have 1/2 of the states who didn't like the Clean Power Plan and the other half did. And we will certainly have many people who are prepared to go to court over this very much dial back rule that challenge with this rule is that it will do almost nothing to reduce carbon.</p><p>Even though the administration admits that carbon pollution is a cause of climate change, they admit that fossil generation is contributing to that, and they admit that they have a responsibility under the Clean Air Act to do something about it. But this rule is a very minimal approach.</p><p>And so, we will have the battle joined again in the courts while the battle on the previous rule is still in play. And unfortunately, what that means is years of delay while CO2 continues to be emitted by power plants in the U.S.</p><p>CHURCH: And what's your general take on the direction, the Environmental Protection Agency has taken under the Trump administration with former head Scott Pruitt, unapologetic about wanting to deregulate the agency, and of course, his replacement being a former lobbyist for the coal industry?</p><p>MCCABE: Well, I think the message has been clear from the very beginning of the administration. This is a deregulatory administration in the last two weeks, we've seen the proposed rule to freeze the corporate average fuel economy standards. So, to put the brakes on our push forward to have cars be more and more fuel efficient. And now, this rollback of the Clean Power Plan.</p><p>So, I think that the message from the administration is perfectly clear if we didn't already know it.</p><p>CHURCH: Janet McCabe, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCCABE: You bet, it's a pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: Well, now to an example of how plastic in our oceans is threatening marine life. A shark in Eastern Australia narrowly escaped a sad fate when two brave divers intervened what was originally a training lesson turned into a rescue mission.</p><p>When divers noticed a grey nurse shark had plastic netting stuck between its large jaws. They tried to remove it by tugging on the plastic line hanging from the shark's mouth. And they were able to successfully free it.</p><p>The shark escaped the slow and painful death from discarded plastic. A faith that has become all too common. Plastic trash in the ocean is killing millions of animals every year. It is tragic.</p><p>Well, just before the Pope's trip to Ireland, the Vatican makes an unusual announcement ahead of the close watch on how he addresses sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Were back in just a moment.</p><p>[02:54:53] CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. A Catholic priest in Pennsylvania faces charges of indecent assault and corruption of a minor. Officials say, Father Kevin Lonergan, sent sexual messages and nude images to a 17-year-old girl on social media. He is accused of hugging the girl while aroused and grabbing her while she tried to pull away.</p><p>The diocese, says it cooperated with the district attorney and immediately removed Lonergan from his assignment. Priests in Pennsylvania are under scrutiny after last week's grand jury report that said more than 300 priests had sexually abused more than a thousand children for decades.</p><p>Well, in just a few days, Pope Francis is to visit Ireland and he will meet with victims of clerical sex abuse. The Pope is under increasing pressure to do something about decades of abuse and cover-ups and victims are demanding more than just words. Barbie Nadeau has the details now from Rome.</p><p>BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: The Vatican announced on Tuesday that Pope Francis will be meeting with victims of clerical sex abuse when he travels to Ireland this coming weekend.</p><p>It's not unusual for the Pope to meet with victims of clerical sex abuse but it is unusual that the Vatican would make this announcement ahead of time. Instead, the Pope usually holds these meetings behind closed doors and the victims announced that they met with the Pope.</p><p>The Vatican did say that it would not be commenting on what was said between the Pope and those victims. The church in Ireland, of course, has its own history of scandal with clerical sex abuse and widespread abuse in 2009. A scathing report pointed to the fact that over 30,000 children had been abused over the course of many decades in Ireland by Catholic Church officials.</p><p>This announcement comes on the heels of the Pennsylvania grand jury report outlining over 70 years of clerical sex abuse carried out by more than 300 priests on over 1,000 children. The Vatican responded to those allegations with a statement calling them criminal and calling for greater accountability.</p><p>Then, Pope Francis, this week followed that up with a letter to the people of God in which he apologized for the sins of the church, and called on church leaders to avoid creating a community where it would be easy to hide such abuse.</p><p>The victims of clerical sex abuse want more than words. They have called on Pope Francis to ask for resignations from complicit bishops and Cardinals and they would like to see any of the secret documents about clerical sex abuse held in churches around the world be released to secular authorities. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.</p><p>CHURCH: And thank you so much for your company this hour. I'm Rosemary Church. I'll be back with another hour of world news in just a moment. Hope you can join us. You're watching CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Among the highest conviction backers are Citywire AA-rated Nick Train and his AAA-rated colleague Michael Lindsell.</p><p>Train holds 6.2% of his<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Lindsell Train</emphasis> (LTI ) investment trust in Nintendo, while Lindsell has an 8.8% position in his Lindsell Train Japanese Equity  fund. The company also makes up 4.9% of the Lindsell Train Global Equity \u00a0fund, managed by both.</p><p>Rathbone Global Opportunities  manager James Thomson meanwhile holds both Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard, with the latter also a feature of the Smith &amp; Williamson Artificial Intelligence  fund.</p><p>Neele also highlighted the computer games sector's opportunities to deliver additional revenues beyond the initial purchase of a game.</p><p>'There are many more ways to monetise games, from advertising to selling virtual items,' he said.</p><p>For example, in Fortnite (pictured), a free-to-download game developed by Epic Games, users can buy \u2018V-Bucks\u2019, which can be used change the visual appearance of their character or get a \u2018battle pass\u2019 to fast-track their performance.</p><p>\u2018Because these are virtual there\u2019s a 100% profit margin for the game manufacturer,\u2019 said Neele.</p><h>Shift to digital</h><p>Neele (pictured) aims to capitalise on the drivers of spending among the world\u2019s 7.6 billion consumers. The shift to digital accounts for 35-40% of the fund (34% at present) and is one of three lasting consumer trends that the fund invests in.</p><p>Some of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies are among its 55 holdings. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon (AMZN.O)</emphasis>, Google owner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOGL.O)</emphasis> ad <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix (NLFX.O)</emphasis> all feature, although <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook (FB.O)</emphasis> is notably absent, having been sold by Neele and fellow Citywire AA-rated manager Richard Speetjens earlier this year.</p><p>That proved an opportune move for the pair: shares in the social media giant slumped 19% on 26 July after it revealed slowing user growth as privacy regulations led to a surprise drop in European users.</p><p>The share price plunge wiped $120 billion (\u00a394.4 billion) from the value of the company in the largest one-day hit in corporate history and reverberated around Silicon Valley, sparking a slump across the tech sector.</p><p>Neele still regards large technology stocks as\u00a0\u2018structural winners\u2019. \u2018We still like the majority of the big tech platforms; their growth record is unprecedented,\u2019 he said.</p><p>Social media is an area that Neele is cautious about given regulatory headwinds, but otherwise he is upbeat about sectors like e-commerce amid a \u2018retail apocalypse\u2019 on the high street and new growth areas for the big platforms like cloud computing, virtual reality and artificial intelligence.</p><p>\u2018The shift to digital is secular in nature \u2013 it\u2019s happening independent of the economic cycle. If the economy slows down a little bit, consumers aren\u2019t going to go back to shopping on the high street,\u2019 he said.</p><p>\u2018We own a lot of e-commerce retailers and those with scale. We own a lot of the streaming businesses that are so popular with millennials \u2013 there are no more video stores and very few music shops; it\u2019s all become digital.\u2019</p><p>Digital music is reinventing an industry that had been in decline. Global recorded music revenues grew for the third consecutive year in 2017 to reach $17.4 billion, up 8% on $16 billion in 2016, according to MIDiA Research.</p><p>Streaming revenues drove that growth, rising 39% to $7.4 billion, or 43% of all revenues \u2013 offsetting declines from legacy formats, like downloads and physical albums.</p><h>Buying brands</h><p>The growth in the middle classes in emerging markets like India and China and consumer loyalty towards strong brands are the fund\u2019s other big themes.</p><p>The appeal of brands gives the fund a bit of ballast, given the riskier nature of technology and emerging markets stocks. This typically commands around a third of assets, and currently stands at 39% of the fund.</p><p>\u2018Consumers tend to pursue healthier lifestyles these days and are buying sportswear and making better food choices,\u2019 said Neele.</p><p>\u2018Producers of organic and natural foods are doing very well in that respect, as are companies like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nike (NKE.N)</emphasis> and Adidas <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(ADSGn.DE)</emphasis>. We like the branded sports goods retailers which have this omni-channel combination of selling through department stores, their own retail outlets and their own online shops.\u2019</p><p>The emerging market consumer commands the smallest allocation, at 24% of the fund, given that it is the most cyclical of the trends the fund invests in.</p><p>Neele accesses this theme directly in companies listed in emerging markets and indirectly through western companies that have a lot of exposure to emerging markets.</p><p>Direct holdings include companies like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kweichow Moutai Co (600519.SS)</emphasis>, maker of the Chinese grain alcohol baijiu, which is experiencing blistering demand, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Avenue Supermarts (AVEU.NS)</emphasis>, which operates DMart, India\u2019s leading grocer. Its shares rose 11% in July after it reported first quarter revenue growth of 27% and profits growth of 43%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYWR-a1148676</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYWR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4M-5651-JD2S-23FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277874</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><timeReceived>12:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Citywire Financial Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Citywire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 22, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002MCM</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC ARTS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002KBZ</classCode><className>NINTENDO CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002PYP</classCode><className>ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>EA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>7974 (TSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ATVI (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>AIY (FRA)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N525910GG</classCode><className>MUTUAL FUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

The world is changing at a record pace, innovation has become a leading value in itself and is no longer considered an 'added feature.' \"Anyone who is not innovative and proactive will find himself irrelevant in the very near future,\" he said.</p><p>Traditional banking, Topaz explained, is divided into two approaches - the Asian banking model, where the consumer is the center of the business, with the understanding that the customer's need is the purchase of a product or service and the financial component is the infrastructure for making the purchase. The client may be exposed to an app like Ali Baba which provides his needs and services in one place without switching between different websites and platforms, so that the transfer of money does not require further action on the part of the customer.</p><p>The second approach - the Western approach - is that the bank is a body with stability in the public consciousness and will remain so in the coming years, with changes in the way it operates. Topaz notes that all banks are heading towards collaborations with third parties. \"We see collaborations with different Fintech organizations or platforms that bring value to the customer and, of course to the partners,\" Topaz said.</p><p>Topaz provided a number of examples of third-party bank collaborations with an outside party that provide an innovative technology experience and significant value to the customer. One example is BBVA Valora, which provides tools to a customer who wants to buy an apartment. The service allows the customer to look for apartments that match predefined data, examines the data about the community, education in the area, and even examines the client's financial ability to purchase the property.</p><p>As for Israel, Topaz declares, \"Any area in which we see successful and profitable collaboration is due to the efforts of the regulator. In Israel, the situation is different and the traditional banking system has not yet made changes that will allow its customers to enjoy services that are offered elsewhere in the world.\"</p><p>What needs to be done so that we Israelis can enjoy the technological advancements in banking services? Topaz says that the banking system needs to be more innovative and flexible. In the past, the main banking competition came from the five largest banking groups in Israel. Today, the picture is completely different. Banks today face Big Tech giants like Google, which is already a significant threat to traditional banking.</p><p>Summarizing the future of banking, Topaz says it will become technological and custom-made: \"The world is taking huge steps towards a contextual value proposition, such that it depends on the time when it best suits the client and where he needs to receive the offer from the bank.\"</p><p>Topaz cited the example of a person who goes to purchase a car. Upon entering the dealership, he is identified by face recognition software which incorporates his information with various databases to identify his loan eligibility. While he is speaking with the salesman about the car he wants to purchase, his loan application will already be approved without the need to speak to the bank's representative. At the conclusion of the purchase, the customer will leave with an approved loan with a minimum amount of effort, and with maximum value.</p><p>Added Topaz, \"I believe that in the near future we will see Israeli banks collaborate with large entities and together they will offer the customer services as is customary today in the world. In order for this to happen, legislators and bank regulators will need to create a suitable legal environment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Bank of Jerusalem CEO Gil Topaz addresses the Maariv Business Conference.

Tech of the Town    SCOOP: INCOMING MANCHIN BILL TARGETS CRIMES ONLINE, SECTION 230 \u2014 Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is set to unveil a long-awaited bill as early as next week aimed at curtailing major crimes online \u2014 such as the sale of illegal drugs \u2014 by amending the internet industry\u2019s legal liability protections. The so-called \u201cSee Something, Say Something Online Act,\u201d would require companies shielded under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to report to the Justice Department suspicious activity by users that could be linked to major crimes, or lose their immunity over third-party content, according to a new dispatch by Cristiano .   \u2014 A bid for bipartisan Section 230 reform: It\u2019s the latest proposal in Washington to set its sights on the legal shield. \u201cAs the Internet rapidly changed, we failed to keep up. Now we must amend Section 230 to reflect the way the Internet impacts our lives today \u2013 both good and bad,\u201d Manchin told POLITICO. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am planning to introduce bipartisan legislation that would require companies to say something when they see something illegal online.\u201d   \u2014 A concept years in the making: Manchin first raised the specter of tweaking Section 230 to hold social media platforms more accountable for the sale of opioid drugs online at a 2018 hearing . Manchin told MT last September he had a bill \u201cprepared and ready to go\u201d and would release it if he felt online platforms hadn\u2019t done enough to curtail drug sales. The proposal also raises the prospect that if companies \u201cfail to exercise due care\u201d in reporting criminal activity, \u201cCongress intends to look at removing liability protections under the Communications Decency Act of 1996 in its entirety.\u201d    HOW FACEBOOK SHIFTED ON POLITICAL ADS  \u2014 For nearly a year, Facebook stuck steadfastly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s position that it should not police political ads. Then, that suddenly changed. \u201cThis month has been an about-face: First, Facebook announced that it is banning new political ads in the week before Election Day to prevent last-minute attempts to deceive voters. Then this week the company took it further, saying it will reject ads that claim victory prematurely as worries rise that President Donald Trump might do just that,\u201d Nancy reports.   \u2014 But the move wasn\u2019t as sudden as it seemed. \u201cThose involved in the discussions over political ads say Facebook officials spent nearly a year wavering between its founder\u2019s declarations on free expression and a desire to avoid becoming a presidential-election villain yet again.\u201d Read more about how Facebook came to change its mind.   TIKTOK\u2019S LEGAL TICK TOCK \u2014 The Trump administration must decide today whether to delay its order banning TikTok from U.S. app stores or defend the move before a federal judge this weekend. In a hearing Thursday , District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, gave the government until 2:30 p.m. to choose. If the administration opts not to delay, Nichols said he plans to rule on TikTok\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction before the app gets booted from U.S. app stores at 11:59 p.m. Sunday.   \u2014 Postponing the ban would mark yet another blow to President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to hobble Chinese tech companies. It also comes as a deal allowing TikTok to continue to operate in the U.S., which seemed settled over the weekend, remains up in the air.   MEET THE UNOFFICIAL \u2018REAL FACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD\u2019 \u2014 A group of civil rights leaders, academics and big tech critics today are launching what they\u2019re calling the \u201cReal Facebook Oversight Board\u201d \u2014 an independent, unsanctioned alternative to the Facebook-approved organization, which will soon launch and be able to overturn the social network\u2019s content decisions. The group said in a statement that it plans to \u201csound the warning about Facebook\u2019s role in the upcoming election and challenge Facebook\u2019s failure to launch its own Oversight Board.\u201d The announcement comes a day after Facebook\u2019s actual oversight board confirmed plans to launch ahead of Election Day .   \u2014 Introducing the \u201creal\u201d board: The unofficial cast includes leaders of the #StopHateForProfit movement, which has organized boycotts of Facebook and its subsidiaries, among others, such as: the heads of the NAACP, Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, as well as Yael Eisenstat, former head of elections integrity ops for political advertising for Facebook; and Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor-turned-prominent-critic.   \u2014 Facebook\u2019s board won\u2019t provide sufficient oversight, they say. \u201cFacebook\u2019s Oversight Board is a distraction, not a real solution,\u201d McNamee said in a statement. \u201cNo amount of spin can hide the damage Facebook does every day to public health and democracy through amplification of hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories.\u201d   WICKER EYES TRUMP\u2019S NEW FCC PICK  \u2014 Senate Commerce Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) is planning on moving forward with Trump\u2019s recent nomination of Nathan Simington, a Commerce Department staffer that Trump chose to take over the seat of GOP veteran Mike O\u2019Rielly, a senior Commerce Committee aide told John.   \u2014 Wicker met with Simington Wednesday evening in a meeting that  the senior aide called highly detailed. The nominee was scheduled to meet with Senate Commerce\u2019s policy and legal teams on Thursday evening, and Wicker is urging all panel Republicans to meet with Simington, the aide added. No word yet on a possible confirmation hearing or vote.   \u2014 Many observers question whether Congress will have enough time to process Simington\u2019s nomination before the end of the year. Controversy lurks given the abrupt way Trump yanked O\u2019Rielly\u2019s nomination this summer following his pushback about regulating social media companies. Simingon worked in a supporting role on the Commerce Department\u2019s summer petition seeking an FCC crackdown on online liability protections, a National Telecommunications and Information Administration spokesman told John.    TECH QUOTE DU JOUR \u2014 \u201cAt Facebook I believe we sought to mine as much human attention as possible and turn it into historically unprecedented profits. To do this, we didn\u2019t simply create something useful and fun. We took a page from Big Tobacco\u2019s playbook, working to make our offering addictive at the outset,\u201d Tim Kendall, Facebook\u2019s first and former director of monetization who appeared in the hit Netflix documentary \u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d testified Thursday at a House Energy &amp; Commerce hearing on extremism on social media.   SCHAKOWSKY SOCIAL MEDIA BILL INBOUND \u2014 Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), chair of the House E&amp;C consumer protection subcommittee, teased plans Thursday to circulate a draft bill next week that will \u201cfundamentally alter [social media] companies' business models and give consumers and regulators the recourse when these compes fail in their \u2026 stated basic commitments to consumers.\u201d Schakowsky, whose panel has jurisdiction over a range of key tech issues, did not elaborate on the scope of the bill. But for months she has signaled plans for legislation targeting the internet industry\u2019s legal liability shield , Section 230.   STOP THE POLITICAL ADS, AMERICAN VOTERS SAY \u2014 More than half of U.S. adults believe social media platforms should make a blanket decision to stop running political ads, according to new data from the Pew Research Center. An even greater portion \u2014 almost 80 percent \u2014 feel that these tech firms should not be using users\u2019 data (from what people do online) to target the political ads they see. Republicans and right-leaning Americans are generally more in favor of allowing political ads on these sites than are Democrats and left-leaning Americans. Facebook announced recently it would refrain from running any new political ads in the week before Election Day; Twitter almost a year ago decided to wipe political ads from its platform altogether.   LEGISLATION ON THE MOVE \u2014 The Senate agreed Thursday to extend the SAFE WEB Act, which originally passed in 2006, for another seven years. The House passed its version of the SAFE WEB Extension Act, H.R. 4779 (116), in December, so the bill now heads to Trump\u2019s desk. That law gives the FTC greater power to fight online fraud and deception across borders.          Transitions    Spotify , Epic Games , Match Group and Tile are among the members of the new Coalition for App Fairness , a group that launched Thursday \u201cto preserve consumer choice and a level playing field for app and game developers that rely on app stores and the most popular gatekeeper platforms.\u201d    Silicon Valley Must Reads    POLITICO scoop: \u201c The Senate Commerce Committee will vote next week on Republicans' attempt to subpoena the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter, a committee aide told POLITICO.\u201d John has the details for Pros.   The Great Twitter Hack: Wired examines how Twitter survived a cyber attack that targeted some of its most-followed users, and how it is planning to stop something similar from happening on Election Day and beyond.

Amazon and Apple were among those who sat it out, per the tracker.   Tech group blasts EO : The Information Technology Industry Council criticized Trump\u2019s recent executive order that prohibits government contractors from offering certain workplace training related to race and gender. CEO Jason Oxman called the order an \u201caffront to our industry\u2019s core values, an attack on free enterprise and, most importantly, an unacceptable step backward for racial equity.\u201d ITI\u2019s members include Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and others with federal contracts.

I'm Bret Baier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The suspect was caught just a few hours ago near Bakersfield, California  after being on the run for two days.  Investigators believe he is  responsible for the murder of Newman police officer Ronil Singh who  migrated to the U.S. legally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an emotional press conference late this afternoon, the Stanislaus county  sheriff said Singh's death could have been prevented.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this happening as we head into a long weekend with a stalemate in the  fight over border security.</p><p>We have Fox team coverage tonight.

Good evening --  William.  </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well Bret -- just  hours ago, police confirmed the arrest of 32-year-old Gustavo Perez  Arriaga, an illegal immigrant confirmed gang member and two-time convicted  drunk driver with outstanding warrants.</p><p>The California sheriff also confirming the arrest of two other illegal  immigrants -- a brother and co-worker who tried to cover up the whereabouts  of Arriaga as he allegedly tried to flee to Mexico.</p><p>But under aerial surveillance the Kern County attack team intercepted  Arriaga near Bakersfield where he surrendered without incident.</p><p>Arriaga is a Mexican national who entered the U.S. illegally in Arizona,  wanted for killing 33-year-old Ron Singh, a seven-year Newman Police  veteran who emigrated to the U.S. legally from Fiji.</p><p>Singh was married with a 5-month-old son.  He took this photo Christmas  Day, just hours before he and his K-9 partner stopped a possible drunk  driver.  Moments later Singh he radioed, \"shots fired.  I'm hit.\"  He died  a short time later.</p><p>Today his brother Reggie thanked police for finding the alleged killer.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGGIE SINGH, BROTHER OF OFFICER RONIL SINGH:  He's not coming back, but --  there is a lot of people out there that miss him and a lot of law  enforcement people that I don't know who work days and nights to make this  happen.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Today in a news conference, the sheriff of Stanislaus County  threw gasoline on the already red-hot immigration debate by calling Singh's  death preventable, blaming the state sanctuary law for prohibiting police  from communicating with ICE about known and wanted felons.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  Let's go back to  Ron -- an immigrant immigrated here lawfully and illegally to pursue his  American dream.  He achieved that goal.

Good evening -- Ellison.</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>That's right.  A shutdown threat in the middle of the shutdown.  President  Trump saying without funding for a border wall, he might decide to close  the southern border entirely.</p><p>\"The United States loses so much money on trade with Mexico under NAFTA,\"  the President tweeted, \"that I would consider closing the southern border,  a profit making operation.  We build a wall or close the southern border.\"</p><p>Shutting down the southern border would cost us a billion dollars a day.   Is the President seriously willing to do that?  </p><p>MICK MULVANEY, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET DIRECTOR:  Yes he absolutely  is.  </p><p>BARBER:  But it's unclear if the President could legally closet the entire  southern border and if he did there would surely be legal challenges just  like with saw happen to so-called travel bans.  The President's budget  director and soon to be acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says it is not  an empty threat.  </p><p>MULVANEY:  All options are on the table.  Listen, it's the only way we can  get the Democrats' attention.  </p><p>BARBER:  According to the White House they offered Democrats a deal that is  less than President Trump's previous ask of $5 billion for border security  and a wall, but they say Democrats just walked away.  </p><p>MULVANEY:  That steel barrier that the President tweeted out, that's what  he wants to build.  The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a  wall, they offered us $1.3 billion to do that.  We countered with $5  billion.  They did not even counter us.  </p><p>BARBER:  More than anyone, administration officials blame House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>MULVANEY:  Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats probably would cut a deal  but they are protecting Mrs. Pelosi.  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  She is unwilling to  actually do anything until she gets her speakership.  She's more willing to  protect that than she is to protect our borders and protect American lives.  </p><p>BARBER:  President Trump, who once said this -- </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get what we  want, I will shut down the government.  </p><p>BARBER:  Putting some blame on the Ninth Circuit, tweeting \"The reason the  DACA for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision  from the Ninth Circuit allowed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to  remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case.  After ruling Dems dropped  deal and that's where we are today.  Democrat obstruction of the needed  wall.</p><p>Yesterday a spokesperson for Pelosi said Democrats offered Republicans  three options to reopen the government and that all three included funding  for border security, but not the President's wall, which they described as  immoral, ineffective and expensive.</p><p>Meanwhile Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen traveled to the  southern border.  She said she wanted to see firsthand medical screenings  and conditions at border patrol stations after an 8-year-old died in the  custody of border patrol agents earlier this week.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBER:  A preliminary autopsy conducted by officials in New Mexico  indicates that that young boy died of the flu.  He is the second child to  die this month while in the custody of border patrol -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Ellison -- thank you.</p><p>As we head into the new year there are no signs of movement towards a deal  on funding a border wall.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy has that part of the story for us from Capitol  Hill.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  As the government's partial drags on  along the Potomac, papers are piling up outside Mitch McConnell's office  and Nancy Pelosi is on an island in the Pacific spotted five time zones  away from the House in Hawaii shortly after she apparently left the White  House hanging as it pitched the spending they request for border wall  money.  </p><p>REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK:  House Democrats are in a bit of a bind.  I  don't think Nancy Pelosi wants to put any offer on the table until after  she's elected speaker.  And so that's holding her back.</p><p>DOOCY:  Part of Pelosi's leadership team is forecasting what she might  want.  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries tweeted today \"Day seven of the Trump  shut down.  Republicans continue to hold the American people hostage.  We  refuse to pay a $5 billion ransom note.  In other words, take a hike.\"</p><p>That $5 billion in border wall funding is stuck in the Senate where White  House ally Senator Lindsey Graham wrote today, \"To Nancy Pelosi and the  House Democrats -- no wall money, no deal.\"</p><p>So now, lawmakers are stuck or are they?</p><p>Senate leaders abandoned attempts to move the border wall bill because it  was so far short of the 60 votes needed to pass.  So some House lawmakers  are urging upper chamber colleagues to change the rules.  </p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R), TEXAS:  This is an emergency.  This is our  southern border.  This is the defense of our nation, the 60-vote rule, the  filibuster rule in the Senate should be suspended to allow this  appropriations bill to go forward.  </p><p>DOOCY:  But Democrats insist this dustup over dollars for the wall is just  a diversion.  </p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), RHODE ISLAND:  He wants a fight about this  because he wants to distract from the other very bad things that have  happened in the last two weeks.  </p><p>DOOCY:  Republican supporters of the wall in the House are starting to  think bigger like a trade -- funds for construction, in exchange for a fix  to help DACA recipients illegally brought to this country as young  children.</p><p>KING:  I think the Democrats should come back with their own offer now.  I  think there is room for negotiation and the President is willing to come  down on the dollar amount.  The Democrats should go along with the wall and  if the DACA is on the table, then let's do that.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY:  There are no signs this partial shutdown will end during Paul  Ryan's final days as House Speaker.  And even though his name is still on  the door outside the speaker's office, we've watched just in the last few  minutes as staffers have started to wheel in desks and computers, because  by the time that many members get back, Nancy Pelosi's name will most  likely be on the door outside -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Peter Doocy, live on a lonely Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p>North Carolina's elections board dissolved today under court order without  certifying a winner in the states ninth congressional district race.  The  state elections board has refused to certify the race between Republican  Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready while it investigates absentee ballot  irregularities.</p><p>Harris holds a slim lead in unofficial results but officials are looking  into fraud allegations against an operative hired by the Harris campaign.</p><p>A mixed day on Wall Street today, the Dow was off 76.  The S&amp;P 500 slipped  three, the Nasdaq was up five.  For the week, the Dow was up 2.75 percent.   The S&amp;P 500 was up nearly three.  The Nasdaq finished ahead of nearly 4  percent.</p><p>Wells Fargo will pay more than half a billion dollars to settle an  investigation into a string of suspicious business practices.  The bank has  been under a cloud since 2015, when it acknowledged that employees had  opened millions of fake bank accounts for customers in order to meet sales  goals.  It has also said that it sold auto insurance and other financial  products to customers who didn't need them.  Wells Fargo has already been  ordered to pay more than $1 billion in penalties and face stricter  regulations.</p><p>A troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.  It may  have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.</p><p>And as Lucas Tomlinson reports from the Pentagon, the Trump  administration's new plan has support from a former senior Obama  administration official.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS PENTAGON PRODUCER:  Syrian forces moved to the  outskirts of a Kurdish held city captured from ISIS putting hundreds of  American troops in potential danger.  But Syrian President Bashar al  Assad's forces closed-in ten days after President Trump ordered the full  withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.</p><p>But the Kurds say they welcome the Syrian troops in Manbij as protection  against a potential Turkish invasion after their U.S. allies leave.   Turkey's president says he wants the Kurdish fighters out of the city  immediately.</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator):  Our entire  aim is to make terror organizations leave the area.  If terror  organizations leave then there is no work left for us anyway.  Our  communications and relationships with both the United States, with  President Trump whom I spoke to recently and Russia continuous healthily  (ph).  </p><p>TOMLINSON:  President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria  following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month.  The  former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports  President Trump's decision to pull out.  \"Holding northeastern Syria would  not have enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from  Damascus, Tehran, or Moscow.  Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and  stabilization teams can reverse that.  We would do well to be humbler about  our abilities especially in the face of sustained widespread regional  hostility.\"</p><p>Seven years after the start of Syria's civil war, President Assad no longer  feels isolated.  Gulf states long opposed to his rule are coming back to  Damascus.  Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in Syria one  day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOMLINSON:  U.S. officials tell me there is no immediate plan to withdraw  any American troops from Manbij, Syria.  The complete withdrawal from the  country could take months -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon.  Lucas -- thank you.</p><p>2018 will end with another deadly protest along the Israeli border, and it  looks like those demonstrations will go into the new year.  </p><p>Correspondent Trey Yingst has our report.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Tear gas was deployed and sniper fire  rang out as Israeli forces fought to push back Palestinian protesters along  the Israel-Gaza border.  The demonstrators gathering for the 40th Friday in  a row to voice opposition to the Israeli blockade on the Gaza strip.</p><p>After four Palestinians were killed last Friday, Hamas, the group in  control of the Gaza Strip threatened to fire rockets and use sniper fire if  anyone was killed today.</p><p>According to the Palestinian health ministry, one person was killed, shot  in the head; and at least eight injured by live ammunition.  </p><p>YINGST:  Organizers of the protests say the fact that thousands showed up  despite the wind and rain is an indication of the persistence and  resilience that these demonstrators have.  And they will continue to push  forward until the Israeli blockade on Gaza is lifted.</p><p>With major grievances still taking place in Gaza regarding employment,  electricity and infrastructure the Friday gatherings are expected to  continue.  The demonstrations come as Egyptian negotiators are trying to  develop a long-term deal between Israel and Hamas that would avoid future  escalations.</p><p>Last month, a failed Israeli Special Forces operation inside Gaza led to an  exchange of rocket fire and air strikes between the two sides.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YINGST:  A senior Hamas official told Fox News the deadly outcome of  today's border demonstrations will certainly factor into the group's  response -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Trey -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, how longer lives and having less children are leading to a rise in  populism.  We'll explain.</p><p>First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 13 in Seattle where a nationwide network outage caused the disruption  to 911 calls in western Washington.  The outages began Thursday from New  York to California.  The company behind the outages says the problem  involved a network element but would not elaborate.</p><p>Fox 7 in Austin where the nation's oldest living veteran with died  Thursday.  Richard Overton was born in 1906, served three years in the army  during World War II.  He credited his faith and cigars and whiskey for his  longevity.  Overton was 112 years old.</p><p>And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate, Fox 5.  The big  story there tonight, a transformer explosion that turned the night sky over  New York City an electric blue last night.  Kind of freaky, it looked like  an alien invasion.  An incredible sight according to the mayor's office  tweeting out that it was not aliens in fact but electrical surge at a  Queens substation.  The blue light eventually faded and at last check no  one was seen being taken away by a spaceship.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  A powerful winter storm continued to wreak havoc across the U.S.  today.  Blizzard conditions across the upper Midwest are being blamed for  at least three deadly car crashes while flash flooding in the south swept  away cars and forced dozens of water rescues.  The risk of flooding will  persist in parts of the south into next week, we are told.</p><p>A change in the makeup of American families is giving way to a rise in  populism, a trend that correspondent Doug McKelway shows us is working its  way across Europe.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP:  America first.  </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The discontent behind the populism  that helped elect Donald Trump is at work across the world.  Europe's  creeping social welfare state marked by a protected status for older works,  early retirement, and an expansive social safety net has proved no match  for the demographic realities of low fertility rates.  </p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION:  Western societies that produce a  plethora of goods and services, and have excellent health care, that's a  Western tradition, then people live longer and life is better.  So they  want to enjoy it and unfortunately that means they don't want to put up  with child raising.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  The lowest fertility rate may be Greece -- 1.35 births per women  and not enough young people to pay for the elderly's benefits.  Europe,  Japan, and the U.S. seem unwilling to remedy it.  </p><p>HANSON:  That would require I think not a lot of sacrifice but enough  sacrifice that an affluent and (INAUDIBLE) society would find probably I  guess intolerable or politically impossible.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Like the U.S., Europe has compensated for the birth dearth by  importing labor, a manageable solution to a point.  </p><p>MONICA DUFFY TOFT, INTERNATIONAL POLITICS PROFESSOR:  By the second or  third generation, these populations -- these non-native populations  acculturate or they sort of become part of the mainstream communities.  But  it takes a generation or two.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Europe is a combination of refugees fleeing ISIS and the civil  war in Syria has proved a bridge too far.  </p><p>PHILIP COHEN, FAMILY SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR:  Immigration poses challenges to  the dominant culture.  It's obviously politically fraught.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  From Greece, to Italy, Germany, France and the Nordic countries,  clashes have erupted.  Nationalist politicians are forcing a reckoning with  multiculturalism.  That while the Yellow Jacket rioting in France proves  there is a limit to how much citizens are willing to be taxed.  </p><p>On the other side of the globe, Japan is facing its own declining fertility  rate that has been traditionally resistant to immigrant labor.  One  potential solution there, robots may help to man factories, to care for the  elderly.  And in China, a demographic problem of its own making a  generation ago overpopulation compelled the communist government to force a  one-child policy on the populace.  </p><p>COHEN:  They included forced sterilization, abortion and very harsh  penalties for people who had extra children.  So it was really a human  rights disaster.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  And because male babies were favored today China faces a surplus  of 34 million single men.  Their widely distorted majority accompanies an  increase in crime, loneliness and prostitution among other societal ills  according to the \"Washington Post\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Ironically today, because of China's massive transformation into  an industrial powerhouse, it has become like the West, more affluent, a  place where a new generation of parents is less interested in reproducing - - Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Doug -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, a closer look at one court and whether some judges are upholding  the law or their own political beliefs.  We will take a look.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>The leaders of Germany and France are pressuring and pressing Russia to  release Ukrainian sailors captured more than a month ago in time for the  new year.</p><p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emanuel Macron made  the joint statement today while also vowing to keep up pressure for a peace  deal for Eastern Ukraine.  The Russian coast guard seized three Ukrainian  naval vessels and their crew back in November.</p><p>Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza  Pyramids killing at least three people and wounding ten others today.

Both sides of the aisle have their sights  set on the big three social media companies -- Facebook, Twitter and  Google-owned YouTube.  </p><p>REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans.   They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.  </p><p>SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA:  We have to put some rules of the  road in place.  They can't just say, if you trust us, we got your back.  </p><p>TURNER:  But not everyone wants the same thing.  Democrats want social  media companies to get rid of fake news after than they did in 2016 to  avoid foreign election interference.  Republicans want to hold the big  three accountable for anti-conservative bias.  One thing they can agree on,  both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign  season kicks off.</p><p>Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about, data  encryption.  Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like  Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake.  They are taking  cues from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.  He's been keeping this  issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refused to  decrypt their data for investigators.</p><p>\"Companies are in the business of generating profits.  I don't blame them  for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns.  But  it's important to understand that what is good for a technology company  isn't necessarily good for America.\"</p><p>Democrats are focused on protecting Americans' privacy.  They worry if  investigators can access any encrypted data they want it will lead to  abuses in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER:  2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users.

This January, Hawaii joins nearly two dozen states in fining folks who lie  about their pet.  At least 21 states have passed laws governing service  animals in an attempt to keep unruly pets out of grocery stores, movie  theaters and restaurants.</p><p>If a man asks a woman out on a date, and he is taller than she is, can that  be considered sexual harassment?  According to a former University of  Missouri vice chancellor, the answer is yes.  School officials suspended a  student for four years because they say his size and gender gave him power  over a female he pursued romantically.  That former student is now suing  the school for racial and sexual discrimination.  </p><p>Judges are supposed to remain impartial, but when they are appointed by a  president, is that possible?  Correspondent Dan Springer with a look  tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When U.S. District Court Judge Jon  Tigar blocked the Trump administration plan to bar asylum to any immigrant  not entering at the designated border crossing, President Trump railed  against who he called the Obama judge, which drew this response from  Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  \"We do not have Obama judges or  Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.  What we have is an  extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best.\"  Trump  tweeted back, \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but we do have Obama  judges, and they have a much different point of view than people who are  charged with the safety of our country.\" Court watchers say essentially  both men are right.  </p><p>JOEL ARD, FEDERALIST SOCIETY:  Presidents certainly hope that the judges  they nominate share their views and hold those views long after the  president is out of office, and I think the chief justice is correct that  the judges are independent, they are not beholden to the president who  nominates them.  </p><p>SPRINGER:  President Trump also bashed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  for not even hearing his appeal on the asylum ruling.  It has been a  frequent attack during a string of losses on immigration cases, from the  travel ban to sanctuary cities.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You go to the Ninth Circuit  and it's a disgrace.  And I'm going to put in a major complaint.  </p><p>SPRINGER:  Of the 41 sitting judges on the Ninth Circuit, 25 were nominated  by Democratic presidents, 16 by Republicans.  President Clinton picked the  most with 14 followed by Obama, George W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter.  Trump  now has two of the 23 active judges, but has nominated five more to current  vacancies.  </p><p>RORY LITTLE, LAW PROFESSOR:  It is soon going to be a Trump court.  It's  soon going to be not a majority of these 29 judges, but they're going to  have a substantial chunk.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPRINGER:  Because Republicans control the Senate and only a simple  majority is needed to confirm federal judges, President Trump will reshape  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Whether future rulings are to his  liking depends on the questions at the heart of the Trump-Roberts debate,  exactly who gets confirmed, and how independent will they be?  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Dan, thank you.  </p><p>When we come back, the battle over the border wall is heading into the new  year.  First, we are sad to report the death of a FOX News regular, Bre  Payton.  A staff writer at \"The Federalist,\" frequent guest on our air,  died this morning after a friend says she was admitted to the hospital with  swine flu and possible meningitis.  Our condolences to her family.  Bre  Payton was only 26 years old.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We're still building the  barrier.  That's why the government is closed, is the president is not  willing to give up on the southern barrier.  But it makes sense to sit down  across the table when you're trying to negotiate with another party and see  if there is someplace in the middle between their five and our 1.3.  </p><p>REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement where a majority say yes.  And I think we had that until  the president went off his meds and who the hell knows what happened.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The negotiations are still continuing, and there doesn't seem to be  any back and forth happening.  This as the arrest of a 33-year-old in  California.  The president tweeting, \"We will be forced to close the  southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us  money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws  that are country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve!\"</p><p>As I mentioned, the arrest of the 33-year-old illegal immigrant, Gustavo  Perez Arriaga, a confirmed gang member according to sheriff's deputies out  there in California, two-time convicted drunk driver, and now charged with  killing a police officer out in California.  </p><p>Let's bring in our panel.  We'll see where things stand tonight.  Matthew  Continetti is editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Leslie  Marshall, Democratic strategist, and political writer John McCormack.  OK  John, your thoughts on where we are and how all these stories stack up  together?  </p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, POLITICAL WRITER:  I think there's always a very strong  bias towards the status quo in these shutdowns.  That was true in 2013 when  Republicans wanted to defund Obamacare, that was true a year ago with  Senate Democrats wanted to get something done on DACA.  </p><p>With that said, I don't really see this resolving itself any time soon,  especially with this murderer out in California.  I think you are going to  see the president dig in.  And I wonder if changing sanctuary laws is going  to become more important in the short-term, something to be done on that,  than getting money for the wall.  But with that said, I think anything at  this point in terms of border security would count as something of a win  given the fact that usually during the shutdowns nothing much happens at  all.  </p><p>BAIER:  Here is the Stanislaus County sheriff about this whole incident.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SHERIFF:  We can't ignore  the fact that this could have been preventable.  And under SB-54 in  California, based on two arrests for DUI and of some other active warrants  that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been  prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this  criminal gang member.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, thoughts on all this?  </p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well, obviously this weighs both,  whether you are Democrat or Republican, emotionally when a life has been  lost, a member of law enforcement, an outstanding member of our community  here in California.  I have had trouble with this law.  There are many  Democrats that have had trouble with this law.  Not that we have some kind  of a sanctuary city refuge, because we do want these individuals to help  law enforcement.  But we do want also for federal and state and local  police to be able to work together to keep our communities safe.</p><p>So I think quite frankly this is, especially in California, more of a  pressing issue, this state issue, than the border wall, which already has  bipartisan support to have repairs and to have more security, but not the  $5 billion for the steel slats that the president talks about.  </p><p>BAIER:  Matthew, it does not seem like there's going to be a quick  resolution to this, unless someone is willing to give.  Right now you can't  foresee that just listening to both sides.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON:  No, not at  all.  There is a difference, Bret, between the shutdown and earlier ones,  and that is this one started and has continued for the last week under  unified government.  Typically shutdowns are when the party in Congress is  different from the party of the president.  In this case it begins with  Republicans controlling both Congress and the presidency.</p><p>And I think that's leading to kind of the standstill in negotiations.  It's  hard to have a meeting of the minds when Nancy Pelosi is in Hawaii for the  holiday.  I think she is waiting until she comes into power next week and  so then she can begin the negotiations on her terms.  </p><p>And that of course is a problem for the president.  These short-term  shutdowns, we have about one week now, they tend to not have major effects  in the economy or in the American politics.  What happens, though, when the  shutdowns go for longer than say a week or two weeks, that stretch into a  third week, or perhaps longer than that, that's when you start having real  political costs in terms of people's bases starting to get nervous, and you  also have the economic costs, which in the state of the markets as they are  today, is something that the president probably doesn't want.  </p><p>BAIER:  John, we've talked about this -- 75 percent of the government has  already been funded because those spending bills have been passed.  There  are seven spending bills that are pending.  There is a possible solution  here in that Congress could come back and pass six of the seven, hold off  on the Department of Homeland Security that deals with border security and  the border wall, pass a continuing resolution for that.  But pass the other  six bills and get it to the president's desk and say, here, let's solve  this, but let's argue about DHS.</p><p>MCCORMACK:  I think that's entirely possible, but I still don't see  Democrats wanting to give in on the wall just because President Trump has  made it such a big campaign issue.  Democrats actually moved pretty very  far left on this issue.  Back in 2006 a number of them like Joe Biden,  Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, voted for 700 miles of fencing, but because  this has been such a big campaign promise of the president's, I don't think  that they're going to want to budge unless they get something really good  like DACA.  When this deal came up last time Democrats insisted that they  get a clean exchange for DACA and the wall.  It got hung up over this idea  of ending chain migration.  You bring in someone and then you bring in all  the relatives.  Whether they can get some clean deal, I think it's unlikely  at this point, but you never know.  </p><p>BAIER:  Last thing Leslie, the other story that's obviously is gaining a  lot of traction and also being talked about on the Democratic side a lot  are the two children who have died in U.S. custody along the border.  And  tragic, and horrible.  The immigration system down there trying to figure  out how best to deal with those children and the problems that they are  dealing with in illness also factoring into this giant equation.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Absolutely.  And this is something, again, where it tugs on the  heartstrings of Americans regardless of what side of the isle you are on.   This speaks to the moral compass of our nation, and people are not  obviously in favor, not only of separating families, of children being put  in harm's way in any way, especially in the United States of America.  </p><p>But Bret, that's exactly why this should not go up.  We need comprehensive  immigration reform that's going to keep us safe and the majority of people  who come here illegally come by plane, not through the Mexican border.  And  we need something that not only will be so costly and a political issue  which is what I believe it is for the president, it's a campaign promise.   But that's something that is not only not going to be so costly and be a  political issue, which I believe this is for the president, because it  would be a political win, it's a campaign promise, but something the  American people want, which is bipartisan support, a multifaceted program  that comes up with comprehensive immigration reform that can help with  DACA, provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people that have  been here for decades already, and to handle the backlog that we have in  the courts, and to take care of these cases of people that are crying out  for amnesty currently at our border.</p><p>BAIER:  Here's Sarah Sanders on the kids in CPB custody.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly, that's an  absolutely tragic situation, something nobody ever wants to see happen.   It's one of the reasons that the president wants to fix our broken  immigration system.  It's a treacherous journey, and we don't want to see  people go that route.  We want people to come through than legal process so  that they are not putting their lives on the line to do this.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Matthew, if the negotiation is just calling it border security and  you don't call it a wall but you still get $2.5 billion to do it, is that a  solution?  Where are we?  Is it semantics now?  </p><p>CONTINETTI:  Semantics is probably the easiest solution, Bret.  But even  there, I'm very pessimistic about this being resolved anytime soon.  As  John McCormack noted, the Democrats have moved away from the president's  position.  Remember just earlier this month, we were talking about $1.6  billion that they were willing to grant him for border security.  Now they  are at zero, and they're making a big issue of the wall.</p><p>And of course, public opinion polls and the public in general also opposes  a wall as well as a shutdown, whereas President Trump of course is really  fighting for his supporters.  And he has strong support among the  Republican Party, and they want the wall.  So as long as these two  positions are kind of intractable, I don't think we're going to come to an  agreement anytime soon.  </p><p>BAIER:  Panel, stand by.  Next up, the biggest foreign policy stories of  the year, plus the winners and losers of 2018.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  You call people sometimes killers, he is a killer.  He's clearly  executing people.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's a tough guy.  He is a  very smart guy, and he's a great negotiator.  But I think we understand  each other.  </p><p>BAIER:  But he still has done some really bad things.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Yes, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  President Trump aboard Air Force One after the summit in Singapore.   What about the big foreign policy stories of 2018?  We are back with the  panel.  Matthew, that's yours, right?</p><p>CONTINETTI:  That's mine, the Singapore summit.  This was a watershed and  America's relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  North Korea.  For the president to meet with the North Korean dictator was  a huge story of 2018.  And it represented a thaw there in relations.  I  think, though, we have reached a stalling plant.  And that's why you see a  great urgency on the part of the president to restart this process of  negotiations leading to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible  denuclearization of North Korea.  </p><p>And yet despite all these entreaties from the American side, North Korea  has been silent, and everyone is saying to look for Kim Jong-un's new  year's message.  That is usually when he presents his big foreign policy  agenda.  He might say that a summit is on New Year's Day, but then again,  Bret, he may not.  </p><p>BAIER:  He has also fired missiles over that time period in the past, so we  shall see.  Now, as far as the withdrawal, take a listen to the president  Thursday and Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I didn't just pull them out.   I've been talking about it for a year and a half.  I've been telling the  generals let's go, go ahead, take more time.  It's not time for others to  take over there and fight.  We don't want to be there.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  The war has not yet been one.   The 2,200 in Syria are performing vital national security functions for us,  which include support for a key ally called the Kurds and is an insurance  policy against the rise of ISIS.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  John, biggest story for you?  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I thought the 2017 story of the year was the rollback of ISIS  by the United States and our allies in the region, and the 2018 story of  the year is President Trump's decision to completely pull out troops,  abandoning our Kurdish allies and potentially giving the ability for ISIS  to reconstitute itself and regroup.  It had echoes of President Obama's  decision to pull out of Iraq entirely, which led rise to ISIS in the first  place.  </p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, I know yours is the U.S.-Saudi relations, but let's start  with winners and losers of 2018.  Your winner, then loser for 2018.</p><p>MARSHALL:  You are starting with me.  OK, I would say, first of all, I'm  going to start with loser, if that's OK.  I want to end on a happier note.   The losers I think, quite frankly the migrant policy that we have right  now, the separation, these children, what it's led to not only physically  but emotionally for these children.</p><p>And winners, I'm going to say the American voters, because they came out in  record numbers and elected more women.  They voted for change.  We saw  people from various religions, from various sexual orientations and  backgrounds.  And I think we're going to see an extremely diverse Congress,  I know, coming up in the new year.  </p><p>BAIER:  Winners and losers, Matthew, of 2018?  </p><p>CONTINETTI:  My winners, Bret, are the Thai Navy Seals.  They rescue along  with some help from other countries including America, they were the ones  who rescued those 12 Thai boys trapped in that cave earlier this year.  It  was an uplifting story, some good news in a year filled with often negative  headlines.  </p><p>And my loser of the year is German chancellor Angela Merkel.  Merkel made  this big gamble in 2015 when she opened Germany's borders to about a  million migrants from the Muslim world, and she set in a chain of events  that led to her announcement just this past year that she will no longer  seek election as chancellor.  This is a huge story for European politics  and also I think world politics.  </p><p>BAIER:  John, your winner and loser of 2018?  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  Winner of the year would be Nikki Haley who is one of the few  if only members of this administration to leave this administration on good  terms with the president.  You saw her make her announcement in the Oval  Office, setting herself up very well for someone who could potentially  unite the party in 2024, who has the respect of the president's supporters  as well as many of a few of his critics in the Republican Party who thought  that she was a voice for American freedom at the United Nations and as well  as someone who would occasionally speak out and disagree with him publicly.  </p><p>My loser of the year is Chuck Schumer and all the Senate Democrats,  particularly those on the Judiciary Committee, for their handling of the  Brett Kavanaugh hearings.  They not only failed to stop President Trump  from getting a second conservative on the Supreme Court, the energized  Republican voters and lost a couple of Senate seats by bringing up a lot of  allegations, many of which were completely scurrilous.  They really didn't  do themselves any favors.  </p><p>BAIER:  Panel, thank you very much, happy New Year.  When we come back,  \"Notable Quotables.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Finally tonight, this is the last \"Notable Quotables\" of 2018.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So much for a Santa Claus rally on Wall Street.

JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement.

It's up  to them to stop the shutdown.  </p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We sat down with Mr.  Schumer and gave him a number below five.  I'm not going to tell you what  it is.  Did I just say I was wasn't going to tell you what the number was?  </p><p>TRUMP:  We came to Al Asad to share our eternal gratitude for everything  you do to keep America safe, strong, and free.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much is happening in Washington as best I can tell.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Are you still a believer in Santa?

I'm Bret Baier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The suspect was caught just a few hours ago near Bakersfield, California  after being on the run for two days.  Investigators believe he is  responsible for the murder of Newman police officer Ronil Singh who  migrated to the U.S. legally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In an emotional press conference late this afternoon, the Stanislaus county  sheriff said Singh's death could have been prevented.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All this happening as we head into a long weekend with a stalemate in the  fight over border security.</p><p> We have Fox team coverage tonight.  Correspondent Ellison Barber is at the  White House where the President is threatening to close the U.S. border.</p><p> Correspondent Peter Doocy is on Capitol Hill where members of Congress are  not.</p><p> But we begin with national correspondent William La Jeunesse who is  following all the latest developments from Los Angeles.  Good evening --  William.  </p><p> WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well Bret -- just  hours ago, police confirmed the arrest of 32-year-old Gustavo Perez  Arriaga, an illegal immigrant confirmed gang member and two-time convicted  drunk driver with outstanding warrants.</p><p> The California sheriff also confirming the arrest of two other illegal  immigrants -- a brother and co-worker who tried to cover up the whereabouts  of Arriaga as he allegedly tried to flee to Mexico.</p><p> But under aerial surveillance the Kern County attack team intercepted  Arriaga near Bakersfield where he surrendered without incident.</p><p> Arriaga is a Mexican national who entered the U.S. illegally in Arizona,  wanted for killing 33-year-old Ron Singh, a seven-year Newman Police  veteran who emigrated to the U.S. legally from Fiji.</p><p> Singh was married with a 5-month-old son.  He took this photo Christmas  Day, just hours before he and his K-9 partner stopped a possible drunk  driver.  Moments later Singh he radioed, \"shots fired.  I'm hit.\"  He died  a short time later.</p><p> Today his brother Reggie thanked police for finding the alleged killer.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGGIE SINGH, BROTHER OF OFFICER RONIL SINGH:  He's not coming back, but --  there is a lot of people out there that miss him and a lot of law  enforcement people that I don't know who work days and nights to make this  happen.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  Today in a news conference, the sheriff of Stanislaus County  threw gasoline on the already red-hot immigration debate by calling Singh's  death preventable, blaming the state sanctuary law for prohibiting police  from communicating with ICE about known and wanted felons.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  Let's go back to  Ron -- an immigrant immigrated here lawfully and illegally to pursue his  American dream.  He achieved that goal.  His dream was taken from him.</p><p> No, we shouldn't politicize it, but we have to have a conversation about  restrictive legislation that puts our communities at risk.  </p><p> SHERIFF DONNY YOUNGBLOOD, KERN COUNTY CALIFORNIA:  When you tie our hands  and don't allow us to work with our federal partners and communicate with  our federal partners about people that commit crimes who are in this  country illegally, we're going to have incidents like this.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  Police arrested three more today for aiding and abetting and  say they are helping prosecutors build a case against Arriaga, arraignment  likely next Wednesday.</p><p> Singh's narcotics dog, Sam, will be retired to live with his wife and child  -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  William -- thank you.</p><p> President Trump is threatening to seal the southern border if he doesn't  get funding for his wall as both sides dig in their heels over border  security.</p><p> Correspondent Ellison Barber is at the White House where the President is  as well this holiday weekend.  Good evening -- Ellison.</p><p> ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p> That's right.  A shutdown threat in the middle of the shutdown.  President  Trump saying without funding for a border wall, he might decide to close  the southern border entirely.</p><p> \"The United States loses so much money on trade with Mexico under NAFTA,\"  the President tweeted, \"that I would consider closing the southern border,  a profit making operation.  We build a wall or close the southern border.\"</p><p> Shutting down the southern border would cost us a billion dollars a day.   Is the President seriously willing to do that?  </p><p> MICK MULVANEY, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET DIRECTOR:  Yes he absolutely  is.  </p><p> BARBER:  But it's unclear if the President could legally closet the entire  southern border and if he did there would surely be legal challenges just  like with saw happen to so-called travel bans.  The President's budget  director and soon to be acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says it is not  an empty threat.  </p><p> MULVANEY:  All options are on the table.  Listen, it's the only way we can  get the Democrats' attention.  </p><p> BARBER:  According to the White House they offered Democrats a deal that is  less than President Trump's previous ask of $5 billion for border security  and a wall, but they say Democrats just walked away.  </p><p> MULVANEY:  That steel barrier that the President tweeted out, that's what  he wants to build.  The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a  wall, they offered us $1.3 billion to do that.  We countered with $5  billion.  They did not even counter us.  </p><p> BARBER:  More than anyone, administration officials blame House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p> MULVANEY:  Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats probably would cut a deal  but they are protecting Mrs. Pelosi.  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  She is unwilling to  actually do anything until she gets her speakership.  She's more willing to  protect that than she is to protect our borders and protect American lives.  </p><p> BARBER:  President Trump, who once said this -- </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get what we  want, I will shut down the government.  </p><p> BARBER:  Putting some blame on the Ninth Circuit, tweeting \"The reason the  DACA for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision  from the Ninth Circuit allowed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to  remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case.  After ruling Dems dropped  deal and that's where we are today.  Democrat obstruction of the needed  wall.</p><p> Yesterday a spokesperson for Pelosi said Democrats offered Republicans  three options to reopen the government and that all three included funding  for border security, but not the President's wall, which they described as  immoral, ineffective and expensive.</p><p> Meanwhile Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen traveled to the  southern border.  She said she wanted to see firsthand medical screenings  and conditions at border patrol stations after an 8-year-old died in the  custody of border patrol agents earlier this week.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARBER:  A preliminary autopsy conducted by officials in New Mexico  indicates that that young boy died of the flu.  He is the second child to  die this month while in the custody of border patrol -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  Ellison -- thank you.</p><p> As we head into the new year there are no signs of movement towards a deal  on funding a border wall.</p><p> Correspondent Peter Doocy has that part of the story for us from Capitol  Hill.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  As the government's partial drags on  along the Potomac, papers are piling up outside Mitch McConnell's office  and Nancy Pelosi is on an island in the Pacific spotted five time zones  away from the House in Hawaii shortly after she apparently left the White  House hanging as it pitched the spending they request for border wall  money.  </p><p> REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK:  House Democrats are in a bit of a bind.  I  don't think Nancy Pelosi wants to put any offer on the table until after  she's elected speaker.  And so that's holding her back.</p><p> DOOCY:  Part of Pelosi's leadership team is forecasting what she might  want.  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries tweeted today \"Day seven of the Trump  shut down.  Republicans continue to hold the American people hostage.  We  refuse to pay a $5 billion ransom note.  In other words, take a hike.\"</p><p> That $5 billion in border wall funding is stuck in the Senate where White  House ally Senator Lindsey Graham wrote today, \"To Nancy Pelosi and the  House Democrats -- no wall money, no deal.\"</p><p> So now, lawmakers are stuck or are they?</p><p> Senate leaders abandoned attempts to move the border wall bill because it  was so far short of the 60 votes needed to pass.  So some House lawmakers  are urging upper chamber colleagues to change the rules.  </p><p> REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R), TEXAS:  This is an emergency.  This is our  southern border.  This is the defense of our nation, the 60-vote rule, the  filibuster rule in the Senate should be suspended to allow this  appropriations bill to go forward.  </p><p> DOOCY:  But Democrats insist this dustup over dollars for the wall is just  a diversion.  </p><p> REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), RHODE ISLAND:  He wants a fight about this  because he wants to distract from the other very bad things that have  happened in the last two weeks.  </p><p> DOOCY:  Republican supporters of the wall in the House are starting to  think bigger like a trade -- funds for construction, in exchange for a fix  to help DACA recipients illegally brought to this country as young  children.</p><p> KING:  I think the Democrats should come back with their own offer now.  I  think there is room for negotiation and the President is willing to come  down on the dollar amount.  The Democrats should go along with the wall and  if the DACA is on the table, then let's do that.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOOCY:  There are no signs this partial shutdown will end during Paul  Ryan's final days as House Speaker.  And even though his name is still on  the door outside the speaker's office, we've watched just in the last few  minutes as staffers have started to wheel in desks and computers, because  by the time that many members get back, Nancy Pelosi's name will most  likely be on the door outside -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Peter Doocy, live on a lonely Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p>North Carolina's elections board dissolved today under court order without  certifying a winner in the states ninth congressional district race.  The  state elections board has refused to certify the race between Republican  Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready while it investigates absentee ballot  irregularities.</p><p> Harris holds a slim lead in unofficial results but officials are looking  into fraud allegations against an operative hired by the Harris campaign.</p><p> A mixed day on Wall Street today, the Dow was off 76.  The S&amp;P 500 slipped  three, the Nasdaq was up five.  For the week, the Dow was up 2.75 percent.   The S&amp;P 500 was up nearly three.  The Nasdaq finished ahead of nearly 4  percent.</p><p>Wells Fargo will pay more than half a billion dollars to settle an  investigation into a string of suspicious business practices.  The bank has  been under a cloud since 2015, when it acknowledged that employees had  opened millions of fake bank accounts for customers in order to meet sales  goals.  It has also said that it sold auto insurance and other financial  products to customers who didn't need them.

It may  have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.</p><p> And as Lucas Tomlinson reports from the Pentagon, the Trump  administration's new plan has support from a former senior Obama  administration official.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS PENTAGON PRODUCER:  Syrian forces moved to the  outskirts of a Kurdish held city captured from ISIS putting hundreds of  American troops in potential danger.  But Syrian President Bashar al  Assad's forces closed-in ten days after President Trump ordered the full  withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.</p><p> But the Kurds say they welcome the Syrian troops in Manbij as protection  against a potential Turkish invasion after their U.S. allies leave.   Turkey's president says he wants the Kurdish fighters out of the city  immediately.</p><p> RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator):  Our entire  aim is to make terror organizations leave the area.  If terror  organizations leave then there is no work left for us anyway.  Our  communications and relationships with both the United States, with  President Trump whom I spoke to recently and Russia continuous healthily  (ph).  </p><p> TOMLINSON:  President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria  following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month.  The  former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports  President Trump's decision to pull out.  \"Holding northeastern Syria would  not have enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from  Damascus, Tehran, or Moscow.  Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and  stabilization teams can reverse that.  We would do well to be humbler about  our abilities especially in the face of sustained widespread regional  hostility.\"</p><p> Seven years after the start of Syria's civil war, President Assad no longer  feels isolated.  Gulf states long opposed to his rule are coming back to  Damascus.  Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in Syria one  day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TOMLINSON:  U.S. officials tell me there is no immediate plan to withdraw  any American troops from Manbij, Syria.  The complete withdrawal from the  country could take months -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon.  Lucas -- thank you.</p><p> 2018 will end with another deadly protest along the Israeli border, and it  looks like those demonstrations will go into the new year.  </p><p> Correspondent Trey Yingst has our report.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Tear gas was deployed and sniper fire  rang out as Israeli forces fought to push back Palestinian protesters along  the Israel-Gaza border.  The demonstrators gathering for the 40th Friday in  a row to voice opposition to the Israeli blockade on the Gaza strip.</p><p> After four Palestinians were killed last Friday, Hamas, the group in  control of the Gaza Strip threatened to fire rockets and use sniper fire if  anyone was killed today.</p><p> According to the Palestinian health ministry, one person was killed, shot  in the head; and at least eight injured by live ammunition.  </p><p> YINGST:  Organizers of the protests say the fact that thousands showed up  despite the wind and rain is an indication of the persistence and  resilience that these demonstrators have.  And they will continue to push  forward until the Israeli blockade on Gaza is lifted.</p><p> With major grievances still taking place in Gaza regarding employment,  electricity and infrastructure the Friday gatherings are expected to  continue.  The demonstrations come as Egyptian negotiators are trying to  develop a long-term deal between Israel and Hamas that would avoid future  escalations.</p><p> Last month, a failed Israeli Special Forces operation inside Gaza led to an  exchange of rocket fire and air strikes between the two sides.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> YINGST:  A senior Hamas official told Fox News the deadly outcome of  today's border demonstrations will certainly factor into the group's  response -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Trey -- thank you.</p><p> Up next, how longer lives and having less children are leading to a rise in  populism.  We'll explain.</p><p> First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 13 in Seattle where a nationwide network outage caused the disruption  to 911 calls in western Washington.  The outages began Thursday from New  York to California.  The company behind the outages says the problem  involved a network element but would not elaborate.</p><p>Fox 7 in Austin where the nation's oldest living veteran with died  Thursday.  Richard Overton was born in 1906, served three years in the army  during World War II.  He credited his faith and cigars and whiskey for his  longevity.  Overton was 112 years old.</p><p> And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate, Fox 5.  The big  story there tonight, a transformer explosion that turned the night sky over  New York City an electric blue last night.  Kind of freaky, it looked like  an alien invasion.  An incredible sight according to the mayor's office  tweeting out that it was not aliens in fact but electrical surge at a  Queens substation.  The blue light eventually faded and at last check no  one was seen being taken away by a spaceship.</p><p> That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.  We'll  be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  A powerful winter storm continued to wreak havoc across the U.S.  today.  Blizzard conditions across the upper Midwest are being blamed for  at least three deadly car crashes while flash flooding in the south swept  away cars and forced dozens of water rescues.  The risk of flooding will  persist in parts of the south into next week, we are told.</p><p> A change in the makeup of American families is giving way to a rise in  populism, a trend that correspondent Doug McKelway shows us is working its  way across Europe.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TRUMP:  America first.  </p><p> DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The discontent behind the populism  that helped elect Donald Trump is at work across the world.  Europe's  creeping social welfare state marked by a protected status for older works,  early retirement, and an expansive social safety net has proved no match  for the demographic realities of low fertility rates.  </p><p> VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION:  Western societies that produce a  plethora of goods and services, and have excellent health care, that's a  Western tradition, then people live longer and life is better.  So they  want to enjoy it and unfortunately that means they don't want to put up  with child raising.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  The lowest fertility rate may be Greece -- 1.35 births per women  and not enough young people to pay for the elderly's benefits.  Europe,  Japan, and the U.S. seem unwilling to remedy it.  </p><p> HANSON:  That would require I think not a lot of sacrifice but enough  sacrifice that an affluent and (INAUDIBLE) society would find probably I  guess intolerable or politically impossible.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  Like the U.S., Europe has compensated for the birth dearth by  importing labor, a manageable solution to a point.  </p><p> MONICA DUFFY TOFT, INTERNATIONAL POLITICS PROFESSOR:  By the second or  third generation, these populations -- these non-native populations  acculturate or they sort of become part of the mainstream communities.  But  it takes a generation or two.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  Europe is a combination of refugees fleeing ISIS and the civil  war in Syria has proved a bridge too far.  </p><p> PHILIP COHEN, FAMILY SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR:  Immigration poses challenges to  the dominant culture.  It's obviously politically fraught.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  From Greece, to Italy, Germany, France and the Nordic countries,  clashes have erupted.  Nationalist politicians are forcing a reckoning with  multiculturalism.  That while the Yellow Jacket rioting in France proves  there is a limit to how much citizens are willing to be taxed.  </p><p> On the other side of the globe, Japan is facing its own declining fertility  rate that has been traditionally resistant to immigrant labor.  One  potential solution there, robots may help to man factories, to care for the  elderly.  And in China, a demographic problem of its own making a  generation ago overpopulation compelled the communist government to force a  one-child policy on the populace.  </p><p> COHEN:  They included forced sterilization, abortion and very harsh  penalties for people who had extra children.  So it was really a human  rights disaster.</p><p> MCKELWAY:  And because male babies were favored today China faces a surplus  of 34 million single men.  Their widely distorted majority accompanies an  increase in crime, loneliness and prostitution among other societal ills  according to the \"Washington Post\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCKELWAY:  Ironically today, because of China's massive transformation into  an industrial powerhouse, it has become like the West, more affluent, a  place where a new generation of parents is less interested in reproducing - - Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Doug -- thank you.</p><p> Up next, a closer look at one court and whether some judges are upholding  the law or their own political beliefs.  We will take a look.</p><p> First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> The leaders of Germany and France are pressuring and pressing Russia to  release Ukrainian sailors captured more than a month ago in time for the  new year.</p><p> German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emanuel Macron made  the joint statement today while also vowing to keep up pressure for a peace  deal for Eastern Ukraine.  The Russian coast guard seized three Ukrainian  naval vessels and their crew back in November.</p><p> Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza  Pyramids killing at least three people and wounding ten others today.  The  country has battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first  attack to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.</p><p> Bad weather and heavy ash are hampering efforts to assess whether an  Indonesian volcano could trigger another deadly tsunami.  Authorities have  warned residents to stay away from the coastline there.  So far 426 people  have been confirmed killed in last weekend's tsunami but the search for  victims will continue into January.</p><p> Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.  We will be  right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  When it comes to cyber security, a year in review might highlight  the billions of people affected by data breaches or even questions over  bias and social media content. </p><p> But as correspondent Gillian Turner reports, some in Congress are hoping  2019 might bring more oversight and online security.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Members of Congress are using the  partial government shutdown as an opportunity to sharpen their knives as  they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year.</p><p> First up, regulating big tech.  Both sides of the aisle have their sights  set on the big three social media companies -- Facebook, Twitter and  Google-owned YouTube.  </p><p> REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans.   They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.  </p><p> SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA:  We have to put some rules of the  road in place.  They can't just say, if you trust us, we got your back.  </p><p> TURNER:  But not everyone wants the same thing.  Democrats want social  media companies to get rid of fake news after than they did in 2016 to  avoid foreign election interference.  Republicans want to hold the big  three accountable for anti-conservative bias.  One thing they can agree on,  both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign  season kicks off.</p><p> Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about, data  encryption.  Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like  Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake.  They are taking  cues from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.  He's been keeping this  issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refused to  decrypt their data for investigators.</p><p> \"Companies are in the business of generating profits.  I don't blame them  for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns.  But  it's important to understand that what is good for a technology company  isn't necessarily good for America.\"</p><p> Democrats are focused on protecting Americans' privacy.  They worry if  investigators can access any encrypted data they want it will lead to  abuses in the future.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TURNER:  2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users.   Breaches at Facebook, Twitter and Google alone resulted in 619 million user  accounts compromised and that's a conservative estimate.</p><p> Here's hoping 2019 is a bit more secure -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  You bet.  Gillian -- thanks.</p><p> TURNER:  You got it.</p><p> BAIER:  Misrepresenting your family pet as a service dog could cost you.   This January, Hawaii joins nearly two dozen states in fining folks who lie  about their pet.  At least 21 states have passed laws governing service  animals in an attempt to keep unruly pets out of grocery stores, movie  theaters and restaurants.</p><p> If a man asks a woman out on a date, and he is taller than she is, can that  be considered sexual harassment?  According to a former University of  Missouri vice chancellor, the answer is yes.  School officials suspended a  student for four years because they say his size and gender gave him power  over a female he pursued romantically.  That former student is now suing  the school for racial and sexual discrimination.  </p><p> Judges are supposed to remain impartial, but when they are appointed by a  president, is that possible?  Correspondent Dan Springer with a look  tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When U.S. District Court Judge Jon  Tigar blocked the Trump administration plan to bar asylum to any immigrant  not entering at the designated border crossing, President Trump railed  against who he called the Obama judge, which drew this response from  Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  \"We do not have Obama judges or  Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.  What we have is an  extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best.\"  Trump  tweeted back, \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but we do have Obama  judges, and they have a much different point of view than people who are  charged with the safety of our country.\" Court watchers say essentially  both men are right.  </p><p> JOEL ARD, FEDERALIST SOCIETY:  Presidents certainly hope that the judges  they nominate share their views and hold those views long after the  president is out of office, and I think the chief justice is correct that  the judges are independent, they are not beholden to the president who  nominates them.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  President Trump also bashed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  for not even hearing his appeal on the asylum ruling.  It has been a  frequent attack during a string of losses on immigration cases, from the  travel ban to sanctuary cities.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You go to the Ninth Circuit  and it's a disgrace.  And I'm going to put in a major complaint.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  Of the 41 sitting judges on the Ninth Circuit, 25 were nominated  by Democratic presidents, 16 by Republicans.  President Clinton picked the  most with 14 followed by Obama, George W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter.  Trump  now has two of the 23 active judges, but has nominated five more to current  vacancies.  </p><p> RORY LITTLE, LAW PROFESSOR:  It is soon going to be a Trump court.  It's  soon going to be not a majority of these 29 judges, but they're going to  have a substantial chunk.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SPRINGER:  Because Republicans control the Senate and only a simple  majority is needed to confirm federal judges, President Trump will reshape  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Whether future rulings are to his  liking depends on the questions at the heart of the Trump-Roberts debate,  exactly who gets confirmed, and how independent will they be?  Bret?</p><p> BAIER:  Dan, thank you.  </p><p> When we come back, the battle over the border wall is heading into the new  year.  First, we are sad to report the death of a FOX News regular, Bre  Payton.  A staff writer at \"The Federalist,\" frequent guest on our air,  died this morning after a friend says she was admitted to the hospital with  swine flu and possible meningitis.  Our condolences to her family.  Bre  Payton was only 26 years old.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We're still building the  barrier.  That's why the government is closed, is the president is not  willing to give up on the southern barrier.  But it makes sense to sit down  across the table when you're trying to negotiate with another party and see  if there is someplace in the middle between their five and our 1.3.  </p><p> REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement where a majority say yes.  And I think we had that until  the president went off his meds and who the hell knows what happened.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  The negotiations are still continuing, and there doesn't seem to be  any back and forth happening.  This as the arrest of a 33-year-old in  California.  The president tweeting, \"We will be forced to close the  southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us  money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws  that are country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve!\"</p><p> As I mentioned, the arrest of the 33-year-old illegal immigrant, Gustavo  Perez Arriaga, a confirmed gang member according to sheriff's deputies out  there in California, two-time convicted drunk driver, and now charged with  killing a police officer out in California.  </p><p> Let's bring in our panel.  We'll see where things stand tonight.  Matthew  Continetti is editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Leslie  Marshall, Democratic strategist, and political writer John McCormack.  OK  John, your thoughts on where we are and how all these stories stack up  together?  </p><p> JOHN MCCORMACK, POLITICAL WRITER:  I think there's always a very strong  bias towards the status quo in these shutdowns.  That was true in 2013 when  Republicans wanted to defund Obamacare, that was true a year ago with  Senate Democrats wanted to get something done on DACA.  </p><p> With that said, I don't really see this resolving itself any time soon,  especially with this murderer out in California.  I think you are going to  see the president dig in.  And I wonder if changing sanctuary laws is going  to become more important in the short-term, something to be done on that,  than getting money for the wall.  But with that said, I think anything at  this point in terms of border security would count as something of a win  given the fact that usually during the shutdowns nothing much happens at  all.  </p><p> BAIER:  Here is the Stanislaus County sheriff about this whole incident.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SHERIFF:  We can't ignore  the fact that this could have been preventable.  And under SB-54 in  California, based on two arrests for DUI and of some other active warrants  that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been  prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this  criminal gang member.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Leslie, thoughts on all this?  </p><p> LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well, obviously this weighs both,  whether you are Democrat or Republican, emotionally when a life has been  lost, a member of law enforcement, an outstanding member of our community  here in California.  I have had trouble with this law.  There are many  Democrats that have had trouble with this law.  Not that we have some kind  of a sanctuary city refuge, because we do want these individuals to help  law enforcement.  But we do want also for federal and state and local  police to be able to work together to keep our communities safe.</p><p> So I think quite frankly this is, especially in California, more of a  pressing issue, this state issue, than the border wall, which already has  bipartisan support to have repairs and to have more security, but not the  $5 billion for the steel slats that the president talks about.  </p><p> BAIER:  Matthew, it does not seem like there's going to be a quick  resolution to this, unless someone is willing to give.  Right now you can't  foresee that just listening to both sides.</p><p> MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON:  No, not at  all.  There is a difference, Bret, between the shutdown and earlier ones,  and that is this one started and has continued for the last week under  unified government.  Typically shutdowns are when the party in Congress is  different from the party of the president.  In this case it begins with  Republicans controlling both Congress and the presidency.</p><p> And I think that's leading to kind of the standstill in negotiations.  It's  hard to have a meeting of the minds when Nancy Pelosi is in Hawaii for the  holiday.  I think she is waiting until she comes into power next week and  so then she can begin the negotiations on her terms.  </p><p> And that of course is a problem for the president.  These short-term  shutdowns, we have about one week now, they tend to not have major effects  in the economy or in the American politics.  What happens, though, when the  shutdowns go for longer than say a week or two weeks, that stretch into a  third week, or perhaps longer than that, that's when you start having real  political costs in terms of people's bases starting to get nervous, and you  also have the economic costs, which in the state of the markets as they are  today, is something that the president probably doesn't want.  </p><p> BAIER:  John, we've talked about this -- 75 percent of the government has  already been funded because those spending bills have been passed.  There  are seven spending bills that are pending.  There is a possible solution  here in that Congress could come back and pass six of the seven, hold off  on the Department of Homeland Security that deals with border security and  the border wall, pass a continuing resolution for that.  But pass the other  six bills and get it to the president's desk and say, here, let's solve  this, but let's argue about DHS.</p><p> MCCORMACK:  I think that's entirely possible, but I still don't see  Democrats wanting to give in on the wall just because President Trump has  made it such a big campaign issue.  Democrats actually moved pretty very  far left on this issue.  Back in 2006 a number of them like Joe Biden,  Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, voted for 700 miles of fencing, but because  this has been such a big campaign promise of the president's, I don't think  that they're going to want to budge unless they get something really good  like DACA.  When this deal came up last time Democrats insisted that they  get a clean exchange for DACA and the wall.  It got hung up over this idea  of ending chain migration.  You bring in someone and then you bring in all  the relatives.  Whether they can get some clean deal, I think it's unlikely  at this point, but you never know.  </p><p> BAIER:  Last thing Leslie, the other story that's obviously is gaining a  lot of traction and also being talked about on the Democratic side a lot  are the two children who have died in U.S. custody along the border.  And  tragic, and horrible.  The immigration system down there trying to figure  out how best to deal with those children and the problems that they are  dealing with in illness also factoring into this giant equation.  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Absolutely.  And this is something, again, where it tugs on the  heartstrings of Americans regardless of what side of the isle you are on.   This speaks to the moral compass of our nation, and people are not  obviously in favor, not only of separating families, of children being put  in harm's way in any way, especially in the United States of America.  </p><p> But Bret, that's exactly why this should not go up.  We need comprehensive  immigration reform that's going to keep us safe and the majority of people  who come here illegally come by plane, not through the Mexican border.  And  we need something that not only will be so costly and a political issue  which is what I believe it is for the president, it's a campaign promise.   But that's something that is not only not going to be so costly and be a  political issue, which I believe this is for the president, because it  would be a political win, it's a campaign promise, but something the  American people want, which is bipartisan support, a multifaceted program  that comes up with comprehensive immigration reform that can help with  DACA, provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people that have  been here for decades already, and to handle the backlog that we have in  the courts, and to take care of these cases of people that are crying out  for amnesty currently at our border.</p><p> BAIER:  Here's Sarah Sanders on the kids in CPB custody.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly, that's an  absolutely tragic situation, something nobody ever wants to see happen.   It's one of the reasons that the president wants to fix our broken  immigration system.  It's a treacherous journey, and we don't want to see  people go that route.  We want people to come through than legal process so  that they are not putting their lives on the line to do this.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Matthew, if the negotiation is just calling it border security and  you don't call it a wall but you still get $2.5 billion to do it, is that a  solution?  Where are we?  Is it semantics now?  </p><p> CONTINETTI:  Semantics is probably the easiest solution, Bret.  But even  there, I'm very pessimistic about this being resolved anytime soon.  As  John McCormack noted, the Democrats have moved away from the president's  position.  Remember just earlier this month, we were talking about $1.6  billion that they were willing to grant him for border security.  Now they  are at zero, and they're making a big issue of the wall.</p><p> And of course, public opinion polls and the public in general also opposes  a wall as well as a shutdown, whereas President Trump of course is really  fighting for his supporters.  And he has strong support among the  Republican Party, and they want the wall.  So as long as these two  positions are kind of intractable, I don't think we're going to come to an  agreement anytime soon.  </p><p> BAIER:  Panel, stand by.  Next up, the biggest foreign policy stories of  the year, plus the winners and losers of 2018.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  You call people sometimes killers, he is a killer.  He's clearly  executing people.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's a tough guy.  He is a  very smart guy, and he's a great negotiator.  But I think we understand  each other.  </p><p> BAIER:  But he still has done some really bad things.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Yes, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  President Trump aboard Air Force One after the summit in Singapore.   What about the big foreign policy stories of 2018?  We are back with the  panel.  Matthew, that's yours, right?</p><p> CONTINETTI:  That's mine, the Singapore summit.  This was a watershed and  America's relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  North Korea.  For the president to meet with the North Korean dictator was  a huge story of 2018.  And it represented a thaw there in relations.  I  think, though, we have reached a stalling plant.  And that's why you see a  great urgency on the part of the president to restart this process of  negotiations leading to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible  denuclearization of North Korea.  </p><p> And yet despite all these entreaties from the American side, North Korea  has been silent, and everyone is saying to look for Kim Jong-un's new  year's message.  That is usually when he presents his big foreign policy  agenda.  He might say that a summit is on New Year's Day, but then again,  Bret, he may not.  </p><p> BAIER:  He has also fired missiles over that time period in the past, so we  shall see.  Now, as far as the withdrawal, take a listen to the president  Thursday and Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I didn't just pull them out.   I've been talking about it for a year and a half.  I've been telling the  generals let's go, go ahead, take more time.  It's not time for others to  take over there and fight.  We don't want to be there.</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  The war has not yet been one.   The 2,200 in Syria are performing vital national security functions for us,  which include support for a key ally called the Kurds and is an insurance  policy against the rise of ISIS.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  John, biggest story for you?  </p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I thought the 2017 story of the year was the rollback of ISIS  by the United States and our allies in the region, and the 2018 story of  the year is President Trump's decision to completely pull out troops,  abandoning our Kurdish allies and potentially giving the ability for ISIS  to reconstitute itself and regroup.  It had echoes of President Obama's  decision to pull out of Iraq entirely, which led rise to ISIS in the first  place.  </p><p> BAIER:  Leslie, I know yours is the U.S.-Saudi relations, but let's start  with winners and losers of 2018.  Your winner, then loser for 2018.</p><p> MARSHALL:  You are starting with me.  OK, I would say, first of all, I'm  going to start with loser, if that's OK.  I want to end on a happier note.   The losers I think, quite frankly the migrant policy that we have right  now, the separation, these children, what it's led to not only physically  but emotionally for these children.</p><p> And winners, I'm going to say the American voters, because they came out in  record numbers and elected more women.  They voted for change.  We saw  people from various religions, from various sexual orientations and  backgrounds.  And I think we're going to see an extremely diverse Congress,  I know, coming up in the new year.  </p><p> BAIER:  Winners and losers, Matthew, of 2018?  </p><p> CONTINETTI:  My winners, Bret, are the Thai Navy Seals.  They rescue along  with some help from other countries including America, they were the ones  who rescued those 12 Thai boys trapped in that cave earlier this year.  It  was an uplifting story, some good news in a year filled with often negative  headlines.  </p><p> And my loser of the year is German chancellor Angela Merkel.  Merkel made  this big gamble in 2015 when she opened Germany's borders to about a  million migrants from the Muslim world, and she set in a chain of events  that led to her announcement just this past year that she will no longer  seek election as chancellor.  This is a huge story for European politics  and also I think world politics.  </p><p> BAIER:  John, your winner and loser of 2018?  </p><p> MCCORMACK:  Winner of the year would be Nikki Haley who is one of the few  if only members of this administration to leave this administration on good  terms with the president.  You saw her make her announcement in the Oval  Office, setting herself up very well for someone who could potentially  unite the party in 2024, who has the respect of the president's supporters  as well as many of a few of his critics in the Republican Party who thought  that she was a voice for American freedom at the United Nations and as well  as someone who would occasionally speak out and disagree with him publicly.  </p><p> My loser of the year is Chuck Schumer and all the Senate Democrats,  particularly those on the Judiciary Committee, for their handling of the  Brett Kavanaugh hearings.  They not only failed to stop President Trump  from getting a second conservative on the Supreme Court, the energized  Republican voters and lost a couple of Senate seats by bringing up a lot of  allegations, many of which were completely scurrilous.  They really didn't  do themselves any favors.  </p><p> BAIER:  Panel, thank you very much, happy New Year.  When we come back,  \"Notable Quotables.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Finally tonight, this is the last \"Notable Quotables\" of 2018.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So much for a Santa Claus rally on Wall Street.   Investigators getting a lump of coal.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  An emphatic bounce back with the biggest single day  points gain ever for the Dow.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I can't tell you when the  government is going to be open.  I can tell you it's not going to be open  until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it.  </p><p> REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement.  And I think we had that until the president went off his  meds, and who the hell knows what happened.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Authorities are investigating the death of an eight- year-old Guatemalan boy in U.S. custody.  </p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly that's an absolutely  tragic situation.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-three-year-old Ronil Singh was gunned down at  1:00 a.m. Wednesday in the small town of Newman.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's not coming back.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's just too much chaos, too many crises going on.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Democrats need to step up to the plate.  It's up  to them to stop the shutdown.  </p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We sat down with Mr.  Schumer and gave him a number below five.  I'm not going to tell you what  it is.  Did I just say I was wasn't going to tell you what the number was?  </p><p> TRUMP:  We came to Al Asad to share our eternal gratitude for everything  you do to keep America safe, strong, and free.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much is happening in Washington as best I can tell.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Are you still a believer in Santa?  Because at seven it's marginal,  right?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  One week, hard to believe.  </p><p> Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight and every night in 2018.  We  look forward to a great 2019 ahead.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Bret Baier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The suspect was caught just a few hours ago near Bakersfield, California  after being on the run for two days.  Investigators believe he is  responsible for the murder of Newman police officer Ronil Singh who  migrated to the U.S. legally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an emotional press conference late this afternoon, the Stanislaus county  sheriff said Singh's death could have been prevented.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this happening as we head into a long weekend with a stalemate in the  fight over border security.</p><p>We have Fox team coverage tonight.  Correspondent Ellison Barber is at the  White House where the President is threatening to close the U.S. border.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy is on Capitol Hill where members of Congress are  not.</p><p>But we begin with national correspondent William La Jeunesse who is  following all the latest developments from Los Angeles.  Good evening --  William.  </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well Bret -- just  hours ago, police confirmed the arrest of 32-year-old Gustavo Perez  Arriaga, an illegal immigrant confirmed gang member and two-time convicted  drunk driver with outstanding warrants.</p><p>The California sheriff also confirming the arrest of two other illegal  immigrants -- a brother and co-worker who tried to cover up the whereabouts  of Arriaga as he allegedly tried to flee to Mexico.</p><p>But under aerial surveillance the Kern County attack team intercepted  Arriaga near Bakersfield where he surrendered without incident.</p><p>Arriaga is a Mexican national who entered the U.S. illegally in Arizona,  wanted for killing 33-year-old Ron Singh, a seven-year Newman Police  veteran who emigrated to the U.S. legally from Fiji.</p><p>Singh was married with a 5-month-old son.  He took this photo Christmas  Day, just hours before he and his K-9 partner stopped a possible drunk  driver.  Moments later Singh he radioed, \"shots fired.  I'm hit.\"  He died  a short time later.</p><p>Today his brother Reggie thanked police for finding the alleged killer.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGGIE SINGH, BROTHER OF OFFICER RONIL SINGH:  He's not coming back, but --  there is a lot of people out there that miss him and a lot of law  enforcement people that I don't know who work days and nights to make this  happen.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Today in a news conference, the sheriff of Stanislaus County  threw gasoline on the already red-hot immigration debate by calling Singh's  death preventable, blaming the state sanctuary law for prohibiting police  from communicating with ICE about known and wanted felons.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  Let's go back to  Ron -- an immigrant immigrated here lawfully and illegally to pursue his  American dream.  He achieved that goal.  His dream was taken from him.</p><p>No, we shouldn't politicize it, but we have to have a conversation about  restrictive legislation that puts our communities at risk.  </p><p>SHERIFF DONNY YOUNGBLOOD, KERN COUNTY CALIFORNIA:  When you tie our hands  and don't allow us to work with our federal partners and communicate with  our federal partners about people that commit crimes who are in this  country illegally, we're going to have incidents like this.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Police arrested three more today for aiding and abetting and  say they are helping prosecutors build a case against Arriaga, arraignment  likely next Wednesday.</p><p>Singh's narcotics dog, Sam, will be retired to live with his wife and child  -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  William -- thank you.</p><p>President Trump is threatening to seal the southern border if he doesn't  get funding for his wall as both sides dig in their heels over border  security.</p><p>Correspondent Ellison Barber is at the White House where the President is  as well this holiday weekend.  Good evening -- Ellison.</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>That's right.  A shutdown threat in the middle of the shutdown.  President  Trump saying without funding for a border wall, he might decide to close  the southern border entirely.</p><p>\"The United States loses so much money on trade with Mexico under NAFTA,\"  the President tweeted, \"that I would consider closing the southern border,  a profit making operation.  We build a wall or close the southern border.\"</p><p>Shutting down the southern border would cost us a billion dollars a day.   Is the President seriously willing to do that?  </p><p>MICK MULVANEY, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET DIRECTOR:  Yes he absolutely  is.  </p><p>BARBER:  But it's unclear if the President could legally closet the entire  southern border and if he did there would surely be legal challenges just  like with saw happen to so-called travel bans.  The President's budget  director and soon to be acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says it is not  an empty threat.  </p><p>MULVANEY:  All options are on the table.  Listen, it's the only way we can  get the Democrats' attention.  </p><p>BARBER:  According to the White House they offered Democrats a deal that is  less than President Trump's previous ask of $5 billion for border security  and a wall, but they say Democrats just walked away.  </p><p>MULVANEY:  That steel barrier that the President tweeted out, that's what  he wants to build.  The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a  wall, they offered us $1.3 billion to do that.  We countered with $5  billion.  They did not even counter us.  </p><p>BARBER:  More than anyone, administration officials blame House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>MULVANEY:  Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats probably would cut a deal  but they are protecting Mrs. Pelosi.  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  She is unwilling to  actually do anything until she gets her speakership.

Europe,  Japan, and the U.S. seem unwilling to remedy it.  </p><p>HANSON:  That would require I think not a lot of sacrifice but enough  sacrifice that an affluent and (INAUDIBLE) society would find probably I  guess intolerable or politically impossible.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Like the U.S., Europe has compensated for the birth dearth by  importing labor, a manageable solution to a point.  </p><p>MONICA DUFFY TOFT, INTERNATIONAL POLITICS PROFESSOR:  By the second or  third generation, these populations -- these non-native populations  acculturate or they sort of become part of the mainstream communities.

Correspondent Dan Springer with a look  tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When U.S. District Court Judge Jon  Tigar blocked the Trump administration plan to bar asylum to any immigrant  not entering at the designated border crossing, President Trump railed  against who he called the Obama judge, which drew this response from  Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  \"We do not have Obama judges or  Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.  What we have is an  extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best.\"  Trump  tweeted back, \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but we do have Obama  judges, and they have a much different point of view than people who are  charged with the safety of our country.\" Court watchers say essentially  both men are right.  </p><p>JOEL ARD, FEDERALIST SOCIETY:  Presidents certainly hope that the judges  they nominate share their views and hold those views long after the  president is out of office, and I think the chief justice is correct that  the judges are independent, they are not beholden to the president who  nominates them.  </p><p>SPRINGER:  President Trump also bashed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  for not even hearing his appeal on the asylum ruling.  It has been a  frequent attack during a string of losses on immigration cases, from the  travel ban to sanctuary cities.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You go to the Ninth Circuit  and it's a disgrace.  And I'm going to put in a major complaint.  </p><p>SPRINGER:  Of the 41 sitting judges on the Ninth Circuit, 25 were nominated  by Democratic presidents, 16 by Republicans.  President Clinton picked the  most with 14 followed by Obama, George W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter.  Trump  now has two of the 23 active judges, but has nominated five more to current  vacancies.  </p><p>RORY LITTLE, LAW PROFESSOR:  It is soon going to be a Trump court.

Our condolences to her family.  Bre  Payton was only 26 years old.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We're still building the  barrier.  That's why the government is closed, is the president is not  willing to give up on the southern barrier.  But it makes sense to sit down  across the table when you're trying to negotiate with another party and see  if there is someplace in the middle between their five and our 1.3.  </p><p>REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement where a majority say yes.  And I think we had that until  the president went off his meds and who the hell knows what happened.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The negotiations are still continuing, and there doesn't seem to be  any back and forth happening.  This as the arrest of a 33-year-old in  California.  The president tweeting, \"We will be forced to close the  southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us  money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws  that are country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve!\"</p><p>As I mentioned, the arrest of the 33-year-old illegal immigrant, Gustavo  Perez Arriaga, a confirmed gang member according to sheriff's deputies out  there in California, two-time convicted drunk driver, and now charged with  killing a police officer out in California.  </p><p>Let's bring in our panel.  We'll see where things stand tonight.  Matthew  Continetti is editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Leslie  Marshall, Democratic strategist, and political writer John McCormack.  OK  John, your thoughts on where we are and how all these stories stack up  together?  </p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, POLITICAL WRITER:  I think there's always a very strong  bias towards the status quo in these shutdowns.  That was true in 2013 when  Republicans wanted to defund Obamacare, that was true a year ago with  Senate Democrats wanted to get something done on DACA.  </p><p>With that said, I don't really see this resolving itself any time soon,  especially with this murderer out in California.  I think you are going to  see the president dig in.  And I wonder if changing sanctuary laws is going  to become more important in the short-term, something to be done on that,  than getting money for the wall.  But with that said, I think anything at  this point in terms of border security would count as something of a win  given the fact that usually during the shutdowns nothing much happens at  all.  </p><p>BAIER:  Here is the Stanislaus County sheriff about this whole incident.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SHERIFF:  We can't ignore  the fact that this could have been preventable.  And under SB-54 in  California, based on two arrests for DUI and of some other active warrants  that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been  prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this  criminal gang member.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, thoughts on all this?  </p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well, obviously this weighs both,  whether you are Democrat or Republican, emotionally when a life has been  lost, a member of law enforcement, an outstanding member of our community  here in California.  I have had trouble with this law.  There are many  Democrats that have had trouble with this law.  Not that we have some kind  of a sanctuary city refuge, because we do want these individuals to help  law enforcement.  But we do want also for federal and state and local  police to be able to work together to keep our communities safe.</p><p>So I think quite frankly this is, especially in California, more of a  pressing issue, this state issue, than the border wall, which already has  bipartisan support to have repairs and to have more security, but not the  $5 billion for the steel slats that the president talks about.  </p><p>BAIER:  Matthew, it does not seem like there's going to be a quick  resolution to this, unless someone is willing to give.  Right now you can't  foresee that just listening to both sides.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON:  No, not at  all.  There is a difference, Bret, between the shutdown and earlier ones,  and that is this one started and has continued for the last week under  unified government.  Typically shutdowns are when the party in Congress is  different from the party of the president.  In this case it begins with  Republicans controlling both Congress and the presidency.</p><p>And I think that's leading to kind of the standstill in negotiations.  It's  hard to have a meeting of the minds when Nancy Pelosi is in Hawaii for the  holiday.  I think she is waiting until she comes into power next week and  so then she can begin the negotiations on her terms.  </p><p>And that of course is a problem for the president.  These short-term  shutdowns, we have about one week now, they tend to not have major effects  in the economy or in the American politics.  What happens, though, when the  shutdowns go for longer than say a week or two weeks, that stretch into a  third week, or perhaps longer than that, that's when you start having real  political costs in terms of people's bases starting to get nervous, and you  also have the economic costs, which in the state of the markets as they are  today, is something that the president probably doesn't want.  </p><p>BAIER:  John, we've talked about this -- 75 percent of the government has  already been funded because those spending bills have been passed.  There  are seven spending bills that are pending.  There is a possible solution  here in that Congress could come back and pass six of the seven, hold off  on the Department of Homeland Security that deals with border security and  the border wall, pass a continuing resolution for that.  But pass the other  six bills and get it to the president's desk and say, here, let's solve  this, but let's argue about DHS.</p><p>MCCORMACK:  I think that's entirely possible, but I still don't see  Democrats wanting to give in on the wall just because President Trump has  made it such a big campaign issue.  Democrats actually moved pretty very  far left on this issue.  Back in 2006 a number of them like Joe Biden,  Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, voted for 700 miles of fencing, but because  this has been such a big campaign promise of the president's, I don't think  that they're going to want to budge unless they get something really good  like DACA.  When this deal came up last time Democrats insisted that they  get a clean exchange for DACA and the wall.  It got hung up over this idea  of ending chain migration.  You bring in someone and then you bring in all  the relatives.  Whether they can get some clean deal, I think it's unlikely  at this point, but you never know.  </p><p>BAIER:  Last thing Leslie, the other story that's obviously is gaining a  lot of traction and also being talked about on the Democratic side a lot  are the two children who have died in U.S. custody along the border.  And  tragic, and horrible.  The immigration system down there trying to figure  out how best to deal with those children and the problems that they are  dealing with in illness also factoring into this giant equation.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Absolutely.  And this is something, again, where it tugs on the  heartstrings of Americans regardless of what side of the isle you are on.   This speaks to the moral compass of our nation, and people are not  obviously in favor, not only of separating families, of children being put  in harm's way in any way, especially in the United States of America.  </p><p>But Bret, that's exactly why this should not go up.  We need comprehensive  immigration reform that's going to keep us safe and the majority of people  who come here illegally come by plane, not through the Mexican border.  And  we need something that not only will be so costly and a political issue  which is what I believe it is for the president, it's a campaign promise.   But that's something that is not only not going to be so costly and be a  political issue, which I believe this is for the president, because it  would be a political win, it's a campaign promise, but something the  American people want, which is bipartisan support, a multifaceted program  that comes up with comprehensive immigration reform that can help with  DACA, provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people that have  been here for decades already, and to handle the backlog that we have in  the courts, and to take care of these cases of people that are crying out  for amnesty currently at our border.</p><p>BAIER:  Here's Sarah Sanders on the kids in CPB custody.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly, that's an  absolutely tragic situation, something nobody ever wants to see happen.   It's one of the reasons that the president wants to fix our broken  immigration system.  It's a treacherous journey, and we don't want to see  people go that route.  We want people to come through than legal process so  that they are not putting their lives on the line to do this.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Matthew, if the negotiation is just calling it border security and  you don't call it a wall but you still get $2.5 billion to do it, is that a  solution?  Where are we?  Is it semantics now?  </p><p>CONTINETTI:  Semantics is probably the easiest solution, Bret.  But even  there, I'm very pessimistic about this being resolved anytime soon.  As  John McCormack noted, the Democrats have moved away from the president's  position.  Remember just earlier this month, we were talking about $1.6  billion that they were willing to grant him for border security.  Now they  are at zero, and they're making a big issue of the wall.</p><p>And of course, public opinion polls and the public in general also opposes  a wall as well as a shutdown, whereas President Trump of course is really  fighting for his supporters.  And he has strong support among the  Republican Party, and they want the wall.  So as long as these two  positions are kind of intractable, I don't think we're going to come to an  agreement anytime soon.  </p><p>BAIER:  Panel, stand by.  Next up, the biggest foreign policy stories of  the year, plus the winners and losers of 2018.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  You call people sometimes killers, he is a killer.  He's clearly  executing people.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's a tough guy.  He is a  very smart guy, and he's a great negotiator.  But I think we understand  each other.  </p><p>BAIER:  But he still has done some really bad things.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Yes, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  President Trump aboard Air Force One after the summit in Singapore.   What about the big foreign policy stories of 2018?  We are back with the  panel.  Matthew, that's yours, right?</p><p>CONTINETTI:  That's mine, the Singapore summit.  This was a watershed and  America's relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  North Korea.  For the president to meet with the North Korean dictator was  a huge story of 2018.  And it represented a thaw there in relations.  I  think, though, we have reached a stalling plant.  And that's why you see a  great urgency on the part of the president to restart this process of  negotiations leading to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible  denuclearization of North Korea.  </p><p>And yet despite all these entreaties from the American side, North Korea  has been silent, and everyone is saying to look for Kim Jong-un's new  year's message.  That is usually when he presents his big foreign policy  agenda.  He might say that a summit is on New Year's Day, but then again,  Bret, he may not.  </p><p>BAIER:  He has also fired missiles over that time period in the past, so we  shall see.  Now, as far as the withdrawal, take a listen to the president  Thursday and Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I didn't just pull them out.   I've been talking about it for a year and a half.  I've been telling the  generals let's go, go ahead, take more time.  It's not time for others to  take over there and fight.  We don't want to be there.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  The war has not yet been one.   The 2,200 in Syria are performing vital national security functions for us,  which include support for a key ally called the Kurds and is an insurance  policy against the rise of ISIS.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  John, biggest story for you?  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I thought the 2017 story of the year was the rollback of ISIS  by the United States and our allies in the region, and the 2018 story of  the year is President Trump's decision to completely pull out troops,  abandoning our Kurdish allies and potentially giving the ability for ISIS  to reconstitute itself and regroup.  It had echoes of President Obama's  decision to pull out of Iraq entirely, which led rise to ISIS in the first  place.  </p><p>BAIER:  Leslie, I know yours is the U.S.-Saudi relations, but let's start  with winners and losers of 2018.  Your winner, then loser for 2018.</p><p>MARSHALL:  You are starting with me.  OK, I would say, first of all, I'm  going to start with loser, if that's OK.  I want to end on a happier note.   The losers I think, quite frankly the migrant policy that we have right  now, the separation, these children, what it's led to not only physically  but emotionally for these children.</p><p>And winners, I'm going to say the American voters, because they came out in  record numbers and elected more women.  They voted for change.  We saw  people from various religions, from various sexual orientations and  backgrounds.  And I think we're going to see an extremely diverse Congress,  I know, coming up in the new year.  </p><p>BAIER:  Winners and losers, Matthew, of 2018?  </p><p>CONTINETTI:  My winners, Bret, are the Thai Navy Seals.  They rescue along  with some help from other countries including America, they were the ones  who rescued those 12 Thai boys trapped in that cave earlier this year.  It  was an uplifting story, some good news in a year filled with often negative  headlines.  </p><p>And my loser of the year is German chancellor Angela Merkel.  Merkel made  this big gamble in 2015 when she opened Germany's borders to about a  million migrants from the Muslim world, and she set in a chain of events  that led to her announcement just this past year that she will no longer  seek election as chancellor.  This is a huge story for European politics  and also I think world politics.  </p><p>BAIER:  John, your winner and loser of 2018?  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  Winner of the year would be Nikki Haley who is one of the few  if only members of this administration to leave this administration on good  terms with the president.  You saw her make her announcement in the Oval  Office, setting herself up very well for someone who could potentially  unite the party in 2024, who has the respect of the president's supporters  as well as many of a few of his critics in the Republican Party who thought  that she was a voice for American freedom at the United Nations and as well  as someone who would occasionally speak out and disagree with him publicly.  </p><p>My loser of the year is Chuck Schumer and all the Senate Democrats,  particularly those on the Judiciary Committee, for their handling of the  Brett Kavanaugh hearings.  They not only failed to stop President Trump  from getting a second conservative on the Supreme Court, the energized  Republican voters and lost a couple of Senate seats by bringing up a lot of  allegations, many of which were completely scurrilous.  They really didn't  do themselves any favors.  </p><p>BAIER:  Panel, thank you very much, happy New Year.  When we come back,  \"Notable Quotables.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Finally tonight, this is the last \"Notable Quotables\" of 2018.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So much for a Santa Claus rally on Wall Street.   Investigators getting a lump of coal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  An emphatic bounce back with the biggest single day  points gain ever for the Dow.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I can't tell you when the  government is going to be open.  I can tell you it's not going to be open  until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it.  </p><p>REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement.  And I think we had that until the president went off his  meds, and who the hell knows what happened.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Authorities are investigating the death of an eight- year-old Guatemalan boy in U.S. custody.  </p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly that's an absolutely  tragic situation.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-three-year-old Ronil Singh was gunned down at  1:00 a.m. Wednesday in the small town of Newman.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's not coming back.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's just too much chaos, too many crises going on.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Democrats need to step up to the plate.  It's up  to them to stop the shutdown.  </p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We sat down with Mr.  Schumer and gave him a number below five.  I'm not going to tell you what  it is.  Did I just say I was wasn't going to tell you what the number was?  </p><p>TRUMP:  We came to Al Asad to share our eternal gratitude for everything  you do to keep America safe, strong, and free.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much is happening in Washington as best I can tell.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Are you still a believer in Santa?  Because at seven it's marginal,  right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  One week, hard to believe.  </p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight and every night in 2018.  We  look forward to a great 2019 ahead.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good evening --  William.  </p><p> WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well Bret -- just  hours ago, police confirmed the arrest of 32-year-old Gustavo Perez  Arriaga, an illegal immigrant confirmed gang member and two-time convicted  drunk driver with outstanding warrants.</p><p> The California sheriff also confirming the arrest of two other illegal  immigrants -- a brother and co-worker who tried to cover up the whereabouts  of Arriaga as he allegedly tried to flee to Mexico.</p><p> But under aerial surveillance the Kern County attack team intercepted  Arriaga near Bakersfield where he surrendered without incident.</p><p> Arriaga is a Mexican national who entered the U.S. illegally in Arizona,  wanted for killing 33-year-old Ron Singh, a seven-year Newman Police  veteran who emigrated to the U.S. legally from Fiji.</p><p> Singh was married with a 5-month-old son.  He took this photo Christmas  Day, just hours before he and his K-9 partner stopped a possible drunk  driver.  Moments later Singh he radioed, \"shots fired.  I'm hit.\"  He died  a short time later.</p><p> Today his brother Reggie thanked police for finding the alleged killer.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGGIE SINGH, BROTHER OF OFFICER RONIL SINGH:  He's not coming back, but --  there is a lot of people out there that miss him and a lot of law  enforcement people that I don't know who work days and nights to make this  happen.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  Today in a news conference, the sheriff of Stanislaus County  threw gasoline on the already red-hot immigration debate by calling Singh's  death preventable, blaming the state sanctuary law for prohibiting police  from communicating with ICE about known and wanted felons.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  Let's go back to  Ron -- an immigrant immigrated here lawfully and illegally to pursue his  American dream.  He achieved that goal.  His dream was taken from him.</p><p> No, we shouldn't politicize it, but we have to have a conversation about  restrictive legislation that puts our communities at risk.  </p><p> SHERIFF DONNY YOUNGBLOOD, KERN COUNTY CALIFORNIA:  When you tie our hands  and don't allow us to work with our federal partners and communicate with  our federal partners about people that commit crimes who are in this  country illegally, we're going to have incidents like this.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LA JEUNESSE:  Police arrested three more today for aiding and abetting and  say they are helping prosecutors build a case against Arriaga, arraignment  likely next Wednesday.</p><p> Singh's narcotics dog, Sam, will be retired to live with his wife and child  -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  William -- thank you.</p><p> President Trump is threatening to seal the southern border if he doesn't  get funding for his wall as both sides dig in their heels over border  security.</p><p> Correspondent Ellison Barber is at the White House where the President is  as well this holiday weekend.  Good evening -- Ellison.</p><p> ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.</p><p> That's right.  A shutdown threat in the middle of the shutdown.  President  Trump saying without funding for a border wall, he might decide to close  the southern border entirely.</p><p> \"The United States loses so much money on trade with Mexico under NAFTA,\"  the President tweeted, \"that I would consider closing the southern border,  a profit making operation.  We build a wall or close the southern border.\"</p><p> Shutting down the southern border would cost us a billion dollars a day.   Is the President seriously willing to do that?  </p><p> MICK MULVANEY, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET DIRECTOR:  Yes he absolutely  is.  </p><p> BARBER:  But it's unclear if the President could legally closet the entire  southern border and if he did there would surely be legal challenges just  like with saw happen to so-called travel bans.  The President's budget  director and soon to be acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says it is not  an empty threat.  </p><p> MULVANEY:  All options are on the table.  Listen, it's the only way we can  get the Democrats' attention.  </p><p> BARBER:  According to the White House they offered Democrats a deal that is  less than President Trump's previous ask of $5 billion for border security  and a wall, but they say Democrats just walked away.  </p><p> MULVANEY:  That steel barrier that the President tweeted out, that's what  he wants to build.  The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a  wall, they offered us $1.3 billion to do that.  We countered with $5  billion.  They did not even counter us.  </p><p> BARBER:  More than anyone, administration officials blame House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p> MULVANEY:  Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats probably would cut a deal  but they are protecting Mrs. Pelosi.  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  She is unwilling to  actually do anything until she gets her speakership.  She's more willing to  protect that than she is to protect our borders and protect American lives.  </p><p> BARBER:  President Trump, who once said this -- </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get what we  want, I will shut down the government.  </p><p> BARBER:  Putting some blame on the Ninth Circuit, tweeting \"The reason the  DACA for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision  from the Ninth Circuit allowed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to  remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case.  After ruling Dems dropped  deal and that's where we are today.  Democrat obstruction of the needed  wall.</p><p> Yesterday a spokesperson for Pelosi said Democrats offered Republicans  three options to reopen the government and that all three included funding  for border security, but not the President's wall, which they described as  immoral, ineffective and expensive.</p><p> Meanwhile Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen traveled to the  southern border.  She said she wanted to see firsthand medical screenings  and conditions at border patrol stations after an 8-year-old died in the  custody of border patrol agents earlier this week.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARBER:  A preliminary autopsy conducted by officials in New Mexico  indicates that that young boy died of the flu.  He is the second child to  die this month while in the custody of border patrol -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  Ellison -- thank you.</p><p> As we head into the new year there are no signs of movement towards a deal  on funding a border wall.</p><p> Correspondent Peter Doocy has that part of the story for us from Capitol  Hill.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  As the government's partial drags on  along the Potomac, papers are piling up outside Mitch McConnell's office  and Nancy Pelosi is on an island in the Pacific spotted five time zones  away from the House in Hawaii shortly after she apparently left the White  House hanging as it pitched the spending they request for border wall  money.  </p><p> REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK:  House Democrats are in a bit of a bind.  I  don't think Nancy Pelosi wants to put any offer on the table until after  she's elected speaker.  And so that's holding her back.</p><p> DOOCY:  Part of Pelosi's leadership team is forecasting what she might  want.  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries tweeted today \"Day seven of the Trump  shut down.  Republicans continue to hold the American people hostage.  We  refuse to pay a $5 billion ransom note.  In other words, take a hike.\"</p><p> That $5 billion in border wall funding is stuck in the Senate where White  House ally Senator Lindsey Graham wrote today, \"To Nancy Pelosi and the  House Democrats -- no wall money, no deal.\"</p><p> So now, lawmakers are stuck or are they?</p><p> Senate leaders abandoned attempts to move the border wall bill because it  was so far short of the 60 votes needed to pass.  So some House lawmakers  are urging upper chamber colleagues to change the rules.  </p><p> REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R), TEXAS:  This is an emergency.  This is our  southern border.  This is the defense of our nation, the 60-vote rule, the  filibuster rule in the Senate should be suspended to allow this  appropriations bill to go forward.  </p><p> DOOCY:  But Democrats insist this dustup over dollars for the wall is just  a diversion.  </p><p> REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), RHODE ISLAND:  He wants a fight about this  because he wants to distract from the other very bad things that have  happened in the last two weeks.  </p><p> DOOCY:  Republican supporters of the wall in the House are starting to  think bigger like a trade -- funds for construction, in exchange for a fix  to help DACA recipients illegally brought to this country as young  children.</p><p> KING:  I think the Democrats should come back with their own offer now.  I  think there is room for negotiation and the President is willing to come  down on the dollar amount.  The Democrats should go along with the wall and  if the DACA is on the table, then let's do that.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOOCY:  There are no signs this partial shutdown will end during Paul  Ryan's final days as House Speaker.  And even though his name is still on  the door outside the speaker's office, we've watched just in the last few  minutes as staffers have started to wheel in desks and computers, because  by the time that many members get back, Nancy Pelosi's name will most  likely be on the door outside -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Peter Doocy, live on a lonely Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p>North Carolina's elections board dissolved today under court order without  certifying a winner in the states ninth congressional district race.  The  state elections board has refused to certify the race between Republican  Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready while it investigates absentee ballot  irregularities.</p><p> Harris holds a slim lead in unofficial results but officials are looking  into fraud allegations against an operative hired by the Harris campaign.</p><p> A mixed day on Wall Street today, the Dow was off 76.  The S&amp;P 500 slipped  three, the Nasdaq was up five.  For the week, the Dow was up 2.75 percent.   The S&amp;P 500 was up nearly three.  The Nasdaq finished ahead of nearly 4  percent.</p><p>Wells Fargo will pay more than half a billion dollars to settle an  investigation into a string of suspicious business practices.  The bank has  been under a cloud since 2015, when it acknowledged that employees had  opened millions of fake bank accounts for customers in order to meet sales  goals.  It has also said that it sold auto insurance and other financial  products to customers who didn't need them.  Wells Fargo has already been  ordered to pay more than $1 billion in penalties and face stricter  regulations.</p><p> A troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.  It may  have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.</p><p> And as Lucas Tomlinson reports from the Pentagon, the Trump  administration's new plan has support from a former senior Obama  administration official.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS PENTAGON PRODUCER:  Syrian forces moved to the  outskirts of a Kurdish held city captured from ISIS putting hundreds of  American troops in potential danger.  But Syrian President Bashar al  Assad's forces closed-in ten days after President Trump ordered the full  withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.</p><p> But the Kurds say they welcome the Syrian troops in Manbij as protection  against a potential Turkish invasion after their U.S. allies leave.   Turkey's president says he wants the Kurdish fighters out of the city  immediately.</p><p> RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator):  Our entire  aim is to make terror organizations leave the area.  If terror  organizations leave then there is no work left for us anyway.  Our  communications and relationships with both the United States, with  President Trump whom I spoke to recently and Russia continuous healthily  (ph).  </p><p> TOMLINSON:  President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria  following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month.  The  former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports  President Trump's decision to pull out.  \"Holding northeastern Syria would  not have enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from  Damascus, Tehran, or Moscow.  Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and  stabilization teams can reverse that.  We would do well to be humbler about  our abilities especially in the face of sustained widespread regional  hostility.\"</p><p> Seven years after the start of Syria's civil war, President Assad no longer  feels isolated.  Gulf states long opposed to his rule are coming back to  Damascus.  Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in Syria one  day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TOMLINSON:  U.S. officials tell me there is no immediate plan to withdraw  any American troops from Manbij, Syria.  The complete withdrawal from the  country could take months -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon.  Lucas -- thank you.</p><p> 2018 will end with another deadly protest along the Israeli border, and it  looks like those demonstrations will go into the new year.  </p><p> Correspondent Trey Yingst has our report.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Tear gas was deployed and sniper fire  rang out as Israeli forces fought to push back Palestinian protesters along  the Israel-Gaza border.  The demonstrators gathering for the 40th Friday in  a row to voice opposition to the Israeli blockade on the Gaza strip.</p><p> After four Palestinians were killed last Friday, Hamas, the group in  control of the Gaza Strip threatened to fire rockets and use sniper fire if  anyone was killed today.</p><p> According to the Palestinian health ministry, one person was killed, shot  in the head; and at least eight injured by live ammunition.  </p><p> YINGST:  Organizers of the protests say the fact that thousands showed up  despite the wind and rain is an indication of the persistence and  resilience that these demonstrators have.  And they will continue to push  forward until the Israeli blockade on Gaza is lifted.</p><p> With major grievances still taking place in Gaza regarding employment,  electricity and infrastructure the Friday gatherings are expected to  continue.  The demonstrations come as Egyptian negotiators are trying to  develop a long-term deal between Israel and Hamas that would avoid future  escalations.</p><p> Last month, a failed Israeli Special Forces operation inside Gaza led to an  exchange of rocket fire and air strikes between the two sides.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> YINGST:  A senior Hamas official told Fox News the deadly outcome of  today's border demonstrations will certainly factor into the group's  response -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Trey -- thank you.</p><p> Up next, how longer lives and having less children are leading to a rise in  populism.  We'll explain.</p><p> First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 13 in Seattle where a nationwide network outage caused the disruption  to 911 calls in western Washington.  The outages began Thursday from New  York to California.  The company behind the outages says the problem  involved a network element but would not elaborate.</p><p>Fox 7 in Austin where the nation's oldest living veteran with died  Thursday.  Richard Overton was born in 1906, served three years in the army  during World War II.  He credited his faith and cigars and whiskey for his  longevity.  Overton was 112 years old.</p><p> And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate, Fox 5.  The big  story there tonight, a transformer explosion that turned the night sky over  New York City an electric blue last night.  Kind of freaky, it looked like  an alien invasion.  An incredible sight according to the mayor's office  tweeting out that it was not aliens in fact but electrical surge at a  Queens substation.  The blue light eventually faded and at last check no  one was seen being taken away by a spaceship.</p><p> That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.  We'll  be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  A powerful winter storm continued to wreak havoc across the U.S.  today.  Blizzard conditions across the upper Midwest are being blamed for  at least three deadly car crashes while flash flooding in the south swept  away cars and forced dozens of water rescues.  The risk of flooding will  persist in parts of the south into next week, we are told.</p><p> A change in the makeup of American families is giving way to a rise in  populism, a trend that correspondent Doug McKelway shows us is working its  way across Europe.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TRUMP:  America first.  </p><p> DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The discontent behind the populism  that helped elect Donald Trump is at work across the world.  Europe's  creeping social welfare state marked by a protected status for older works,  early retirement, and an expansive social safety net has proved no match  for the demographic realities of low fertility rates.  </p><p> VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION:  Western societies that produce a  plethora of goods and services, and have excellent health care, that's a  Western tradition, then people live longer and life is better.  So they  want to enjoy it and unfortunately that means they don't want to put up  with child raising.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  The lowest fertility rate may be Greece -- 1.35 births per women  and not enough young people to pay for the elderly's benefits.  Europe,  Japan, and the U.S. seem unwilling to remedy it.  </p><p> HANSON:  That would require I think not a lot of sacrifice but enough  sacrifice that an affluent and (INAUDIBLE) society would find probably I  guess intolerable or politically impossible.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  Like the U.S., Europe has compensated for the birth dearth by  importing labor, a manageable solution to a point.  </p><p> MONICA DUFFY TOFT, INTERNATIONAL POLITICS PROFESSOR:  By the second or  third generation, these populations -- these non-native populations  acculturate or they sort of become part of the mainstream communities.  But  it takes a generation or two.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  Europe is a combination of refugees fleeing ISIS and the civil  war in Syria has proved a bridge too far.  </p><p> PHILIP COHEN, FAMILY SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR:  Immigration poses challenges to  the dominant culture.  It's obviously politically fraught.  </p><p> MCKELWAY:  From Greece, to Italy, Germany, France and the Nordic countries,  clashes have erupted.  Nationalist politicians are forcing a reckoning with  multiculturalism.  That while the Yellow Jacket rioting in France proves  there is a limit to how much citizens are willing to be taxed.  </p><p> On the other side of the globe, Japan is facing its own declining fertility  rate that has been traditionally resistant to immigrant labor.  One  potential solution there, robots may help to man factories, to care for the  elderly.  And in China, a demographic problem of its own making a  generation ago overpopulation compelled the communist government to force a  one-child policy on the populace.  </p><p> COHEN:  They included forced sterilization, abortion and very harsh  penalties for people who had extra children.  So it was really a human  rights disaster.</p><p> MCKELWAY:  And because male babies were favored today China faces a surplus  of 34 million single men.  Their widely distorted majority accompanies an  increase in crime, loneliness and prostitution among other societal ills  according to the \"Washington Post\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCKELWAY:  Ironically today, because of China's massive transformation into  an industrial powerhouse, it has become like the West, more affluent, a  place where a new generation of parents is less interested in reproducing - - Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Doug -- thank you.</p><p> Up next, a closer look at one court and whether some judges are upholding  the law or their own political beliefs.  We will take a look.</p><p> First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> The leaders of Germany and France are pressuring and pressing Russia to  release Ukrainian sailors captured more than a month ago in time for the  new year.</p><p> German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emanuel Macron made  the joint statement today while also vowing to keep up pressure for a peace  deal for Eastern Ukraine.  The Russian coast guard seized three Ukrainian  naval vessels and their crew back in November.</p><p> Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza  Pyramids killing at least three people and wounding ten others today.  The  country has battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first  attack to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.</p><p> Bad weather and heavy ash are hampering efforts to assess whether an  Indonesian volcano could trigger another deadly tsunami.  Authorities have  warned residents to stay away from the coastline there.  So far 426 people  have been confirmed killed in last weekend's tsunami but the search for  victims will continue into January.</p><p> Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.  We will be  right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  When it comes to cyber security, a year in review might highlight  the billions of people affected by data breaches or even questions over  bias and social media content. </p><p> But as correspondent Gillian Turner reports, some in Congress are hoping  2019 might bring more oversight and online security.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Members of Congress are using the  partial government shutdown as an opportunity to sharpen their knives as  they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year.</p><p> First up, regulating big tech.  Both sides of the aisle have their sights  set on the big three social media companies -- Facebook, Twitter and  Google-owned YouTube.  </p><p> REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans.   They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.  </p><p> SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA:  We have to put some rules of the  road in place.  They can't just say, if you trust us, we got your back.  </p><p> TURNER:  But not everyone wants the same thing.  Democrats want social  media companies to get rid of fake news after than they did in 2016 to  avoid foreign election interference.  Republicans want to hold the big  three accountable for anti-conservative bias.  One thing they can agree on,  both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign  season kicks off.</p><p> Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about, data  encryption.  Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like  Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake.  They are taking  cues from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.  He's been keeping this  issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refused to  decrypt their data for investigators.</p><p> \"Companies are in the business of generating profits.  I don't blame them  for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns.  But  it's important to understand that what is good for a technology company  isn't necessarily good for America.\"</p><p> Democrats are focused on protecting Americans' privacy.  They worry if  investigators can access any encrypted data they want it will lead to  abuses in the future.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TURNER:  2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users.   Breaches at Facebook, Twitter and Google alone resulted in 619 million user  accounts compromised and that's a conservative estimate.</p><p> Here's hoping 2019 is a bit more secure -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  You bet.  Gillian -- thanks.</p><p> TURNER:  You got it.</p><p> BAIER:  Misrepresenting your family pet as a service dog could cost you.   This January, Hawaii joins nearly two dozen states in fining folks who lie  about their pet.  At least 21 states have passed laws governing service  animals in an attempt to keep unruly pets out of grocery stores, movie  theaters and restaurants.</p><p> If a man asks a woman out on a date, and he is taller than she is, can that  be considered sexual harassment?  According to a former University of  Missouri vice chancellor, the answer is yes.  School officials suspended a  student for four years because they say his size and gender gave him power  over a female he pursued romantically.  That former student is now suing  the school for racial and sexual discrimination.  </p><p> Judges are supposed to remain impartial, but when they are appointed by a  president, is that possible?  Correspondent Dan Springer with a look  tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When U.S. District Court Judge Jon  Tigar blocked the Trump administration plan to bar asylum to any immigrant  not entering at the designated border crossing, President Trump railed  against who he called the Obama judge, which drew this response from  Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  \"We do not have Obama judges or  Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.  What we have is an  extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best.\"  Trump  tweeted back, \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but we do have Obama  judges, and they have a much different point of view than people who are  charged with the safety of our country.\" Court watchers say essentially  both men are right.  </p><p> JOEL ARD, FEDERALIST SOCIETY:  Presidents certainly hope that the judges  they nominate share their views and hold those views long after the  president is out of office, and I think the chief justice is correct that  the judges are independent, they are not beholden to the president who  nominates them.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  President Trump also bashed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  for not even hearing his appeal on the asylum ruling.  It has been a  frequent attack during a string of losses on immigration cases, from the  travel ban to sanctuary cities.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You go to the Ninth Circuit  and it's a disgrace.  And I'm going to put in a major complaint.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  Of the 41 sitting judges on the Ninth Circuit, 25 were nominated  by Democratic presidents, 16 by Republicans.  President Clinton picked the  most with 14 followed by Obama, George W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter.  Trump  now has two of the 23 active judges, but has nominated five more to current  vacancies.  </p><p> RORY LITTLE, LAW PROFESSOR:  It is soon going to be a Trump court.  It's  soon going to be not a majority of these 29 judges, but they're going to  have a substantial chunk.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SPRINGER:  Because Republicans control the Senate and only a simple  majority is needed to confirm federal judges, President Trump will reshape  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Whether future rulings are to his  liking depends on the questions at the heart of the Trump-Roberts debate,  exactly who gets confirmed, and how independent will they be?  Bret?</p><p> BAIER:  Dan, thank you.  </p><p> When we come back, the battle over the border wall is heading into the new  year.  First, we are sad to report the death of a FOX News regular, Bre  Payton.  A staff writer at \"The Federalist,\" frequent guest on our air,  died this morning after a friend says she was admitted to the hospital with  swine flu and possible meningitis.  Our condolences to her family.  Bre  Payton was only 26 years old.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We're still building the  barrier.  That's why the government is closed, is the president is not  willing to give up on the southern barrier.  But it makes sense to sit down  across the table when you're trying to negotiate with another party and see  if there is someplace in the middle between their five and our 1.3.  </p><p> REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement where a majority say yes.  And I think we had that until  the president went off his meds and who the hell knows what happened.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  The negotiations are still continuing, and there doesn't seem to be  any back and forth happening.  This as the arrest of a 33-year-old in  California.  The president tweeting, \"We will be forced to close the  southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us  money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws  that are country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  president who would approve!\"</p><p> As I mentioned, the arrest of the 33-year-old illegal immigrant, Gustavo  Perez Arriaga, a confirmed gang member according to sheriff's deputies out  there in California, two-time convicted drunk driver, and now charged with  killing a police officer out in California.  </p><p> Let's bring in our panel.  We'll see where things stand tonight.  Matthew  Continetti is editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Leslie  Marshall, Democratic strategist, and political writer John McCormack.  OK  John, your thoughts on where we are and how all these stories stack up  together?  </p><p> JOHN MCCORMACK, POLITICAL WRITER:  I think there's always a very strong  bias towards the status quo in these shutdowns.  That was true in 2013 when  Republicans wanted to defund Obamacare, that was true a year ago with  Senate Democrats wanted to get something done on DACA.  </p><p> With that said, I don't really see this resolving itself any time soon,  especially with this murderer out in California.  I think you are going to  see the president dig in.  And I wonder if changing sanctuary laws is going  to become more important in the short-term, something to be done on that,  than getting money for the wall.  But with that said, I think anything at  this point in terms of border security would count as something of a win  given the fact that usually during the shutdowns nothing much happens at  all.  </p><p> BAIER:  Here is the Stanislaus County sheriff about this whole incident.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SHERIFF:  We can't ignore  the fact that this could have been preventable.  And under SB-54 in  California, based on two arrests for DUI and of some other active warrants  that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been  prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this  criminal gang member.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Leslie, thoughts on all this?  </p><p> LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Well, obviously this weighs both,  whether you are Democrat or Republican, emotionally when a life has been  lost, a member of law enforcement, an outstanding member of our community  here in California.  I have had trouble with this law.  There are many  Democrats that have had trouble with this law.  Not that we have some kind  of a sanctuary city refuge, because we do want these individuals to help  law enforcement.  But we do want also for federal and state and local  police to be able to work together to keep our communities safe.</p><p> So I think quite frankly this is, especially in California, more of a  pressing issue, this state issue, than the border wall, which already has  bipartisan support to have repairs and to have more security, but not the  $5 billion for the steel slats that the president talks about.  </p><p> BAIER:  Matthew, it does not seem like there's going to be a quick  resolution to this, unless someone is willing to give.  Right now you can't  foresee that just listening to both sides.</p><p> MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON:  No, not at  all.  There is a difference, Bret, between the shutdown and earlier ones,  and that is this one started and has continued for the last week under  unified government.  Typically shutdowns are when the party in Congress is  different from the party of the president.  In this case it begins with  Republicans controlling both Congress and the presidency.</p><p> And I think that's leading to kind of the standstill in negotiations.  It's  hard to have a meeting of the minds when Nancy Pelosi is in Hawaii for the  holiday.  I think she is waiting until she comes into power next week and  so then she can begin the negotiations on her terms.  </p><p> And that of course is a problem for the president.  These short-term  shutdowns, we have about one week now, they tend to not have major effects  in the economy or in the American politics.  What happens, though, when the  shutdowns go for longer than say a week or two weeks, that stretch into a  third week, or perhaps longer than that, that's when you start having real  political costs in terms of people's bases starting to get nervous, and you  also have the economic costs, which in the state of the markets as they are  today, is something that the president probably doesn't want.  </p><p> BAIER:  John, we've talked about this -- 75 percent of the government has  already been funded because those spending bills have been passed.  There  are seven spending bills that are pending.  There is a possible solution  here in that Congress could come back and pass six of the seven, hold off  on the Department of Homeland Security that deals with border security and  the border wall, pass a continuing resolution for that.  But pass the other  six bills and get it to the president's desk and say, here, let's solve  this, but let's argue about DHS.</p><p> MCCORMACK:  I think that's entirely possible, but I still don't see  Democrats wanting to give in on the wall just because President Trump has  made it such a big campaign issue.  Democrats actually moved pretty very  far left on this issue.  Back in 2006 a number of them like Joe Biden,  Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, voted for 700 miles of fencing, but because  this has been such a big campaign promise of the president's, I don't think  that they're going to want to budge unless they get something really good  like DACA.  When this deal came up last time Democrats insisted that they  get a clean exchange for DACA and the wall.  It got hung up over this idea  of ending chain migration.  You bring in someone and then you bring in all  the relatives.  Whether they can get some clean deal, I think it's unlikely  at this point, but you never know.  </p><p> BAIER:  Last thing Leslie, the other story that's obviously is gaining a  lot of traction and also being talked about on the Democratic side a lot  are the two children who have died in U.S. custody along the border.  And  tragic, and horrible.  The immigration system down there trying to figure  out how best to deal with those children and the problems that they are  dealing with in illness also factoring into this giant equation.  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Absolutely.  And this is something, again, where it tugs on the  heartstrings of Americans regardless of what side of the isle you are on.   This speaks to the moral compass of our nation, and people are not  obviously in favor, not only of separating families, of children being put  in harm's way in any way, especially in the United States of America.  </p><p> But Bret, that's exactly why this should not go up.  We need comprehensive  immigration reform that's going to keep us safe and the majority of people  who come here illegally come by plane, not through the Mexican border.  And  we need something that not only will be so costly and a political issue  which is what I believe it is for the president, it's a campaign promise.   But that's something that is not only not going to be so costly and be a  political issue, which I believe this is for the president, because it  would be a political win, it's a campaign promise, but something the  American people want, which is bipartisan support, a multifaceted program  that comes up with comprehensive immigration reform that can help with  DACA, provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people that have  been here for decades already, and to handle the backlog that we have in  the courts, and to take care of these cases of people that are crying out  for amnesty currently at our border.</p><p> BAIER:  Here's Sarah Sanders on the kids in CPB custody.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly, that's an  absolutely tragic situation, something nobody ever wants to see happen.   It's one of the reasons that the president wants to fix our broken  immigration system.  It's a treacherous journey, and we don't want to see  people go that route.  We want people to come through than legal process so  that they are not putting their lives on the line to do this.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Matthew, if the negotiation is just calling it border security and  you don't call it a wall but you still get $2.5 billion to do it, is that a  solution?  Where are we?  Is it semantics now?  </p><p> CONTINETTI:  Semantics is probably the easiest solution, Bret.  But even  there, I'm very pessimistic about this being resolved anytime soon.  As  John McCormack noted, the Democrats have moved away from the president's  position.  Remember just earlier this month, we were talking about $1.6  billion that they were willing to grant him for border security.  Now they  are at zero, and they're making a big issue of the wall.</p><p> And of course, public opinion polls and the public in general also opposes  a wall as well as a shutdown, whereas President Trump of course is really  fighting for his supporters.  And he has strong support among the  Republican Party, and they want the wall.  So as long as these two  positions are kind of intractable, I don't think we're going to come to an  agreement anytime soon.  </p><p> BAIER:  Panel, stand by.  Next up, the biggest foreign policy stories of  the year, plus the winners and losers of 2018.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  You call people sometimes killers, he is a killer.  He's clearly  executing people.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's a tough guy.  He is a  very smart guy, and he's a great negotiator.  But I think we understand  each other.  </p><p> BAIER:  But he still has done some really bad things.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Yes, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  President Trump aboard Air Force One after the summit in Singapore.   What about the big foreign policy stories of 2018?  We are back with the  panel.  Matthew, that's yours, right?</p><p> CONTINETTI:  That's mine, the Singapore summit.  This was a watershed and  America's relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  North Korea.  For the president to meet with the North Korean dictator was  a huge story of 2018.  And it represented a thaw there in relations.  I  think, though, we have reached a stalling plant.  And that's why you see a  great urgency on the part of the president to restart this process of  negotiations leading to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible  denuclearization of North Korea.  </p><p> And yet despite all these entreaties from the American side, North Korea  has been silent, and everyone is saying to look for Kim Jong-un's new  year's message.  That is usually when he presents his big foreign policy  agenda.  He might say that a summit is on New Year's Day, but then again,  Bret, he may not.  </p><p> BAIER:  He has also fired missiles over that time period in the past, so we  shall see.  Now, as far as the withdrawal, take a listen to the president  Thursday and Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I didn't just pull them out.   I've been talking about it for a year and a half.  I've been telling the  generals let's go, go ahead, take more time.  It's not time for others to  take over there and fight.  We don't want to be there.</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  The war has not yet been one.   The 2,200 in Syria are performing vital national security functions for us,  which include support for a key ally called the Kurds and is an insurance  policy against the rise of ISIS.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  John, biggest story for you?  </p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I thought the 2017 story of the year was the rollback of ISIS  by the United States and our allies in the region, and the 2018 story of  the year is President Trump's decision to completely pull out troops,  abandoning our Kurdish allies and potentially giving the ability for ISIS  to reconstitute itself and regroup.  It had echoes of President Obama's  decision to pull out of Iraq entirely, which led rise to ISIS in the first  place.  </p><p> BAIER:  Leslie, I know yours is the U.S.-Saudi relations, but let's start  with winners and losers of 2018.  Your winner, then loser for 2018.</p><p> MARSHALL:  You are starting with me.  OK, I would say, first of all, I'm  going to start with loser, if that's OK.  I want to end on a happier note.   The losers I think, quite frankly the migrant policy that we have right  now, the separation, these children, what it's led to not only physically  but emotionally for these children.</p><p> And winners, I'm going to say the American voters, because they came out in  record numbers and elected more women.  They voted for change.  We saw  people from various religions, from various sexual orientations and  backgrounds.  And I think we're going to see an extremely diverse Congress,  I know, coming up in the new year.  </p><p> BAIER:  Winners and losers, Matthew, of 2018?  </p><p> CONTINETTI:  My winners, Bret, are the Thai Navy Seals.  They rescue along  with some help from other countries including America, they were the ones  who rescued those 12 Thai boys trapped in that cave earlier this year.  It  was an uplifting story, some good news in a year filled with often negative  headlines.  </p><p> And my loser of the year is German chancellor Angela Merkel.  Merkel made  this big gamble in 2015 when she opened Germany's borders to about a  million migrants from the Muslim world, and she set in a chain of events  that led to her announcement just this past year that she will no longer  seek election as chancellor.  This is a huge story for European politics  and also I think world politics.  </p><p> BAIER:  John, your winner and loser of 2018?  </p><p> MCCORMACK:  Winner of the year would be Nikki Haley who is one of the few  if only members of this administration to leave this administration on good  terms with the president.  You saw her make her announcement in the Oval  Office, setting herself up very well for someone who could potentially  unite the party in 2024, who has the respect of the president's supporters  as well as many of a few of his critics in the Republican Party who thought  that she was a voice for American freedom at the United Nations and as well  as someone who would occasionally speak out and disagree with him publicly.  </p><p> My loser of the year is Chuck Schumer and all the Senate Democrats,  particularly those on the Judiciary Committee, for their handling of the  Brett Kavanaugh hearings.  They not only failed to stop President Trump  from getting a second conservative on the Supreme Court, the energized  Republican voters and lost a couple of Senate seats by bringing up a lot of  allegations, many of which were completely scurrilous.  They really didn't  do themselves any favors.  </p><p> BAIER:  Panel, thank you very much, happy New Year.  When we come back,  \"Notable Quotables.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Finally tonight, this is the last \"Notable Quotables\" of 2018.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So much for a Santa Claus rally on Wall Street.   Investigators getting a lump of coal.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  An emphatic bounce back with the biggest single day  points gain ever for the Dow.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I can't tell you when the  government is going to be open.  I can tell you it's not going to be open  until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it.  </p><p> REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  We have to work at it until we get  to an agreement.  And I think we had that until the president went off his  meds, and who the hell knows what happened.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Authorities are investigating the death of an eight- year-old Guatemalan boy in U.S. custody.  </p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly that's an absolutely  tragic situation.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-three-year-old Ronil Singh was gunned down at  1:00 a.m. Wednesday in the small town of Newman.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's not coming back.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's just too much chaos, too many crises going on.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Democrats need to step up to the plate.  It's up  to them to stop the shutdown.  </p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  We sat down with Mr.  Schumer and gave him a number below five.  I'm not going to tell you what  it is.  Did I just say I was wasn't going to tell you what the number was?  </p><p> TRUMP:  We came to Al Asad to share our eternal gratitude for everything  you do to keep America safe, strong, and free.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not much is happening in Washington as best I can tell.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Are you still a believer in Santa?  Because at seven it's marginal,  right?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  One week, hard to believe.  </p><p> Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight and every night in 2018.  We  look forward to a great 2019 ahead.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Bret Baier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The suspect was caught just a few hours ago near Bakersfield, California after being on the run for two days. Investigators believe he is responsible for the murder of Newman police officer Ronil Singh who migrated to the U.S. legally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an emotional press conference late this afternoon, the Stanislaus county sheriff said Singh's death could have been prevented.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this happening as we head into a long weekend with a stalemate in the fight over border security.</p><p>We have Fox team coverage tonight. Correspondent Ellison Barber is at the White House where the President is threatening to close the U.S. border.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy is on Capitol Hill where members of Congress are not.</p><p>But we begin with national correspondent William La Jeunesse who is following all the latest developments from Los Angeles. Good evening -- William.</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well Bret -- just hours ago, police confirmed the arrest of 32-year-old Gustavo Perez Arriaga, an illegal immigrant confirmed gang member and two-time convicted drunk driver with outstanding warrants.</p><p>The California sheriff also confirming the arrest of two other illegal immigrants -- a brother and co-worker who tried to cover up the whereabouts of Arriaga as he allegedly tried to flee to Mexico.</p><p>But under aerial surveillance the Kern County attack team intercepted Arriaga near Bakersfield where he surrendered without incident.</p><p>Arriaga is a Mexican national who entered the U.S. illegally in Arizona, wanted for killing 33-year-old Ron Singh, a seven-year Newman Police veteran who emigrated to the U.S. legally from Fiji.</p><p>Singh was married with a 5-month-old son. He took this photo Christmas Day, just hours before he and his K-9 partner stopped a possible drunk driver. Moments later Singh he radioed, \"shots fired. I'm hit.\" He died a short time later.</p><p>Today his brother Reggie thanked police for finding the alleged killer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGGIE SINGH, BROTHER OF OFFICER RONIL SINGH: He's not coming back, but -- there is a lot of people out there that miss him and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't know who work days and nights to make this happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Today in a news conference, the sheriff of Stanislaus County threw gasoline on the already red-hot immigration debate by calling Singh's death preventable, blaming the state sanctuary law for prohibiting police from communicating with ICE about known and wanted felons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA: Let's go back to Ron -- an immigrant immigrated here lawfully and illegally to pursue his American dream. He achieved that goal. His dream was taken from him.</p><p>No, we shouldn't politicize it, but we have to have a conversation about restrictive legislation that puts our communities at risk.</p><p>SHERIFF DONNY YOUNGBLOOD, KERN COUNTY CALIFORNIA: When you tie our hands and don't allow us to work with our federal partners and communicate with our federal partners about people that commit crimes who are in this country illegally, we're going to have incidents like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Police arrested three more today for aiding and abetting and say they are helping prosecutors build a case against Arriaga, arraignment likely next Wednesday.</p><p>Singh's narcotics dog, Sam, will be retired to live with his wife and child -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: William -- thank you.</p><p>President Trump is threatening to seal the southern border if he doesn't get funding for his wall as both sides dig in their heels over border security.</p><p>Correspondent Ellison Barber is at the White House where the President is as well this holiday weekend. Good evening -- Ellison.</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret.</p><p>That's right. A shutdown threat in the middle of the shutdown. President Trump saying without funding for a border wall, he might decide to close the southern border entirely.</p><p>\"The United States loses so much money on trade with Mexico under NAFTA,\" the President tweeted, \"that I would consider closing the southern border, a profit making operation. We build a wall or close the southern border.\"</p><p>Shutting down the southern border would cost us a billion dollars a day. Is the President seriously willing to do that?</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET DIRECTOR: Yes he absolutely is.</p><p>BARBER: But it's unclear if the President could legally closet the entire southern border and if he did there would surely be legal challenges just like with saw happen to so-called travel bans. The President's budget director and soon to be acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says it is not an empty threat.</p><p>MULVANEY: All options are on the table. Listen, it's the only way we can get the Democrats' attention.</p><p>BARBER: According to the White House they offered Democrats a deal that is less than President Trump's previous ask of $5 billion for border security and a wall, but they say Democrats just walked away.</p><p>MULVANEY: That steel barrier that the President tweeted out, that's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall, they offered us $1.3 billion to do that. We countered with $5 billion. They did not even counter us.</p><p>BARBER: More than anyone, administration officials blame House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>MULVANEY: Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats probably would cut a deal but they are protecting Mrs. Pelosi.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: She is unwilling to actually do anything until she gets her speakership. She's more willing to protect that than she is to protect our borders and protect American lives.</p><p>BARBER: President Trump, who once said this --</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If we don't get what we want, I will shut down the government.</p><p>BARBER: Putting some blame on the Ninth Circuit, tweeting \"The reason the DACA for wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the Ninth Circuit allowed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling Dems dropped deal and that's where we are today. Democrat obstruction of the needed wall.</p><p>Yesterday a spokesperson for Pelosi said Democrats offered Republicans three options to reopen the government and that all three included funding for border security, but not the President's wall, which they described as immoral, ineffective and expensive.</p><p>Meanwhile Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen traveled to the southern border. She said she wanted to see firsthand medical screenings and conditions at border patrol stations after an 8-year-old died in the custody of border patrol agents earlier this week.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBER: A preliminary autopsy conducted by officials in New Mexico indicates that that young boy died of the flu. He is the second child to die this month while in the custody of border patrol -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Ellison -- thank you.</p><p>As we head into the new year there are no signs of movement towards a deal on funding a border wall.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy has that part of the story for us from Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As the government's partial drags on along the Potomac, papers are piling up outside Mitch McConnell's office and Nancy Pelosi is on an island in the Pacific spotted five time zones away from the House in Hawaii shortly after she apparently left the White House hanging as it pitched the spending they request for border wall money.</p><p>REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: House Democrats are in a bit of a bind. I don't think Nancy Pelosi wants to put any offer on the table until after she's elected speaker. And so that's holding her back.</p><p>DOOCY: Part of Pelosi's leadership team is forecasting what she might want. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries tweeted today \"Day seven of the Trump shut down. Republicans continue to hold the American people hostage. We refuse to pay a $5 billion ransom note. In other words, take a hike.\"</p><p>That $5 billion in border wall funding is stuck in the Senate where White House ally Senator Lindsey Graham wrote today, \"To Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats -- no wall money, no deal.\"</p><p>So now, lawmakers are stuck or are they?</p><p>Senate leaders abandoned attempts to move the border wall bill because it was so far short of the 60 votes needed to pass. So some House lawmakers are urging upper chamber colleagues to change the rules.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R), TEXAS: This is an emergency. This is our southern border. This is the defense of our nation, the 60-vote rule, the filibuster rule in the Senate should be suspended to allow this appropriations bill to go forward.</p><p>DOOCY: But Democrats insist this dustup over dollars for the wall is just a diversion.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D), RHODE ISLAND: He wants a fight about this because he wants to distract from the other very bad things that have happened in the last two weeks.</p><p>DOOCY: Republican supporters of the wall in the House are starting to think bigger like a trade -- funds for construction, in exchange for a fix to help DACA recipients illegally brought to this country as young children.</p><p>KING: I think the Democrats should come back with their own offer now. I think there is room for negotiation and the President is willing to come down on the dollar amount. The Democrats should go along with the wall and if the DACA is on the table, then let's do that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: There are no signs this partial shutdown will end during Paul Ryan's final days as House Speaker. And even though his name is still on the door outside the speaker's office, we've watched just in the last few minutes as staffers have started to wheel in desks and computers, because by the time that many members get back, Nancy Pelosi's name will most likely be on the door outside -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Peter Doocy, live on a lonely Capitol Hill. Peter -- thanks.</p><p>North Carolina's elections board dissolved today under court order without certifying a winner in the states ninth congressional district race. The state elections board has refused to certify the race between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready while it investigates absentee ballot irregularities.</p><p>Harris holds a slim lead in unofficial results but officials are looking into fraud allegations against an operative hired by the Harris campaign.</p><p>A mixed day on Wall Street today, the Dow was off 76. The S&amp;P 500 slipped three, the Nasdaq was up five. For the week, the Dow was up 2.75 percent. The S&amp;P 500 was up nearly three. The Nasdaq finished ahead of nearly 4 percent.</p><p>Wells Fargo will pay more than half a billion dollars to settle an investigation into a string of suspicious business practices. The bank has been under a cloud since 2015, when it acknowledged that employees had opened millions of fake bank accounts for customers in order to meet sales goals. It has also said that it sold auto insurance and other financial products to customers who didn't need them. Wells Fargo has already been ordered to pay more than $1 billion in penalties and face stricter regulations.</p><p>A troubling sign today for President Trump's withdrawal from Syria. It may have left an opening for Syria's president to regain some territory.</p><p>And as Lucas Tomlinson reports from the Pentagon, the Trump administration's new plan has support from a former senior Obama administration official.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS PENTAGON PRODUCER: Syrian forces moved to the outskirts of a Kurdish held city captured from ISIS putting hundreds of American troops in potential danger. But Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces closed-in ten days after President Trump ordered the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.</p><p>But the Kurds say they welcome the Syrian troops in Manbij as protection against a potential Turkish invasion after their U.S. allies leave. Turkey's president says he wants the Kurdish fighters out of the city immediately.</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): Our entire aim is to make terror organizations leave the area. If terror organizations leave then there is no work left for us anyway. Our communications and relationships with both the United States, with President Trump whom I spoke to recently and Russia continuous healthily (ph).</p><p>TOMLINSON: President Trump made the decision to pull out of Syria following a call with his Turkish counterpart earlier this month. The former U.S. ambassador to Syria under the Obama administration supports President Trump's decision to pull out. \"Holding northeastern Syria would not have enabled Washington to leverage any important concessions from Damascus, Tehran, or Moscow. Only Syrians, not U.S. troops and stabilization teams can reverse that. We would do well to be humbler about our abilities especially in the face of sustained widespread regional hostility.\"</p><p>Seven years after the start of Syria's civil war, President Assad no longer feels isolated. Gulf states long opposed to his rule are coming back to Damascus. Bahrain announced Friday it will reopen its embassy in Syria one day after the United Arab Emirates did the same.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOMLINSON: U.S. officials tell me there is no immediate plan to withdraw any American troops from Manbij, Syria. The complete withdrawal from the country could take months -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon. Lucas -- thank you.</p><p>2018 will end with another deadly protest along the Israeli border, and it looks like those demonstrations will go into the new year.</p><p>Correspondent Trey Yingst has our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tear gas was deployed and sniper fire rang out as Israeli forces fought to push back Palestinian protesters along the Israel-Gaza border. The demonstrators gathering for the 40th Friday in a row to voice opposition to the Israeli blockade on the Gaza strip.</p><p>After four Palestinians were killed last Friday, Hamas, the group in control of the Gaza Strip threatened to fire rockets and use sniper fire if anyone was killed today.</p><p>According to the Palestinian health ministry, one person was killed, shot in the head; and at least eight injured by live ammunition.</p><p>YINGST: Organizers of the protests say the fact that thousands showed up despite the wind and rain is an indication of the persistence and resilience that these demonstrators have. And they will continue to push forward until the Israeli blockade on Gaza is lifted.</p><p>With major grievances still taking place in Gaza regarding employment, electricity and infrastructure the Friday gatherings are expected to continue. The demonstrations come as Egyptian negotiators are trying to develop a long-term deal between Israel and Hamas that would avoid future escalations.</p><p>Last month, a failed Israeli Special Forces operation inside Gaza led to an exchange of rocket fire and air strikes between the two sides.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YINGST: A senior Hamas official told Fox News the deadly outcome of today's border demonstrations will certainly factor into the group's response -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Trey -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, how longer lives and having less children are leading to a rise in populism. We'll explain.</p><p>First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 13 in Seattle where a nationwide network outage caused the disruption to 911 calls in western Washington. The outages began Thursday from New York to California. The company behind the outages says the problem involved a network element but would not elaborate.</p><p>Fox 7 in Austin where the nation's oldest living veteran with died Thursday. Richard Overton was born in 1906, served three years in the army during World War II. He credited his faith and cigars and whiskey for his longevity. Overton was 112 years old.</p><p>And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate, Fox 5. The big story there tonight, a transformer explosion that turned the night sky over New York City an electric blue last night. Kind of freaky, it looked like an alien invasion. An incredible sight according to the mayor's office tweeting out that it was not aliens in fact but electrical surge at a Queens substation. The blue light eventually faded and at last check no one was seen being taken away by a spaceship.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: A powerful winter storm continued to wreak havoc across the U.S. today. Blizzard conditions across the upper Midwest are being blamed for at least three deadly car crashes while flash flooding in the south swept away cars and forced dozens of water rescues. The risk of flooding will persist in parts of the south into next week, we are told.</p><p>A change in the makeup of American families is giving way to a rise in populism, a trend that correspondent Doug McKelway shows us is working its way across Europe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: America first.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The discontent behind the populism that helped elect Donald Trump is at work across the world. Europe's creeping social welfare state marked by a protected status for older works, early retirement, and an expansive social safety net has proved no match for the demographic realities of low fertility rates.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Western societies that produce a plethora of goods and services, and have excellent health care, that's a Western tradition, then people live longer and life is better. So they want to enjoy it and unfortunately that means they don't want to put up with child raising.</p><p>MCKELWAY: The lowest fertility rate may be Greece -- 1.35 births per women and not enough young people to pay for the elderly's benefits. Europe, Japan, and the U.S. seem unwilling to remedy it.</p><p>HANSON: That would require I think not a lot of sacrifice but enough sacrifice that an affluent and (INAUDIBLE) society would find probably I guess intolerable or politically impossible.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Like the U.S., Europe has compensated for the birth dearth by importing labor, a manageable solution to a point.</p><p>MONICA DUFFY TOFT, INTERNATIONAL POLITICS PROFESSOR: By the second or third generation, these populations -- these non-native populations acculturate or they sort of become part of the mainstream communities. But it takes a generation or two.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Europe is a combination of refugees fleeing ISIS and the civil war in Syria has proved a bridge too far.</p><p>PHILIP COHEN, FAMILY SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR: Immigration poses challenges to the dominant culture. It's obviously politically fraught.</p><p>MCKELWAY: From Greece, to Italy, Germany, France and the Nordic countries, clashes have erupted. Nationalist politicians are forcing a reckoning with multiculturalism. That while the Yellow Jacket rioting in France proves there is a limit to how much citizens are willing to be taxed.</p><p>On the other side of the globe, Japan is facing its own declining fertility rate that has been traditionally resistant to immigrant labor. One potential solution there, robots may help to man factories, to care for the elderly. And in China, a demographic problem of its own making a generation ago overpopulation compelled the communist government to force a one-child policy on the populace.</p><p>COHEN: They included forced sterilization, abortion and very harsh penalties for people who had extra children. So it was really a human rights disaster.</p><p>MCKELWAY: And because male babies were favored today China faces a surplus of 34 million single men. Their widely distorted majority accompanies an increase in crime, loneliness and prostitution among other societal ills according to the \"Washington Post\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKELWAY: Ironically today, because of China's massive transformation into an industrial powerhouse, it has become like the West, more affluent, a place where a new generation of parents is less interested in reproducing - - Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Doug -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, a closer look at one court and whether some judges are upholding the law or their own political beliefs. We will take a look.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>The leaders of Germany and France are pressuring and pressing Russia to release Ukrainian sailors captured more than a month ago in time for the new year.</p><p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emanuel Macron made the joint statement today while also vowing to keep up pressure for a peace deal for Eastern Ukraine. The Russian coast guard seized three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crew back in November.</p><p>Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb hit a tourist bus near the Giza Pyramids killing at least three people and wounding ten others today. The country has battled Islamic militants for years but this is the first attack to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.</p><p>Bad weather and heavy ash are hampering efforts to assess whether an Indonesian volcano could trigger another deadly tsunami. Authorities have warned residents to stay away from the coastline there. So far 426 people have been confirmed killed in last weekend's tsunami but the search for victims will continue into January.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We will be right back.</p><p>BAIER: When it comes to cyber security, a year in review might highlight the billions of people affected by data breaches or even questions over bias and social media content.</p><p>But as correspondent Gillian Turner reports, some in Congress are hoping 2019 might bring more oversight and online security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Members of Congress are using the partial government shutdown as an opportunity to sharpen their knives as they gear up for two big cyber battles in the new year.</p><p>First up, regulating big tech. Both sides of the aisle have their sights set on the big three social media companies -- Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube.</p><p>REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS: We are playing second fiddle to the Europeans. They protect the privacy of their folks more than we do.</p><p>SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: We have to put some rules of the road in place. They can't just say, if you trust us, we got your back.</p><p>TURNER: But not everyone wants the same thing. Democrats want social media companies to get rid of fake news after than they did in 2016 to avoid foreign election interference. Republicans want to hold the big three accountable for anti-conservative bias. One thing they can agree on, both parties want new legislation on the book before the 2020 campaign season kicks off.</p><p>Another issue, most Americans probably haven't heard too much about, data encryption. Republicans want legislation that forces tech companies like Apple to decrypt data when national security is at stake. They are taking cues from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein. He's been keeping this issue in the spotlight, recently rebuking tech companies that refused to decrypt their data for investigators.</p><p>\"Companies are in the business of generating profits. I don't blame them for failing to consider law enforcement and public safety concerns. But it's important to understand that what is good for a technology company isn't necessarily good for America.\"</p><p>Democrats are focused on protecting Americans' privacy. They worry if investigators can access any encrypted data they want it will lead to abuses in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER: 2018 was a tough year for social media platforms and their users. Breaches at Facebook, Twitter and Google alone resulted in 619 million user accounts compromised and that's a conservative estimate.</p><p>Here's hoping 2019 is a bit more secure -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: You bet. Gillian -- thanks.</p><p>TURNER: You got it.</p><p>BAIER: Misrepresenting your family pet as a service dog could cost you. This January, Hawaii joins nearly two dozen states in fining folks who lie about their pet. At least 21 states have passed laws governing service animals in an attempt to keep unruly pets out of grocery stores, movie theaters and restaurants.</p><p>If a man asks a woman out on a date, and he is taller than she is, can that be considered sexual harassment? According to a former University of Missouri vice chancellor, the answer is yes. School officials suspended a student for four years because they say his size and gender gave him power over a female he pursued romantically. That former student is now suing the school for racial and sexual discrimination.</p><p>Judges are supposed to remain impartial, but when they are appointed by a president, is that possible? Correspondent Dan Springer with a look tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: When U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar blocked the Trump administration plan to bar asylum to any immigrant not entering at the designated border crossing, President Trump railed against who he called the Obama judge, which drew this response from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best.\" Trump tweeted back, \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but we do have Obama judges, and they have a much different point of view than people who are charged with the safety of our country.\" Court watchers say essentially both men are right.</p><p>JOEL ARD, FEDERALIST SOCIETY: Presidents certainly hope that the judges they nominate share their views and hold those views long after the president is out of office, and I think the chief justice is correct that the judges are independent, they are not beholden to the president who nominates them.</p><p>SPRINGER: President Trump also bashed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for not even hearing his appeal on the asylum ruling. It has been a frequent attack during a string of losses on immigration cases, from the travel ban to sanctuary cities.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You go to the Ninth Circuit and it's a disgrace. And I'm going to put in a major complaint.</p><p>SPRINGER: Of the 41 sitting judges on the Ninth Circuit, 25 were nominated by Democratic presidents, 16 by Republicans. President Clinton picked the most with 14 followed by Obama, George W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter. Trump now has two of the 23 active judges, but has nominated five more to current vacancies.</p><p>RORY LITTLE, LAW PROFESSOR: It is soon going to be a Trump court. It's soon going to be not a majority of these 29 judges, but they're going to have a substantial chunk.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPRINGER: Because Republicans control the Senate and only a simple majority is needed to confirm federal judges, President Trump will reshape the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Whether future rulings are to his liking depends on the questions at the heart of the Trump-Roberts debate, exactly who gets confirmed, and how independent will they be? Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Dan, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, the battle over the border wall is heading into the new year. First, we are sad to report the death of a FOX News regular, Bre Payton. A staff writer at \"The Federalist,\" frequent guest on our air, died this morning after a friend says she was admitted to the hospital with swine flu and possible meningitis. Our condolences to her family. Bre Payton was only 26 years old.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We're still building the barrier. That's why the government is closed, is the president is not willing to give up on the southern barrier. But it makes sense to sit down across the table when you're trying to negotiate with another party and see if there is someplace in the middle between their five and our 1.3.</p><p>REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: We have to work at it until we get to an agreement where a majority say yes. And I think we had that until the president went off his meds and who the hell knows what happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The negotiations are still continuing, and there doesn't seem to be any back and forth happening. This as the arrest of a 33-year-old in California. The president tweeting, \"We will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that are country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress and president who would approve!\"</p><p>As I mentioned, the arrest of the 33-year-old illegal immigrant, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, a confirmed gang member according to sheriff's deputies out there in California, two-time convicted drunk driver, and now charged with killing a police officer out in California.</p><p>Let's bring in our panel. We'll see where things stand tonight. Matthew Continetti is editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and political writer John McCormack. OK John, your thoughts on where we are and how all these stories stack up together?</p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, POLITICAL WRITER: I think there's always a very strong bias towards the status quo in these shutdowns. That was true in 2013 when Republicans wanted to defund Obamacare, that was true a year ago with Senate Democrats wanted to get something done on DACA.</p><p>With that said, I don't really see this resolving itself any time soon, especially with this murderer out in California. I think you are going to see the president dig in. And I wonder if changing sanctuary laws is going to become more important in the short-term, something to be done on that, than getting money for the wall. But with that said, I think anything at this point in terms of border security would count as something of a win given the fact that usually during the shutdowns nothing much happens at all.</p><p>BAIER: Here is the Stanislaus County sheriff about this whole incident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SHERIFF: We can't ignore the fact that this could have been preventable. And under SB-54 in California, based on two arrests for DUI and of some other active warrants that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this criminal gang member.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, thoughts on all this?</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well, obviously this weighs both, whether you are Democrat or Republican, emotionally when a life has been lost, a member of law enforcement, an outstanding member of our community here in California. I have had trouble with this law. There are many Democrats that have had trouble with this law. Not that we have some kind of a sanctuary city refuge, because we do want these individuals to help law enforcement. But we do want also for federal and state and local police to be able to work together to keep our communities safe.</p><p>So I think quite frankly this is, especially in California, more of a pressing issue, this state issue, than the border wall, which already has bipartisan support to have repairs and to have more security, but not the $5 billion for the steel slats that the president talks about.</p><p>BAIER: Matthew, it does not seem like there's going to be a quick resolution to this, unless someone is willing to give. Right now you can't foresee that just listening to both sides.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: No, not at all. There is a difference, Bret, between the shutdown and earlier ones, and that is this one started and has continued for the last week under unified government. Typically shutdowns are when the party in Congress is different from the party of the president. In this case it begins with Republicans controlling both Congress and the presidency.</p><p>And I think that's leading to kind of the standstill in negotiations. It's hard to have a meeting of the minds when Nancy Pelosi is in Hawaii for the holiday. I think she is waiting until she comes into power next week and so then she can begin the negotiations on her terms.</p><p>And that of course is a problem for the president. These short-term shutdowns, we have about one week now, they tend to not have major effects in the economy or in the American politics. What happens, though, when the shutdowns go for longer than say a week or two weeks, that stretch into a third week, or perhaps longer than that, that's when you start having real political costs in terms of people's bases starting to get nervous, and you also have the economic costs, which in the state of the markets as they are today, is something that the president probably doesn't want.</p><p>BAIER: John, we've talked about this -- 75 percent of the government has already been funded because those spending bills have been passed. There are seven spending bills that are pending. There is a possible solution here in that Congress could come back and pass six of the seven, hold off on the Department of Homeland Security that deals with border security and the border wall, pass a continuing resolution for that. But pass the other six bills and get it to the president's desk and say, here, let's solve this, but let's argue about DHS.</p><p>MCCORMACK: I think that's entirely possible, but I still don't see Democrats wanting to give in on the wall just because President Trump has made it such a big campaign issue. Democrats actually moved pretty very far left on this issue. Back in 2006 a number of them like Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, voted for 700 miles of fencing, but because this has been such a big campaign promise of the president's, I don't think that they're going to want to budge unless they get something really good like DACA. When this deal came up last time Democrats insisted that they get a clean exchange for DACA and the wall. It got hung up over this idea of ending chain migration. You bring in someone and then you bring in all the relatives. Whether they can get some clean deal, I think it's unlikely at this point, but you never know.</p><p>BAIER: Last thing Leslie, the other story that's obviously is gaining a lot of traction and also being talked about on the Democratic side a lot are the two children who have died in U.S. custody along the border. And tragic, and horrible. The immigration system down there trying to figure out how best to deal with those children and the problems that they are dealing with in illness also factoring into this giant equation.</p><p>MARSHALL: Absolutely. And this is something, again, where it tugs on the heartstrings of Americans regardless of what side of the isle you are on. This speaks to the moral compass of our nation, and people are not obviously in favor, not only of separating families, of children being put in harm's way in any way, especially in the United States of America.</p><p>But Bret, that's exactly why this should not go up. We need comprehensive immigration reform that's going to keep us safe and the majority of people who come here illegally come by plane, not through the Mexican border. And we need something that not only will be so costly and a political issue which is what I believe it is for the president, it's a campaign promise. But that's something that is not only not going to be so costly and be a political issue, which I believe this is for the president, because it would be a political win, it's a campaign promise, but something the American people want, which is bipartisan support, a multifaceted program that comes up with comprehensive immigration reform that can help with DACA, provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people that have been here for decades already, and to handle the backlog that we have in the courts, and to take care of these cases of people that are crying out for amnesty currently at our border.</p><p>BAIER: Here's Sarah Sanders on the kids in CPB custody.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly, that's an absolutely tragic situation, something nobody ever wants to see happen. It's one of the reasons that the president wants to fix our broken immigration system. It's a treacherous journey, and we don't want to see people go that route. We want people to come through than legal process so that they are not putting their lives on the line to do this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Matthew, if the negotiation is just calling it border security and you don't call it a wall but you still get $2.5 billion to do it, is that a solution? Where are we? Is it semantics now?</p><p>CONTINETTI: Semantics is probably the easiest solution, Bret. But even there, I'm very pessimistic about this being resolved anytime soon. As John McCormack noted, the Democrats have moved away from the president's position. Remember just earlier this month, we were talking about $1.6 billion that they were willing to grant him for border security. Now they are at zero, and they're making a big issue of the wall.</p><p>And of course, public opinion polls and the public in general also opposes a wall as well as a shutdown, whereas President Trump of course is really fighting for his supporters. And he has strong support among the Republican Party, and they want the wall. So as long as these two positions are kind of intractable, I don't think we're going to come to an agreement anytime soon.</p><p>BAIER: Panel, stand by. Next up, the biggest foreign policy stories of the year, plus the winners and losers of 2018.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: You call people sometimes killers, he is a killer. He's clearly executing people.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's a tough guy. He is a very smart guy, and he's a great negotiator. But I think we understand each other.</p><p>BAIER: But he still has done some really bad things.</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: President Trump aboard Air Force One after the summit in Singapore. What about the big foreign policy stories of 2018? We are back with the panel. Matthew, that's yours, right?</p><p>CONTINETTI: That's mine, the Singapore summit. This was a watershed and America's relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea. For the president to meet with the North Korean dictator was a huge story of 2018. And it represented a thaw there in relations. I think, though, we have reached a stalling plant. And that's why you see a great urgency on the part of the president to restart this process of negotiations leading to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.</p><p>And yet despite all these entreaties from the American side, North Korea has been silent, and everyone is saying to look for Kim Jong-un's new year's message. That is usually when he presents his big foreign policy agenda. He might say that a summit is on New Year's Day, but then again, Bret, he may not.</p><p>BAIER: He has also fired missiles over that time period in the past, so we shall see. Now, as far as the withdrawal, take a listen to the president Thursday and Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't just pull them out. I've been talking about it for a year and a half. I've been telling the generals let's go, go ahead, take more time. It's not time for others to take over there and fight. We don't want to be there.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: The war has not yet been one. The 2,200 in Syria are performing vital national security functions for us, which include support for a key ally called the Kurds and is an insurance policy against the rise of ISIS.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: John, biggest story for you?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I thought the 2017 story of the year was the rollback of ISIS by the United States and our allies in the region, and the 2018 story of the year is President Trump's decision to completely pull out troops, abandoning our Kurdish allies and potentially giving the ability for ISIS to reconstitute itself and regroup. It had echoes of President Obama's decision to pull out of Iraq entirely, which led rise to ISIS in the first place.</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, I know yours is the U.S.-Saudi relations, but let's start with winners and losers of 2018. Your winner, then loser for 2018.</p><p>MARSHALL: You are starting with me. OK, I would say, first of all, I'm going to start with loser, if that's OK. I want to end on a happier note. The losers I think, quite frankly the migrant policy that we have right now, the separation, these children, what it's led to not only physically but emotionally for these children.</p><p>And winners, I'm going to say the American voters, because they came out in record numbers and elected more women. They voted for change. We saw people from various religions, from various sexual orientations and backgrounds. And I think we're going to see an extremely diverse Congress, I know, coming up in the new year.</p><p>BAIER: Winners and losers, Matthew, of 2018?</p><p>CONTINETTI: My winners, Bret, are the Thai Navy Seals. They rescue along with some help from other countries including America, they were the ones who rescued those 12 Thai boys trapped in that cave earlier this year. It was an uplifting story, some good news in a year filled with often negative headlines.</p><p>And my loser of the year is German chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel made this big gamble in 2015 when she opened Germany's borders to about a million migrants from the Muslim world, and she set in a chain of events that led to her announcement just this past year that she will no longer seek election as chancellor. This is a huge story for European politics and also I think world politics.</p><p>BAIER: John, your winner and loser of 2018?</p><p>MCCORMACK: Winner of the year would be Nikki Haley who is one of the few if only members of this administration to leave this administration on good terms with the president. You saw her make her announcement in the Oval Office, setting herself up very well for someone who could potentially unite the party in 2024, who has the respect of the president's supporters as well as many of a few of his critics in the Republican Party who thought that she was a voice for American freedom at the United Nations and as well as someone who would occasionally speak out and disagree with him publicly.</p><p>My loser of the year is Chuck Schumer and all the Senate Democrats, particularly those on the Judiciary Committee, for their handling of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. They not only failed to stop President Trump from getting a second conservative on the Supreme Court, the energized Republican voters and lost a couple of Senate seats by bringing up a lot of allegations, many of which were completely scurrilous. They really didn't do themselves any favors.</p><p>BAIER: Panel, thank you very much, happy New Year. When we come back, \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, this is the last \"Notable Quotables\" of 2018.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So much for a Santa Claus rally on Wall Street. Investigators getting a lump of coal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An emphatic bounce back with the biggest single day points gain ever for the Dow.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I can't tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it.</p><p>REP. JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: We have to work at it until we get to an agreement. And I think we had that until the president went off his meds, and who the hell knows what happened.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Authorities are investigating the death of an eight- year-old Guatemalan boy in U.S. custody.</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly that's an absolutely tragic situation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thirty-three-year-old Ronil Singh was gunned down at 1:00 a.m. Wednesday in the small town of Newman.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's not coming back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's just too much chaos, too many crises going on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Democrats need to step up to the plate. It's up to them to stop the shutdown.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We sat down with Mr. Schumer and gave him a number below five. I'm not going to tell you what it is. Did I just say I was wasn't going to tell you what the number was?</p><p>TRUMP: We came to Al Asad to share our eternal gratitude for everything you do to keep America safe, strong, and free.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not much is happening in Washington as best I can tell.</p><p>TRUMP: Are you still a believer in Santa? Because at seven it's marginal, right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: One week, hard to believe.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight and every night in 2018.

It is also home to a who's who of Canadian business and society, including former publishing magnate Conrad Black and Macao Casino billionaire Stanley Ho, who keeps a home in the neighborhood.</p><p>According to property listings website Zolo.ca, the Bridle Path home features at least six bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, includes a home theatre and indoor pool, and is more than 5,000 square feet. It was sold on Aug. 27, 2014 for $14.2 million.</p><p>A listing on a hotel comparison website describes the address as a \"luxury home\" that showcases a sauna, an indoor pool, a private garden, and an elevator.</p><p>Physician Ghafouri says he and other neighbours have complained to the city over the last several years about noise coming from the home.</p><p>\"Sometimes we can't sleep, so we just sit downstairs in the family room because the music is so loud, it goes till 3 a.m. or after. And my backyard sometimes reeks of marijuana,\" he says. The city informed him that they were investigating, but so far there has been no action.</p><p>Another resident, who didn't wish to be named, says she has been complaining to the city for more than a year about noise and traffic emanating from the rental of the home.</p><p>\"It's scary when people come into your neighbourhood and they start trashing the place. Litter is a real problem.\"</p><p>The incident is not surprising, according to Thorben Wieditz, spokesperson for Fairbnb, a coalition of tenants' groups, condo associations, rental landlords and hotel groups advocating for fairer rules regarding short-term rentals.</p><p>Wieditz said the fact that the shooting took place in the Bridle Path, where the annual average household income is $936,137 as of 2014, shows just how much Airbnb's accountability and rating system is not up to preventing these type of issues.</p><p>\"Airbnb should remove all multiple listing houses,\" Wieditz said. \"These properties are full-time commercial hotel operations.\" While Wieditz did not have knowledge of this listing specifically, he added that violent incidents \"increase exponentially\" when it comes to absentee landlords who pick up dozens of properties for the sole purpose of taking them off the long-term market for short-term use.</p><p>Ilya Ba\u00f1ares is a breaking news reporter, working out of the Star's radio room in Toronto.

I'm Steve Hilton and this is the home of positive populism, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we'll bring you more from my conversation at the White House with President Trump -- a part of it that we couldn't quite squeeze into last week's show. Plus an exclusive interview with legendary wrestling entrepreneur and until very recently member of the Trump Cabinet, Linda McMahon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But tonight I want to start with three letters that just about sum up how I've been feeling. No doubt you, too, as I watched with increasing disbelief this week -- the idiotic, infantile, irresponsible antics of the Democrats in Washington and their lackeys in the establishment state media -- F-F-S. That's what I found myself yelling at the television all week F- F-S.</p><p>I'm not allowed to spell it out, but if you don't know what it means, you can look it up. That's what I felt when I saw every ludicrous and melodramatic cynical statement, \"Oh for F's sake, Pelosi, what are you talking about? Cover up?\" Cover up of what? Your own precious Mueller found no crime. For F's sake, Nadler, you're the one holding the Constitution in contempt. Do you even understand what the separation of powers is? Do you care?</p><p>What do they even mean impeach the President? Impeach him for what? Winning an election they thought was theirs by right? What is it exactly that they want to investigate? What do they want to get to the bottom of with their endless spurious subpoenas and hearings? The bottom of the barrel? They're already there.</p><p>In all the hours wasted on this, hours when we could be talking about real things that affect the real lives of real Americans, not a single person, not the politicians, not the news anchors, not the pundits, none of them spend a single second talking about anything of actual substance that might justify all this manufactured scandal.</p><p>It's all about the process -- the political theater. The Washington D.C., political and media establishment have lost their minds. They are consumed with our own pathetic psychodrama, one that is utterly irrelevant to the rest of the country, but which has foisted on us anyway. What is the point of any of this except to indulge the demented rage of the resistance fanatics, outdoing each other in shrieking at President Trump?</p><p>If there's any justice, we would kick the lot of them and replace them with normal people who can calmly work with each other and the President to get things done.</p><p>I sent out a tweet last week which seemed to strike a chord. So here it is, again. \"Nancy Pelosi is a disingenuous charlatan, throws around Watergate-style cover-up accusations then blames Trump for not being cooperative. She is recklessly undermining faith in our democracy institutions and for what? To pander to her base. She is the one who should be impeached.\"</p><p>Right? Allow me to elaborate. All of this madness will come back to haunt Pelosi and Nadler and Schiff and Maxine Waters and all the rest of them.</p><p>The fury of the half of the country whose votes for this President are being scorned on a daily basis by Democrats who refuse to accept the result of the 2016 election and want to overturn it through undemocratic means, the fury of those millions of Americans, it will be visited on the Democrats that I can tell you.</p><p>People will not forget the way these self-righteous tyrants behaved. Vengeance will come. If impeachment is now the way to pursue political differences, all right then, let's impeach Pelosi and Nadler. They're doing more damage to our democracy than Donald Trump has ever done.</p><p>If total all out investigation is now the chosen tactic to obstruct political opponents, all right, then let's make sure it's applied with equal force to the Democrats. Let's get Nancy Pelosi's tax returns and her husband's while we're at it, and Maxine Waters' bank statements, that'll be fun considering she was once found to be the most corrupt Member of Congress.</p><p>Speaking of corruption, don't forget Jerry Nadler. He is up to his neck in it with a decades' long track record of taking money from businesses where he has a clear conflict of interest.</p><p>Let's get the Southern District of New York on to him. But we've got to pay it forward, too. One day, there will be another Democratic President and that person, whoever they are, must be crippled right out of the gate by the full weight of investigatory power. No honeymoon, no cooperation, just resistance, obstruction and vilification. That must be the fate of the next Democratic President. It's only fair.</p><p>President Trump says this should never happen to another President again; well, that is certainly magnanimous of him. But I think it needs qualification. He is right about the long term, but before we move on, before we return to normal, a debt must be paid by the Democrats. They must go through the exact same process they've put this President through, it's only fair. It's what justice demands.</p><p>And then, once they have received a taste of their own medicine, once the Democratic debt has been repaid, perhaps then we can return to a more civilized state of affairs.</p><p>Tell me what you think of that @SteveHiltonX and @NextRevFNC.</p><p>Now, let's meet our guests for tonight. Fox News contributor Sara Carter, and Turning Point USA founder, Charlie Kirk, who is also the host of the fantastic new \"Charlie Kirk Podcast.\"</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: That's correct.</p><p>HILTON: Very good. Okay, so I don't know, I'm steamed up about everything. I think half the country is, too. What do you think?</p><p>SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's fantastic what you said. I was talking to someone today who had said the same thing. Let's just put everything out on the line, put all the cards on the table. Let's investigate the Democrats, too.</p><p>If they want to investigate President Trump, let's not just stop with them, Steve. Let's not just stop with them. Let's investigate their families, their children, their connections, how did they handle money? Did they meet people while they were in office?</p><p>How is it possible that people like Maxine Waters come into office with a relatively normal bank account and leave with millions of dollars? Or Nancy Pelosi and her business dealings with her husband?</p><p>So let's just put the cards out on the table. They want to investigate Trump. Let's investigate every single one of them and their children and any family members that live with them and any business dealings that they have overseas.</p><p>KIRK: Speaking of their children, Hunter Biden, I mean, under this sort of microscope that they have put our friend, Donald Trump, Jr. under for taking a singular meeting of which nothing resulted back in June of 2016. Let's put that microscope of 1/100 under Hunter Biden.</p><p>And you've covered this brilliantly, Steve. You look at what their family did to this country, to sell our interest to our greatest enemy, China, so they could line their own pockets. Let the investigations begin now.</p><p>Republicans have the Senate. There could be investigation starting about how Nancy Pelosi had met with Bashar Al-Assad's father back in 2007 ...</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>KIRK: ... for foreign inclusion. You want to talk about all of this foreign collusion? Boy, are they going to go down a very dangerous path.</p><p>HILTON: Charlie, you're right, and sorry, Charlie, to cut you off, but I mean, that's such a great point about the Biden's in China, because it shows you how partisan this whole thing is.</p><p>KIRK: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: If they really cared about democracy and the Constitution and doing things the proper way and holding the Executive to account --</p><p>KIRK: Absolutely.</p><p>HILTON: They would absolutely be investigating that Biden family connection with China.</p><p>CARTER: Biden family connections with China, Hillary Clinton's connections with China, with Ukraine, with others with Russia. Let's look at all of it.</p><p>I mean, we seem to forget that Bill Clinton -- and I bring this up over and over again from Renaissance Capital Bank, which is basically run by the FSB.</p><p>KIRK: Yes, half a million dollars.</p><p>CARTER: Yes, which is basically run by Russian spies, got half a million dollars to speak. To speak about what? He was supporting the Uranium One deal back then in 2010. This is just crazy. So let's do it. Let's put the cards on the table. I think the Democrats would agree. They want full honesty.</p><p>That's what they said. They want everything out in the public. Let's get their taxes going back six years. Let's investigate. You know what? Let's go one step further, Steve. Let's find out about all the #MeToo money, all the hush money in Congress.</p><p>KIRK: $17 million.</p><p>CARTER: Yes, in Congress that was paid out and find out who those congressional representatives were. Let's just -- let's just clean it all out.</p><p>KIRK: So Steve, you really struck a chord with me, because I'm hearing a lot of Republicans say we have to move on and forgiveness is a virtue of which I tried to have, but I'm not there yet. I want justice for what that they've put this President through.</p><p>HILTON: That's right.</p><p>KIRK: And maybe I'll get to a place where we're ready to move on, but not right now. Because these people gallivant around, and they virtue signal towards this President. He has been the most transparent, most successful President of our lifetime.</p><p>We know exactly where he is, the meetings that he has. Everything is so transparent with him, and then they're the ones that are saying that he is engaging in a cover-up. Steve, I totally agree that we need to now investigate the investigators, but hold the very same people ...</p><p>CARTER: Absolutely.</p><p>KIRK: ... that have been preaching against this administration to this standard of foreign corruption and influence.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. That's why I am so intrigued because I felt this week when, you know, I mean, we are going to talk about it later the interview I had with President Trump last Sunday. You know, he is talking about policy, serious issues, China -- the debate was a serious debate.</p><p>And then immediately, it's the Democrats that are back on to this ridiculous farce of investigations. And I just -- for me, it was like a kind of radicalizing moment. It reminded me of the Kavanaugh hearings, actually. We just saw the true partisanship of what they're doing.</p><p>And I thought, \"Right, we've got to fight back.\" And exactly as you say, and that's why I made the point. You know, there's a debt there that is going to be repaid by them. Then we can move forward.</p><p>KIRK: Do you know, they started mentioning impeachment in April of 2016 before he was even the nominee. Mark Levin mentioned that in his new book. It's amazing.</p><p>CARTER: Oh, yes.</p><p>HILTON: It's all about -- we've got to leave it there for a moment. That's what it is all about. They cannot stand the fact that ...</p><p>KIRK: That's right.</p><p>HILTON: ... that the disrupter, the people's representative, came in, took power that they thought was rightfully theirs away from them and they'd do anything to get it back. It's so disgusting.</p><p>CARTER: And it's going to backfire.</p><p>HILTON: Right. Okay. I think we're in agreement there. Coming up, a part of my conversation with President Trump that you haven't seen before. We talked about the latest in the Boeing scandal. And coming up next, swamp watch update, that's next.</p><p>HILTON: My conversation with President Trump last week covered a wide range of topics and we squeezed as much as we could into last week's show. But one part we didn't have time for was our discussion of the recent controversy surrounding Boeing. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Another example of the swamp, you know, people really related to that argument that you made. You see it now with what's going on with Boeing, right?</p><p>You talked about the military industrial complex. We know that their planes -- the civilian planes -- but they're a big part of that government machinery. What do you think of what's going on there?</p><p>I mean, every day, it seems like we get a story about Boeing. But it's very worrying in terms of what they may have covered up.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I feel very badly for Boeing. I think it's one of the great brands of the world and I've never seen a brand be hurt so badly so fast. That 737 MAX has been a disaster for them. And I guess, they're doing a lot of things. But, you know --</p><p>HILTON: What do you think of the CEO?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I know him.</p><p>HILTON: Are you confident he is the right guy to lead that company out of this?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, he was flawless until about four months ago, when that first plane went down, and I've been saying it. They're making it too complicated. You know, they want to be pilots you want to have -- they're making airplanes and other equipment.</p><p>I could tell you stories about ships that we're building. They always think they have to up it, up it up it and eventually, I mean, you have to graduate first in your class at MIT to fly an airplane.</p><p>They're making it too complicated and what they're doing is making it too dangerous. It's no good. And I told that to Dennis Muilenburg at Boeing who you're talking about.</p><p>Dennis is a good man. He has had a great career and the last four months have been a disaster for him.</p><p>HILTON: So you've got Nikki Haley on the board there.</p><p>TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: What would you hope that she'd be doing?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I think she can help him a lot. She is very talented. She is a good person. She was great with me and did a really good job at the United Nations. She has already supported us.</p><p>But I think she can do a good job. I think it's good to have her on the Board. I think she can help.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: All right, that's our original Boeing swamp watch. New details have emerged about the faulty technology in their 737 MAX airplane.</p><p>It turns out that Boeing knew about a problem with safety features before the two crashes that killed hundreds of innocent people. In 2017, their engineers discovered a problem with the key safety indicator months before delivering their first 737 MAX planes to clients.</p><p>Boeing conducted an internal safety review, decided the problem was no big deal and chose not to communicate the problem to their clients or regulators at the FAA, until of course hundreds of people were killed.</p><p>Then they thought it might be worth disclosing the flaw. But even after reviewing the issue, the FAA declared the issue to be, quote, \"low risk.\" And that's not all.</p><p>Recently unveiled audio recordings from a private meeting show that the American Airlines Pilot Union confronted Boeing executives of a possible safety issues in the 737 MAX just a few months before the deadly crash in Ethiopia.</p><p>All of this raises new questions about what else Boeing has known and failed to disclose about the safety of their planes. Look, Boeing is a great American company with many thousands of workers who are among the best in the world. But Boeing leadership is obviously now crooked, self- serving, and shockingly irresponsible. They must be held accountable.</p><p>All right, Charlie you followed this all along, what do you think?</p><p>KIRK: Yes, and it's really important to realize, this is not the market at work. This is cronyism at work. And you look at the self-dealing, it's the perfect way to put it. The access to government contracts, the monopolization they have on the American manufacturing industry, for airlines. There's only really two firms in the world that can make the type of planes that they make the transcontinental airlines, and that would be Airbus in France and Boeing in America.</p><p>And I like to think that we're a country that's so rich, a $20 trillion GDP, 330 million Americans. We have one company that can do that. That just goes to show that the tax dollars should be always diffused and decentralized when you bid for these contracts.</p><p>HILTON: Such an important point. That's so much the thing that's gone wrong in so many parts of the economy, the centralization, not enough competence.</p><p>KIRK: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: That's so true. And I think for me, you know, I fly frequently, you fly frequently. We put our lives in the hands of these companies. This is about -- not just about a flaw in something that will harm anyone. This is about hundreds of people on board an aircraft, with their children, with their family members, entrusting their lives to the people who make these planes.</p><p>And unfortunately, for Boeing and their executives, just as you said, Steve, they withheld information that could have saved people's lives. I mean, this is probably one of the most grotesque moves a company like this could make.</p><p>And you're right, Boeing love Boeing. My father was a mechanic on an aircraft, he worked on AWACS. You know, my father always talked about, you know, the safety issues on a plane.</p><p>So for me, to think that Boeing could do that, those are the questions that I want to know. How much more has been withheld from the American public? And what are we expecting of our corporations? And you're right, it's cronyism, but it doesn't stop there. We need to know what's going on and they need to be honest with us.</p><p>KIRK: And there's a super deep point here, and you talk about this in your book. When you don't have competition, you get lazy.</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>KIRK: You stop being your best version of yourself, so Boeing has not had that kind of competition for years. So they got to this level, where they have endless tax dollars coming, where they spend more money on public affairs and lobbying than on research and development, and then actually making sure their products are the best in the world.</p><p>And what you talk about in your book, we've talked about it in the show many times -- decentralization, competition, entrepreneurship -- will make the products better, but also give a better value for the taxpayer and hopefully end up saving lives.</p><p>HILTON: And also they're really, really great -- a terrible example of what we talk about all the time it's almost the revolving door, the executive. I mean, they're literally -- I can't remember the exact details, but the Head of Safety at Boeing ends up becoming the Head of Safety at the FAA, the regulators.</p><p>CARTER: Research and development -- the problems with that we've seen that not only in the private sector, we've seen it in the public sector, with the Pentagon and with the Department of Defense, where you have, you know, these contracts that are these open-ended contracts with very few bidders, with very little competition and people are putting out products that are sub because there is just not competition out there to put out the best product.</p><p>KIRK: I would venture a guess that if President Trump did a press conference and he said, \"The $10 billion,\" whatever it is, \"Will now be open bid.\" You'll have entrepreneurs from all over our country saying, \"I'll do it. I have expertise. I used to work for Boeing. I can have a competitor.\" Allow the market to solve these problems. Don't rely on Washington, D.C. to do it.</p><p>HILTON: That's a great idea. For anyone who is watching with the power to make that happen, I would say, \"Go for it.\"</p><p>All right, coming up, our interview with President Trump made headlines for his comments on everything from Iran to Mayor Pete, up next.</p><p>I want to break down some of the key moments and explain what they tell us about this President. Don't go away.</p><p>HILTON: So last week, I had the chance to talk to President Trump about everything from domestic policy to foreign relations to his approach to doing the job.</p><p>Now, I just want to pull out a couple of the highlights from the interview. Because I think it tells you something really important about this President and something that you just not recognize elsewhere in the media.</p><p>First of all, let's look at this answer about Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: When I first came to office, one of the first meetings I had was at the Pentagon with generals and they were showing me the Middle East. And they had 14 or 15 sites where there was nothing but war problems. Every single one of those sites was instigated by Iran.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: All right, so what does that tell you? We keep hearing the whole time, he doesn't listen to his people around him. He doesn't read briefings. He just sort of watches TV. Total rubbish.</p><p>In response to a question about Iran, he immediately goes to a briefing from the experts and the generals at the Pentagon and remembers the detail really precisely.</p><p>So second one, this is about carried interest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Tax reform, tax cuts -- we all agree it's been an amazing ...</p><p>TRUMP: It's been great.</p><p>HILTON: ... boost to the economy and so on. There was one thing missing from it that you talked about the people noticed in 2016. Carried interest.</p><p>TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: You describe that as ...</p><p>TRUMP: I did.</p><p>HILTON: ... getting away with murder.</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, I hated it.</p><p>HILTON: Why wasn't that tax --</p><p>TRUMP: But I traded that for two points. In other words, I could have had carried interest out, but you would have paid 23 or 24 instead of 21. And I wanted the 21 percent. I used that as a negotiating chip, and frankly, was a very good deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Okay, so let's look at that. He talks about tax reform the whole time, that's in the conversation. This carried interest point that I threw in there, he wasn't expecting that.</p><p>No one is talking about that at the moment. That was a debate from two years ago. I threw it in there, he immediately got the point, remembered the detail, got into the whole argument of why it's a good idea, and then in the end, why he decided not to do it.</p><p>And this is the person that they accuse of not focusing on detail, not understanding policy, being basically some kind of sort of dummy that doesn't understand.</p><p>You know, it's really fascinating -- the grasp of policy detail, evident in that answer in his instant response to an unexpected question like that, I thought was really, really important for everyone to understand.</p><p>And then finally, this one on tweeting and watching TV and all the rest of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: That's one of the things you get hit for a lot about how you do the job. They say, \"He is up in the residence all morning watching TV, rage-tweeting at 'Morning Joe,' he is not focusing on the job.\" What's your response to that?</p><p>TRUMP: So I have way over a hundred million people on the various things, much more than that, but over 100 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and all of it, right?</p><p>It's a tremendous way to communicate for me, because I have so many people. When people do a book, they beg me, \"Please give me --\" because it goes to being a bestselling book.</p><p>If there's somebody interesting, I like to watch it. I watch much less television, you know, they would like to make me look like I'm up early in the morning. I'm in the Oval Office early. I leave late.</p><p>HILTON: So it's not true when they say that you're up in the residence.</p><p>TRUMP: No, no. They do that as a form of disparagement. I was about -- three weeks ago with some very big businessmen, I was in the Oval Office negotiating. And we have a small screen of television, and they noticed that they were saying, \"Donald Trump is up now. He is steaming. He is angry. He is up in the residence.\" I said, \"See that, folks. I'm in the Oval Office.\"</p><p>HILTON: Right.</p><p>TRUMP: I'm a very calm person, too, you know. They like to make me like I'm raging. I'm like the raging bull. I'm a raging person --</p><p>HILTON: The tweets are a bit raging every now and again.</p><p>TRUMP: No, but sometimes you do that for a reason. I mean, you know, the tweets seem to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: So what does that tell us? This is not some impulsive lunatic as the as the resistance maniacs describe him. This is someone who is incredibly intentional and strategic about how he does the job, what he values, how he wants to operate, how he wants to communicate, fully aware of what he is doing.</p><p>I just thought when you take it all together, the briefings and the policy grasp and all the rest of it, I just wanted to make those points, not necessarily about the specifics of each of those policy areas, but what it tells you about this President is the direct opposite of what you hear all the time from his critics, okay.</p><p>CARTER: Look, I think the most important thing -- and the American people that voted for President Trump got this right off the bat -- he listens. He doesn't want to be bamboozled. He doesn't want people to come into the Pentagon and sit down and tell him about every single tribe in Syria, and the machinations between them.</p><p>He wants to hear what is going on, and he heard it clearly. All of these areas -- Iran. Iran was involved in, in making a problem for us in the Middle East and are affecting our national security. He sees the problem, he makes a decision, and he negotiates.</p><p>This is a perfect example, Steve, of why he won. Because people get that. When he talks to an audience, he is able to deliver a message and the American people sitting there that are listening to him says, \"For the first time, here is somebody who is not playing me.\"</p><p>HILTON: Yes, that's right.</p><p>CARTER: \"He is telling me like it is and then he is holding to that promise and moving forward.\" And really, that's what the Democrats hate about him most.</p><p>KIRK: He is absolutely brilliant. I say that commonly. I just want to reinforce that. Look at the different topics you were throwing at him, Steve, and he was able to lean back two years ago and use exactly why he had that specific policy position and what he got in response for it.</p><p>And he is so quick. He is relentless. But you look at what he has been able to accomplish with the amount thrown at him. I don't think that combination has ever happened in American history where you have this level of accomplishment with that level of adversity to get through it.</p><p>And I will say, those three examples that you used with the Iran, how we listened to the generals, they have to process information, then make a decision - the correct decision without having to just immediately step into conflict or war, but have other steps before that, which deserves to be praised and heralded.</p><p>But also the carried interest, which was really interesting. He is able to say, \"No, no, I use that as a negotiating tactic. I got a lower tax rate because of it.\" And I think it's such a disservice the media does when they described this President.</p><p>CARTER: And certainly the third with the Twitter, you know, how he utilizes Twitter.</p><p>KIRK: Yes, I love it.</p><p>CARTER: And these different platforms to be very strategic.</p><p>HILTON: This is what I find so -- truly unfair about the reporting on him because it's one thing to disagree with his policy positions and say, you know, that's not what this anything is about.</p><p>KIRK: No.</p><p>HILTON: They constantly --</p><p>KIRK: It's ad hominem attacks.</p><p>HILTON: That's all it is. That's all it ever is. There's never any recognition that actually what he's going -- what? To get elected President from nowhere.</p><p>KIRK: Steve, do you ever notice --</p><p>HILTON: The idea that you're some sort of dummy, which is what they try and make out.</p><p>KIRK: Every day, it's contradictory ad hominem attacks. One day, he has no idea what he is doing; the other day, he is this mad scientist destroying the country.</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>KIRK: One day, he is clueless and the other day he has this Machiavellian plan to uproot America. You can't be both a mad scientists and also clueless.</p><p>HILTON: Right.</p><p>CARTER: That's right. And also targeting his family. It's a consistent targeting. They're trying to isolate him. They target the people around him, those that were in his administration in the beginning, then they go after his family.</p><p>But you know what's so brilliant about President Trump -- and in history, they will write about this -- that he continues to do the work for the American people, despite all of these attacks, he is able to keep himself straightforward, level-headed, moving forward and despite everything that they throw at him, he has been able to do incredible things for this country.</p><p>HILTON: Yes, and they want to continue, too, even though you know, literally, this week, when you've got, you know, the kind of investigative sort of mania of the Democrats, leading to the sort of blow up we saw, they're still going to be pushing ahead with things that they can do with the executive action.</p><p>I was just really pleased. And I got a lot of good feedback from you. Thank you for that on the interview last Sunday. And I really appreciate that. And one thing that a lot of you said was that it was great to see the President given some time to breathe and to express his views in a kind of considered way on a range of issues and that was exactly my intention. So thank you very much for all your feedback on that.</p><p>Coming up, Linda McMahon weighs in on the 2020 election and her time in President Trump's Cabinet -- my exclusive interview, next.</p><p>HILTON: I recently spoke with former Small Business Administration Chief, Linda McMahon about her time in President Trump's Cabinet and her new position as Head of the America First Super PAC. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HILTON: Linda McMahon, great to see you. I'm dying to ask you so many questions. I want to start with your experience in President Trump's Cabinet focusing on small business, what were your priorities? What were you focusing on when you were in that role?</p><p>LINDA MCMAHON, HEAD, AMERICA FIRST SUPER PAC: Well, I can tell you, I had a tremendous good time being at SBA, but also it was incredibly beneficial for me to be able to go all over the country.</p><p>I went to all 50 states. I visited all 68 district offices for SBA, and in that tour, and the reason I did that was because I really wanted to hear from small businesses. I mean, I, as the head of the SBA was the advocate for small businesses in Washington, and so I talked to over 800 business owners, I went to dozens of businesses all around the country.</p><p>And so what I heard from them are the benefits of tax cuts we're bringing to them, to be able to write off in a purchase of equipment, et cetera in the year which they were buying it to expand, hire more people raise wages, regulatory rollback, all of that was so important so I was bringing those messages back to Washington.</p><p>HILTON: And the regulatory stuff, like you, I've started and run my own business, not on the scale of yours, but you know, I've done my bit. And it's the regulatory stuff that just is so irritating and gets in the way.</p><p>Just talk to us a little bit about some of the specific stories you heard about the things that have changed to make small business owners' lives easier.</p><p>MCMAHON: Well, what I heard, mostly, when I was out meeting with small businesses was not necessarily any particular regulation. It was actually the cumulative amount of regulation. So you have a small business owner that is often the CEO and the janitor, and so you don't often have time to do all of the things that are necessary to comply with all of the regulations and you might not even know about all of them.</p><p>So I think actually rolling back regulations, making the paperwork of requirements so much less is giving entrepreneurs more time to spend and focus on their businesses and they're able to grow.</p><p>HILTON: I remember when I was engaged in a very similar program back in the U.K. government many years ago trying to roll back regulations and I was saying to the officials in some of the departments. Well, why don't we just, you know, get -- rather than trying to find the specific ones we want to get rid of, why don't we just reset the default? Get rid of all of them and then see what happens for a year. And then bring back the ones that we feel that we really need. Now, just remember, the kind of complete horror at this idea?</p><p>MCMAHON: That would have been, I think, horrific, but I do think the approach that the President has taken and that each agency has taken and then as the regulatory rolled back out into the private sector has been successful, has been, you know, the right approach, because it's really, really been successful.</p><p>HILTON: So let's look ahead to 2020 now in your new role. One of the things that is just getting all the attention apart from the candidates on the Democratic side, we may get to that in a second, but there's a lot of focus on those particular voters that President Trump won over in those particular states, you know, sometimes called I think a little insultingly, the rust belt states.</p><p>But we talk about Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, particularly; Pennsylvania, especially. That kind of economic argument there was so important in 2016. Do you think that he'll be able to make that case to them again in 2020?</p><p>MCMAHON: Oh, absolutely because it's been successful. I mean, look at you know, the first time in decades, wage growth has actually happened. There wasn't a wage growth; now, there is wage growth, the best in 10 years.</p><p>And so workers are definitely feeling that. And when I often hear Democrats talk about how well the tax cuts and everything just benefited the upper income earners that is just not true. That lower 25 percent really had better benefit, you know, than anyone else across the spectrum.</p><p>HILTON: What do you think of those who say, \"Well, yes,\" but you've got a couple of the candidates in this vast and growing Democratic field that may pose a problem there for slightly different reasons.</p><p>First of all, they talk about Joe Biden having a particular appeal in those kind of states to those kind of workers, the more blue collar appeal, but also Bernie Sanders, because there are a lot of voters in that category who actually interestingly, crossed over and voted for Bernie in the Democratic primary and then switched to Trump in the general election because they wanted that kind of populist message. What do you think about those two, Bernie and Biden?</p><p>MCMAHON: Well, it'll be interesting to see how the field actually does narrow in who the candidate is. But I think if you do take a look at former Vice President Biden's record while he was Vice President, again, jobs lost; under President Trump jobs gained. Manufacturing jobs were lost. And so we brought them back.</p><p>Really, the feeling of those workers that I think Biden had a great appeal to clearly understand, promises were made, but President Trump delivered.</p><p>HILTON: So agree with that. Quickly on Bernie though, what do you think about his appeal to those kind of the Trump base?</p><p>MCMAHON: Well, I think, you know, Bernie Sanders just takes us farther and farther to the left and I don't see that we will see the kind of economic growth at all anywhere near. In fact, we'd see the opposite if Bernie Sanders was elected President of the United States.</p><p>And Medicare-for-All, while it sounds like a wonderful premise, the real understanding is not there of the -- I think of the detrimental effect that it would actually have on healthcare available to everyone around the country, because the quality of that care, the lack of numbers of doctors that we would need in our country, we're already at a doctor shortage. This would not accomplish what Bernie Sanders wants to do, and our economy would definitely go the other direction.</p><p>HILTON: Which those people definitely don't want. I think the President is very grateful I'm sure to have you on his team now looking to 2020. Wonderful to talk to you today. Linda McMahon, thank you so much.</p><p>MCMAHON: Thank you so much.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HILTON: Coming up, if San Francisco in California are any indication of having a loony left in charge of the country is a scary proposition. The loony left is next.</p><p>HILTON: The City of San Francisco has long been home to the most left-wing politics in the country, yet a recent piece in \"The Washington Post\" quotes, \"Longtime residents calling the city a train wreck,\" and highlights many attributes that are the opposite of what progressives say they stand for. The downfall of San Francisco is tonight's loony left.</p><p>All right, here's a quote from that \"Washington Post\" piece. \"To take a midday tour downtown is to be enveloped by a jeaned and athleisured army of young workers mostly white and Asian and predominantly male. The presence of a boomer or toddler is akin to spotting an endangered species.\"</p><p>The city is too homogenous, too expensive, too tech, too millennial, too white, too elite, too bro. I can add to that from personal experience over many years, the entire city stinks of feces, urine and weed. Drug paraphernalia can be found on every street corner, homeless people lining the sidewalks, potholes puncture the roads. And yet the housing is so expensive.</p><p>Regular working Americans with jobs in the city often have two or even three hour commutes from somewhere affordable. San Francisco is a civic catastrophe. And it is entirely the responsibility of the Democrats and the self-righteous big tech overlords who slavishly back them.</p><p>They've been in sole control of state and local government for over a decade. There's no one else to blame. God help us all if this goes national.</p><p>CARTER: And we're seeing it. God help us all of this goes national, but we're seeing it. We're seeing it spread. Unfortunately, you know, when you think about this, it's so tragic. It's so horrible that when people from other countries get to San Francisco and walk out on the streets, and they're expecting to see this booming, beautiful city on the hill. They see feces. They see homelessness. They see people with mental illness just rummaging around in the streets looking through trash for food.</p><p>And what they don't see is a middle class America, or low income America, they see the rich and the poor. What does that say about us? And all of the people that have fled, and even in California now, even in Los Angeles, we're seeing it. We're seeing the remnants of this. We're seeing it in Washington, D.C. in some cases. There has to be something -- something needs to be done and I think everybody knows it.</p><p>HILTON: And I think it's really important to focus the conversation on this, which is that this is not an accident. This is not an act of nature. This is the consequence of the policies of the loony left.</p><p>KIRK: Right. And so this is by design. The left will create policies that protects the ruling class, the Wise Men of Washington, the philosopher kings, the elites, as we call them. And then they will then point to the inequality that they created as a reason to give themselves more power.</p><p>And then the inequality will be exacerbated, then they'll say, \"We need more power, because look at all the inequality.\" So then it will be exacerbated even further and then that's what you have the implementation of socialism where the ruling elites, the philosopher Kings, are able to live in permanent luxury, while pointing to the inequality that they themselves created as the reason why they need to stay in power.</p><p>HILTON: Exactly.</p><p>CARTER: Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, what you'll see is to, is the migration. So once they wreaked havoc in one area, then they move and they move to another area saying, \"Whoa, this is just too much taxes on our business. We need to move out of here. Let's move to Arizona. Let's move to Nevada. Let's move to Utah.\" And then they start voting for the same policies there creating this same problems in those communities that they created in San Francisco.</p><p>KIRK: And Steve, it's all about mobility. America has always been about mobility that's why this country is the greatest country ever to exist. There's nothing mobile about San Francisco, about an income tax rate where people can't keep the money that they're earning. Sales tax, property tax, schools that are not working or functioning. Civil institutions are crumbling, and the elites can afford to price themselves out of it, though.</p><p>They can afford to send their kids to the private schools. They can afford to have the private jets to go to better communities. It's the middle class Americans that crumble under these policies.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. And that's, again, make the political connections. So many of these policies are driven by the public sector unions that absolutely control the Democrats in this state of California where we are tonight and around the country, too.</p><p>All right, coming up another Democrat jumps into the 2020 race, which if my math is correct, makes him the 257th declared candidate. We will tell you it is, next.</p><p>HILTON: Welcome back, everyone. Because of our interview with President Trump last week, we couldn't bring you our weekly 2020 update and let you know that yes, you guessed it, the Democratic field has grown even larger.</p><p>The newest candidate, New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio. The President weighed in and I think it's safe to say, he isn't a fan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I can't believe it. I just heard that the worst mayor in the history of New York City and without question, the worst mayor in the United States is now running for President. It will never happen, I'm pretty good at predicting things like that. I would be very surprised to see him in there for a long period, but it's just not going to happen.</p><p>If you like high taxes and if you like crime, you could vote for him, but most people aren't into that. So I wish him luck, but really, it would be better off if you get back to New York City and did your job for the little time you have left. Good luck. Be well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: We all really enjoyed that. I think, it feels like we should just leave it there, but you know --</p><p>KIRK: He is the best, isn't he?</p><p>HILTON: It's just so great.</p><p>KIRK: The worst mayor of New York City and probably the worst mayor in the country. He is exactly right. Imagine being the worst at something and then want to be President, that's Mayor de Blasio.</p><p>CARTER: He could win an award for being the worst at something. I mean, all you have to do is walk down the city streets of New York now and see how much it's changed since he's become mayor.</p><p>I mean the poverty, the people sleeping on the streets, the sidewalks, the crime. He seems to care more about what people eat in New York City and how big their Big Gulps are and whether or not they could buy a --</p><p>KIRK: Not to mention, he screwed up the Amazon deal.</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>KIRK: He has been raising taxes.</p><p>CARTER: Horrible.</p><p>KIRK: The schools are totally crumbling. He has lost the trust of the police and anyone -- and you can have that street feel when you go to New York.</p><p>CARTER: Yes, that's right.</p><p>KIRK: The ethic, the spirit of New York is not there anymore. It was different under Giuliani.</p><p>CARTER: That's right. Absolutely.</p><p>HILTON: But it's amazing to me that he is universally despised. It's really interesting like -- even his own side. They just can't stand him and I just saw going to a friendly news outlet you know, where they will get completely kind of slavish treatment generally speaking, and they were confronting him with a disaster of New York and his appalling poll ratings, you know, no one likes him.</p><p>CARTER: Which is really fascinating, because now that's the one thing that those news outlets and President Trump can agree on. So Bill de Blasio has done one thing. He has got an agreement between President Trump and those news outlets that are more to the left.</p><p>But you know, if you're thinking about New York City, and you're thinking about the changes, you brought it up, Charlie, Rudy Giuliani imagine how much of a change that was.</p><p>I remember going to New York when he was the mayor and just being like, the city is beautiful.</p><p>KIRK: He had a great spirit to it.</p><p>CARTER: I felt comfortable walking around at night, yes, it had a great spirit. People were proud. Now even New Yorkers don't like Mayor de Blasio.</p><p>KIRK: And to this day, Giuliani never got credit for what he did after 9/11 to bring that city together. And Trump played a big role in that. People forget, he donated millions of dollars and was a huge part of the reconstruction and the cleanup project in New York. And now it's too bad because New York is really the center of the world. That's really what was said all throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s.</p><p>And now it's just become really a place of high tax and you want to talk about where those socialist policies are put in place. The elites are doing fine in New York, it's middle class New Yorkers that are suffering.</p><p>And the one thing that could have helped them is Amazon coming in with 24,000 jobs and de Blasio wanted nothing to do with it.</p><p>HILTON: But it's just amazing to me, like he like why is he bothering? I mean, like the President put it so well, like \"Good luck.\" But why is he - - all of these people are jumping? Like it feels like the field is very, very, you know, the bigger it gets, the more kind of settled it seems in terms of the people who are there at the top.</p><p>CARTER: They live in a bubble. This is the problem, Steve. They're not with the rest of America. They don't really even understand what's going on here. That's why they're freaking out in a manner of speaking with President Trump.

So Bill de Blasio, he's a narcissist. He kind of lives in his own bubble. He thinks he is doing the greatest thing in the world for everyone.

Since inauguration day on Jan. 20, top executives from at least 186 companies have visited with Trump or senior advisers at the White House or on presidential trips, including those to Mar-a-Lago, the private, seaside Florida club where he spends many weekends. Some of the meetings have been reported in the press. </p><p>But Reuters analyzed more than 900 White House press pool reports to give the first big picture view, albeit an incomplete one, of who has had the most and least success at bending the president's ear. Such access can be crucial for companies, with Trump regularly passing judgment and making proposals on business issues such as trade, taxes, immigration and regulation. The review showed Trump listening closely to some segments of Corporate America, though perhaps neglecting the dynamic technology and entertainment sectors, both powerful U.S. export industries. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc , and other tech leaders met with Trump before his inauguration. Access sometimes means influence, but it was likely too soon to tell, after less than 100 days, whether Trump's actions have disproportionately favored big manufacturers and Wall Street. Industrial power-houses have led the way on access, including companies with the clout to make significant hiring decisions: Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields has met with Trump at least four times; General Motors CEO Mary Barra, at least four times; and Boeing representatives, at least three times. The Reuters review helps fill a blank in the Trump record that opened in mid-April when he put the White House visitor logs off-limits to the public. They had been mostly public under Obama. Transparency advocates have warned that Trump's decision will make it harder to hold him accountable. \"A public record of who has the president's ear is more important than it has ever been,\" said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit good-government advocacy group. The review showed about half of the companies that have made it into the Trump inner circle through April 21, day 92 of his presidency, were manufacturers or financial firms - asset managers, insurers and banks ranging from Wall Street giants such as Citigroup to small community banks. Financier Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs a presidential advisory forum of business leaders, is CEO of the Blackstone Group , the largest manager of private equity and real estate assets. He was spotted by the press pool aboard Air Force 1 on Feb. 3 when the president was traveling to Mar-a-Lago. Schwarzman also attended at least three meetings with Trump and other executives. Almost all of Trump's meetings were group encounters with 10 or more executives sitting down with the president and White House officials in events billed as listening sessions, roundtable discussions or town halls. A few were more intimate encounters, such as on March 18, when Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Corp. subsidiary, met with the president in Mar-a-Lago before having dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Perlmutter, however, was one of few executives from media companies seen by pool reporters in meetings with Trump. Information technology firms, which enjoyed significant access to former President Barack Obama, have had less access to Trump than legacy manufacturers such as auto and steel makers. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty attended three meetings with Trump, but was one of only a few CEOs from big tech firms seen at the White House. Manufacturers and financiers also enjoyed access to the White House under Obama, according to a Reuters review in December 2015 of White House visitor logs. The recent Reuters review is not comprehensive since the press pool, though dogged and alert, may have missed some of Trump's meetings with business leaders. The pool is a rotation of journalists from several outlets, including Reuters, who follow Trump and get briefings from White House officials on some, but not all of his meetings.

Almost everything is promotable now because there are media channels interested in reporting on topics no matter how obscure.\"</p><p>\"Another trend that might be heading in the wrong direction,\" he continued, \"is the rush by PR pros to get into content creation.

It's a nuanced environment and one that changes very quickly, so we place a high value on talent with real tech chops. If we're doing our jobs right, we're just as likely to be giving counsel to engineers and developers as we are to the communications team. In tech, what a company says and what it actually does need to be tightly aligned.</p><p>\"While technical acumen gives us credibility, it's our integrated approach that drives value for Edelman clients. We frequently draw on world-class expertise in social media, brand marketing, healthcare, public affairs and corporate communications to field diverse teams that think through client challenges in new and interesting ways. For example, we recently developed a special unit focused on Data Security &amp; Privacy. In this space, the issues are layered and intricate, thus requiring a blend of skill sets.\"</p><p>\"From innovative startups to well-established market leaders, our philosophy is the same: Put the client first, build the right team, align on objectives, and commit to mutual success.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Waggener Edstrom WW, Bellevue, WA, $59,305,000</emphasis></h><p>Kimberly Davis, senior VP and head of the technology practice, said the firm, with 28 years of experience in the technology sector, \"is at the fore-front of important technological advances that change the world.

Other tech clients include eBay and Hewlett Packard.</p><p>\"Our tech practice had another successful year in 2011 with significant new client projects won around the world and the expansion of several existing accounts to new markets. A good example of the latter is our work for Applied Materials, the worldwide manufacturer of solar cell, semi-conductor and micro-chip production machineries. Over the past few years we have had great success supporting their government relations priorities in the European Union and 2011 saw our account expand to provide strategic counsel and regulatory consulting to help them grow their business in China.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Atomic PR, San Francisco, $12,006,603</emphasis></h><p>Andy Getsey, co-founder and CEO, said the firm's growth in 2011 was due to its \"broadening, creative and effective use of analytics as well as the launch of sister agency H3O Communications.</p><p>\"These two things led to a string of tech and consumer tech wins by both firms, kicked off by McAfee and Sony early in the year, and a growing number of pure consumer assignments from brands like Bertazzoni and Cabot Creamery going into the end of the year,\" he said.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sparkpr, San Francisco, $10,396,043</emphasis></h><p>Alan Soucy, CEO of Sparkpr, which has specialized in tech since its founding in 1999, said it has handled clients ranging from stealth start-ups to Fortune 500 global public companies. \"We have supported tech companies through launches, growth, and acquisitions and IPOs and we're known for our expertise in social media programs,\" he said.</p><p>Specialized practice areas focus on consumer tech, digital media &amp; advertising, ecommerce, enterprise &amp; IT, financial services, gaming, green tech, media &amp; entertainment, mobile &amp; wireless, music, social media and venture capital.</p><p>Current clients include Barclaycard US, blinkx, Etsy, Good Technology, Greylock Partners, Hootsuite, NEA, Nielsen, Pinnacle Engines, Rdio, Spiceworks, SugarCRM, \"The Today Show,\" Vevo and Virgin Green Fund.</p><p>Sparkpr won TechCrunch's 'Crunchie Award' for best overall U.S. technology firm. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Inc Magazine</emphasis> has named it one of the fastest growing privately held companies three years in a row and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">San Francisco Business Times</emphasis> in 2010 and 2011 recognized it as one of the Bay Area's \"Best Places to Work.\"</p><p>Branch offices are in New York, London and Cape Town.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Davies Murphy Group, Burlington, MA, $8,883,415</emphasis></h><p>\"At Davies Murphy Group, tech PR isn't one of our practice areas - it's our only practice area,\" says founder Eric Davies.</p><p>He explained the firm's operation: \"We work with technology giants like IBM and Comcast, as well as earlier stage companies like Veeam and Brainshark, and we provide a wide range of services including PR (media relations, analyst relations, social media, speaking programs, and awards programs), marketing (lead generation programs, collateral development, event management, messaging and positioning, SEO/SEM), and business strategy (product strategy, market development, M&amp;A strategy).\"</p><p>The agency was started in 1998 with an exclusive focus on technology because, for the previous decade, Davies (whose roots are in IT and software engineering) had been the client of PR agencies, and felt that most agencies weren't well equipped to represent technology companies.</p><p>\"In today's media environment, where so much of the emphasis is on content creation, and so much of the coverage depends on being able to tie clients' technologies to industry issues and trends, you really can't staff or operate a tech PR agency the way you would a \"consumer or general purpose PR agency,\" says Davies.</p><p>\"You need senior, experienced people who not only understand PR and marketing, but who have a real in-depth understanding of a broad range of technologies.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Finn Partners, New York, $8,700,000</emphasis></h><p>Practice heads Howard Solomon, Managing Partner, and Alicia Young, Managing Partner, said \"Exceeding client expectations is the hallmark of the Finn Partners technology team.

Jason Redmond\u2014AFP/Getty Images</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Alana Semuels</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic has upended businesses across the world, but it has been very good for Amazon. Every lockdown \"click to purchase\" nudged the company a little further toward utter domination of online shopping as total e-commerce sales nearly doubled in May. But if bigger was better for everyone, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos would not be appearing before Congress on Wednesday for an antitrust hearing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Charlene Anderson, and sellers like her, are one reason why he'll be there. Anderson is among the many merchants who sell goods on Amazon \u2014 and who together account for more than half of sales on the site. But they pay, too: Amazon charges Anderson a $39.99 monthly fee to post her knitting and craft supplies on its site, and it takes a cut of about 30 percent on each item she sells. Anderson's seller experience has worsened during the pandemic as Amazon exercised the power of what she calls \"dictatorship\" over the vast internal marketplace it alone controls.</p><p>In mid-March, for example, Amazon notified sellers that during the pandemic, its warehouses would accept only household staples, medical supplies and \"other high-demand products,\" but it failed to explain how it determined what it would accept. Anderson could still send some colors of knitting bags to Amazon warehouses, but not others; she could send one size of knitting needles, but not another. Some sellers saw their sales evaporate; others paid USPS or other services to ship orders to customers, while still paying Amazon's monthly fees.</p><p>Even after Amazon lifted that order, boxes of goods that Anderson ships to a warehouse still sit on loading docks for weeks, she says, and when Amazon unpacks them, it miscounts the items, an error that takes Anderson days to remedy. The company sends customers the wrong items, then allows them to leave negative feedback on her seller page despite the error being Amazon's, says Anderson, who is 63 and lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In the Facebook group she runs, Anderson says some sellers worry that the raft of problems will lower their internal scores on Amazon so much that the company will kick them off the site.</p><p>But where else can they go? \"What are we going to do, protest and not sell on Amazon?\" Anderson asks. \"Right, I'm just going to kill my whole business. They have you and they know they have you\u2014if you go, they'll just find someone else to sell those products.\"</p><p>Consumer spending on Amazon between May and July was up 60% from the same time frame last year, according to the financial data firm Facteus. The company's extraordinary power \u2014 it has 38% of the e-commerce market, trailed by Walmart with 6% \u2014 was under scrutiny well before COVID-19. But the lockdown that boosted the company's dominance also threw into higher relief its consequences for other businesses.</p><p>That's increased interest in updating federal laws written more than a century ago to correct the distortions of monopolies on an economy. Bezos is appearing before a Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, part of an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee into online platforms and market power. The hearings are asking: in the age of Big Tech, how big is too big? New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway, a longtime critic of Amazon, says it's helpful to think of Amazon's Prime membership service as the kind of massive competitive advantage once enjoyed by railroad barons. With its extensive logistics and delivery network, Amazon not only has the eyeballs of millions of households, it is the company that ships, packs, and delivers what they buy.</p><p>\"Amazon already owns the rails into 115 million households in America,\" says Galloway. \"Do we really want one company to be the arbiter of all commerce?\"</p><p>Economic crises have a way of creating winners and losers. Procter &amp; Gamble thrived during the Great Depression by doubling down on advertising; Target expanded after the 2001 recession and saw profits grow 50%. Before the pandemic, Amazon represented around 4% of total U.S. retail sales. But with the new habits formed during the pandemic, UBS predicts that by 2025, e-commerce will make up one-quarter of total retail sales, up from 15% last year. The firm also estimates that 100,000 brick and mortar retail outlets will close in the next five years. \"Consumers are increasingly shifting towards online shopping,\" analysts wrote. \"Many of these shoppers may not get back to in-store shopping when the current state is over.\"</p><p>Amazon, which refused to make an executive available to comment on this article, casts itself as a friendly giant in its ubiquitous messages to consumers; it spent nearly $7 billion advertising itself in 2019 (more than double what Walmart spent). According to Ad Age, that made the company the biggest ad spender in the U.S. last year. But Amazon also sells advertising \u2014 $3.9 billion worth in the first quarter of 2020, up about 44% from a year earlier. The ads appear on Kindle, on Amazon Prime TV and on Amazon.com, some of them purchased by the same small sellers already paying to be listed on Amazon but afraid of getting lost on the site without additional promotion.</p><p>Because of the way e-commerce works, advertising on Amazon is essential for just about anyone selling on the site. According to marketing surveys, when online shoppers are thinking of buying an item, about half go straight to Amazon and search for the item, rather than Googling it or visiting another website. Most don't scroll beyond the first page of results, so for sellers, it's essential to be featured on that first page. They can hope that positive reviews lead Amazon's algorithm to put them there, or they can buy ads.</p><p>Amazon is now the third-biggest digital ad seller in the United States, following Facebook and Google. And as it consolidates its grip on e-commerce, it can charge more for ads on its site. Buyers now compete with each other in an auction for keywords related to their products; the more people that are competing, the higher prices go. Revenues from advertising in the first three months of this year were up 43.8% from the previous year and 359% since 2017, according to company earnings reports.\"It begins to feel like they're playing chess, and they're thinking three to four steps ahead,\" says Andrew Lipsman, a retail analyst at market research firm eMarketer. \"The more I think about Amazon, the more I marvel at it.\"</p><p>So do investors, who saw its stock as a haven in a treacherous equity market. Amazon has gained half a trillion dollars in market value just this year, and shares should climb even higher when earnings are reported on July 30 if, as analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted, company revenues in North America show a jump of nearly 50% from the previous year. Bezos, already the richest person in the world with a net worth of $178 billion, could become the world's first trillionaire by 2026.</p><p>That kind of concentrated wealth invites the stark comparisons embodied by people like Susan Bengel. One of the 175,000 employees Amazon hired during a pandemic that cost 40 million American jobs, Bengel, 62, had been living in her car before she started working at an Amazon warehouse in Pennsylvania in late March. She told me she recently got an offer from UPS, but she stayed with Amazon despite difficult conditions that include being on her feet for entire night shifts. UPS couldn't match the pay or benefits she gets at Amazon, Bengel says. \"It's a monopoly, but they provide well,\" she told me after one shift, in which each worker received a Chick-fil-A boxed dinner and bottle of hand sanitizer courtesy of Amazon. As stores close in her hometown of Wayne, Pa., she turned to Amazon to buy what she needs, including new shoes and back braces to get her through her shifts.</p><p>For Amazon shoppers, there's not much not to like, apart from the unease at feeding a behemoth that competitors say is gobbling up their customers. Amazon argues that it's not a monopoly, since it competes with brick and mortar stores for sales. \"There's a single retail market of which online is one channel. People do not shop exclusively online,\" an Amazon spokesman said in a statement. But stores without Amazon's logistics network are finding it impossible to compete. While Amazon was hiring tens of thousands of new workers, Jeff Curtis was running around his Maine bookshop, Sherman's, scrambling to fulfill online orders much as Bezos had done in the mid-90s during Amazon's early days selling only books online. But Curtis was by himself, because his store was closed to comply with stay-at-home orders. He says the state denied his request for special dispensation to bring in workers to help, even as Amazon was allowed to have on-site employees fulfill its own rush of online orders. Curtis has already decided to permanently close one of six branches of his store and is worried he may have to close another. It is the way of the world Amazon has built. Kathy Gonzalez, who runs two retail stores in northwest Florida, says she's tried to offer shipping for furniture and other items she sells, but the cost is so high that people turn to Amazon, where shipping is free.</p><p>\"If you want to be able to reach customers online, you're essentially compelled to be on Amazon's platform, but Amazon's platform is not a place that you can succeed,\" says Stacy Mitchell, the co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \"With this sudden surge in online shopping, all of that has been magnified.\"</p><p>Its mammoth size gives Amazon advantages available only to itself: One of its companies, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a cloud computing platform that lets companies rent space on a network of servers. Its $35 billion in sales in 2019 (up 36% from the previous year) provided a financial cushion that let Amazon subsidize grocery delivery, expand its network of warehouses, and dare to offer one-day shipping without worrying about huge losses. The company now has 1,223 buildings covering 278 million square feet in its global logistics network, up 82% since 2016, according to MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm, and it's still expanding at an \"unprecedented\" pace,\" says Marc Wulfraat, founder and president of MWPVL. It built or announced plans to build 49 million square feet of logistics space in the U.S. between March and July alone, he says.</p><p>Amazon's deep pockets are also ensuring the company's ability to operate during the coronavirus in a way no other company can. Bezos said in late April that Amazon was investing $4 billion in coronavirus-protection efforts, including personal protective equipment for workers, enhanced cleaning at facilities, and development of its own COVID-19 testing capabilities. Galloway calls this the first \"vaccinated supply chain,\" and says it will help Amazon further dominate competitors as more people choose to buy and sell products through a service that has invested in being virus-free.</p><p>Amazon also continues to invest in technologies that will further consolidate its grip on e-commerce. In June, the company said it would spend $1.2 billion to acquire Zoox, a startup that makes self-driving vehicles, which could help in its delivery services. Amazon is expanding its fleet of cargo planes as other airlines lease them for cheap, the better to lessen its reliance on FedEx and UPS. It invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Rivian, an electric car company, and ordered 100,000 electric vans from the startup. In July, Amazon said it would open more cashier-less Amazon Go stores.</p><p>\"Some people\u2014and I'm one of them\u2014only buy something if it's on Amazon\" says Brandon Fishman, CEO of VitaCup, which sells vitamin-infused coffee and tea both in retail stores and online and which saw a 35% increase in its Amazon sales in March and April. Fishman says it's cheaper for him to sell his products in brick and mortar stores than to sell them on Amazon, because of the cut Amazon takes for packing and shipping. But he doesn't want to miss out on e-commerce customers, who are his most loyal. More than half the people who buy VitaCup products on Amazon return to the site to buy more.</p><p>\"Third party sellers would say it's a deal with the devil,\" says Galloway, the NYU professor. \"Amazon brings us a lot of revenue, and we become addicted to it, but every year our economics get worse.\"</p><p>In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon had been using data from third-party sellers to determine which items were selling well, then making private-label versions of the same products to compete with the sellers' products. (Amazon said such a practice would violate its policies, and it vowed to investigate.) Other sellers have alleged that Amazon does not take down counterfeit versions of items sold on its site; they suspect that the company does not want to lose the fees it collects from both legitimate and non-legitimate sellers. (Amazon says it invests \"heavily\" in prohibiting the sale of counterfeit products, using automated systems to help ferret out counterfeits, and that 99.9% of all pages visited by customers did not receive a notice of potential counterfeit infringement.)</p><p>During the pandemic, sellers say, communication has worsened and Amazon has slowed its response to flagrant problems on the site. Charlene Anderson says she can't sell a knitting gauge because the picture is inaccurate on Amazon's catalog page; she has been trying the problem fixed for three months. In July, Anderson says, Amazon told sellers it was going to restrict how many products they could keep in warehouses based on a performance metric. The ups and downs of the pandemic have meant that while Anderson's sales were down in the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, they're up about 3% now. But some sellers in the Facebook group she runs report their sales are down more than 50%. Most frustrating for all of them is the inconsistency; they have no idea when Amazon will change the rules again. \"We hate having to deal with all of this, but to build our business, we have to,\" Anderson says.</p><p>Amazon says its platform allows anybody to make an income in an otherwise challenging pandemic economy, and that it is working to help sellers while meeting increased demand from consumers. \"Our commitment to our selling partners has never been more steadfast,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. In the twelve months ending May 31, 2020, small and medium-sized businesses sold 3.4 billion products, up 25% from the same time the previous year, according to a report Amazon released July 21. Amazon says the average American small and medium-sized seller had more than $160,000 in sales during that time, though it did not provide averages for how much these sellers took home after expenses.</p><p>Amazon is now valued by the stock market at $1.5 trillion, a figure that dwarfs the GDP of Saudi Arabia. The very thing that has made it so successful during the pandemic\u2014its size and the many layers of its businesses\u2014is what has given it so much leverage over sellers, workers and governments. Existing antitrust laws are designed to protect the consumer from predatory pricing. That orientation has shielded Amazon, because the company in many cases saves consumers money, but it is being questioned by scholars, and now lawmakers.</p><p>Critics say that regulating or breaking up Amazon will be better for merchants on its site and also, in the long term, for the economy. The rate of start-up creation in the United States has been falling for years; there is some evidence that this is because big companies like Amazon use their size to force smaller competitors out of business, or prevent them from being created in the first place. If small manufacturers and retailers had a fighting chance in competing with Amazon, they might help reverse the decline in start-up creation. New businesses in America are much of what drives the country's productivity and economic growth, raising its standard of living and spreading wealth and jobs.</p><p>Historically, antitrust enforcement has helped upstarts; Companies like Google arose in part because of government antitrust action against Microsoft in the 1990s; the breakup of AT&amp;T in the 1980s helped launch a technology renaissance.</p><p>\"A key component of our success as a society is this very basic notion of checks and balances,\" says Galloway, of NYU. \"We've tried to avoid dictatorships, we try to avoid monopolies. We don't have a judge, we have a judge and jury. And we believe in the wisdom of crowds.\"</p><p>Charlene Anderson agrees. She says she and other sellers don't want Amazon to disappear. If that happened, they would lose their income source and their access to millions of shoppers. They just want better communication with Amazon, more democracy, less dictatorship. \"Amazon is not transparent at all,\" she says. \"Amazon will not tell you anything.\"</p><p>Wednesday's hearing before the House subcommittee on antitrust law will test that allegation, and more, as Congress peaks behind the curtain of one of America's most successful companies.

The attacks from the White House coincide with a Justice Department announcement that it would convene talks on whether social media firms are \u201cstifling\u201d speech or harming competition, and precedes a series of hearings by regulators to review how antitrust laws apply to digital giants.  Trump in recent days has stepped up his attacks on the tech industry, claiming that Googlesuppresses conservatives and promotes \u201cleft-wing\u201d news sources and then issuing a vague warning to Facebook, Googleand Twitter to \u201cbe careful.\u201d  Trump\u2019s criticism of political bias was echoed by some Republican lawmakers at hearings on Capitol Hill featuring Twitter and Facebook top executives.  The prospect of a legal crackdown on Big Tech has industry leaders understandably worried, but many conservative activists are also worried about punishing one of America\u2019s most important industries for political reasons. </p><p> \u2013 Constitutional confusion \u2013  John Samples, vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, said the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>in claiming \u201ccensorship\u201d is misapplying the constitution\u2019s First Amendment free speech protection.  \u201cThe First Amendment sharply limits government power over speech. It does not limit private governance of speech,\u201d Samples said in a blog post.  \u201cGovernment officials bullying private companies contravenes a culture of free speech. Needless to say, having the Justice Department investigate those companies looks a lot like a threat to the companies\u2019 freedom.\u201d  Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation, a think tank that supports a deregulatory agenda, also warned against a government effort to regulate algorithms like those that Googleuses.  \u201cIt would be unwise, as a matter of policy, to lodge the power to police search neutrality in the government\u2019s hands,\u201d May said in a column for the Washington Times.  \u201cBecause search results may be manipulated easily by those who design the algorithms, it would be foolish to risk giving government officials control over them. The temptation for government to abuse this power to promote its own messages \u2014 its own version of what is most \u2018relevant\u2019 \u2014 is evident.\u201d  American Enterprise Institute fellow James Pethokoukis said Trump and his allies may not have considered what type of precedent he could set if one of his political opponents wins the White House.  \u201cHave they thought about the possibility that, say, president Elizabeth Warren might latch onto the latest Trumpopulist thinking to create a Federal Internet Platform Commission to regulate the sector?\u201d Pethokoukis said in a blog post.  \u2013 Antitrust as a weapon? \u2013  The spectacular growth of Big Tech in recent years has sparked talk of antitrust action, but Trump\u2019s sharp attacks have raised fears that any enforcement would be for political reasons.  \u201cCertainly antitrust scrutiny is to be expected at this point when these companies are so big,\u201d said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University.  \u201cBut this could be the first step in a broad effort by the government to subvert the First Amendment under the guise of antitrust.\u201d  Among those warning the administration was Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political group created by billionaires David and Charles Koch.  \u201cAntitrust laws exist for the good of American consumers, not to further the political interests of public officials,\u201d said the association\u2019s policy manager David Barnes.  \u201cThe Justice Department should not wield its authority to subjectively pick winners and losers in the tech industry or to police free speech. Using threats of antitrust or other enforcement as a political weapon should be cause for concern for every American.\u201d  Ed Black, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group that includes Googleand Facebook, also expressed concern about politics tainting the antitrust process.  \u201cWe think antitrust is so important that it should not be politicized or turned into a political tool for other ends,\u201d Black told a conference call.  The Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department, last month announced it would review all aspects of enforcement.  The review will include the \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard \u2014 a precedent that has largely avoided prosecuting firms for monopoly practices as long as consumers are not harmed.  Michael Carrier, a professor of antitrust law at Rutgers University, said abandoning the consumer welfare standard may be problematic, with courts likely to be circumspect.  \u201cThe difficulty with abandoning this standard is that there is no ready-made framework to replace it and I can\u2019t see courts adopting a more robust (and less consumer-friendly) framework,\u201d Carrier said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGGOVN-RLPMN816116420180912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGGOVN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7T-MSP1-J9XT-P15R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bangladesh Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"504\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 12, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It does not limit private governance of speech,\" Samples said in a blog post.</p><p>\"Government officials bullying private companies contravenes a culture of free speech. Needless to say, having the Justice Department investigate those companies looks a lot like a threat to the companies' freedom.\"</p><p>Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation, a think tank that supports a deregulatory agenda, also warned against a government effort to regulate algorithms like those that Google uses.</p><p>\"It would be unwise, as a matter of policy, to lodge the power to police search neutrality in the government's hands,\" May said in a column for the Washington Times.</p><p>\"Because search results may be manipulated easily by those who design the algorithms, it would be foolish to risk giving government officials control over them. The temptation for government to abuse this power to promote its own messages -- its own version of what is most 'relevant' -- is evident.\"</p><p>American Enterprise Institute fellow James Pethokoukis said Trump and his allies may not have considered what type of precedent he could set if one of his political opponents wins the White House.</p><p>\"Have they thought about the possibility that, say, president Elizabeth Warren might latch onto the latest Trumpopulist thinking to create a Federal Internet Platform Commission to regulate the sector?\" Pethokoukis said in a blog post.</p><p>CAPTION(S):</p><p>(AFP/File / MANILA BULLETIN)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-553827375</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 553827375</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T80-W6P1-JCBJ-K22R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Manila Bulletin Publishing Corp.</copyright><publicationName>Manila Bulletin</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 11, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00052GB</classCode><className>AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CATO INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC7375 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Over the next hour, we'll take a deeper dive into some of the biggest matters affecting American life today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We start with speech. As you probably heard, recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones. Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones' accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Left, which seeks to crush anything it can't control, applauded the news. The institutional Right in Washington, afraid of being criticized, mostly stayed silent. That was foolish and it was cowardly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This isn't about Alex Jones or any one person, it's about the central principle of our society, and it's at stake here. Do people have a right to communicate their views. It doesn't matter what those views are, Alex Jones' views or anyone else's views. They may be misguided; they may be repugnant; often they are.</p><p>But there's a remedy for repugnant views, make a counter case, defeat bad ideas with good ideas, kill lies with truth. That's how healthy societies function. We are moving in the opposite direction. Increasingly, the people in charge use technology to silence criticism, mostly of them.</p><p>The Left will tell you that defending Alex Jones' right to speak is the same as defending what Alex Jones says. That is a lie, and they know it's a lie. We would make the very same case on behalf of Jill Stein or Noam Chomsky on the Left or anyone else the establishment was trying to silence.</p><p>The left-wing ACLU spent about a hundred years representing radical extremists, whose views they hated, and they did it to make that point. Free speech is for everybody, even the crazies. That's the very definition of free speech.</p><p>In a free country, everyone can be heard. In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard. The Left used to understand that, but they don't anymore. What changed? Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up?</p><p>And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure. Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with. You see it all the time. Last summer, the CEO of Google, who was a billionaire by the way, flew home from family vacation just to fire a low-level programmer called James Damore.</p><p>What did Damore do? His crime was writing a private memo that gently questioned identity politics. The reaction in both those cases and many others like them was weirdly disproportionate, almost hysterical.</p><p>It was like shooting someone for looking at you funny. Confident people don't behave like that; insecure terrified people do. And that's the point. An establishment crushes dissent, not because our establishment is strong, but because it is weak and afraid.</p><p>In the words of a perceptive essay this week, \"Censorship is what happens when powerful people get scared.\" That piece was written by a former Wall Street executive called Michael Krieger, and it's worth quoting at length here.</p><p>\"Elites aren't afraid of what Alex Jones,\" says Krieger writes, \"they're terrified that it's popular. They're in denial about the consequences of the world they created. Trump didn't divide American society, Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread and by the way justified distrust in institutions, elites did that with their spectacular failures.</p><p>Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status quo, the stewards of which refused to take a look in the mirror, accept blame, and reform.</p><p>Censorship by Silicon Valley billionaires will backfire spectacularly. Ultimately, it's safer for society to have open public forums, where all ideas whether you consider them dangerous and crazy or not can be openly expressed alongside each other.</p><p>Deplatforming popular content won't make it go away. It will just shift to areas of the Internet you may not see, where it will fester and grow stronger over time in even more intense and radicalized echo chambers.</p><p>You'll think it's gone from the society, because it's been safely cleansed from your corporate government Facebook Timeline. But it may grow even stronger in the shadows.\"</p><p>In other words, censorship does not work. Ideas spread, the good ones which are rooted in nature and observable reality, take root and they endure. People know what's true, they can smell it. You can't stop them from knowing that. You can't control their minds. You can only humiliate yourself and undermine your own authority by trying.</p><p>Our childish billionaire overlords may be geniuses, they say they are, but they don't understand that. Someday soon they will learn, and that is a comforting thought at a time like this.</p><p>Joining us now is DePaul University professor Jason Hill. Professor, thank you for coming on.</p><p>JASON HILL, PROFESSOR, HONORS DISTINGUISHED FACULTY, &amp; DIRECTOR OF TEACHING PRACTICUM, DEPAUL UNIVERSITY: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So tell us your view of why censorship from the Left, but not exclusively from Left but mostly, has increased. That doesn't seem like the sign of confidence, it seems like the sign of people who believe they're losing control.</p><p>HILL: Well, I think what has happened is that the Right has lost the cultural wars. I think that we are seeing a period since the 1964-65 period in which the Free Speech Movement was fought ironically by the Far Left. So far, we are under the nefarious control of a Left -- Far Left movement that is in cultural -- exercising cultural power and is in control of our cultural institutions.</p><p>And what we have are these institutions like Google, like Twitter, like YouTube yielding to that cultural power out of fear of retribution or repercussions that they fear will have financial consequences.</p><p>But make no mistake about it, we are in the throes of a Far Left that has exercised and is exercising great cultural power over our society. They have won the cultural wars.</p><p>CARLSON: What I don't understand is why people who dissent, who have different views, tend to be so passive in the face of attempts to shut them up? I understand why people don't like Alex Jones, I'm not defending Alex Jones' views obviously, but if they can silence a radio show host or if they can silence James Damore, the engineer at Google, why can't they silence you or why can't they silence me?</p><p>Of course, they can. Why don't we fight back against this?</p><p>HILL: We can't fight back because we have not -- we don't have the moral courage to fight the opposition. We are apologists for our values and we're apologists for our principles.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HILL: We have ceded the moral high ground to the adversary, and in some sense, we have given them the moral authority out of some sense of cowardice. I think there's a great deal of moral cowardice that conservatives have, that people who are even mildly conservative have, and we have ceded the moral high ground to people who have co-opted values and principles in the name of some sort of morality.</p><p>That is nothing short of nihilism, cultural relativism, an attack on reason, and an attack on rational argumentation. But it's a lack of courage -</p><p>CARLSON: Confidence.</p><p>HILL: -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I think you're exactly - I think you're exactly right. But if all people who dissented from the prevailing view of, say, our tech billionaires who have so much control over our speech, paused and said, \"Yu know, I'm not actually going to go along with this. You don't have the moral high ground over me, and I am going to say what I think. I'm going to say it even louder if you try and silence me.\"</p><p>I mean, you could actually make some headway fighting back against it, couldn't you?</p><p>HILL: You could, but I think people -- I think we -- what the - the point I'd like to reiterate is that we don't really realize the kind of cultural power that is being exercised and the kind of intimidation tactics that is exercised and wielded over people who have dissenting views.</p><p>There is a kind of hijacking of one's moral conscience that has to be reckoned with, and I think until people who hold conservative values or people who are on the other side of the spectrum say, no this is wrong. Free speech has got to be defended.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>HILL: -- and whether it's even, I would go as far Tucker as to say, even hate speech so long as it's not an incitement to violence.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate you, professor, for reminding us of that. Thank you very much for that.</p><p>HILL: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We want to go to another topic that has emerged again and again in the news recently, socialism. Socialism of course has a long -- a century long track record of creating human misery and destroying countries from Russia to Venezuela.</p><p>But the ideology has proven impossible to kill and it is flourishing or appears to be flourishing in the modern Democratic Party. Democrats as a whole now say they view socialism more favorably than they do capitalism.</p><p>Politicians like Bernie Sanders and Cynthia Nixon proudly call themselves socialists.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT: Maybe there's a little (INAUDIBLE) to socialism that turns people -</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT: I don't really think so. I think the real issue is that the ideas that we have been talking about, almost without exception Stephen, are now ideas that are mainstream ideas that are supported by the vast majority of the American people.</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON, ACTRESS, ACTIVIST, AND GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK: Republicans are going to call us socialists no matter what we do, so we might as well give them the real thing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Give them the real thing. But what is the real thing and what are they talking about, when they say they are socialists?</p><p>David Azerrad has thought a lot about this. He's Director at the B. Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics at The Heritage Foundation in Washington and he joins us.</p><p>David, thank you for coming on. So, all of us have watched kind of slack- jawed as a growing number of ascended Democratic politicians have embraced socialism. What are they saying when they say they're socialists, what does that mean?</p><p>DAVID AZERRAD, DIRECTOR, B. KENNETH SIMON CENTER FOR PRINCIPLES AND POLITICS, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: I think you should look at the policies they support rather than the labels they use, and there you'll find that what they're calling socialism is basically just liberalism.</p><p>They want more regulations on the private sectors and they want bigger entitlements. So, basically socialism has become a synonym for a more aggressive self-confident brand of liberalism, and it's definitely spreading.</p><p>But Marxist Leninist socialism, the intermediary stage on the way to communism, that's completely dead in the US and enjoys almost no support. So, I would tell my friends on the Right not to panic that this is not the birth of communism.</p><p>What it is just is a renascent more aggressive form of progressivism. No more Bill Clinton, the era of big government is over, but an assertive and demanding and self-confident form of liberalism.</p><p>CARLSON: It does seem like though somebody has failed, maybe it was parents, maybe it was teachers, maybe it was both, in making the term socialism unacceptable. I mean no one is espousing Nazism; that's been obviously discredited and for good reason.</p><p>Socialism -- self-described socialist murdered tens of millions of people in the last 100 years. Why is the word itself not more verboten?</p><p>AZERRAD: I mean, look at what we teach in our schools. By and large, there are only three things that kids learn about the past. Nazism, Jim Crow, and slavery, and they know that that's bad.</p><p>Socialism killed and communism killed 100 million people in the 20th century, but that's not really taught. And then the other thing to keep in mind is 2008. 2008 happens and immediately the Left reacted and said, \"This is capitalism.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>AZERRAD: \"This is the legacy of Reagan. This is unregulated greed. It's the private sector running amok and trampling over the well-being of Americans.\" And then the pollsters come along and they give the American people the choice between capitalism, which to many on the Left and to Millennials means 2008, or socialism which has come to mean kind of we're all in this together, we take care of one another, or the government gives us free stuff.</p><p>And people say, \"Well, I sure as hell am not going to support capitalism. Therefore I'm going to support socialism.\" I think it's more an indictment of our failure to properly teach history.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>AZERRAD: And look, the fact also that words evolve and their meaning changes over time, and I think today for a lot of people socialism just means big government.</p><p>CARLSON: Libertarians and some conservatives never really reckoned with the deep resentment about the bank bailouts, I always thought. Did it ever occur to them that people looked at that, if you're a non-economist like me, and you think, \"Well, if my business fails, no one bails me out, but we're bailing out these billion dollar banks.\"</p><p>I mean people kind of hated that, and why wouldn't they.</p><p>AZERRAD: And I also think we didn't offer a simple counter-narrative. I mean there have been very intelligent and profound explanations offered on the Right by economists of what happened. But to put it bluntly, what's our talking point?</p><p>CARLSON: Good point.</p><p>AZERRAD: And I've been in DC now for 10 years, I still don't know what it is. So that I think in the popular consciousness, 2008 was caused by deregulation and greed, which I think you and I both know is not the case. But we kind of lost that battle.</p><p>CARLSON: David Azerrad, one of the smartest observers for us. Thank you for joining us and I appreciate it.</p><p>AZERRAD: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Our INSIDE THE ISSUES special continues. Just ahead, with a look at big tech, even when you think your phone is not listening to you, it likely is. We've been investigating this for months and that investigation continues after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our INSIDE THE ISSUES special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The people who run the tech industry already know a lot more about you and your neighbors and your family than the East German Stasi ever could have dreamed.</p><p>But they're always looking for more information. And for most people, the smartphone is the way they get it. Your phone doesn't just track where you go though, it does do that. It can also listen in on your conversations, your in-person conversations and use them to decide which ads you see online.</p><p>Brett Larson hosts Fox News Headlines 24/7 on SiriusXM radio. He frequently investigates tech stories for us. So, Brett Larson, I know this can't be true, because we've suspected this for a long time, but the industry has denied it repeatedly.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, MORNING ANCHOR ON FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7, SIRIUSXM 115: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're saying it is real?</p><p>LARSON: They have denied, denied, denied, but every time someone sits down and researches it, it seems it is actually happening, that the conversations that you're having in front of your smartphones are being listened to and then advertisements appropriate to the conversations you had will pop up the next time you go online.</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, can I just interrupt you --</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- to make sure I have this right? So, this is not when you're speaking to Siri, not when you're talking to the phone.</p><p>LARSON: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But when your phone is sitting on a table in a restaurant, in your home, and you don't --</p><p>LARSON: You know, like right here, hearing me.</p><p>CARLSON: -- even now? How is that legal?</p><p>LARSON: Here's the thing. This is where -- and when we had Mark Zuckerberg in Congress, Congress said over and over these end-user agreements that we all just kind of click through and we don't pay attention, for what we know, it could be buried in there, but it could be buried in there in such a way that you don't really understand what they're saying.</p><p>When you open an app for the first time, when you download the Facebook app, for example, and you open it for the first time, it may say Facebook app would like access to your camera and your microphone.</p><p>And logically, you're going to think, \"Oh it's because I want to put pictures on Facebook directly from the app.\" But buried in that license agreement, it may say flat out. And well, it's -- we're listening to the things going on around you when you post your photos so that we can take the mood of the room or so that you're not posting a silent movie basically.</p><p>But this reporter at Vice Media did the same thing and he did it the same way all of us have heard this story over and over. These anecdotal things of like, \"You know, I was talking about wanting to go to Japan, and the next thing I know, I'm in front of my computer and there's all these ads for cheap flights to Japan.\"</p><p>And most of us dismiss it like, \"There's no way that could be happening. Zuckerberg's in Congress and he says there's no way we're not listening to you.\" But other researchers have found that a lot of these apps are actually listening to us, and they're also paying attention to how we interact with the app.</p><p>They're going to excuse it away. Well, they're paying attention how we use the app, they want to make the app a better user experience. I totally get that. They're listening to us. Our phones are always listening to us because they're listening for that magic word.</p><p>They're listening for OK Google to alert the virtual assistant or Hey Siri, which if I say my phone's going to -- now there it goes. It's good, it's what can I help you with?</p><p>But in order for my phone to hear me say that, it's got to be listening to me all the time. So, it's a matter of what other apps are also listening and what are their, what they're called, trigger words to get them to start paying attention.</p><p>For all we know, the Seuss Books App trigger is, \"I'm thinking about,\" and then the next thing is what they're listening for.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but I guess that's the point, we don't know.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And by the way, Congress banned lawn darts and clove cigarettes, because they were a danger to the public. But they've done nothing about this, because they're pathetic and in the pocket of these companies.</p><p>But let me ask, where does this data go? They have all your conversations, all your intimate conversations, what do they doing with it?</p><p>LARSON: Yes. They take it back, they process it, and they sell you advertisements. That's -- you know, when we did that investigation into Google in tracking your location, it's really about they want to know where you go, they want to know your routine, because then they have a more valuable sell to an advertiser.</p><p>You're not just going to a fast-food restaurant and saying we're going to give you a thousand customers. You're going to a fast-food restaurant and saying we're going to give you a hundred customers that absolutely walk past your store every day, and ten of them walk in once a week, and we know this for a fact.</p><p>Now, they can go a step further and say, of those 10 that we know walk into your store, one of them is actually talking in the morning about how he wants to get breakfast at your particular establishment. And they have all this data.</p><p>CARLSON: Why would any sane person ever bring a smartphone into a bedroom, seriously?</p><p>LARSON: (LAUGHTER) I know, I know. It's valid question. And when you - Tucker, when you think about it, we've got baby cams, pet cams, all these things in our homes connected to the Internet. We don't know where that's going.</p><p>So, my advice would be, turn the phone off if you're bringing it into the bedroom because it is probably listening to you. And I'm not trying to sound alarmist, I'm just trying to be realistic.</p><p>CARLSON: You're the opposite of an alarmist.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I mean, I'm alarmed, I'm terrified, and I'm upset that Congress doesn't care enough to do something about this. Brett Larson, thank you for your relentless --</p><p>LARSON: They need to get savvier about it, indeed.</p><p>CARLSON: - you think? It's insane.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you for your relentless investigations, I appreciate them.</p><p>LARSON: Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Up next, the war in Afghanistan continues to drag on 17 years and counting, billions and billions of dollars. Is victory anywhere in sight? What should we do about America's longest war? Our INSIDE THE ISSUES special continues, just ahead.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, TELEVISION NEWS ANCHOR, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles. After two days of deliberations, still no verdict in the Paul Manafort fraud trial. Jurors are set to reconvene on Monday.</p><p>In another development, the judge revealed today he has received threats and he fears for the peace and safety of the jurors, so he will not disclose the names of the panel, once the trial is over.</p><p>The judge himself is currently under the protection of US Marshals. Manafort is accused of hiding from the IRS millions that he made advising Russia-backed politicians in Ukraine, and then lying to banks to get loans, when the money dried up.</p><p>He faces 18 felony counts on tax evasion and bank fraud. Earlier today, President Trump issued a fresh defense of his former campaign manager calling him, \"A very good person.\" When news breaks out, we'll break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our INSIDE THE ISSUES special hour. It rarely grabs headlines anymore, but thousands of American troops continue to wage war in Afghanistan. It costs more than $40 billion a year. That's enough to pay for two walls in the Mexican border, enough to do a lot of things.</p><p>Victory though seems as far off as ever, maybe farther away than ever, as Taliban forces control huge swathes of the countryside. They recently laid siege to Ghazni, a major city less than a hundred miles from the capital Kabul.</p><p>President Trump promised in 2016 to keep the U.S. out of foreign quagmires. But what can he do about this quagmire that he inherited. We spoke recently with Eric Prince who founded the private military firm Blackwater and is an expert on the country of Afghanistan.</p><p>Erik Prince joins us. Eric, thanks for coming on.</p><p>ERIK PRINCE, FOUNDER, BLACKWATER USA: Hey Tucker, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So you're one of the few people I know is paying close attention to what's happening in Afghanistan. The President gets elected year and a half ago, partly on the promise to reassess Afghanistan and Pentagon asks him more time, more troops.</p><p>What's the result of that, is it turning around?</p><p>PRINCE: Look, the President got bad advice a year ago. He originally was going to go with his instincts, which is to do something different, something unconventional. He was very deliberate about the decision-making process, but in the end they rolled him.</p><p>And after a year more, another $62 billion of spending, more dead Americans and lots of dead Afghans, we are losing. The Taliban showed that very strongly again this week. They killed another 350 Afghan soldiers, four districts taken, they effectively cut the country in half by cutting a major city.</p><p>And just this week also, killed 50 kids in Kabul, studying for taking a college entrance exam. So, the country continues to melt down. The conventional approach is not working. For the last 17 years, we've basically repeated the Soviet battle plan and it's not working. So, it's time for the President to make some choices.</p><p>CARLSON: So what's the thinking here? So, as you said, it's been on -- next month, it will be 17 years.</p><p>PRINCE: Next Tuesday.</p><p>CARLSON: And we do not control - right, a large part of the country and it's not working. So, is the thinking that something is going to change or why are we continuing to do the same things over and over?</p><p>PRINCE: That is the definition of insanity, to do the same thing, and expect a different result. Again, the President got bad advice, he was only given the option of more money and more troops or pull out completely.</p><p>If we do pull out completely, it will become a terrorist super state, because the Taliban, the ISIS have the ability to -- right now, they're making about $600 dollars a year between the illegal drug sales and illegal mining.</p><p>The 9/11 attack only cost $500,000. But we need to as a country have a sustainable and effective program going forward, and with the thousands of the - 15,000 US troops that are there, the 30,000 contractors in-country is not working.</p><p>We've recommended a very -- a much smaller and much more unconventional approach, really that goes back to what worked after 9/11, which is this CIA led very small team, very fast, very maneuverable, not a big plotting conventional approach.</p><p>Right now, we're spending $62 billion. Even some of the staff in the White House align the President are saying, \"Oh we're only spending $15 billion. No, you can look in the Overseas Contingency funding bill of the Pentagon; they're spending $49 billion, plus $17 billion in base support for their efforts in Afghanistan.</p><p>And it's wrong and there's a much cheaper way to do that. For all the talk about Pakistan abusing the United States, it's true. But because of the Pentagon's very thirsty, very hungry footprint, we can never actually choke off Pakistan, because they can choke off our supply lines.</p><p>So the President should appoint a special Presidential envoy, effectively a bankruptcy trustee. The president understands how to restructure basically bankrupt failing situations. He needs to do that in this situation, give that envoy the Title 50 authorities, just like the CIA had when they went into Afghanistan after 9/11, and work this thing out.</p><p>Now, there is a new commander going in, who is a guy with a Special Operations background. That is a very good step, but the President can bolster that and have someone -- one person that reports to him to unify the multi-headed Hydra of US government policy and fix this.</p><p>I know the President is frustrated, he asks about it all the time, I'm told.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PRINCE: And it's time for the President to take a different path and solve and end this longest war in America. There are Americans dying there now, who were toddlers or not even born when the Twin Towers fell 17 years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: Very quickly, is it true that other countries have secured mineral rights in Afghanistan, as we pour billions into that country?</p><p>PRINCE: Sure. A lot of countries have secured mineral rights, but there's actually very little legal mining going on. The Taliban and Isis are doing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of illegal mining.</p><p>Because, again as a country, we haven't advanced the rule of law into these areas to prevent actual legitimate investment.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PRINCE: But if we go with a small unconventional footprint, we can put this thing back on track.</p><p>CARLSON: And of course, we're getting nothing out of it as usual.</p><p>PRINCE: We are standing by, Mr. President.</p><p>CARLSON: Erik, thank you for keeping up with this.</p><p>PRINCE: You bet. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CARLSON: I hope that happens. Good to see you.</p><p>We told you many times about how the people who run our country are ignoring the threat of China, or in some cases actively assisting its rise, because they're getting rich doing it. But what is the reverse like, how do Chinese elites regard our country and the Trump administration?</p><p>We got an insight into that, it's fascinating, stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our INSIDE THE ISSUES special hour. The people who run this country are obsessed with Russia. We hear that every day. Weirdly, they prefer to ignore China, at least in public. In private, they're taking a lot of money from China.</p><p>But what do China's leaders think about us? Well, it turns out they think a lot about Donald Trump and his tough posture on trade. Are they impressed? Well, we asked Michael Pillsbury, he is Director of the Center on Chinese Strategy, the Hudson Institute, and a frequent traveler to China.</p><p>He's also the author of the single best book on this subject, The Hundred- Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.</p><p>Michael Pillsbury, thanks for joining us.</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER ON CHINESE STRATEGY, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: There was a surprising piece written by a Chinese expert in The Financial Times recently that described the Chinese leadership's view of Donald Trump. And it came as I think something as a surprise, if you follow the news coverage of Trump in this country.</p><p>It said, essentially Chinese leadership believes that our President is playing a kind of three-dimensional chess, he's a brilliant tactician, and that they fear he's outflanking them strategically.</p><p>Do you think that's right?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes, I was in Beijing a week ago. I think I heard pretty much the same thing that they think President Trump is basically the superior President out of the last five or six that dealt with China, and he's done the most to alter the relationship.</p><p>He's really got their attention. They're quite concerned if there's something deeper going on than they're aware of. So, you get this sense that the Chinese leadership and the advisers to the leadership are afraid of being outsmarted by President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a little odd from a non-experts point of view, because it doesn't seem like his posture has been that aggressive. Is it just that he's the only President to fight back at all, or do they think more is coming?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Both. I think he's distinguished himself as fighting back et al, number one. Number two, the details and the depth of his allegations in these several White House reports he's released are really quite stunning to the Chinese.</p><p>He is basically alleging that they stole their way to the top. They've had forcible technology transfers from US companies, the outright stolen technology, and that they sort of have an illegitimate path to be number two in the world.</p><p>That he would say these kinds of things, especially this term he's used in some reports, economic warfare, that China is committing economic warfare against America and other countries. This is really quite astonishing to them. They're used to being, if you will, coddled or spoken politely to.</p><p>So, this is really quite a shock and it's working, I think.</p><p>CARLSON: Do they agree with the assessment fundamentally? When you speak to them candidly, do they acknowledge that there is some truth in the President's description of their behavior?</p><p>PILLSBURY: No, they're quite firm that this is all lies, defamation, the American companies who testified to our trade representatives' office over the last six months are all making up stories.</p><p>They're adamant, denying everything, and this frankly, Tucker, makes it awfully hard to negotiate. They haven't met us, not even halfway, they haven't met us one quarter of the way yet. So, I'm pessimistic in the short term.</p><p>Obviously, if President Xi and President Trump get together again, if the terms are right, then some kind of a deal could be struck. But I think we're a long way from that.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that, so far, this change in our attitude towards China has helped the United States, have we gotten something out of this?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, it's kind of a strange reaction, but we've certainly got the attention of the European Union. The European Union President, Mr. Juncker, came here not less than a month ago and now wants to work towards zero subsidies and zero tariffs with the United States.</p><p>This too, Tucker, is stimulating paranoia in China. They now are beginning to think that President Trump is so smart, as you say playing three- dimensional chess, that he has got the Europeans on his side, and they've issued a set of warnings just in the past week to the Europeans, not to fall for President Trump's trap.</p><p>CARLSON: (LAUGHTER) Is there something kind of wonderfully amusing about this story, or is that just me?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PILLSBURY: It's partly just you. But don't forget -</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- you want to see some change and some aggressive steps, and the President has certainly done that. I think the next step is going to be to see what the first Chinese offer will be after these two months now basically no contact.</p><p>They've been making hints. They've dropped a couple of hints in newspapers recently that they're willing to renegotiate investment terms with us. They're willing to say that there may have been some minor violations by a few Chinese companies or local provinces.</p><p>But, certainly, the center -- the Communist Party and President Xi never did anything wrong. So, we haven't come very far, but yes I think it's refreshing to see this level of respect for the United States. I haven't seen it in 40 years.</p><p>Usually, the Chinese look down on us, as not being very bright.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and for good reason. Michael Pillsbury, thank you for that perspective, it was great.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Thanks Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well tonight, we continue our ongoing investigation into the world of horse meat. We recently talked to someone who advocates eating horses. But because this is a balanced show, tonight we're going to speak to a horse advocate horrified by the idea of barbecuing Seabiscuit. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our special INSIDE THE ISSUES hour. We recently touched on a little-known but important issue in American life, horse meat. We interviewed a man called Dave Duquette. He came on the show and argued that Congress ought to change the law to allow slaughter and sale of horse meat for human consumption.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVE DUQUETTE, EQUINE EXPERT, PROTECT THE HARVEST: It's mainly a welfare issue, Tucker. It's -- the welfare of horses in the horse world is that it's gone downhill ever since. And when you have something that doesn't have any value at all -</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>DUQUETTE: -- which is what the unwanted horse is. We have a huge history of horse meat consumption in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We got a remarkable response to that segment. Horse meat is uncommon in this country, very common in Mexico and in France. Nancy Watson is not impressed by that. She's President of the SAFE Food SAFE Horses Coalition.</p><p>She thinks the idea of serving Black Beauty at Thanksgiving Dinner is repugnant. She saw that segment and asked to come on to state her case, and of course we were glad to have her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Nancy, thank you for coming on.</p><p>NANCY WATSON, PRESIDENT, SAFE FOOD SAFE HORSES COALITION: Thank you for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, the argument is from the other side, and again, I'm agnostic on this, though I don't plan to have a cheval burger anytime soon. But the argument is that there are a lot of unwanted horses, and we did find a lot of news stories describing abandoned horses, and that this market in horse meat might be a solution to that.</p><p>That's the argument anyway. What is your response?</p><p>WATSON: There are no unwanted horses in America. Just recently, MPDI (ph) published a poll taken just a few months ago, where it showed 1.2 million homes available for horses in need. It's a matter of rehoming them and making the effort to find them a new home.</p><p>There are no unwanted horses. It's a manufactured crisis by the small faction of horse meat eating people in the United States, who want to bring that industry back.</p><p>CARLSON: You said it's a threat to the public health. How so?</p><p>WATSON: Well, the FDA, the government agency responsible for public health and food safety, classifies horses as companion animals. We raise them in the United States as athletes, workmates, and companions.</p><p>So they're medicated with hundreds of toxic chemicals and pharmaceuticals that are banned for use on livestock or food producing animals. And we are putting these horses into the food supply, and we're contaminating the food supply knowingly.</p><p>We supply two-thirds of the horses that are slaughtered for human consumption in Mexico and in Canada.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, why would -- and I know that you're sincerely gravely opposed to eating horse, but why would people go to all this effort to argue on behalf of eating horses, when there are perfectly good cows available, for example? What is the appeal of horse meat?</p><p>WATSON: That's a great question. The cost of raising horses for slaughter is way more than the cost of raising cows for slaughter, and the slaughter process is much more costly for horses. They have five times more blood than a cow; it's just a messy process.</p><p>I can't fathom why anybody would want to slaughter a horse. They're physically -- they have the long muscular necks, so the head restraints don't work, the captive bolt doesn't work. I really don't know why anybody wants to bring that industry to the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think there's something degrading of a nation about eating horses.</p><p>WATSON: Personally, I do, yes. But honestly, our fight is about public health and food safety.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I understand.</p><p>WATSON: There is a crisis - we are contaminating the food supply with toxic horses. Horse meat that's sourced from U.S. horses is toxic.</p><p>CARLSON: And there's something awful about it, I agree with you, I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think I'm on your side. Thank you very much for that and great to talk to you.</p><p>WATSON: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has isolated the main cause of America's problems. We'll give you a hint, it's a certain cable news channel. We'll tell you more as our INSIDE THE ISSUES special continues after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR, NEW YORK CITY: Today, you have one outlet and one outlet only, that is constantly sowing division, and we should be able to talk about that.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, HOST, CNN RELIABLE SOURCES: So, you rather not have the New York Post or Fox News exist?</p><p>DE BLASIO: Look, it's a free country. I'm saying, because they exist, we have been changed for the worst. I feel very angry when I see a media outlet, a corporate giant, a profit-making giant, dividing people and creating hatred and negativity. CNN, you could try and find some politics in CNN, but it does not even come close do resembling the clear political agenda of News Corp.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was New York City Mayor and non-genius Bill de Blasio on CNN recently, describing what he believes is the biggest problem America faces, diversity of opinion. Well, there isn't much of it left in this country, almost every news outlet has identical views on everything, and they happen to be the same as Bill de Blasio's views.</p><p>There's only one television network that isn't completely onboard, and that's one too many for Bill de Blasio. Dissent is divisive, he says. Things would be much better if people who disagree with Bill de Blasio were forced to shut up.</p><p>Mandatory consensus, that's the Left's view of paradise. We don't agree, by the way, and we plan to keep saying so.</p><p>We move into our ongoing investigation into wind turbines. They have a well-deserved reputation for causing noise pollution, ruining the natural landscape, and providing precious little electricity in return for all of that. They also kill a lot of birds.</p><p>But could they also be hurting our military? We spoke with Texas State Senator Donna Campbell about that. Here is our conversation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: State Senator Donna Campbell joins us now. Senator Campbell, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>SEN. DONNA CAMPBELL (R), TEXAS: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I've have heard a lot of complaints about corporate wind farms. One that they are unsightly, two that they don't produce meaningful and usable energy, three that they kill an awful lot of birds. You are saying that there is a fourth problem with them that they hinder military readiness. Tell us how.</p><p>CAMPBELL: You are right. They do hinder military readiness. And I would say that's the primary problem. I took a tour at our Naval Air Station in Kingsville, where we train over half of our naval and Marine Corps pilots. And there I saw firsthand look -- I had a firsthand look at the wind turbines. I mean, they are 500 feet tall. Some as tall as two football fields in height. Huge blades.</p><p>And in a cluster, we find that they affect the mission of the base. The flight path has to be changed. The altitudes have to be changed. It degrades radar. And all of this combined actually affects mission readiness, which in turn affects our national security. It's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p><p>CARLSON: But I notice that they are almost all in low income rural areas. You don't see them in Nantucket Sound, you don't see them off the Coast of Santa Monica. Why is it that the people most in favor of corporate wind farms don't have them in their own backyards? Have you noticed that?</p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes, and I couldn't have put it better myself, Tucker. They are putting them on the coast down in Texas. They're clustered across the landscape of America, except in the places, of course, where they want to keep the area pretty. Important for us is that -</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I know.</p><p>CAMPBELL: -- yes. Important for us is that we don't compromise our national security.</p><p>CARLSON: No, well, of course, and that's the new angle on this and I'm glad you brought it to our attention. Senator, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>CAMPBELL: Thank you so much, Tucker.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for tonight's special INSIDE THE ISSUES hour. Hope you had a good time; we did. Tune in every weeknight 8:00 p.m. to the show that is the sworn enemy and we mean that of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Good night.

A third expect technology to strengthen democracy as reformers find ways to fight back against info-warriors and chaos</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Janna Anderson and Lee Rainie</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How we did this</p><p>This is a nonscientific canvassing based on a non-random sample, so the results represent only the individuals who responded to the query and are not projectable to any other population. Pew Research Center and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center built a database of experts to canvass from several sources, including professionals and policy people from government bodies, technology businesses, think tanks and networks of interested networks of academics and technology innovators. The expert predictions reported here about the impact of digital technologies on key aspects of democracy and democratic representation came in response to a set of questions in an online canvassing conducted between July 3, 2019, and Aug. 5, 2019. This is the 11th \"Future of the Internet\" canvassing Pew Research and the Imagining the Internet Center have conducted together. More on the methodology underlying this canvassing and the participants can be found here.</p><p>The years of almost unfettered enthusiasm about the benefits of the internet have been followed by a period of techlash as users worry about the actors who exploit the speed, reach and complexity of the internet for harmful purposes. Over the past four years a time of the Brexit decision in the United Kingdom, the American presidential election and a variety of other elections the digital disruption of democracy has been a leading concern.</p><p>The hunt for remedies is at an early stage. Resistance to American-based big tech firms is increasingly evident, and some tech pioneers have joined the chorus. Governments are actively investigating technology firms, and some tech firms themselves are requesting government regulation. Additionally, nonprofit organizations and foundations are directing resources toward finding the best strategies for coping with the harmful effects of disruption. For example, the Knight Foundation announced in 2019 that it is awarding $50 million in grants to encourage the development of a new field of research centered on technology's impact on democracy.</p><p>In light of this furor, Pew Research Center and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center canvassed technology experts in the summer of 2019 to gain their insights about the potential future effects of people's use of technology on democracy. Overall, 979 technology innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers, and activists responded to the following query:</p><p>Technology's impact on democratic institutions/representation : Between now and 2030, how will use of technology by citizens, civil society groups and governments affect core aspects of democracy and democratic representation? Will they mostly weaken core aspects of democracy and democratic representation, mostly strengthen core aspects of democracy and democratic representation or not much change in core aspects of democracy and democratic representation?</p><p>Some 49% of these respondents say use of technology will mostly weaken core aspects of democracy and democratic representation in the next decade, 33% say use of technology will mostly strengthen core aspects of democracy and democratic representation and 18% say there will be no significant change in the next decade.</p><p>This is a nonscientific canvassing based on a non-random sample. The results represent only the opinions of individuals who responded to the query and are not projectable to any other population. The methodology underlying this canvassing is elaborated here. The bulk of this report covers these experts' written answers explaining their responses.</p><p>In addition to the plurality view among these experts that democracy will be weakened, a large majority of the entire set of respondents including both the pessimists and the optimists voiced concerns they believe should be addressed to keep democracy vibrant. Their worries often center on the interplay of trust, truth and democracy, a cluster of subjects that have framed key research by Pew Research in recent months. The logic in some expert answers goes this way: The misuse of digital technology to manipulate and weaponize facts affects people's trust in institutions and each other. That ebbing of trust affects people's views about whether democratic processes and institutions designed to empower citizens are working.</p><p>Some think the information and trust environment will worsen by 2030 thanks to the rise of video deepfakes, cheapfakes and other misinformation tactics. They fear that this downward spiral toward disbelief and despair also is tied to the protracted struggles facing truthful, independent journalism. Moreover, many of these experts say they worry about the future of democracy because of the power of major technology companies and their role in democratic discourse, as well as the way those companies exploit the data they collect about users.</p><p>In explaining why he feels technology use will mostly weaken core aspects of democracy and democratic representation, Jonathan Morgan, senior design researcher with the Wikimedia Foundation, described the problem this way: \"I'm primarily concerned with three things. 1) The use of social media by interested groups to spread disinformation in a strategic, coordinated fashion with the intent of undermining people's trust in institutions and/or convincing them to believe things that aren't true. 2) The role of proprietary, closed platforms run by profit-driven companies in disseminating information to citizens, collecting information from (and about) citizens, and engaging political stakeholder groups. These platforms were not designed to be 'digital commons,' are not equally accessible to everyone and are not run for the sake of promoting social welfare or broad-based civic participation. These companies' profit motives, business models, data-gathering practices, process/procedural opacity and power (and therefore, resilience against regulation undertaken for prosocial purposes) make them poorly suited to promoting democracy. 3) The growing role of surveillance by digital platform owners (and other economic actors that collect and transact digital trace data) as well as by state actors, and the increasing power of machine learning-powered surveillance technologies for capturing and analyzing data, threaten the public's ability to engage safely and equitably in civic discussions.\"</p><p>Those who are more optimistic expect that effective solutions to these problems will evolve because people always adapt and can use technology to combat the problems that face democracy. Those who do not expect much change generally say they believe that humans' uses of technology will continue to remain a fairly stable mix of both positive and negative outcomes for society.</p><p>The main themes found in an analysis of the experts' comments are outlined in the next two tables.</p><p>Themes About the Digital Disruption of Democracy in the Next Decade: Concerns for Democracy's Future</p><p>Power Imbalance: Democracy is at risk because those with power will seek to maintain it by building systems that serve them not the masses. Too few in the general public possess enough knowledge to resist this assertion of power.</p><p>EMPOWERING THE POWERFULCorporate and government agendas generally do not serve democratic goals and outcomes. They serve the goals of those in power.</p><p>DIMINISHING THE GOVERNEDDigitally-networked surveillance capitalism creates an undemocratic class system pitting the controllers against the controlled.</p><p>EXPLOITING DIGITAL ILLITERACYCitizens' lack of digital fluency and their apathy produce an ill-informed and/or dispassionate public, weakening democracy and the fabric of society.</p><p>WAGING INFO-WARSTechnology will be weaponized to target vulnerable populations and engineer elections.</p><p>Trust issues: The rise of misinformation and disinformation erodes public trust in many institutions</p><p>SOWING CONFUSIONTech-borne reality distortion is crushing the already-shaky public trust in the institutions of democracy.</p><p>WEAKENING JOURNALISMThere seems to be no solution for problems caused by the rise of social media-abetted tribalism and the decline of trusted, independent journalism.</p><p>RESPONDING TOO SLOWLYThe speed, scope and impact of the technologies of manipulation may be difficult to overcome as the pace of change accelerates.</p><p>PEW RESEARCH CENTER and ELON UNIVERSITY'S IMAGINING THE INTERNET CENTER, 2020</p><p>Themes About the Digital Disruption of Democracy in the Next Decade: Hopes and Suggested Solutions</p><p>Innovation is inevitable: Change is beginning to happen at the level of individuals and social systems. History shows how human adaption pays off in the long run.</p><p>EVOLVING INDIVIDUALSIncreased citizen awareness, digital literacy improvements and better engagement among educators will be evident in the next decade.</p><p>ADAPTING SYSTEMSChanges in the design of human systems and an improved ethos among technologists will help democracy.</p><p>ENSHRINING VALUESDeep-rooted human behaviors have always created challenges to democratic ideals. Historically, though, inspired people have shown they can overcome these darker tendencies.</p><p>WAGING INFO-WARSTechnology will be weaponized to target vulnerable populations and engineer elections.</p><p>Leadership and activist agitation will create change</p><p>WORKING FOR GOODGovernments, enlightened leaders and activists will help steer policy and democratic processes to produce better democratic outcomes.</p><p>Technology will be part of the solution: Some of the tech tools now undermining democracy will come to its aid and helpful innovations will be created.</p><p>ASSISTING REFORMSPro-democracy governance solutions will be aided by the spread of technology and innovations like artificial intelligence. Those will work in favor of trusted free speech and greater citizen empowerment.</p><p>PEW RESEARCH CENTER and ELON UNIVERSITY'S IMAGINING THE INTERNET CENTER, 2020</p><p>Some of the striking observations about democracy's current predicament came in these responses:</p><p>danah boyd, principal researcher at Microsoft Research and founder of Data and Society, wrote, \"Democracy requires the public to come together and work through differences in order to self-govern. That is a hard task in the best of times, but when the public is anxious, fearful, confused or otherwise insecure, they are more likely to retreat from the collective and focus on self-interest. Technology is destabilizing. That can help trigger positive change, but it can also trigger tremendous anxiety. Technology also reconfigures power, at least temporarily. This can benefit social movements, but it can also benefit adversarial actors. All too often, technology is designed naively, imagining all of the good but not building safeguards to prevent the bad. The problem is that technology mirrors and magnifies the good, bad AND ugly in everyday life. And right now, we do not have the safeguards, security or policies in place to prevent manipulators from doing significant harm with the technologies designed to connect people and help spread information.\"</p><p>Susan Etlinger, an industry analyst with the Altimeter Group, responded, \"Today we have the ability to amass massive amounts of data, create new types of data, weaponize it and create and move markets without governance structures sufficient to protect consumers, patients, residents, investors, customers and others not to mention governments from harm. If we intend to protect democracy, we need to move deliberately, but we also need to move fast. Reversing the damage of the 'fake news' era was hard enough before synthetic content; it will become exponentially harder as deepfake news becomes the norm. I'm less worried about sentient robots than I am about distorting reality and violating the human rights of real people at massive scale. It is therefore incumbent on both public and private institutions to put appropriate regulations in place and on citizens to become conscious consumers of digital information, wherever and however we find it.\"</p><p>Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said, \"It was naive to believe that technology would strengthen democratic institutions. This became obvious as the technology companies almost immediately sought to exempt themselves from the laws and democratic rules that governed other businesses in such areas as political advertising, privacy protection, product liability and transparency. The rhetoric of 'multi-stakeholder processes' replaced the requirement of democratic decision-making. The impact was immediate and far-reaching: The rapid accumulation of power and wealth. Techniques that isolated and silenced political opponents, diminished collective action and placed key employees by the side of political leaders, including the president. And all with the support of a weakened political system that was mesmerized by the technology even as it failed to grasp the rapid changes underway.\"</p><p>An internet pioneer based in North America, said, \"I am deeply concerned that democracy is under siege through abuse of online services and some seriously gullible citizens who have trouble distinguishing fact from fiction or who are wrapped up in conspiracy theories or who are unable or unwilling to exercise critical thinking. ... We are seeing erosion of trust in our institutions, fed in part by disinformation and misinformation campaigns designed to achieve that objective and to stir dissent. We are seeing social networking systems that provoke feedback loops that lead to extremism. Metrics such as 'likes' or 'views' or 'followers' are maximized through expression of extreme content. Trolls use media that invite commentary to pump poison into discussion. Constant cyberattacks expose personal information or enable theft of intellectual property. Tools to facilitate cyberattacks are widely available and used to create botnets, generate denial of service attacks, spread malware, conduct ransom demands and a host of other harmful things. Law enforcement is challenged in part by the transnational nature of the internet/web and lack of effective cooperative law enforcement agreements across national boundaries. Privacy is abused to commit crimes or other harmful acts. At the same time, privacy is extremely hard to come by given the ease with which information can be spread and found on the net. Nation-states and organized crime are actively exploiting weaknesses in online environments. Ironically, enormous amounts of useful information are found and used to good effect all the time, in spite of the ills listed above. The challenge we face is to find ways to preserve all the useful aspects of the internet while protecting against its abuse. If we fail, the internet will potentially devolve into a fragmented system offering only a fraction of its promise. In the meantime, democracy suffers.\"</p><p>Still, there are those who wrote that they expect human systems and tools will evolve to solve some of the new challenges to democracy.</p><p>Paul Saffo, chair for futures studies and forecasting at Singularity University and visiting scholar at Stanford MediaX, said, \"There is a long history of new media forms creating initial chaos upon introduction and then being assimilated into society as a positive force. This is precisely what happened with print in the early 1500s and with newspapers over a century ago. New technologies are like wild animals it takes time for cultures to tame them. I am not in any way downplaying the turbulence still ahead (the next five to seven years will not be fun), but there is a sunnier digital upland on the other side of the current chaos.\"</p><p>Brad Templeton, internet pioneer, futurist and activist, a former president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote, \"There are going to be many threats to the democratic process that come through our new media. There are going to be countermeasures to those threats and there are going to be things that improve the process. It is very difficult for anybody to evaluate how the balance of these things will play out without knowing what the new threats and benefits will be, most of which are yet to be invented. It is certainly true that past analysis underestimated the threats. Hopefully this at least will not happen as much.\"</p><p>One of the most extensive and thoughtful answers to the canvassing question came from Judith Donath, a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center currently writing a book about technology, trust and deception and the founder of the Sociable Media Group at the MIT Media Lab. She chose not to select any of the three possible choices offered in this canvassing, instead sharing two possible scenarios for 2030 and beyond. In one scenario, she said, \"democracy is in tatters.\" Disasters created or abetted by technology spark the \"ancient response\" the public's fear-driven turn toward authoritarianism.</p><p>In the second scenario, \"Post-capitalist democracy prevails. Fairness and equal opportunity are recognized to benefit all. The wealth from automation is shared among the whole population.

In the face of this change, agencies must be nimble, cutting edge, and innovative in the way we're getting our clients' messages across.

That's why we've been growing our Interactive group and working with each employee to ensure that they have the advanced social media skills our clients require.\"</p><p>About 75% of client work involves integrated programs that combine PR, social and interactive services, said Horn. Her firm has developed an approach called SENSE that she said helps clients to strategically apply services and tactics into integrated campaigns that achieve business goals.</p><p>Said Horn: \"We've even gone so far as to weave our Interactive talent into every client engagement, better supporting our clients' larger marketing efforts. The results speak for themselves.</p><p>\"Our sector focus continues to be in digital media/publishing, enterprise/Software as a Service (SaaS) and consumer e-commerce,\" she said.

Since our technology clients play in the B2B space, trade media channels are usually a priority.

CEO and Principal, said clients range from international, well-established brands to venturefunded start-up companies as well as midsized, business-to-business technology hardware, software and service providers.</p><p>\"There's no question that each of these kinds of clients has a different set of needs depending on their phase of growth,\" he said. \"Our account teams are made up of people with industry and business acumen who counsel clients and execute programs that yield the right kind of results for each stage of the technology company's life cycle. Clients at different stages of maturity concentrate on very different PR strategies, and sometimes very different audiences. Younger companies need to build awareness, increase market share and 'prove' their products and services through reviews, use cases and testimonials.\"</p><p>Matter bases its fee structure on what \"works best\" in each client case, said Signore. \"We work collaboratively with our clients to determine the right budget for the results they need. We don't adhere to the typical hourly billing rate structure that is the norm in PR agencies, but rather come to a holistic agreement on a retainer fee, that is based on scope of work and goals for results.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fahlgren Mortine makes $5.5 million</emphasis></h><p>Columbus-based Fahlgren Mortine, headed by President and CEO Neil Mortine, serves a range of technology clients, from emerging to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fortune</emphasis> 500 companies, specializing in information technology, energy and medical technologies. \"We believe in entrenching ourselves in our clients' businesses, market spaces and competitive landscapes,\" he said.</p><p>Working on a fee or project basis, the firm engages with each client by developing a deep understanding of the technology, its market and its value to provide the foundation for more effective strategy, messaging, media relations and content development, said Mortine.</p><p>\"It's that command of the details and issues that lets us confidently and credibly build relationships with IT media and industry analysts,\" he added. \"It also feeds strong content development, which is often at the heart of integrated media campaigns.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Formula PR's tech finds $3.4 million</emphasis></h><p>The firm's tech practice is managed within two divisions. Formula Senior VP Emily Porter heads business/technology and VP Kelly Baker heads consumer/technology.</p><p>Said Porter and Baker: \"We develop strategic, integrated marketing programs aimed at elevating brand awareness and establishing or reinforcing a leadership position in the marketplace.

It is not hard to understand why so many of us feel so powerless when it comes to using the Internet, nor is the solution to such a pervasive feeling all that complicated. It just boils down to rules and liability\u2014or, in other words, making sure if a company violates your privacy per the law that there is an inescapable penalty. The clearer and more direct the path to holding a company accountable for violating your privacy\u2014much like your physical health, property rights, emotional wellbeing, or other things held in legally enforceable trusts\u2014the more confidence will return to the Internet marketplace. </p><p>But we don't have these clear enforceable rights in today's American consumer privacy legal system for a vast majority of Internet privacy related activity. In fact, when the next Google or Facebook scandal rolls around in terms of user privacy, think back to the last one\u2014likely just a few months old\u2014and ask how much in damages the company paid and whether the company had to compensate individual people for the violation. In many cases, that answer is going to be no penalty, which then feeds into users' sense of powerlessness. But the fact that companies often have to pay no penalty, and the fact that we do not have laws in place to remedy these privacy harms, is a choice we have made. It is not the natural order of things, and it is not inevitable. We have, as a society, made decisions under our intellectual property laws where absolutely no liability is allowed to promote another profitless value, namely our freedom of expression. For example, the practice of criticizing a film on YouTube while playing portions of it in the background is considered a fair use. This means, despite copyright holders having the exclusive rights over the public performance of their work, we have decided to extinguish liability when it involves the expression of criticism. In the absence of fair use, the critic using the film, as well as YouTube, would be directly liable for a lot of money for playing portions of it. However, we counterbalance and limit the economic right of the filmmaker in order to promote free speech values through fair use. In essence, we keep a liability-free zone for criticism and that is generally seen as a net positive for users. It also promotes the creation of open platforms, allowing those speakers to discover audiences and build engagement. But in consumer privacy we have not seen nearly the same benefit yielded back to consumers in exchange for the mostly liability-free zone. There is no race to the top in guarding consumer's personal information, because the profit maximizing effort isn't about augmenting our privacy, it is about tearing it down as much as possible for profit. This is why we keep getting these privacy scandals. There is no need to apply morality to the analysis as often happens when people observe corporate behavior, but rather the simple question of how profit maximization (which corporations have to pursue under the law) is being countered by law to reflect our expectations. When we look at the problem of consumer privacy from this angle, it becomes fairly clear that private rights of action for consumer personal privacy would be transformative. No longer would a corporation view experiments with handling personal information as a generally risk free profit making proposition if financial damages and a loss of profit were involved. Industry wants a Consumer Privacy Law\u2014Just so Long As You Can't Sue Them The long road of industry opposition\u2014and the extreme hypocrisy of now pretending to endorse[2] passage[3] of a comprehensive consumer privacy law\u2014is worth reflecting on in order to understand why in fact we have no law today. If we go back a little over a decade to a privacy scandal that launched a series of congressional hearings, we find a little company called NebuAd that specialized in deep packet inspection[4]. NebuAd's premise was scary in that it proposed to allow your ISP to record everything you do online and then monetize it with advertisers. I was a staffer on Capitol Hill when NebuAd came to Congress to explain their product, and still remember the general shock at the idea being proposed. In fact, the idea was so offensive it garnered bi-partisan opposition[5] from House leaders and ultimately led to the demise of NebuAd[6]. The legislative hearings that followed the growing understanding of 'deep packet inspection' led to discussions of a comprehensive privacy bill[7] in 2009. But despite widespread concern with developing industry practices as the technology was evolving, we never got anywhere out of concern for the freemium model of Internet products. It is hard to remember this time, but back then the Internet industry was still a fairly new thing to the public and Congress. The iPhone had just launched two years earlier, and the public was still in the process of transitioning from flip phones to smartphones. Only three years prior had Facebook become available to the general public. Google had only a small handful of vertical products, the newest being Google Voice\u2014which allowed people to text for free at a time when each text you sent cost a fee. All of these things were seen as net positive to users, yet all hinged on the monetization of personal information being relatively liability free. So for years policymakers, including an all out effort by the White House in 2012[8], searched for a means to balance privacy with innovation. Companies generally known as 'big tech' today were still very sympathetic entities in that the innovations they continued to produce were seen as both novel and useful to people. Therefore, their involvement was actively solicited by the White House in trying to jointly draft a means to promote privacy while allowing the industry to flourish. Ultimately, it was a wasted effort because what industry actually wanted was the liability free zone to be baked into law with little regard to increasing degradation of user privacy. It used to be that most of the Internet companies still had competitors with each other forcing them to try to be more attractive to users with greater privacy settings. Even Google Search was facing a direct assault by Microsoft with their fairly new Bing product. As efforts to figure out a privacy regime for Internet applications and services were being stalled by the Internet companies, progress was being made with the substantially more mature and the already regulated Internet Service Provider (ISP) industry. Congress had already passed a set of privacy laws for communications companies under Section 222 of the Communications Act, so a great many ISPs, being former telephone companies, had a comprehensive set of privacy laws applicable to them (including private rights of action). But their transition into broadband companies began to muddy the waters, particularly as the Federal Communications Commission started to say in 2005 that broadband was magically different and therefore should be quasi-regulated. Having learned nothing from the fiasco of NebuAd and potentially having 'deep packet inspection' banned for ISPs, other privacy invasive ideas kept getting rolled out by the broadband industry. Things such as 'search hijacking'\u2014where your search queries were monitored and rerouted[9]\u2014became a thing. AT&amp;#38;T began forcibly injecting ads into WiFi hotpots[10] at airports, wireless ISPs preinstalled 'Carrier IQ' on phones to track everything you did[11] (which ended when people sued them directly under a class action lawsuit[12]), and Verizon invented the 'super-cookie,' prompting a privacy enforcement response[13] from the FCC in 2014. Even after the FCC stopped treating broadband as uniquely different from other communications access technology in 2015, the industry continued to push the line. In that same year telecom carriers partnered with SAP Consumer Insight 365[9][14] to 'ingest' data from 20 to 25 million mobile subscribers close to 300 times every day (we do not know which mobile telephone companies participate in this practice, as that information is kept a secret). That data is used to inform retailers about customer browsing, geolocation, and demographic data. So unsurprisingly, the FCC came out with strong, clear ISP privacy rules in 2016[15] that continued the long tradition of privacy protections for our communication networks. However, the heavily captured Congress, which had never taken a major pro-privacy vote on Internet policy in close to a decade, quickly took action to repeal the widely supported FCC privacy rules[16] on behalf of AT&amp;#38;T and Comcast. Ironically, the creation of ISP privacy rules by the FCC only happened because Congress created a series of privacy laws, including private rights of action, for various aspects of our communication industry more than a decade prior. While many of the leaders of the ISP privacy repeal effort claim to be foes of big tech[17], they have done literally next to nothing to move a consumer privacy law. In fact, all they did was solidify the capture of Congress by giving AT&amp;#38;T and Comcast a reason to team up with Google and Facebook in opposing real privacy reform. EFF witnessed this joint industry opposition first hand as we attempted to rectify the damage Congress did to broadband privacy with a state law in California[18]. In fact, between ISPs and big tech we had absolutely no new privacy laws passed in the states in 2017 in response to Congress repealing ISP privacy rules. Despite the arrogant belief they could sustain perpetual capture at the legislative level, along came an individual named Alastair McTaggert who personally financed a ballot initiative[19] on personal privacy that later became the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). While they could 'convince' a legislator of the righteousness of their cause with political contributions, they had no real means to convince the individual that the status quo was good. After Cambridge Analytica and wireless carriers selling geolocation to a black market for bounty hunters, virtually no one thinks this industry should be unregulated on privacy. So rather than continue to publicly oppose real privacy protections, the industry has opted to pretend it supports a law just so long as it gets rid of state laws (including state private rights of action), putting all our eggs into the basket of a captured regulator. In other words, they only will support a federal privacy law if it further erodes our personal privacy rather than enhance it. This opening offer from industry is a wild departure from other privacy statutes that have all included an individual right to sue such as wiretaps[20], stored electronic communications[21], video rentals[22], driver's licenses[23], credit reporting[24], and cable subscriptions[25]. Not to miss their marching orders, industry-friendly legislators were quick to put together a legislative hearing on consumer privacy that literally had no one representing consumers[26]. But this game by industry, where so long as they can hold and finance enough legislators to prevent any real law from passing, will only last so long. Afterall, their effort to ban states from passing privacy laws is effectively dead once the Speaker of the House from California made it clear[27] she would not undermine her own state's law on behalf of industry. Furthermore, Senator Cantwell, a leader on the Senate Commerce Committee, has introduced comprehensive legislation[28] that includes a private right of action and more than a dozen Senators led by Senator Schatz have endorsed the concept supported by EFF of creating an information fiduciary[29]. As more and more legislators make publicly clear the parameters of what they consider a good law, it becomes harder for industry to sustain the behind the scenes opposition. But we are still far away from the end, which means more has to be done in the states until enough of Congress can break free of the industry shell game. If We Do Not Restore Trust in Internet Products, People Will Make Less Use of the Internet and That Comes with Serious Consequences As we wrestle with containing COVID-19, a solution being proposed by Apple and Google in the form of contact tracing is facing a serious hurdle. A majority of Americans do not want to use health data applications and services from these companies because they do not trust what[30] they will do with their information[31]. Since they can't directly punish these companies for abusing their personal health data, they are exercising the only real choice they have left: not to use them at all. Numerous federal studies from federal agencies such as the Department of Commerce[32], the Federal Trade Commission[33], and the FCC[34] all point to the same end result if we do not have real privacy protections in place for Internet activity. People will simply refrain from using applications and services that involve sensitive uses such as healthcare or finances. In fact, lack of trust in how our personal information is handled has a detrimental impact on broadband adoption in general. Meaning a growing number of people will just not use the Internet at all in order to keep their personal information to themselves. Given the systemic powerlessness users feel about their personal information when they use the Internet, the dampening effect it has on fully utilizing the Internet, and the loss of broadband adoption, it is fairly conclusive that the near liability free zone is an overall net negative as a public policy. Congress should be working to actively give users back their control, instead of letting the companies with the worst privacy track records dictate users' legal rights. Any new federal data privacy law must not preempt stronger state data privacy rules and contain a private right of action. While special tailoring has to be done for startups and new entrants with limited finances to ensure they can enter the market under the same conditions Google and Facebook launched, this is not true for big tech. Establishing clear lines of liability and rules for major corporate entities, efforts to launch the next privacy invasive tech will be scrutinized by corporate counsel eager to shield the company from legal trouble. That ultimately is the point of having a private right of action in law. It is not to flood companies with lawsuits, but rather for them to operate in a manner that avoids lawsuits. As users begin to understand that they have an inalienable legal right to privacy when they use the Internet, they will begin to trust the products with greater and more sensitive uses that will benefit them. This will open new lines of commerce as a growing number of users willingly engage in deeply personal interactions with next generation applications and services. For all the complaints industry has about consumer privacy laws, the one thing they never take into account is the importance of trust. Without it we start to lose the full potential of what the 21st century Internet can bring.

Others are delaying plans to go public. Hot new technologies like Bitcoin have been struggling.With all the nervous chatter out there - Where is this going? What's next? - I called on <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/marc_andreessen/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Marc Andreessen</url>, who has lived through a bubble or two (or three).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, has been at the epicenter of the technology business here for two decades. In the early 1990s, he was a co-founder of one of the first major web browsers, Netscape. He went on to start Ning, an early social site. Now, in addition to being voluble on <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/twitter/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Twitter</url>, he sits on the board of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Facebook</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/ebay_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">eBay</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/hewlett_packard_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Hewlett-Packard</url>.</p><p>I got 28 minutes with him. But Mr. Andreessen speaks so quickly, it felt like an hour and a half.</p><p>Saying \"bubble\" to a venture capitalist around here is like saying \"homework\" to a teenager. They roll their eyes and try to shoo you away. So rather than ask if we are in the middle of another - ahem - bubble, I asked Mr. Andreessen why some young companies can't seem to raise all the money they want.</p><p>His answer: conditions ebb and flow. And right now, they are ebbing for some companies. But for others, capital is still available.</p><p>\"We have not seen any pullback so far on private investment,\" Mr. Andreessen said. \"Actually, what we're seeing is more of the opposite right now. We're seeing a lot more institutional money - in particular from the hedge fund world - crossing over\" into tech investing.</p><p>But what about companies that can't find their way to the stock market, like Box and Square?</p><p>Mr. Andreessen pointed to 1997 and 1998, when the market for initial public stock offerings was briefly derailed by the Asian financial crisis. Before long, investor interest revved up again, and the Nasdaq stock market was flying high. (A few years later, of course, it came crashing down.)</p><p>So if a start-up can't go public just now, it's no big deal. \"The nature of the public market is that it is maniac depressive,\" Mr. Andreessen said. \"It gets excited, it gets depressed.\"</p><p>Speaking of feeling down, I asked Mr. Andreessen a question I often hear from people outside Silicon Valley: Why can't other places build their own valley-style tech hubs? People in cities ranging from Dublin to Berlin to New York often ask what they are doing wrong.</p><p>Mr. Andreessen said new valleys will eventually emerge. But they won't be Silicon Valley copycats.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, venture firms have invested in start-ups in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and all over China. L.A., for example, is home to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/technology/snapchat-reaches-settlement-with-federal-trade-commission.html\">Snapchat</url>, Tinder, Whisper,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/technology/facebook-to-buy-oculus-vr-maker-of-virtual-reality-headset.html\">Oculus VR</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/technology/facebook-to-buy-oculus-vr-maker-of-virtual-reality-headset.html\">Beats</url>, some of the big tech stories of the year. Mr. Andreessen said another hot place is Atlanta, the home of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/georgia_institute_of_technology/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Georgia Tech</url>.</p><p>But he offers a caveat.</p><p>\"My personal view is that Silicon Valley will continue to take a disproportionate share of the No. 1 positions in great new markets, and I think that's just a reflection that the fact that the valley works as well as it does,\" Mr. Andreessen said.</p><p>There is a caveat to his caveat.</p><p>In Mr. Andreessen's view, there shouldn't be 50 Silicon Valleys. Instead, there should be 50 different kinds of Silicon Valley. For example, there could be Biotech Valley, a Stem Cell Valley, a 3-D Printing Valley or a Drone Valley. As he noted, there are huge regulatory hurdles in many of these fields. If a city wanted to spur innovation around drones, for instance, it might have to remove any local legal barriers to flying unnamed aircraft.</p><p>So what kind of valley would <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>build? He is a big believer in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/technology/facebook-to-buy-oculus-vr-maker-of-virtual-reality-headset.html\">digital currencies like Bitcoin</url>, as well as in virtual reality. He says enterprises like Bitcoin will change the world on the scale that web browsers did. And before long, virtual reality will be, well, reality.</p><p>Don't believe him? Mr. Andreessen recalled similar skepticism in May 1994 when he was showing media and telecommunications executives this bizarre development called a web browser.</p><p>\"They pretty much told us we were out of minds and to go away,\" he said. Five years later, Netscape was sold to <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/aol-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">AOL</url> for $4.2 billion.</p><p>Finally, I couldn't end my discussion without asking him about Twitter. Over the past several months Mr. Andreessen <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/pmarca\">has become a mantle</url> on the social network, known for his long stream of tweets that have become known as the \"<person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://hiw.me/cdixon/status/438530737210273792\">tweetstorm</url>.\"</p><p>So Mr. Andreessen, why the long tweets?</p><p>\"My view is that 140 characters doesn't make sense anymore,\" he said. \"If it was me, I'd immediately raise the limit to 300 or 400 characters.\"</p><p>But if that doesn't happen, he's incredibly bullish on the service just the way it is. \"The counterargument is that there is magic to the limitation,\" he said, laying out a number of virtues around the limited character lengths. \"If Twitter doesn't adapt, I would not view them as being stupid.

Others are delaying plans to go public. Hot new technologies such as Bitcoin have been struggling. With all the nervous chatter out there - Where is this going? What's next? - I called on <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen, </nameText></person>who has lived through a bubble or two.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, has been at the epicentre of the tech business for two decades. In the early 1990s, he was a co-founder of one of the first major Web browsers, Netscape. He went on to start Ning, an early social site. Now, in addition to being voluble on Twitter, he sits on the boards of Facebook, eBay and Hewlett-Packard. I got 28 minutes with him. But Andreessen speaks so quickly, it felt like an 90 minutes.</p><p>Rather than ask if we are in the middle of another bubble, I asked Mr. Andreessen why some young companies can't seem to raise all the money they want. His answer: Conditions ebb and flow. And right now, they are ebbing for some companies. But for others, capital is still available.</p><p>\"We have not seen any pullback so far on private investment,\" he said. \"Actually, what we're seeing is more of the opposite. We're seeing a lot more institutional money - in particular from the hedge fund world - crossing over\" into tech investing.</p><p>But what about companies that can't find their way to the stock market, such as Box and Square? Mr. Andreessen pointed to 1997 and 1998, when the market for initial public stock offerings was briefly derailed by the Asian financial crisis. Before long, investor interest revved up again, and the Nasdaq stock market was flying high. (A few years later, of course, it came crashing down.) So if a startup can't go public just now, it's no big deal.</p><p>\"The nature of the public market is that it is manic depressive,\" Mr. Andreessen said. \"It gets excited; it gets depressed.\"</p><p>Speaking of feeling down, I asked Mr. Andreessen a question I often hear from people outside Silicon Valley: Why can't other places build their own valley-style tech hubs? People in cities as varied as Dublin, Berlin and New York often ask what they are doing wrong.</p><p>He said new valleys would eventually emerge. But they won't be Silicon Valley copycats.</p><p>In the past couple of years, venture firms have invested in startups in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and all over China. Los Angeles, for example, is home to Snapchat, Tinder,</p><p>Whisper, Oculus VR and Beats, some of the big tech stories of the year.</p><p>But he offers a caveat: \"My personal view is that Silicon Valley will continue to take a disproportionate share of the No. 1 positions in great new markets, and I think that's just a reflection on the fact that the valley works as well as it does,\" Mr. Andreessen said.</p><p>In Mr. Andreessen's view, there shouldn't be 50 Silicon Valleys. Instead, there should be 50 kinds of Silicon Valley. For example, there could be Biotech Valley, a Stem Cell Valley, a 3-D Printing Valley or a Drone Valley. As he noted, there are huge regulatory hurdles in many of these fields. If a city wanted to spur innovation around drones, for instance, it might have to remove any local legal barriers to flying unmanned aircraft.</p><p>So what kind of valley would Mr. Andreessen build? He is a big believer in digital currencies and in virtual reality. He says enterprises like Bitcoin will change the world on the scale that Web browsers did. And before long, virtual reality will be, well, reality.</p><p>Don't believe him? Mr. Andreessen recalled similar skepticism in May 1994 when he was showing media and telecommunications executives this bizarre development called a Web browser.</p><p>\"They pretty much told us we were out of our minds and to go away,\" he said. Five years later, Netscape was sold to AOL for US$4.2-billion.</p><p>Finally, I couldn't end my discussion without asking him about Twitter. In the past several months Mr. Andreessen has become a mantle on the social network, known for his long stream of tweets that have become known as the \"<person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>Tweetstorm.\"</p><p>\"My view is that 140 characters doesn't make sense anymore,\" he said. \"If it was me, I'd immediately raise the limit to 300 or 400 characters.\"</p><p>But if that doesn't happen, he's incredibly bullish on the service just the way it is.</p><p>\"The counter-argument is that there is magic to the limitation,\" he said, laying out a number of virtues around the limited character lengths. \"If Twitter doesn't adapt, I would not view them as being stupid. I just hope they change it because it would be a lot better for me.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images;  Venture capitalist and co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen, </nameText></person>sits on the boards of Facebook, eBay, and HP.;
