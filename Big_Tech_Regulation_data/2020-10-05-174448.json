As this continues -- the  Russian situation over the British spy poisoning incident, the Kremlin vows  to retaliate.</p><p>The fallout over the Stormy Daniels interview as the porn stars attorney  says there is more evidence to come.</p><p>And the stock market soars with the Dow having the biggest point gain since  2008.</p><p>This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>Good evening.  I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>The U.S. and more than a dozen European nations are expelling more than 100  Russian diplomats/intelligence officers/spies tonight in a unified show of  condemnation over the poisoning of a former Russian spy earlier this month  in England.  The Kremlin which has steadfastly denied involvement says it  will proceed from a principle of reciprocity.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening there -- Bret.</p><p>This wave of expulsions comes after officials both in the U.S. and in  Europe pointed to strong evidence that suggested, they say, that the  Russians were behind that deadly, certainly dangerous, nerve agent attack  on a former Russian spy on British soil.  And that, they say, was the solid  basis for further action.</p><p>In expelling 60 Russian diplomats the U.S. joined governments across the  globe in punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian  spy on British soil, an action the White House today called brazen and  reckless.  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We think that this  is not just an important message to send to the Russian government but it's  also, you know, significant in degrading their intelligence capabilities  around the world, not just in the United States.  </p><p>Along with the U.S., more than a dozen European Union countries, Ukraine,  and Canada all took action affecting more than 100 individuals in the  biggest western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold  War.</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May called the international response the  clearest indication yet of world solidarity against Moscow.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  It is part of a pattern of  increasingly aggressive Russian behavior.  But also represents the new and  dangerous phase in Russia's hostile activity against Europe and our shared  values and interests.  </p><p>CORKE:  Kremlin officials have denied being behind the attack on Sergei  Skripal and his daughter Yulia.  But they remain in critical condition.</p><p>Also today, the White House announced the closure of a Russian facility in  Seattle, just the latest in a series of actions directed toward the Kremlin  by the Trump administration countering a frequent narrative from critics  who often accuse Mr. Trump of being soft on Moscow.</p><p>The President previously ordered a cruise missile attack against Syria's  Bashar al-Assad.  He expanded sanctions on Moscow, gave lethal aid to  neighboring Ukraine, sent troops into Poland over Russian objections and  expanded oil exports into eastern Europe -- a crucial Russian economic  market.  </p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. (through translator):  What  the United States of America do today is they are destroying the little  that is left from the Russian-American relations.  The United States is  wholly responsible for the destruction of Russian-American relations.  </p><p>JON HUNTSMAN, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA:  The bonds between our people  remain strong.  The United States is ready to cooperate and forge a better  relationship between our two countries.  But that will only be possible  when Russia chooses to become a more responsible partner.  </p><p>CORKE:  Joel Rosenberg, author of the bestselling book \"the Kremlin  Conspiracy\" warns the latest moves by the White House are only a solid  first step.  </p><p>JOEL ROSENBERG, AUTHOR:  President Trump has to do much more.  He needs to  toughen up economic sanctions and really hit Putin's money, the oligarchs'  money.  And he needs to start putting more deterrent forces in Europe close  to Russia's border.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Very interesting conversation there.  By the way, Bret, we also  heard from the Russian Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Paskov.  He says that his  country would be guided by the principle of reciprocity in reaction to what  happened today, which is a not-so-subtle way of saying that dozens of  American diplomats could soon be making their way home -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn.  Kevin -- thank you.</p><p>Let's talk about the effects of the diplomatic expulsions.  Senior  political analyst Brit Hume is here with us tonight.</p><p>Good evening -- Brit.  Your thoughts on this and what it means.  </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, this is another  example of, I think a key lesson that people need to learn about the Trump  administration which is that what the President says and what he does are  frequently very different indeed.</p><p>All those things that Kevin just ticked off that the President has done  undermine Russian interests in many ways.  Indeed our whole energy policy  undermines Russian interest because it holds oil prices down and the  Russian economy really is built on that.  It has been described, as you  know Bret, as a gas station with nuclear weapons.</p><p>So that's but one example.</p><p>These expulsions today are another.  You know, that follows the closing of  the consulate in San Francisco earlier still.  And meanwhile, of course,  the President is calling Putin on the phone to congratulate him on his  victory.  And in many ways he's acting as if he's got a deep hunch that he  and Vladimir Putin are going to compose their relationship and have a real  cooperative arrangement.</p><p>But the actions he has taken do not indicate that he is pursuing that, at  least in terms of what he is doing.  So this is one example.</p><p>There are many others.  But that is something that we need to keep an eye  on.  Watch what he does, not so much what he says.  </p><p>BAIER:  Yes.  As you said, the critics are very loud and boisterous that  the President is not saying the right things and that he is not  communicating the message publicly.  But yet the list of things we just saw  in Kevin's piece obviously is action.</p><p>HUME:  Yes.  And look at another area here.  The President comes out and  says, you know, trade wars are easy to win.  And he imposes these sanctions  on steel and aluminum.  And the next thing you know, of course, he's  exempting allies right and left from that.  And now despite the fact that  there is supposed to be in effect with China we learned today, and the  stock market certainly noticed today, that negotiations are now underway to  work something out with China.</p><p>Again a case of saying one thing and the actions tend to point in another  direction, proving that as in so many instances, the President's bark is  worse than his bite.  </p><p>BAIER:  Where do you think this goes with Russia?  Do you think, Brit, this  is the beginning of another Cold War in essence?  </p><p>HUME:  Well, I think that, you know, relations are pretty tense.  And I  think it's almost certainly true that there will be expulsions of Americans  or other measures taken by Russia to respond to this.</p><p>But the question then becomes, all right, once that's done, what is the  message that Vladimir Putin takes away from these actions?  I think he will  probably take away the notion that President Trump, while he would like to  have a good relationship with him, is not really going to be pushed around  and that could lead in a positive direction.</p><p>Putin is a hard-eyed man who I think understands actions do obviously speak  louder than words.  And there may be a chance after this settles down a  little bit to forge a more cooperative relationship that would have to be  based on Russian behavior.</p><p>And as the analyst that you quoted in the earlier piece noted, there are  still further actions the U.S. could take that are well short of any  military action or I think, you know, truly, deeply belligerent that would  make a difference in Russia.  So we will see but we've got a long way to go  here.  </p><p>BAIER:  Brit -- as always, thank you.</p><p>HUME:  You bet -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Do you agree with the expulsion of the Russian diplomats?  Let us  know.  Do you think the Trump administration has been strong enough when it  comes to Russia?  Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier, you can use the  #SpecialReport; or on Facebook at facebook.com/BretBaierSR.</p><p>Back here at home, stocks surged today on Wall Street.  The Dow jumped 669  -- that is its biggest one-day point gain in ten years.  The S&amp;P 500 was up  70.  The Nasdaq finished ahead 228.  It is the best day in 17 years.</p><p>Let's talk about that.  Where the market is today, why, and maybe where  it's going.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of the Fox Business Network joins us from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre, big day.  </p><p>DEIDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Bret, it  certainly is.</p><p>So today's high highs make up about half of last week's low lows.  You said  it -- the Dow posting its biggest one-day point gain in about a decade, so  more than 650 points up, and all three indices logging their biggest rally  since August 2015.</p><p>So investors saw evidence of trade solutions instead of a trade war and  that helped sentiment.</p><p>ON Sunday U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said the administration  was quote, \"working on a pathway to see if we, the U.S. can reach an  agreement as to what fair trade is for them, meaning China.  So it seems as  if U.S. officials are meeting with Chinese officials behind closed doors,  away from the press, quietly seeking trade agreements and a completely  different tone to what we had last week which was angry public rhetoric on  both sides.</p><p>So tech stocks closed higher today as well.  That also helped overall  sentiment.  Even Facebook closed slightly higher after losing about 10  percent in the past five trading days.</p><p>So Facebook has a tough road ahead though.  For the second time since 2011,  the FTC is investigating the company's privacy practices.  The Senate  Judiciary Committee also inviting, but that means they probably can't say  no, the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and Google to testify in D.C. on April  10.  So more to come on privacy, big tech, and potential regulations.</p><p>In the meantime, Bret -- back to you.  </p><p>BAIER:  All right.  Deirdre - -thank you.</p><p>The chief law enforcement officers for 37 states and territories are  demanding to know when Facebook learned of a huge breach of privacy  protections.  Meanwhile the social media site is going old school, using  newspapers, of all things, to try to express its sorrow and commitment to  change.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse reports tonight from Los  Angeles.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data.  </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  That statement by  CEO Mark Zuckerberg carries new meaning today with the announcement on the  Federal Trade Commission's investigation into the social media giant.  </p><p>SAM LESTER, ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER:  Facebook represented to  its users that it had certain privacy protections in place when in fact, it  didn't.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  In 2011, Facebook agreed with an FTC mandate to obtain user  permission before sharing personal data with third-party apps.  Critics say  the company repeatedly violated that and the watchdog until now has shown  no teeth.  </p><p>LESTER:  If Facebook had complied with this consent order and if the FTC  had done its job and enforced it, then this whole mess with Cambridge  Analytica never would have happened.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  This weekend, Zuckerberg apologized in a full-page ad though  polls show many users already lost trust.  </p><p>SATITA (PH), UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA:  This isn't really a  personal issue of personal apology.  It's really about public policy,  consumer harm, consumer protection.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Last week the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked  Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill.  Today Senate Judiciary Chairman  Chuck Grassley did as well in a data privacy hearing scheduled for April  10.  </p><p>SENATOR MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA:  I think Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come  and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in the  newspaper.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Any inquiry will also involve Cambridge Analytica which  according to the \"Washington Post\" allowed dozens of foreign nationals to  work in 2014 U.S. election campaigns in violation of U.S. law.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  And the latest controversy for Facebook, an allegation that  it kept logs of phone calls and texts of Android users using the Facebook  messenger without their explicit consent.  The company claims by simply  signing up, users opted in -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  William -- thank you.</p><p>The President does not believe anyone threatened adult movie actress Stormy  Daniels who alleges a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.  That came from the  President's spokesman this afternoon after last nights interview with  Daniels on \"60 Minutes\".  The President's lawyers demanding an apology for  the implication he might have been involved.</p><p>Tonight Fox News media analyst and host of Fox's \"MEDIA BUZZ\" Howard Kurtz  has a recap of the Stormy Daniels interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS, DONALD TRUMP ACCUSER:  This is not a \"me too\".  I was not a  victim.  I've never said I was a victim</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST:  Stormy Daniels, as expected, told  CBS' Anderson Cooper that she had a one-time sexual encounter with Donald  Trump a dozen years ago.  </p><p>But some journalists are saying today that the porn actress failed to prove  her other allegations and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, drew criticism on  the morning shows including \"The View\" for overhyping the \"60 Minutes\"  appearance.</p><p>Avenatti had tweeted a picture of a CD, implying his client might have  photos or texts involving Trump but she refused to discuss that on CBS.</p><p>Daniels said that back in 2011 when she was going to tell her tale to a  magazine, a man confronted her in a parking lot and told her to leave Trump  alone and forget the story.  </p><p>DANIELS:  And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said  that's a beautiful little girl.  It would be a shame if something happened  to her mom.  </p><p>KURTZ:  But Daniels says she can't identify the man and didn't go the  police making the account impossible for others to verify.</p><p>Daniels said she accepted a $130,000 nondisclosure deal from Trump attorney  Michael Cohen because she didn't want the story to come out.  And she said  she later felt pressured, as recently as January, into releasing statements  denying any affair.  </p><p>DANIELS:  As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was \"They can make  your life hell in many different ways.\"</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  \"They\" being -- </p><p>DANIELS:  I'm not exactly sure who \"they\" were.  I believed it to be  Michael Cohen.  </p><p>KURTZ:  That speculation led Cohen to strongly deny any involvement in any  pressure and his lawyer to send her a cease-and-desist letter.</p><p>And today -- a White House denial.  </p><p>SHAH:  He's denied the accusations that she made last night and has been  consistent in doing so.  She is not.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ:  And late today in California, Stormy Daniels' attorney expanded her  legal complaint to include (ph) presidential attorney Michael Cohen of  defamation.</p><p>\"60 Minutes\" scored its biggest ratings in a decade.  And the Daniels suit  and litigation by other accusers might lead to legal complications for the  President.  But in the court of public opinion, the Stormy sit-down didn't  seem to move the needle -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Howie -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, is the U.S. being drawn in further to the Yemen civil war?  We  will take a look there.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 40 in Sacramento where the family of an unarmed African-American man  shot 20 times by police is calling for an independent investigation of his  death.  Twenty-two-year-old Stephon Clark was killed in the backyard of his  grandparents' home last week.  Police say they thought the cell phone he  was holding was a gun.  Clark's grandmother asked why officers did not use  a taser or other nonlethal force.</p><p>WDRB in Louisville as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will  try to bring hemp production back into the mainstream.  The Kentucky  senator says he will introduce legislation to legalize hemp as an  agricultural commodity.  Kentucky is one of several states using hemp for  research.</p><p>And this is a live look at Orlando from Fox 35, our affiliate there.  The  big story there tonight, lawyers for the wife of the Pulse Nightclub  shooter asked for a mistrial after learning her father's -- her husband's  father rather, was an informant for the FBI for 11 years.  The judge denied  the ruling late this afternoon.  Noor Salman is accused of aiding her  husband in the attack that killed 49 people in June of 2016.  Her attorneys  say the information about her father-in-law should have been disclosed  earlier.</p><p>That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>A senior U.S. Defense official confirms to Fox News federal agents have  found several suspicious packages delivered to military locations in the  Washington area.  The official says the destinations include Fort Belvoir,  Fort McNair, and the Dahlgren Naval Service Warfare Center.  One of those  packages reportedly tested positive for black powder and residue.  The  packages are being examined at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.   </p><p>We will bring you any late breaking details.</p><p>There are reports tonight a high level North Korean official is in Beijing.   Bloomberg, citing three sources, has even said it is North Korean leader  Kim Jong-un.  There has been no confirmation of this at this hour,  including from the White House.  Kim Jong-un has not made an international  trip since taking power in 2011 in North Korea.</p><p>There is considerable confusion tonight about just how effective Saudi  Arabia's U.S.-supplied missile defense system has been against rocket  attacks from Shiite rebels in Yemen.</p><p>Correspondent Conor Powell is watching that story from our Middle East  newsroom.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONOR POWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yemen's Houthi rebels celebrating as  they fired a barrage of missiles into Saudi Arabia.  At least three made it  as far as Riyadh, the Kingdom's capital.  One person was killed and two  injured.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At 11:00 p.m., we woke up to a loud sound.  We rushed  and ran out of the room as the explosion took place over the house.  </p><p>POWELL:  Saudi state TV claimed all the missiles were intercepted but this  video shows a U.S.-made Patriot antimissile changing course in midair and  crashing.</p><p>Last night's attack comes on the third anniversary of the Saudi-led  coalition launching military operations against the Houthis in what many  see as a proxy fight between Tehran and Riyadh.  The State Department  condemned the attack, saying \"We support the right of our Saudi partners to  defend their borders against these threats.\"</p><p>The conflict in Yemen though is turning into a humanitarian disaster with  more than 10,000 people dead and eight million now on the verge of  starvation.</p><p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is in the U.S. trying to shore up  support for the war.  America is a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia.   And the Pentagon has advisors in Riyadh.  But there are growing concerns on  Capitol Hill about America's participation in the conflict.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POWELL:  A bipartisan congressional effort to remove U.S. forces from the  conflict in Yemen was recently defeated, and President Trump has developed  a close working relationship with the Saudi Crown Prince with an eye  towards ramping up the pressure on Iran -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Conor Powell in our Middle East newsroom.  Conor -- thank you.</p><p>Two al Qaeda militants have been killed in the first U.S. drone strike in  Libya against the terror group.  The U.S. African command says no civilians  were hurt in the city of Ubari located in the Sahara desert.  The Pentagon  says al Qaeda has used southern Libya as a staging point for operations for  some time.</p><p>Back here in the U.S., gun maker Remington is filing for bankruptcy  protection.  The company makes the Bushmaster AR-15 style rifle that was  used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.  AR-15 style rifles  have been used in other mass shootings like the recent school shooting in  Parkland, Florida as well as the Las Vegas massacre.  Remington has faced  falling sales and lawsuits tied to that massacre since 2012.</p><p>Over the weekend, survivors of the school shootings in Parkland, Florida,  led a nationwide effort to promote gun control.  The epicenter of the  movement was Washington, D.C., but the effects could be felt all over.</p><p>Correspondent Garrett Tenney looks at what happened.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GARRET TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hundreds of thousands of people  took to the streets this past weekend to protest gun violence.  Organizers  of the student-led March for Our lives rallies are calling it the start of  a movement and a wake-up call for Congress ahead of this year's midterm  elections.  </p><p>DELANEY TARR, DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR:  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The  pressure is on for every person in power, and it will stay that way because  they know what is coming.  They know that if there is no assault weapons  ban passed then we will vote them out.</p><p>TENNEY:  The latest Fox News poll found overwhelming support for specific  gun-control measures, including 91 percent of voters who are in favor of  universal background checks on all gun buyers; 72 percent support raising  the minimum age to buy a gun to 21; and 60 percent in favor of banning  assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the motion is adopted -- </p><p>TENNEY:  Congress did include several reforms in its $1.3 trillion spending  bill last week.  Strengthening background checks and providing funding for  school safety measures.  But activists argue those measures aren't enough  and Democrats are hoping that frustration will help them in November.  </p><p>SENATOR TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA:  The activism in these young people is  actually changing the equation.  </p><p>TENNEY:  Gun control will be a complicated issue for Democrats particularly  in the Senate where they're defending seats in states like West Virginia,  North Dakota, Missouri, and Indiana where there is strong support for the  Second Amendment.  </p><p>GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM:  They have to be careful about embracing gun  control on a national level when there are going to be states and districts  that are not going to go for that.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TENNEY:  Retaking the House won't be easy for Democrats either though.  The  latest Fox News poll found a tightening race in voters' candidate  preferences with 46 percent saying that they back the Democratic candidate  in their district compared to 41 for the Republican.  That is a very  different picture from October though when Democrats were up by 15 -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Garrett -- thank you.</p><p>Keeping first responders safe during school shootings and other incidents  is becoming a focus for law enforcement.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Laura Ingle shows us how medical personnel and law  enforcement are learning to work together.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Trying to save lives while protecting  your own.</p><p>This is rescue task force training as close to a real-life active shooter  incident as it gets.</p><p>This drill being run by the National Center for Security and Preparedness  is using local EMS and law enforcement agencies in Poughkeepsie, New York.   The goal of this training is to bring rapid triage to victims under the  protection of armed officers.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have to stop the killing and we also have to stop  the dying.  </p><p>INGLE:  Paramedics learning the language and timed movements of armed entry  has been going on nationwide for years.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think I hear gunshots.  </p><p>INGLE:  And recent shootings like Parkland, Florida, some paramedics  reported being frustrated when they were held back until a scene is  declared safe or a cold zone.  A hot zone is when a shooter can directly  fire at you.  And these teams say a lot of good work can be done in the  warm zone when police are present and the danger level has dropped.  </p><p>SGT.

It involves longtime U.N. spokesman Rick  Grenell who is gay, a Republican, and supports the president.   Correspondent Rich Edson looks at the battle from the State Department.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a year into the Trump  administration, senior positions at the State Department and high profile  ambassador posts remain vacant.  Though last week as Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell tried to initiate a vote on the president's choice as  ambassador to Germany, Rick Grenell, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley  objective.  </p><p>SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, (D) OREGON:  I cannot in good faith support a nominee  who has a lengthy track record of tweets attacking both prominent  Democratic and prominent Republican women.  </p><p>EDSON:  Grenell has since apologized for tweets and comments he said were  intended to be funny and he says he regrets it.  In October the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee cleared his nomination.  </p><p>CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  It's a surreal  environment up there were the people who profess to care the most about  diplomacy, often Democrats, are holding up the most qualified would-be  diplomats.  </p><p>EDSON:  Republicans also point out the growing importance of the  relationship with Germany.  The United States is negotiating with the  Germans and other Europeans to change their policies towards Iran.  Without  an agreement President Trump says he is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear  deal.  </p><p>WHITON:  Germany right now is at a very important crossroads.  You have  Merkel in her final term, a coalition there that involves leftwing elements  where we really want to be pushing them away from their worst instincts.  </p><p>EDSON:  If confirmed Grenell would also be the highest profile openly gay  official in the Trump administration.  He served as the U.S. spokesman at  the United Nations during the Bush administration.  Though even as  Democrats slowed Grenell's confirmation, they point out the administration  still has no nominees for other significant State Department positions.   Beyond Germany about 40 ambassador jobs remain officially vacant with no  pending nominee for South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Cuba, the  European Union.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EDSON:  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson frequently argued with the White  House over staffing.  He is gone now and it's unclear if his successor, CIA  Director Mike Pompeo, if the Senate confirms him, will find better success  finding nominees.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Rich Edson at the State Department.  Rich, thanks.  </p><p>President Trump and his advisors are restarting an old conversation about  something called the line item veto.  The president says it's the only way  he can get his economic objectives past a democratic filibuster in the U.S.  Senate.  Correspondent Doug McKelway tells us tonight it is a road we as a  country have been done before.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  And tonight I ask you to give me  what 43 governors already have, give me a line item veto this year.  </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Generations of presidents wanted a  line item veto.  None had it until the Clinton administration when Congress  passed the line item veto act of 1996.  Clinton used it 82 times before the  Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional two years later.  That didn't stop  future presidents from wanting it.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I think there is not a president out  there who wouldn't love to have it.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Including President Trump who was clearly frustrated at the  Democratic leverage in the omnibus spending bill.  While that bill gave him  defense spending, it gave them domestic spending, and it gave taxpayers  more deficit spending.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm calling on Congress to  give me a line item veto for all government spending bills.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin repeated the president's call  on Sunday, paying no heed to its unconstitutionality.  </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think they should give the president  a line item veto.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  That was ruled unconstitutional by the  Supreme Court, sir.  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  Again, Congress could pass a rule that allows them to do it.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  But it would take a constitutional amendment, not just a rule.   Congress tried it in 2011 after the high court ruling.  It tinkered with a  more moderate version of a line item veto that attempted to maintain the  balance of power.  </p><p>BOB CUSACK, \"THE HILL\" EDITOR IN CHIEF:  The president would propose cuts  and then Congress would have to approve those cuts.  So the president  couldn't go in and strike everything that he wanted out.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  That bill ultimately died in the Senate.  So where does that  leave President Trump?  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  He wants to fix the budget  process, and his message to leaders in Congress of both parties is that if  something similar happens again he is much more inclined to veto it.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  So look out for September 30th.  That's the date that the  current funding bill runs out and the process then begins all over again  with a new impediment, the midterm elections just six weeks away.  Bret?  </p><p>BAIER:  Doug McKelway up on the Hill.  Doug, thanks.  </p><p>Up next, the panel on expelling Russian diplomats and what retaliation may  look like.  First, beyond our borders tonight.  Sixty-four people, many of  them children, are dead tonight following a fire at a shopping mall in  Siberia.  Officials say four people have been detained.  They say it  appears the fire alarms did not work and employees did not arrange for  evacuation there.  </p><p>Israeli police meantime again today questioning Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu in their ongoing corruption probe.  This was the second time  Netanyahu had been interviewed about allegations he promoted favorable  regulations for the country's telecom giant in exchange for favorable  coverage.  Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing.  </p><p>And Egyptians are voting in an election that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi  is virtually guaranteed to end.  His only challenger is a little-known  politician who joined the race at the last minute to spare the government  the embarrassment of a one candidate election after several hopefuls were  forced out or arrested.  </p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.  We will be  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  Today 18 countries have announced  their intention to expel more than 100 Russian intelligence officers from  their countries.  This is the largest collective expulsion of Russian  intelligence officers in history.  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  The president ordered the  expulsion of dozens of Russian intelligence officers and the closure of the  Russian consulate in Seattle.  </p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S.:  What the United States do  today is destroying the little that is left from the Russian-American  relations.  </p><p>SHAH:  We stand ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with  Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian government's  behavior.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Big moves today as the U.S. has an expulsion of Russian diplomats.   In fact there were 60 Russian diplomats being expelled, described as  aggressive intelligence collectors.  Forty-eight are now at the Russian  embassy, 12 at the U.N.  The Russian consulate, as mentioned, in Seattle  ordered closed due to a proximity to a submarine base and to Boeing, but  there's no specific threat or activity at that facility.</p><p>Individuals and their families have been given seven days to leave the U.S.   But the U.S. is not alone.  Actually 133 Russian diplomats have been  expelled from 20 countries.  And again, this is in response to the attack  on British soil, the poisoning of that U.S. -- of that spy, the British  spy, and his daughter.  </p><p>Let's bring our panel, see where this goes from here, Steve Hayes, editor  in chief for \"The Weekly Standard,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The  Federalist,\" and David Catanese, senior politics writer for \"U.S. News and  World Report.\" Steve, thoughts on today's action?  </p><p>STEVE HAYES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE WEEKLY STANDARD\":  I think it's a big  deal.  This is an impressive move.  The fact that the U.S. did it in  conjunction not only with the British allies but more than a dozen other  countries sends I think a pretty strong message to Russia that this kind of  behavior is not going to be tolerated, at least not tolerated for very long  without repercussions.  So I think it's a good move full stop.  </p><p>I think it would be better, the president could enhance this move or  strengthen it by saying something in his own voice.  Just last week he was  tweeting that we need better relations with Russia and that people who were  calling for him to confront Vladimir Putin on these poisonings or on  election meddling in the United States or calling on him not to  congratulate Vladimir Putin for a sham election, the president pushed back  on that and said that these are people who don't want good relations with  Russia, between the United States and Russia, and we are all better off if  there are good relations with the United States Russia.  </p><p>I think it's pretty clear Russia has no intention of behaving the way that  a civilized country would behave, and the president ought to make it  clearer still by saying something directly in his own voice.  </p><p>BAIER:  The kremlin's response, Mollie, is this, \"We deeply regret the  taken actions.  We are to analyze the situation following the decision by  number of countries to expel our diplomats.  The main analysis will be done  by our foreign ministry.  After that the president will seek proposals for  taking retaliatory steps.  A final decision will be made by the head of  state.  We have said more than once and we say once again, Russia has had  nothing to do with this affair whatsoever.  Naturally as before we will  proceed from the principle of reciprocity,\" Kremlin spokesman.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  Russia made this  decision to do this poisoning of a British citizen and his daughter, and  they also made the decision to not really respond to the concerns of the  world when they raised them.  And so now you have this action, more than a  dozen, almost two dozen countries expelling diplomats.  And it is a strong  action, and as Steve says, it does send a message.  </p><p>It's very difficult when you're doing with nuclear power to do much more  than send a message without risking nuclear conflict, but this is something  that so serious that more action really is needed.  I understand this is  the U.K.'s situation and we are in a supportive role even if we expelled  more diplomats than they did, but there are other actions that can be  taken.  Even the intelligence community report last year said anti-fracking  movements were something that the Russian government was funding and trying  to affect U.S. policy.  Doing something policy-wise they can really Russia,  or hurt them economically, might be a good way to ramp things up without  risking nuclear war.  </p><p>BAIER:  David?</p><p>DAVID CATANESE, SENIOR POLITICS WRITER, \"U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT\":  This  alleviates some of the critics that have pounded the Trump administration  for not acting on Russia, for not being forceful enough.  This is the  toughest action of the Trump administration has taken to date against  Russia.  </p><p>But I think you also have seen in statements today out of the Senate,  particularly from John McCain, that this is an opportunity to do more, that  this is an opportunity to move forward with economic sanctions and really  hit them hard.  </p><p>I also think it's going to be striking to watch, what is Putin's next move.   I already saw on social media today the Russian government putting out  polls saying how should we retaliate?  Which consulate of the Americans  should be close?  And I know there was talk even just last week after the  president's call with Putin that there was going to be maybe another  meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin.  That probably puts a  chill on that I think at least for the near term.  </p><p>BAIER:  Mollie, I just want to point out these FOX News polls.  The first  one is the president's job approval, job performance.  We have the latest  poll up to 45 percent approve, disapprove at 52 percent.  And there you can  see their previous track there.  And the second question, Russia's main  goal in election meddling -- chaos, doubt, U.S. democracy, sowing chaos, 57  percent helped Trump win, 21 percent helped Clinton win, five percent.</p><p>As you look at these polls and how people are perceiving the actions of the  president based on what Steve said, the want for the president to vocalize  it a little bit more or a lot more than he is about what's happening on  Russia, the actions are different than the voice.  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I actually think this kind of shows how silly this entire  narrative about the president not being strong against Russia.  Objectively  speaking he's been stronger than either of his two predecessors against  Russian aggression.  And it's not just with actions like today's which came  at the direction of the president.  They are not separate from the  president.  They were his actions that he recommended taking, and the White  House said that.  </p><p>It's also true that he's been really tough.  Even on the Iran deal which is  something Russia really wants the U.S. to stay in.  Actions in Syria,  missile-defense, any number of actions the president has actually been  quite tough.  And this narrative that he's not been tough, yes, people  might want rhetoric that is stronger, but actions count a lot in this  matter.  </p><p>BAIER:  I just want to play this one other sound bite.  This is Kevin Corke  asking the spokesman today about these actions and what they mean.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Does an attack on the soil of the  valued ally rise to the level of an active war?  Is that the  administration's policy?  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We have been joined at the  hip with U.K. on this matter, with the U.K. on this matter.  We stand  firmly with our ally.  Again, I'll classify this as brazen and reckless.  I  don't want to get ahead of anything the president may or may not announce  or declare later on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Where is the line, though, Steve, for an act of war against a  country?  </p><p>HAYES:  That's a good question.  It's something that comes up in the  context of our NATO alliance is.  Obviously Raj Shah I think for very  understandable reasons didn't want to answer that question directly,  certainly not in the affirmative.  That might present him some problems.  </p><p>BAIER:  Exactly.  Next up, the effort to break the diplomatic logjam in the  Senate, and more on that interview with Stormy Daniels.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, (D) OREGON:  I cannot in good faith support a nominee  who has a lengthy track record of tweets attacking both prominent  Democratic and prominent Republican women.  Since his nomination, these  tweets have continued, showing a complete disregard for the Senate  confirmation process and a disregard for the seriousness of the position to  which he is nominated.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, (R) WYOMING:  Today Democrats deliberately delay in  ways that limit us to a couple nominations in a typical week.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  There is one nomination that is pending, and a lot of talk about  what's not been filled.  But Rick Grenell is the nominee to be the U.S.  ambassador to Germany.  He is a former U.S. spokesman for -- at the U.N.  He's the Trump administration's first openly gay nominee.  He cleared the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee in October, awaiting a confirmation  vote.  There are a number of positions that have not been nominated yet,  but confirmed, 127, some career holdovers, nominated 18, and vacant without  nominees, 44.  The ambassador for Germany position is not one of them.   Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I think it is absurd to say that Rick Grenell is facing trouble  because of tweets that he made, and I don't take anyone really believes  that.  It is part of a larger anti-Trump or Democratic strategy to keep  Trump from having the people he needs in positions that are key so that  bureaucrats can continue to wield the power in those seats.  It's really  dangerous, though, when you have situations like the ambassador to Germany.   This is a very key post, and particularly if the new national security  advisor, John Bolton, moves forward in getting out of the Iran deal, you  really need someone in Germany.  Germany is becoming a much more important  place.  And it is something where the Trump administration and United  States in general could use a strong advocate such as Rick Grenell.  So  this delay is getting to the point of absurdity.  </p><p>BAIER:  David?</p><p>CATANESE:  We don't have ambassadors and three dozen countries.  So this is  the focal point this week because of a \"New York Times\" story, and I think  it also has to do because he would be the highest qualified or highest  serving openly gay official in the Trump administration.  But we don't have  ambassadors in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt.  </p><p>And if we are frank about this, a lot of these ambassador posts are rewards  to campaign donors.  So I think in different countries they matter at  different -- it's more significant in some countries that it is other  countries.  There's a lot of reports out there that staffing can do a lot  of these jobs.  And remember when Rex Tillerson, I know he is the outgoing  secretary of state, he was asked about this a couple weeks ago, and he  said, look, this isn't that big of a deal.  We can still move forward with  policy.  </p><p>And on foreign policy I think the one thing we have learned out of the  Trump administration is there is one man setting it, and that's President  Trump.  So look, this is a procedural battle, and I think there is also a  case to be made that Mitch McConnell, if he wanted to, hold the Senate open  all week long, have the debate, have a 30 hours.  But if Richard Grenell is  very important in Germany, you could also make the case for why don't we  have ambassadors and really key Middle East countries like I named, Saudi  Arabia, Egypt.  </p><p>BAIER:  Or even Korea.</p><p>CATANESE:  South Korea.  </p><p>BAIER:  OK, so big interview last night, \"60 Minutes,\" the fallout today.   Take a listen to a part of that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS:  I was in a parking lot going to a fitness class with my  infant daughter, taking the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper  bag, getting all the stuff out, and a guy walked up on me and said leave  Trump alone.  Forget the story.  And then he leaned around looked at my  daughter and said, a beautiful little girl.  It would be a shame if  something happened to her mom.  And then he was gone.  </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER:  Did you ever see the person again?  </p><p>DANIELS:  No.  But if I did, I would know it right away.  </p><p>COOPER:  Did you go to the police?  </p><p>DANIELS:  No.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why?</p><p>DANIELS:  Because I was scared.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The White House engaging, saying they don't believe that there was  a threat made.  Michael Cohen, the president's attorney, saying he doesn't  believe it.  Where does this go from here, Steve?  </p><p>HAYES:  Well, I don't think it goes away.  Stormy Daniels is not the most  credible accuser that President Trump has had.  She's lied specifically  about this incident.  She has said that she lied about this incident.  I  think the problem for President Trump is that there are many others who  have made similar allegations, whether we are talking about aggressive  behavior towards women or we are talking about his folks making thuggish  threats on journalists or others who could potentially do him harm.  </p><p>I don't think the story goes away in part because of the campaign finance  aspect of it.  Some people are shrugging that off and saying it's not a big  deal.  Really we're just talking about $130,000.  But if you stop and think  about what the substance of the case is, what the center of the case is,  it's that the president had, or the president's top lawyer allegedly paid  $130,000 in hush money shortly before the election because he had an affair  with a porn star.  That's a big deal.  No matter how you look at it, it's a  big deal.  And I think we'll learn more about how she wants to substantiate  her case if she's able to do so in the coming days.  </p><p>BAIER:  We will follow all aspect of it.  Panel, thank you very much.  When  we come back, a new kind of peacemaking.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BAIER:  Finally tonight, a power play that even hardcore politicians can  appreciate.  When the Colorado Mammoth took the on Vancouver Stealth in a  box lacrosse match Saturday in Denver, yes, lacrosse, things got a bit  testy between two of the players.  That's when referee Todd LaBranche  stepped in with an unusual penalty call.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These two are clearly having issues with each other,  could not restrain themselves, so we're going to give them two minutes to  think about what they have done.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  To think about what they've done, two minutes of reflection in the  box triggered plenty of comments on Twitter, fans praising LaBranche for  keeping the peace.  Maybe LaBranche should come to Washington, get the deal  makers to borrow a page from his playbook in solving that penalty issue.  </p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That's it for this SPECIAL  REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid.  \"The Story\" hosted by Martha  MacCallum, with reflection, starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

SPECIAL REPORT is up next.  Hey -- Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR:  Hey -- Kimberly.  Thank you.</p><p>President Trump kicks out dozens of Russians.  As this continues -- the  Russian situation over the British spy poisoning incident, the Kremlin vows  to retaliate.</p><p>The fallout over the Stormy Daniels interview as the porn stars attorney  says there is more evidence to come.</p><p>And the stock market soars with the Dow having the biggest point gain since  2008.</p><p>This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>Good evening.  I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>The U.S. and more than a dozen European nations are expelling more than 100  Russian diplomats/intelligence officers/spies tonight in a unified show of  condemnation over the poisoning of a former Russian spy earlier this month  in England.  The Kremlin which has steadfastly denied involvement says it  will proceed from a principle of reciprocity.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening there -- Bret.</p><p>This wave of expulsions comes after officials both in the U.S. and in  Europe pointed to strong evidence that suggested, they say, that the  Russians were behind that deadly, certainly dangerous, nerve agent attack  on a former Russian spy on British soil.  And that, they say, was the solid  basis for further action.</p><p>In expelling 60 Russian diplomats the U.S. joined governments across the  globe in punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian  spy on British soil, an action the White House today called brazen and  reckless.  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We think that this  is not just an important message to send to the Russian government but it's  also, you know, significant in degrading their intelligence capabilities  around the world, not just in the United States.  </p><p>Along with the U.S., more than a dozen European Union countries, Ukraine,  and Canada all took action affecting more than 100 individuals in the  biggest western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold  War.</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May called the international response the  clearest indication yet of world solidarity against Moscow.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  It is part of a pattern of  increasingly aggressive Russian behavior.  But also represents the new and  dangerous phase in Russia's hostile activity against Europe and our shared  values and interests.  </p><p>CORKE:  Kremlin officials have denied being behind the attack on Sergei  Skripal and his daughter Yulia.  But they remain in critical condition.</p><p>Also today, the White House announced the closure of a Russian facility in  Seattle, just the latest in a series of actions directed toward the Kremlin  by the Trump administration countering a frequent narrative from critics  who often accuse Mr. Trump of being soft on Moscow.</p><p>The President previously ordered a cruise missile attack against Syria's  Bashar al-Assad.  He expanded sanctions on Moscow, gave lethal aid to  neighboring Ukraine, sent troops into Poland over Russian objections and  expanded oil exports into eastern Europe -- a crucial Russian economic  market.  </p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. (through translator):  What  the United States of America do today is they are destroying the little  that is left from the Russian-American relations.  The United States is  wholly responsible for the destruction of Russian-American relations.  </p><p>JON HUNTSMAN, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA:  The bonds between our people  remain strong.  The United States is ready to cooperate and forge a better  relationship between our two countries.  But that will only be possible  when Russia chooses to become a more responsible partner.  </p><p>CORKE:  Joel Rosenberg, author of the bestselling book \"the Kremlin  Conspiracy\" warns the latest moves by the White House are only a solid  first step.  </p><p>JOEL ROSENBERG, AUTHOR:  President Trump has to do much more.  He needs to  toughen up economic sanctions and really hit Putin's money, the oligarchs'  money.  And he needs to start putting more deterrent forces in Europe close  to Russia's border.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Very interesting conversation there.  By the way, Bret, we also  heard from the Russian Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Paskov.  He says that his  country would be guided by the principle of reciprocity in reaction to what  happened today, which is a not-so-subtle way of saying that dozens of  American diplomats could soon be making their way home -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn.  Kevin -- thank you.</p><p>Let's talk about the effects of the diplomatic expulsions.  Senior  political analyst Brit Hume is here with us tonight.</p><p>Good evening -- Brit.  Your thoughts on this and what it means.  </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, this is another  example of, I think a key lesson that people need to learn about the Trump  administration which is that what the President says and what he does are  frequently very different indeed.</p><p>All those things that Kevin just ticked off that the President has done  undermine Russian interests in many ways.  Indeed our whole energy policy  undermines Russian interest because it holds oil prices down and the  Russian economy really is built on that.  It has been described, as you  know Bret, as a gas station with nuclear weapons.</p><p>So that's but one example.</p><p>These expulsions today are another.  You know, that follows the closing of  the consulate in San Francisco earlier still.  And meanwhile, of course,  the President is calling Putin on the phone to congratulate him on his  victory.  And in many ways he's acting as if he's got a deep hunch that he  and Vladimir Putin are going to compose their relationship and have a real  cooperative arrangement.</p><p>But the actions he has taken do not indicate that he is pursuing that, at  least in terms of what he is doing.  So this is one example.</p><p>There are many others.  But that is something that we need to keep an eye  on.  Watch what he does, not so much what he says.  </p><p>BAIER:  Yes.  As you said, the critics are very loud and boisterous that  the President is not saying the right things and that he is not  communicating the message publicly.  But yet the list of things we just saw  in Kevin's piece obviously is action.</p><p>HUME:  Yes.  And look at another area here.  The President comes out and  says, you know, trade wars are easy to win.  And he imposes these sanctions  on steel and aluminum.  And the next thing you know, of course, he's  exempting allies right and left from that.  And now despite the fact that  there is supposed to be in effect with China we learned today, and the  stock market certainly noticed today, that negotiations are now underway to  work something out with China.</p><p>Again a case of saying one thing and the actions tend to point in another  direction, proving that as in so many instances, the President's bark is  worse than his bite.  </p><p>BAIER:  Where do you think this goes with Russia?  Do you think, Brit, this  is the beginning of another Cold War in essence?  </p><p>HUME:  Well, I think that, you know, relations are pretty tense.  And I  think it's almost certainly true that there will be expulsions of Americans  or other measures taken by Russia to respond to this.</p><p>But the question then becomes, all right, once that's done, what is the  message that Vladimir Putin takes away from these actions?  I think he will  probably take away the notion that President Trump, while he would like to  have a good relationship with him, is not really going to be pushed around  and that could lead in a positive direction.</p><p>Putin is a hard-eyed man who I think understands actions do obviously speak  louder than words.  And there may be a chance after this settles down a  little bit to forge a more cooperative relationship that would have to be  based on Russian behavior.</p><p>And as the analyst that you quoted in the earlier piece noted, there are  still further actions the U.S. could take that are well short of any  military action or I think, you know, truly, deeply belligerent that would  make a difference in Russia.  So we will see but we've got a long way to go  here.  </p><p>BAIER:  Brit -- as always, thank you.</p><p>HUME:  You bet -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Do you agree with the expulsion of the Russian diplomats?  Let us  know.  Do you think the Trump administration has been strong enough when it  comes to Russia?  Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier, you can use the  #SpecialReport; or on Facebook at facebook.com/BretBaierSR.</p><p>Back here at home, stocks surged today on Wall Street.  The Dow jumped 669  -- that is its biggest one-day point gain in ten years.  The S&amp;P 500 was up  70.  The Nasdaq finished ahead 228.  It is the best day in 17 years.</p><p>Let's talk about that.  Where the market is today, why, and maybe where  it's going.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of the Fox Business Network joins us from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre, big day.  </p><p>DEIDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Bret, it  certainly is.</p><p>So today's high highs make up about half of last week's low lows.  You said  it -- the Dow posting its biggest one-day point gain in about a decade, so  more than 650 points up, and all three indices logging their biggest rally  since August 2015.</p><p>So investors saw evidence of trade solutions instead of a trade war and  that helped sentiment.</p><p>ON Sunday U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said the administration  was quote, \"working on a pathway to see if we, the U.S. can reach an  agreement as to what fair trade is for them, meaning China.  So it seems as  if U.S. officials are meeting with Chinese officials behind closed doors,  away from the press, quietly seeking trade agreements and a completely  different tone to what we had last week which was angry public rhetoric on  both sides.</p><p>So tech stocks closed higher today as well.  That also helped overall  sentiment.  Even Facebook closed slightly higher after losing about 10  percent in the past five trading days.</p><p>So Facebook has a tough road ahead though.  For the second time since 2011,  the FTC is investigating the company's privacy practices.  The Senate  Judiciary Committee also inviting, but that means they probably can't say  no, the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and Google to testify in D.C. on April  10.  So more to come on privacy, big tech, and potential regulations.</p><p>In the meantime, Bret -- back to you.  </p><p>BAIER:  All right.  Deirdre - -thank you.</p><p>The chief law enforcement officers for 37 states and territories are  demanding to know when Facebook learned of a huge breach of privacy  protections.  Meanwhile the social media site is going old school, using  newspapers, of all things, to try to express its sorrow and commitment to  change.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse reports tonight from Los  Angeles.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data.  </p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  That statement by  CEO Mark Zuckerberg carries new meaning today with the announcement on the  Federal Trade Commission's investigation into the social media giant.  </p><p>SAM LESTER, ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER:  Facebook represented to  its users that it had certain privacy protections in place when in fact, it  didn't.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  In 2011, Facebook agreed with an FTC mandate to obtain user  permission before sharing personal data with third-party apps.  Critics say  the company repeatedly violated that and the watchdog until now has shown  no teeth.  </p><p>LESTER:  If Facebook had complied with this consent order and if the FTC  had done its job and enforced it, then this whole mess with Cambridge  Analytica never would have happened.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  This weekend, Zuckerberg apologized in a full-page ad though  polls show many users already lost trust.  </p><p>SATITA (PH), UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA:  This isn't really a  personal issue of personal apology.  It's really about public policy,  consumer harm, consumer protection.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Last week the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked  Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill.  Today Senate Judiciary Chairman  Chuck Grassley did as well in a data privacy hearing scheduled for April  10.  </p><p>SENATOR MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA:  I think Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come  and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in the  newspaper.  </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Any inquiry will also involve Cambridge Analytica which  according to the \"Washington Post\" allowed dozens of foreign nationals to  work in 2014 U.S. election campaigns in violation of U.S. law.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  And the latest controversy for Facebook, an allegation that  it kept logs of phone calls and texts of Android users using the Facebook  messenger without their explicit consent.  The company claims by simply  signing up, users opted in -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  William -- thank you.</p><p>The President does not believe anyone threatened adult movie actress Stormy  Daniels who alleges a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.  That came from the  President's spokesman this afternoon after last nights interview with  Daniels on \"60 Minutes\".  The President's lawyers demanding an apology for  the implication he might have been involved.</p><p>Tonight Fox News media analyst and host of Fox's \"MEDIA BUZZ\" Howard Kurtz  has a recap of the Stormy Daniels interview.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS, DONALD TRUMP ACCUSER:  This is not a \"me too\".  I was not a  victim.  I've never said I was a victim</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST:  Stormy Daniels, as expected, told  CBS' Anderson Cooper that she had a one-time sexual encounter with Donald  Trump a dozen years ago.  </p><p>But some journalists are saying today that the porn actress failed to prove  her other allegations and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, drew criticism on  the morning shows including \"The View\" for overhyping the \"60 Minutes\"  appearance.</p><p>Avenatti had tweeted a picture of a CD, implying his client might have  photos or texts involving Trump but she refused to discuss that on CBS.</p><p>Daniels said that back in 2011 when she was going to tell her tale to a  magazine, a man confronted her in a parking lot and told her to leave Trump  alone and forget the story.  </p><p>DANIELS:  And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said  that's a beautiful little girl.  It would be a shame if something happened  to her mom.  </p><p>KURTZ:  But Daniels says she can't identify the man and didn't go the  police making the account impossible for others to verify.</p><p>Daniels said she accepted a $130,000 nondisclosure deal from Trump attorney  Michael Cohen because she didn't want the story to come out.  And she said  she later felt pressured, as recently as January, into releasing statements  denying any affair.  </p><p>DANIELS:  As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was \"They can make  your life hell in many different ways.\"</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  \"They\" being -- </p><p>DANIELS:  I'm not exactly sure who \"they\" were.  I believed it to be  Michael Cohen.  </p><p>KURTZ:  That speculation led Cohen to strongly deny any involvement in any  pressure and his lawyer to send her a cease-and-desist letter.</p><p>And today -- a White House denial.  </p><p>SHAH:  He's denied the accusations that she made last night and has been  consistent in doing so.  She is not.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ:  And late today in California, Stormy Daniels' attorney expanded her  legal complaint to include (ph) presidential attorney Michael Cohen of  defamation.</p><p>\"60 Minutes\" scored its biggest ratings in a decade.  And the Daniels suit  and litigation by other accusers might lead to legal complications for the  President.  But in the court of public opinion, the Stormy sit-down didn't  seem to move the needle -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Howie -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, is the U.S. being drawn in further to the Yemen civil war?  We  will take a look there.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 40 in Sacramento where the family of an unarmed African-American man  shot 20 times by police is calling for an independent investigation of his  death.  Twenty-two-year-old Stephon Clark was killed in the backyard of his  grandparents' home last week.  Police say they thought the cell phone he  was holding was a gun.  Clark's grandmother asked why officers did not use  a taser or other nonlethal force.</p><p>WDRB in Louisville as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will  try to bring hemp production back into the mainstream.  The Kentucky  senator says he will introduce legislation to legalize hemp as an  agricultural commodity.  Kentucky is one of several states using hemp for  research.</p><p>And this is a live look at Orlando from Fox 35, our affiliate there.  The  big story there tonight, lawyers for the wife of the Pulse Nightclub  shooter asked for a mistrial after learning her father's -- her husband's  father rather, was an informant for the FBI for 11 years.  The judge denied  the ruling late this afternoon.  Noor Salman is accused of aiding her  husband in the attack that killed 49 people in June of 2016.  Her attorneys  say the information about her father-in-law should have been disclosed  earlier.</p><p>That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>A senior U.S. Defense official confirms to Fox News federal agents have  found several suspicious packages delivered to military locations in the  Washington area.  The official says the destinations include Fort Belvoir,  Fort McNair, and the Dahlgren Naval Service Warfare Center.  One of those  packages reportedly tested positive for black powder and residue.  The  packages are being examined at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.   </p><p>We will bring you any late breaking details.</p><p>There are reports tonight a high level North Korean official is in Beijing.   Bloomberg, citing three sources, has even said it is North Korean leader  Kim Jong-un.  There has been no confirmation of this at this hour,  including from the White House.  Kim Jong-un has not made an international  trip since taking power in 2011 in North Korea.</p><p>There is considerable confusion tonight about just how effective Saudi  Arabia's U.S.-supplied missile defense system has been against rocket  attacks from Shiite rebels in Yemen.</p><p>Correspondent Conor Powell is watching that story from our Middle East  newsroom.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONOR POWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yemen's Houthi rebels celebrating as  they fired a barrage of missiles into Saudi Arabia.  At least three made it  as far as Riyadh, the Kingdom's capital.  One person was killed and two  injured.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At 11:00 p.m., we woke up to a loud sound.  We rushed  and ran out of the room as the explosion took place over the house.  </p><p>POWELL:  Saudi state TV claimed all the missiles were intercepted but this  video shows a U.S.-made Patriot antimissile changing course in midair and  crashing.</p><p>Last night's attack comes on the third anniversary of the Saudi-led  coalition launching military operations against the Houthis in what many  see as a proxy fight between Tehran and Riyadh.  The State Department  condemned the attack, saying \"We support the right of our Saudi partners to  defend their borders against these threats.\"</p><p>The conflict in Yemen though is turning into a humanitarian disaster with  more than 10,000 people dead and eight million now on the verge of  starvation.</p><p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is in the U.S. trying to shore up  support for the war.  America is a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia.   And the Pentagon has advisors in Riyadh.  But there are growing concerns on  Capitol Hill about America's participation in the conflict.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POWELL:  A bipartisan congressional effort to remove U.S. forces from the  conflict in Yemen was recently defeated, and President Trump has developed  a close working relationship with the Saudi Crown Prince with an eye  towards ramping up the pressure on Iran -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Conor Powell in our Middle East newsroom.  Conor -- thank you.</p><p>Two al Qaeda militants have been killed in the first U.S. drone strike in  Libya against the terror group.  The U.S. African command says no civilians  were hurt in the city of Ubari located in the Sahara desert.  The Pentagon  says al Qaeda has used southern Libya as a staging point for operations for  some time.</p><p>Back here in the U.S., gun maker Remington is filing for bankruptcy  protection.  The company makes the Bushmaster AR-15 style rifle that was  used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.  AR-15 style rifles  have been used in other mass shootings like the recent school shooting in  Parkland, Florida as well as the Las Vegas massacre.  Remington has faced  falling sales and lawsuits tied to that massacre since 2012.</p><p>Over the weekend, survivors of the school shootings in Parkland, Florida,  led a nationwide effort to promote gun control.  The epicenter of the  movement was Washington, D.C., but the effects could be felt all over.</p><p>Correspondent Garrett Tenney looks at what happened.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GARRET TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hundreds of thousands of people  took to the streets this past weekend to protest gun violence.  Organizers  of the student-led March for Our lives rallies are calling it the start of  a movement and a wake-up call for Congress ahead of this year's midterm  elections.  </p><p>DELANEY TARR, DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR:  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The  pressure is on for every person in power, and it will stay that way because  they know what is coming.  They know that if there is no assault weapons  ban passed then we will vote them out.</p><p>TENNEY:  The latest Fox News poll found overwhelming support for specific  gun-control measures, including 91 percent of voters who are in favor of  universal background checks on all gun buyers; 72 percent support raising  the minimum age to buy a gun to 21; and 60 percent in favor of banning  assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the motion is adopted -- </p><p>TENNEY:  Congress did include several reforms in its $1.3 trillion spending  bill last week.  Strengthening background checks and providing funding for  school safety measures.  But activists argue those measures aren't enough  and Democrats are hoping that frustration will help them in November.  </p><p>SENATOR TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA:  The activism in these young people is  actually changing the equation.  </p><p>TENNEY:  Gun control will be a complicated issue for Democrats particularly  in the Senate where they're defending seats in states like West Virginia,  North Dakota, Missouri, and Indiana where there is strong support for the  Second Amendment.  </p><p>GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM:  They have to be careful about embracing gun  control on a national level when there are going to be states and districts  that are not going to go for that.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TENNEY:  Retaking the House won't be easy for Democrats either though.  The  latest Fox News poll found a tightening race in voters' candidate  preferences with 46 percent saying that they back the Democratic candidate  in their district compared to 41 for the Republican.  That is a very  different picture from October though when Democrats were up by 15 -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Garrett -- thank you.</p><p>Keeping first responders safe during school shootings and other incidents  is becoming a focus for law enforcement.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Laura Ingle shows us how medical personnel and law  enforcement are learning to work together.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Trying to save lives while protecting  your own.</p><p>This is rescue task force training as close to a real-life active shooter  incident as it gets.</p><p>This drill being run by the National Center for Security and Preparedness  is using local EMS and law enforcement agencies in Poughkeepsie, New York.

A hot zone is when a shooter can directly  fire at you.  And these teams say a lot of good work can be done in the  warm zone when police are present and the danger level has dropped.  </p><p>SGT. PATRICK BARRY, POUGHKEEPSIE, NEW YORK:  That's why we call in a warm  zone, you know, it's not totally, let's say, a safe environment.  We are  still on guard.  </p><p>CHRIS STRATHAM, NATIONAL CENTER FOR SECURITY AND PREPAREDNESS:  I need the  police officers focused on the threat and the medics focused on the  medicine.  </p><p>INGLE:  Both the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA have issued  guidelines for active shooter incidents but there is not a federal mandate  on how agencies should work in tandem.  With more active shooter situations  unfolding across the U.S., some agencies are ramping up their own training  so that victims aren't waiting any longer than they have to.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>INGLE:  Those who run rescue task force training say these drills will keep  evolving as paramedics and law enforcement continue to learn to work  together to save lives -- Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  Laura -- thank you.</p><p>Does President Trump have any chance of resurrecting the line item veto?   We will look at that next.</p><p>But first, the woman behind the Supreme Court case that ended school  segregation in the U.S. has died.  Linda Brown was a little girl in Topeka  when she became the center of the 1954 Brown versus Board of Education  landmark decision.  Linda Brown -- dead at the age of 76.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  An unusual coalition is putting pressure on  Senate Democrats to move ahead with one of President Trump's most high- profile ambassador nominations.  It involves longtime U.N. spokesman Rick  Grenell who is gay, a Republican, and supports the president.   Correspondent Rich Edson looks at the battle from the State Department.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a year into the Trump  administration, senior positions at the State Department and high profile  ambassador posts remain vacant.  Though last week as Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell tried to initiate a vote on the president's choice as  ambassador to Germany, Rick Grenell, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley  objective.  </p><p>SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, (D) OREGON:  I cannot in good faith support a nominee  who has a lengthy track record of tweets attacking both prominent  Democratic and prominent Republican women.  </p><p>EDSON:  Grenell has since apologized for tweets and comments he said were  intended to be funny and he says he regrets it.  In October the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee cleared his nomination.  </p><p>CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  It's a surreal  environment up there were the people who profess to care the most about  diplomacy, often Democrats, are holding up the most qualified would-be  diplomats.  </p><p>EDSON:  Republicans also point out the growing importance of the  relationship with Germany.  The United States is negotiating with the  Germans and other Europeans to change their policies towards Iran.  Without  an agreement President Trump says he is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear  deal.  </p><p>WHITON:  Germany right now is at a very important crossroads.  You have  Merkel in her final term, a coalition there that involves leftwing elements  where we really want to be pushing them away from their worst instincts.  </p><p>EDSON:  If confirmed Grenell would also be the highest profile openly gay  official in the Trump administration.  He served as the U.S. spokesman at  the United Nations during the Bush administration.  Though even as  Democrats slowed Grenell's confirmation, they point out the administration  still has no nominees for other significant State Department positions.   Beyond Germany about 40 ambassador jobs remain officially vacant with no  pending nominee for South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Cuba, the  European Union.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EDSON:  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson frequently argued with the White  House over staffing.  He is gone now and it's unclear if his successor, CIA  Director Mike Pompeo, if the Senate confirms him, will find better success  finding nominees.  Bret?</p><p>BAIER:  Rich Edson at the State Department.  Rich, thanks.  </p><p>President Trump and his advisors are restarting an old conversation about  something called the line item veto.  The president says it's the only way  he can get his economic objectives past a democratic filibuster in the U.S.  Senate.  Correspondent Doug McKelway tells us tonight it is a road we as a  country have been done before.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  And tonight I ask you to give me  what 43 governors already have, give me a line item veto this year.  </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Generations of presidents wanted a  line item veto.  None had it until the Clinton administration when Congress  passed the line item veto act of 1996.  Clinton used it 82 times before the  Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional two years later.  That didn't stop  future presidents from wanting it.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I think there is not a president out  there who wouldn't love to have it.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Including President Trump who was clearly frustrated at the  Democratic leverage in the omnibus spending bill.  While that bill gave him  defense spending, it gave them domestic spending, and it gave taxpayers  more deficit spending.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm calling on Congress to  give me a line item veto for all government spending bills.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin repeated the president's call  on Sunday, paying no heed to its unconstitutionality.  </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think they should give the president  a line item veto.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  That was ruled unconstitutional by the  Supreme Court, sir.  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  Again, Congress could pass a rule that allows them to do it.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  But it would take a constitutional amendment, not just a rule.   Congress tried it in 2011 after the high court ruling.  It tinkered with a  more moderate version of a line item veto that attempted to maintain the  balance of power.  </p><p>BOB CUSACK, \"THE HILL\" EDITOR IN CHIEF:  The president would propose cuts  and then Congress would have to approve those cuts.  So the president  couldn't go in and strike everything that he wanted out.  </p><p>MCKELWAY:  That bill ultimately died in the Senate.  So where does that  leave President Trump?  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  He wants to fix the budget  process, and his message to leaders in Congress of both parties is that if  something similar happens again he is much more inclined to veto it.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  So look out for September 30th.  That's the date that the  current funding bill runs out and the process then begins all over again  with a new impediment, the midterm elections just six weeks away.  Bret?  </p><p>BAIER:  Doug McKelway up on the Hill.  Doug, thanks.  </p><p>Up next, the panel on expelling Russian diplomats and what retaliation may  look like.  First, beyond our borders tonight.  Sixty-four people, many of  them children, are dead tonight following a fire at a shopping mall in  Siberia.  Officials say four people have been detained.  They say it  appears the fire alarms did not work and employees did not arrange for  evacuation there.  </p><p>Israeli police meantime again today questioning Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu in their ongoing corruption probe.  This was the second time  Netanyahu had been interviewed about allegations he promoted favorable  regulations for the country's telecom giant in exchange for favorable  coverage.  Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing.  </p><p>And Egyptians are voting in an election that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi  is virtually guaranteed to end.  His only challenger is a little-known  politician who joined the race at the last minute to spare the government  the embarrassment of a one candidate election after several hopefuls were  forced out or arrested.  </p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.  We will be  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  Today 18 countries have announced  their intention to expel more than 100 Russian intelligence officers from  their countries.  This is the largest collective expulsion of Russian  intelligence officers in history.  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  The president ordered the  expulsion of dozens of Russian intelligence officers and the closure of the  Russian consulate in Seattle.  </p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S.:  What the United States do  today is destroying the little that is left from the Russian-American  relations.  </p><p>SHAH:  We stand ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with  Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian government's  behavior.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Big moves today as the U.S. has an expulsion of Russian diplomats.   In fact there were 60 Russian diplomats being expelled, described as  aggressive intelligence collectors.  Forty-eight are now at the Russian  embassy, 12 at the U.N.  The Russian consulate, as mentioned, in Seattle  ordered closed due to a proximity to a submarine base and to Boeing, but  there's no specific threat or activity at that facility.</p><p>Individuals and their families have been given seven days to leave the U.S.   But the U.S. is not alone.  Actually 133 Russian diplomats have been  expelled from 20 countries.  And again, this is in response to the attack  on British soil, the poisoning of that U.S. -- of that spy, the British  spy, and his daughter.  </p><p>Let's bring our panel, see where this goes from here, Steve Hayes, editor  in chief for \"The Weekly Standard,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The  Federalist,\" and David Catanese, senior politics writer for \"U.S. News and  World Report.\" Steve, thoughts on today's action?  </p><p>STEVE HAYES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE WEEKLY STANDARD\":  I think it's a big  deal.  This is an impressive move.  The fact that the U.S. did it in  conjunction not only with the British allies but more than a dozen other  countries sends I think a pretty strong message to Russia that this kind of  behavior is not going to be tolerated, at least not tolerated for very long  without repercussions.  So I think it's a good move full stop.  </p><p>I think it would be better, the president could enhance this move or  strengthen it by saying something in his own voice.  Just last week he was  tweeting that we need better relations with Russia and that people who were  calling for him to confront Vladimir Putin on these poisonings or on  election meddling in the United States or calling on him not to  congratulate Vladimir Putin for a sham election, the president pushed back  on that and said that these are people who don't want good relations with  Russia, between the United States and Russia, and we are all better off if  there are good relations with the United States Russia.  </p><p>I think it's pretty clear Russia has no intention of behaving the way that  a civilized country would behave, and the president ought to make it  clearer still by saying something directly in his own voice.  </p><p>BAIER:  The kremlin's response, Mollie, is this, \"We deeply regret the  taken actions.  We are to analyze the situation following the decision by  number of countries to expel our diplomats.  The main analysis will be done  by our foreign ministry.  After that the president will seek proposals for  taking retaliatory steps.  A final decision will be made by the head of  state.  We have said more than once and we say once again, Russia has had  nothing to do with this affair whatsoever.  Naturally as before we will  proceed from the principle of reciprocity,\" Kremlin spokesman.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  Russia made this  decision to do this poisoning of a British citizen and his daughter, and  they also made the decision to not really respond to the concerns of the  world when they raised them.  And so now you have this action, more than a  dozen, almost two dozen countries expelling diplomats.  And it is a strong  action, and as Steve says, it does send a message.  </p><p>It's very difficult when you're doing with nuclear power to do much more  than send a message without risking nuclear conflict, but this is something  that so serious that more action really is needed.  I understand this is  the U.K.'s situation and we are in a supportive role even if we expelled  more diplomats than they did, but there are other actions that can be  taken.  Even the intelligence community report last year said anti-fracking  movements were something that the Russian government was funding and trying  to affect U.S. policy.  Doing something policy-wise they can really Russia,  or hurt them economically, might be a good way to ramp things up without  risking nuclear war.  </p><p>BAIER:  David?</p><p>DAVID CATANESE, SENIOR POLITICS WRITER, \"U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT\":  This  alleviates some of the critics that have pounded the Trump administration  for not acting on Russia, for not being forceful enough.  This is the  toughest action of the Trump administration has taken to date against  Russia.  </p><p>But I think you also have seen in statements today out of the Senate,  particularly from John McCain, that this is an opportunity to do more, that  this is an opportunity to move forward with economic sanctions and really  hit them hard.  </p><p>I also think it's going to be striking to watch, what is Putin's next move.   I already saw on social media today the Russian government putting out  polls saying how should we retaliate?  Which consulate of the Americans  should be close?  And I know there was talk even just last week after the  president's call with Putin that there was going to be maybe another  meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin.  That probably puts a  chill on that I think at least for the near term.  </p><p>BAIER:  Mollie, I just want to point out these FOX News polls.  The first  one is the president's job approval, job performance.  We have the latest  poll up to 45 percent approve, disapprove at 52 percent.  And there you can  see their previous track there.  And the second question, Russia's main  goal in election meddling -- chaos, doubt, U.S. democracy, sowing chaos, 57  percent helped Trump win, 21 percent helped Clinton win, five percent.</p><p>As you look at these polls and how people are perceiving the actions of the  president based on what Steve said, the want for the president to vocalize  it a little bit more or a lot more than he is about what's happening on  Russia, the actions are different than the voice.  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I actually think this kind of shows how silly this entire  narrative about the president not being strong against Russia.  Objectively  speaking he's been stronger than either of his two predecessors against  Russian aggression.  And it's not just with actions like today's which came  at the direction of the president.  They are not separate from the  president.  They were his actions that he recommended taking, and the White  House said that.  </p><p>It's also true that he's been really tough.  Even on the Iran deal which is  something Russia really wants the U.S. to stay in.  Actions in Syria,  missile-defense, any number of actions the president has actually been  quite tough.  And this narrative that he's not been tough, yes, people  might want rhetoric that is stronger, but actions count a lot in this  matter.  </p><p>BAIER:  I just want to play this one other sound bite.  This is Kevin Corke  asking the spokesman today about these actions and what they mean.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Does an attack on the soil of the  valued ally rise to the level of an active war?  Is that the  administration's policy?  </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  We have been joined at the  hip with U.K. on this matter, with the U.K. on this matter.  We stand  firmly with our ally.  Again, I'll classify this as brazen and reckless.  I  don't want to get ahead of anything the president may or may not announce  or declare later on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Where is the line, though, Steve, for an act of war against a  country?  </p><p>HAYES:  That's a good question.  It's something that comes up in the  context of our NATO alliance is.  Obviously Raj Shah I think for very  understandable reasons didn't want to answer that question directly,  certainly not in the affirmative.  That might present him some problems.  </p><p>BAIER:  Exactly.  Next up, the effort to break the diplomatic logjam in the  Senate, and more on that interview with Stormy Daniels.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, (D) OREGON:  I cannot in good faith support a nominee  who has a lengthy track record of tweets attacking both prominent  Democratic and prominent Republican women.  Since his nomination, these  tweets have continued, showing a complete disregard for the Senate  confirmation process and a disregard for the seriousness of the position to  which he is nominated.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, (R) WYOMING:  Today Democrats deliberately delay in  ways that limit us to a couple nominations in a typical week.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  There is one nomination that is pending, and a lot of talk about  what's not been filled.  But Rick Grenell is the nominee to be the U.S.  ambassador to Germany.  He is a former U.S. spokesman for -- at the U.N.  He's the Trump administration's first openly gay nominee.  He cleared the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee in October, awaiting a confirmation  vote.  There are a number of positions that have not been nominated yet,  but confirmed, 127, some career holdovers, nominated 18, and vacant without  nominees, 44.  The ambassador for Germany position is not one of them.   Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I think it is absurd to say that Rick Grenell is facing trouble  because of tweets that he made, and I don't take anyone really believes  that.  It is part of a larger anti-Trump or Democratic strategy to keep  Trump from having the people he needs in positions that are key so that  bureaucrats can continue to wield the power in those seats.  It's really  dangerous, though, when you have situations like the ambassador to Germany.   This is a very key post, and particularly if the new national security  advisor, John Bolton, moves forward in getting out of the Iran deal, you  really need someone in Germany.  Germany is becoming a much more important  place.  And it is something where the Trump administration and United  States in general could use a strong advocate such as Rick Grenell.  So  this delay is getting to the point of absurdity.  </p><p>BAIER:  David?</p><p>CATANESE:  We don't have ambassadors and three dozen countries.  So this is  the focal point this week because of a \"New York Times\" story, and I think  it also has to do because he would be the highest qualified or highest  serving openly gay official in the Trump administration.  But we don't have  ambassadors in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt.  </p><p>And if we are frank about this, a lot of these ambassador posts are rewards  to campaign donors.  So I think in different countries they matter at  different -- it's more significant in some countries that it is other  countries.  There's a lot of reports out there that staffing can do a lot  of these jobs.  And remember when Rex Tillerson, I know he is the outgoing  secretary of state, he was asked about this a couple weeks ago, and he  said, look, this isn't that big of a deal.  We can still move forward with  policy.  </p><p>And on foreign policy I think the one thing we have learned out of the  Trump administration is there is one man setting it, and that's President  Trump.  So look, this is a procedural battle, and I think there is also a  case to be made that Mitch McConnell, if he wanted to, hold the Senate open  all week long, have the debate, have a 30 hours.  But if Richard Grenell is  very important in Germany, you could also make the case for why don't we  have ambassadors and really key Middle East countries like I named, Saudi  Arabia, Egypt.  </p><p>BAIER:  Or even Korea.</p><p>CATANESE:  South Korea.  </p><p>BAIER:  OK, so big interview last night, \"60 Minutes,\" the fallout today.   Take a listen to a part of that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS:  I was in a parking lot going to a fitness class with my  infant daughter, taking the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper  bag, getting all the stuff out, and a guy walked up on me and said leave  Trump alone.  Forget the story.  And then he leaned around looked at my  daughter and said, a beautiful little girl.  It would be a shame if  something happened to her mom.  And then he was gone.  </p><p>ANDERSON COOPER:  Did you ever see the person again?  </p><p>DANIELS:  No.  But if I did, I would know it right away.  </p><p>COOPER:  Did you go to the police?  </p><p>DANIELS:  No.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why?</p><p>DANIELS:  Because I was scared.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The White House engaging, saying they don't believe that there was  a threat made.  Michael Cohen, the president's attorney, saying he doesn't  believe it.  Where does this go from here, Steve?  </p><p>HAYES:  Well, I don't think it goes away.  Stormy Daniels is not the most  credible accuser that President Trump has had.  She's lied specifically  about this incident.  She has said that she lied about this incident.  I  think the problem for President Trump is that there are many others who  have made similar allegations, whether we are talking about aggressive  behavior towards women or we are talking about his folks making thuggish  threats on journalists or others who could potentially do him harm.  </p><p>I don't think the story goes away in part because of the campaign finance  aspect of it.  Some people are shrugging that off and saying it's not a big  deal.  Really we're just talking about $130,000.  But if you stop and think  about what the substance of the case is, what the center of the case is,  it's that the president had, or the president's top lawyer allegedly paid  $130,000 in hush money shortly before the election because he had an affair  with a porn star.  That's a big deal.  No matter how you look at it, it's a  big deal.  And I think we'll learn more about how she wants to substantiate  her case if she's able to do so in the coming days.  </p><p>BAIER:  We will follow all aspect of it.  Panel, thank you very much.  When  we come back, a new kind of peacemaking.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BAIER:  Finally tonight, a power play that even hardcore politicians can  appreciate.  When the Colorado Mammoth took the on Vancouver Stealth in a  box lacrosse match Saturday in Denver, yes, lacrosse, things got a bit  testy between two of the players.  That's when referee Todd LaBranche  stepped in with an unusual penalty call.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These two are clearly having issues with each other,  could not restrain themselves, so we're going to give them two minutes to  think about what they have done.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  To think about what they've done, two minutes of reflection in the  box triggered plenty of comments on Twitter, fans praising LaBranche for  keeping the peace.  Maybe LaBranche should come to Washington, get the deal  makers to borrow a page from his playbook in solving that penalty issue.  </p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That's it for this SPECIAL  REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid.  \"The Story\" hosted by Martha  MacCallum, with reflection, starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Continue reading Ex-Microsoft Attorneys Launch Innovative Government Contracting Law Firm</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tysons Corner, VA, May 27, 2020: Two former Microsoft attorneys announced today the official launch of Tong Tejani law firm (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tongtejani.com/\">www.tongtejani.com</url>), bringing a combined 40 years of government contracting and compliance experience to small and large companies doing business with government customers.</p><p> What sets us apart and in many ways makes us unique,  said co-founder Zohra Tejani,  is that we re leveraging our experience as in-house counsel at Microsoft, VMware and Facebook to do things differently. We re experimenting with business and client service models. </p><p> It is that in-house corporate experience that allows us to give practical, actionable advice to clients,  said co-founder Joyce Tong Oelrich.  We have helped clients operationalize regulatory compliance and provided strategic counsel. </p><p> Our in-house backgrounds along with our previous law firm experience allow us to help companies with the full spectrum of issues in government contracting and compliance. We can handle a bid protest, counsel an engineering team on cybersecurity requirements, and negotiate government contracts for cloud services and other technology products and services. </p><p>Government contracting issues that the founding partners of Tong Tejani have dealt with include:</p><p>Bid Protests and Other Disputes</p><p>Commercial Contracts</p><p>Cybersecurity, Supply Chain Security, Data Protection</p><p>Wage and Hour</p><p>Ethics and Compliance</p><p>Trade Agreements and Buy American Acts</p><p>Fiscal and Appropriations</p><p>International Public Procurement</p><p>Government Relations</p><p>Grants, Cooperative, and Other Transaction (OT) Agreements</p><p>Intellectual Property and Data Rights</p><p>Investigations, Government Enforcement and Whistleblowers</p><p>Mergers and Acquisitions</p><p>National Security and Defense</p><p>Partners and Competition</p><p>Socio-Economic Preferences and Small Businesses</p><p>Sovereign Immunity</p><p>The founders  client experience has ranged from handling bid protests for a small, minority-owned joint venture to representing a $10 billion a year tech giant negotiating with an equally formidable government agency responsible for a $1 billion-plus annual spend.</p><p> The opposing counsel representing the government was impressed enough with my work,  said Tejani,  that when he left government for the private sector, he contacted us about working forhim. </p><p>Zohra Tejani has extensive senior-level experience drafting, negotiating, and counseling on government procurement of commercial technology products and services.  A good shorthand for my legal practice is  govtech,   says Tejani. In fact, using  govtech  as a search term on LinkedIn, the first person identified is  Zohra Tejani. </p><p> We offer a modern, innovative approach inspired by our time in Big Tech,  says Tejani.  Instead of billing by the hour, we offer a subscription service, volume discounts, and fixed fees, and, instead of hiring staff and attorneys, we remain agile and scalable by bringing on contract staff and counsel, partnering with alternative legal service providers and solos as needed. </p><p>Joyce Tong Oelrich is an accomplished global public sector procurement counsel whose career spans nearly two decades advising large and small commercial clients in Big Law and then Big Tech while in-house. A key area of focus for Tong Oelrich has been global government contract compliance.</p><p>Perhaps as noteworthy as their experience is the rarity of who and what they are: women of color who own their own law firm, rare enough that national statistics measuring the extent of such firms do not appear to exist.</p><p> I don't think there are any good data sources on this question,  says Robert L. Nelson, director emeritus of the American Bar Foundation, the research arm of the American Bar Association.  In terms of women of color who are founders of law firms, I cannot think of any source on that. </p><p>Tong and Tejani are unfazed by the rarity of law firms owned by women of color.</p><p> During the initial  beta  phase of our firm before our official launch on May 27,  said Tong Oelrich,  we confirmed that our diversity of experience, both professionally and personally, makes us a good choice for the wide range of companies wanting to do business with government customers. </p><p>Tong Tejani helps companies in all public sector areas, including:</p><p>US Federal, including Civilian, Defense, and National Security Agencies</p><p>Defense Contractors</p><p>US State &amp; Local Government</p><p>Tribal Nations</p><p>Education, including K-12 and Higher-Ed</p><p>International Organizations (e.g., United Nations, World Bank)</p><p>Global Public Sector and State-Owned Entities</p><p>Tong Tejani is certified by the Women s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC).</p><p> The timing of the launch of Tong Tejani at the height of Covid-19 is also, we think, interesting,  says Tong Oelrich.  The beta phase for our firm began in our home offices in October 2019. We began working then as everyone else is now remotely and generally from home.</p><p> Dealing with these new realities, we had a head start. </p><p>Tags:<url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/boutique/\">boutique</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/government-contracting/\">government contracting</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/govtech/\">govtech</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/law-firm/\">Law Firm</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/minority-owned/\">minority-owned</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/tejani/\">tejani</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/tong/\">tong</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/woman-owned/\">woman-owned</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tongtejani.com\">http://www.tongtejani.com</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:joe@slaycomms.com\">joe@slaycomms.com</email><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/extended-distribution/\">Extended Distribution</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/legal-newswire/\">Legal Newswire</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/regulatory-compliance/communications-and-internet-regulations/\">Communications and internet regulations</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/litigation/cybersecurity/\">Cybersecurity</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/regions/delaware/\">Delaware</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/litigation/international-trade/\">International trade</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/regions/middle-atlantic/\">Middle Atlantic</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/legal-general/public-policy/\">Public Policy</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/regions/southeast/\">Southeast</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/industries/technology/\">Technology</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/law-com-newswire/regions/washington-d-c/\">Washington D.C.</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2571947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6019-W3V1-F08D-51G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Online, what is good for business is not necessarily good for individuals or societies. Big Tech platforms make it easy to manipulate opinion, spew hate and incite violence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We once naively believed that mass access to the World Wide Web would inevitably democratize information; today, we worry about the emergence of an \"addiction economy\" that is bad for everyone. What can be done to support more humane, ethical and effective technology?</p><p>One important way to address this problem in a systemic way is by reforming education in the so-called STEM disciplines: science, technology, engineering and math. Policymakers worldwide are already focusing on increasing the number of STEM graduates and the diversity of STEM students. But we should also expand the scope of STEM education, to ensure that students learn to evaluate and respond to the social, economic and political consequences of their work.</p><p>This does not mean adding existing humanities or social sciences courses to a STEM curriculum. Rather, it will require the development of an entirely new curriculum that gives the next generation of technologists, engineers, scientists and mathematicians the formal foundations for considering the macro effects of their actions on society. Without such a framework, the gap between the promise of innovation and the reality of human experience will only grow.</p><p>Fortunately, the seeds of this educational revolution are already sprouting. Some universities are adding ethics classes to the STEM curriculum. Stanford University, with its deep links to the tech industry, has recently added courses with topics like \"Ethics, Public Policy and Technological Change\" and \"Computers, Ethics and Public Policy.\" Stanford has also recently launched a new Human-Centered AI Initiative, which recognizes that \"the development of AI should be paired with an ongoing study of its impact on human society, and guided accordingly.\" Last year, Cornell launched the Milstein Program in Technology and Humanity.</p><p>These early initiatives can serve as important testing grounds for new curricula and methods. But the real change will come only when all STEM programs provide students with the tools they need to carry out a credible assessment of their work's effects on humanity.</p><p>Of course, such changes will mean little if we do not know what the most effective tools actually are. That is why continued experimentation is also essential.</p><p>Casey Fiesler of the University of Colorado, Boulder, is pursuing just such experimentation by crowdsourcing syllabi focused on tech ethics. The growing online database already contains more than 200 different syllabi from universities around the world. Yet only one-quarter of these courses are taught by computer science faculty. The rest are taught in departments such as law, philosophy and communications, which means that they are not being tailored to STEM-related challenges.</p><p>More fundamentally, such stand-alone courses are not ideal. A better approach, as Fiesler herself agrees, would focus on integrating ethics into \"everyday practice\" in the STEM fields. (Fiesler hopes that her database will help faculty make this case to their universities.)</p><p>This is the goal of the Responsible CS Challenge, launched last month by Omidyar Network, Schmidt Futures, Craig Newmark Philanthropies and Mozilla. The two-year challenge should encourage computer science professors in the United States to integrate ethics into their undergraduate curriculum, so that STEM students can gain a deeper understanding of how technology affects humanity.</p><p>This is a good first step, but much more must be done. For one thing, while the initial focus on ethics makes sense, similar explorations will be needed in a wide variety of disciplines such as economics, psychology and many more of the so-called humanities. Expanding STEM education to include such broader considerations would serve as a cornerstone of a more comprehensive long-term strategy to ensure that technology serves society in overwhelmingly positive ways. That strategy must also include changes, say, to business models, incentives, innovation strategies and regulatory regimes - changes that should be pursued by people whose education has prepared them to address the effects of their work on the rest of us.</p><p>Mitchell Baker is co-founder and chair of the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation.

It's part of a wider bipartisan inquiry into whether the tech giants have monopolistic power to squelch competition in a way that hurts rivals and consumers.</p><p>Big drama is insured, if only because these CEOs never before have shared a \"stage.\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will be joined by Tim Cook at Apple, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. But they will appear virtually, via videoconferencing, due to the pandemic.</p><p>An antitrust subcommittee of the House of Representatives is holding the hearings. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., is the subcommittee chairman who has led the investigation, which comes at a critical juncture.</p><h>Tech Antitrust Hearing One Of Many</h><p>The hearing is just one of several government inquiries into Big Tech. Justice Department prosecutors reportedly are preparing a possible antitrust case against Alphabet this year. That inquiry focuses on Google's control of advertising technology and the search engine market.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Amazon's treatment of brands that sell products on its e-commerce site. In addition, Facebook is being studied for its long string of acquisitions, such as its purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp. With Apple, lawmakers have asked about how its App Store terms hurt developers.</p><p>Tuesday's proceeding is an evidentiary hearing, in that lawmakers will question the CEOs to gather evidence through their testimony. The tech antitrust hearing is something of a culmination of an investigation into the four tech giants. It began in June 2019 to assess their competitive practices.</p><p>The antitrust subcommittee expects to issue a report of its findings as well as legislative proposals designed to update antitrust laws. That report could arrive in the fall and result in legislation designed to keep big tech companies from growing too large and powerful.</p><p>Along with fines, politicians and regulators are also contemplating new laws on privacy and competition. They are also looking at the repeal of a law that gives these digital platforms <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-falls-as-trump-plans-order-targeting-social-media/\">broad immunity for content</url> on their sites.</p><h>Big Tech Vs.

The 15 members of the antitrust panel will have five minutes for each question.</p><p>Cicilline will control the number of rounds of questioning, which could stretch into the evening.</p><h>Opening Statements From Big Tech Execs</h><p>All four tech executive posted their opening remarks online late Tuesday.</p><p>In defending Facebook's businesses practices, Zuckerberg focused in on its many acquisitions, which are a target of the investigation.</p><p>\"When you acquire a company, you can benefit from their technology and talent, and when you are acquired you get access to resources and people you otherwise might never have been able to tap into,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/mark-zuckerberg-s-statement-to-a-house-judiciary-panel/9edb5481-5825-477d-bba0-f510055b0c4e/\">he said</url>.</p><p>Cook spent most of his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/tim-cook-s-statement-to-a-house-judiciary-panel/89c15175-1055-4d72-aa10-86619b2525c9/\">opening remarks</url> defending Apple's App Store operations, also a key focus of the investigation.</p><p>\"For the vast majority of apps in the App Store, developers keep 100% of the money they make,\" he said.</p><h>Alphabet Fuels American Progress</h><p>Among the others, Pichai spoke about the enormous investments Alphabet has made in technology and the benefits that provides the U.S.</p><p>\"Through these investments our teams of engineers are helping America solidify its position as the global leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and quantum computing, for example,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/sundar-pichai-s-statement-to-a-house-judiciary-panel/f45ffdda-49c0-4ffe-9bfc-9095f7eddea2/\">he said</url>.</p><p>Bezos, in his <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/statement-by-jeff-bezos-to-the-u-s-house-committee-on-the-judiciary\">typical folksy manner</url>, spoke about his upbringing and how his parents provided the seed money to launch Amazon.</p><p>As to how Amazon treats third-party resellers, a focus of the investigation, he said, \"There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon's stores,\" In addition, he said. \"More than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales in our stores in 2019.\"</p><p>The event can be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVvv3JRCVQAl6ovogDum4hA\">livestreamed here</url>.</p><p>Please follow Brian Deagon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/IBD_BDeagon\">@IBD_BDeagon</url> for more on tech stocks, analysis and financial markets.</p><p>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:</p><p>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard\">Become A Top Investor With Leaderboard</url></p><p>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith\">Catch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmith</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital\">Unlock Premium Stock Lists, Investing Tools And Analysis</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;intcode=icmhpbrdcstmsg|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|707596&amp;src=A00387A\">Get Stock Ideas From IBD Experts Each Morning Before The Open</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital\">Unlock Premium Stock Lists, Investing Tools And Analysis</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-6082746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-X141-JCBB-K3VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Read more on Business Insider[1].Heading into 2020, the U.S. presidential election is top of mind for investors asking how it might impact their portfolios. While national elections generally don't substantially affect global investors, the U.S. election \"is an exception\" to that rule, said Mike Ryan, UBS chief investment strategist for Wealth Management Americas, at a press event Tuesday. That's because the U.S. makes up roughly 55% of the MSCI All Country World index, the U.S. Treasury bond yield is a benchmark for global financial assets, and the U.S. dollar is involved in 88% of all currency transactions, according to UBS. U.S. stocks could face higher volatility leading up to the election, UBS said. And some individual sectors, including technology, energy, financials, and healthcare, could suffer from price swings. That means that investors both in the U.S. and abroad should pay attention in the run-up to the election and monitor the debates for a number of key issues, the bank said. Here are six key themes that UBS says investors should be watching in the next year leading up to the 2020 election. 1. Corporate taxes Mike Blake/ReutersIf a Democratic candidate prevails in 2020, there could be sweeping changes to corporate taxes, according to UBS. A 28% corporate tax rate, like the one proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden, would lower S...00 earnings by 3% to 4%, UBS estimates. Senator Elizabeth Warren's plans would lower earnings by about 7%, the bank said. But, if Trump wins a second term, corporate tax rates would likely remain the same. Lower corporate taxes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 boosted S...00 earnings by nearly 10%, UBS said.2. Trade policy AP Photo/Susan WalshThe conflict between the U.S. and China has been a huge market mover over the last year. While there are signs that a phase-one deal could be coming soon, investors should still watch out for further trade talks, UBS says. If Trump is reelected in 2020, he \"could become more adversarial with China,\" UBS said. On the flip side, it seems that a Democratic president would \"be unlikely to adopt a more conciliatory approach,\" UBS said.3. Technology regulation Aaron P. Bernstein/ReutersInvestors should be prepared for greater scrutiny of big tech, UBS said. This is a big deal as technology looms large in the S...00, making up 16% of market value. If President Trump wins reelection, tech giants could face scrutiny from antitrust regulators in addition to the review underway by the Department of Justice, UBS said. And, a Democratic president would also spell trouble for big tech. Warren has released a plan to break up the biggest tech companies, and Biden has supported further investigation. Discussions on the topic could \"exacerbate volatility\" at the U.S. tech giants, UBS said.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[2] See Also: GOLDMAN SACHS: Equity traders are expecting an

Our nation spans the entire continent and includes thousands of counties and tens of thousands of municipalities with a wide range of demographics, health care facilities, and population densities,\" said Joel Griffith, a research fellow specializing in financial regulations at The Heritage Foundation, in an email to The Epoch Times.</p><p>The governors of seven states, including NewYork, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts all connected by phone on April 13 to create a multi-state partnership that will examine the possibilities of reopening the economy.</p><p>The six Democrats and one Republican governor (Massachusetts) plan to create a task force that will study how to safely restart business and allow people to get back to work.</p><p>Businesses that have a limited risk of contributing to the pandemic, such as manufacturing, retail stores, salons, golf courses, restaurants, and auto centers, will likely be the firts to reopen, Griffith said.</p><p>\"Meanwhile, theaters, sporting events, music venues, nightclubs, and cruises-those with more propensity to bring large numbers of people into close contact with each other-may be more slow to reopen,\" he said.</p><p>Preparing Public Health System for Reopening</p><p>The reopening will depend upon how the public health system manages the crisis, Alan Sager, an expert in public health care systems at the Boston University School of Public Health, told The Epoch Times in an email.</p><p>\"Ending the restraints will not be an all-or-nothing matter. I do think that relaxing the stay-at-home and distancing requirement will be gradual. Otherwise, the virus will come back with a vengeance and may wreak inconceivable havoc- death, illness, and durable economic destruction,\" Sager said.</p><p>He added that bringing down the numbers of new cases to very low levels would be the first step toward encouraging officials to ease restraints.</p><p>Griffith says that expanding test availability, speedier reporting of test results, and contact tracing will help health care systems create conditions for localities to be ready to reopen.</p><p>\"More thorough, quick, and accurate testing\" will generate confidence in the low number of new cases, and relentless contact tracing is a must for any infectiou s disease, Sager said.</p><p>\"Contact tracing is very laborintensive and requires a great deal of time, so it can only work when the number of new cases is low enough to allow careful tracing,\" he said.</p><p>While most of the world is under complete or partial lockdown due to the pandemic, big tech and public health have already been working on developing contact tracing technology.</p><p>Google and Apple announced a joint effort April 10 to develop a Bluetooth-based contact tracking technology to assist government and public health authorities in reducing the spread of the pandemic, according to a statement.</p><p>Next to contact tracing, another important step that can help curtail the virus, Sager says, is mandatory 14-day stay-at-home self-quarantining by those who've been in contact with an infected person.</p><p>Sager said when the two steps of \"relentless contact tracing\" and the self-quarantining are done, people will be able to gradually get back to work while still minding safety precautions.</p><p>\"People who have recovered from the virus, and have the antibodies in their blood to prove it, will be among those who are first able to return to work, since they can't get sick and won't do much to spread the virus if they keep their hands clean,\" Sager said.</p><p>However, he said the reopening of public places will likely take longer.</p><p>\"Reopening social venues like restaurants, bars, movies, sporting events, social gatherings, and even religious meetings may have to be delayed until we can measure the effects of the more essential returns to work on new cases,\" Sager said.</p><p>He noted that states have the legal and practical authority to plan and decide about testing, self-quarantining, contact tracing, and when to allow people back to work.</p><p>\"So, states will make most of the key decisions, and they may allow different approaches in cities versus rural areas, for example,\" he said.</p><p>Authorities Should Exercise Caution</p><p>As the country is being reopened, the administration should provide economic help to the business and the unemployed, Griffith said.</p><p>\"Aid to businesses and the unemployed can temporarily help stave off economic pain. However, a return to the economic prosperity which we enjoyed prior to this pandemic requires allowing the emergency interventions into the U.S. economy to expire once the pandemic is defeated (such as enormous new federal spending and massive Federal Reserve interventions),\" he said.</p><p>Officials must exercise caution because what they do during the pandemic situation today will determine the freedom the public enjoys later on, Sager said.</p><p>\"Only when the spread of the virus is tamed can we return to business as usual. The more competent our actions today, the more freedom we will enjoy tomorrow,\" said Sager, who added that decisions should be based on \"hardheaded medical evidence.\"</p><p>Griffith said businesses with a limited risk of contributing to the pandemic, such as manufacturing, retail stores, salons, golf courses, restaurants, and auto centers, will likely be the first to reopen.</p><p>I do think that relaxing the stay-athome and distancing requirement will be gradual.</p><p>Alan Sager, professor, Boston University School of Public Health</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2394928780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTS-3NG1-JC85-J3YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 686</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 17, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>BOSTON UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Boston University</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Epoch Times</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Massachusetts</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Regulation of financial institutions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Public health</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pandemics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID-19</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Restaurants</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 611310</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 511110</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

They criticising the slowness of these companies in removing posts that incite hatred and terrorist propaganda posted in their platforms, as well as accused them of suppressing freedom of expression and engaging in some agendas.</p><p>Director of International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation Jillian York said that some governments and social media companies deliberately ignore civil society organisations in many of the agreements between the two sides. She noted that after years of monitoring and supervision by governments on social media to face many societal problems, the result was negative, as it was unable to provide solutions to these problems, confirming that many governments and social media companies participate in repression through the Internet, and that repression operations is carried out through legislation enacted by governments with companies to limit freedom of expression.</p><p>York stressed that there is no disagreement about the importance of countering terrorism, but the policies that were followed to counter it did not bring the achievements, but rather it ignored many crimes that should rise to war crimes such as those committed by the Syrian regime, and were documented through social media. She also explained that social media companies themselves discriminate between people, as there is discrimination against women and there is discrimination against citizens.</p><p>She expressed regret that civil society institutions are excluded from partnerships between governments and social media companies, pointing out that these companies insist on dealing with many societal problems as technical problems.</p><p>Commissioner of National Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Jerald Joseph pointed to the importance of working to change laws dating back to colonial times and called on governments to respect human rights and freedom of expression for which activists are being prosecuted.</p><p>Joseph said that companies, in turn, are called upon to respect human rights, noting the need to cooperate with the government side in order to make progress on these levels.</p><p>Social media expert in Taiwan and East Asia Michel Shia said that some countries have used electronic applications to monitor their citizens, while others have used them to counter false and fabricated news issued against them.</p><p>Fernand de Varennes, UN Special Rapporteur on Minority Issue, pointed to the high level of hatred towards minorities in recent years through social media platforms, and noted that there are major challenges in this area, which the international community must raise to reduce the level of hatred. He explained that three quarters of hate in social media is directed against minorities.</p><p>He drew attention to the importance of clarity in dealing with such a file and searching for the causes of hatred and whoever it targets, and he considered that it is not an easy task, especially in light of the absence of global standards in this regard. He stressed that there is no conflict between international law and freedom of expression.</p><p>Senior Political Advisor of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in the EU Matilda Sisatto examined the impact of social media and various applications on human life.</p><p>She said that although these applications and websites have made it easy for people to see their important matters, they have become at the same time a way to monitor people and collect data about them.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/321/1059/40/158201339261.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/321/1059/40/158201339261.jpeg</url></p><p>Experts call on govts to respect human rights, protect social media activists <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEPEN-167583357</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEPEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7H-9841-F11P-X1TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399277</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dar Al Sharq Press, Printing &amp; Distribution Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

All the privacy notifications and data breach notifications you receive today is because of the EU and the US.</p><p>\"We need a strong privacy law which regulates the private sector and regulates and provides a remedy for illegal government surveillance. That's good in a federal country because it makes it clear what Delhi or the state capitals are doing and increases trust. Today, law-enforcement agencies also spy on each other because they don't trust each other and they don't want to share their data.\"</p><p>Free Software Movement of India president Prabir Purkayastha said: \"Before the 2014 elections and after, what was the relation between a political party and Facebook? So, can they affect your election? Yes.\"</p><p>He added: \"A three to five per cent voting change is not something that is really major for a platform to do.

In September, International Business Machine Corps. (IBM) reported that 15 percent of top global banks rolled out at least one full scale, commercial blockchain product that year, with the figure expected to increase to 65 percent by 2019. Consequently, the adoption rate is expected to rise at an even quicker pace in 2018, as more traditional institution and FinTech giants continue to find ways to implement the innovative technology into their operating procedures. </p><p>Demand for the blockchain, best known for supporting bitcoin, is growing so much that it will be one of the largest users of capacity in 2018 at more than 60 data centers rented out by IBM to other companies around the globe, said the Pura panel. As one of the first big companies to recognize the technology's promise, IBM has contributed to an open source effort. IBM has even encouraged startups to try the blockchain on its cloud for free, creating opportunities for both small businesses and large corporations attempting to innovate. As a result the technology has garnered interest from big tech and financial multinationals alike. In early November, startup company R3 announced that it now has over 60 clients, including Microsoft and Intel, actively using its blockchain platform, also known as a distributed ledger technology, to store vast amounts of data across a network of computers around the world, rather than on one local server. In its announcement, R3 added that more than 100 banks, insurance firms, regulators and trade associations have signed on to collaborate as members, a further sign of growing acceptance. Essentially, the blockchain enables companies and individuals doing business with each other to record transactions securely. Its strength lies in its trustworthiness, explained the Pura Cryptocurrency[2] panel, as it is impossible to reverse or change what has been recorded. I can also hold infinitely more documents and data than traditional database storage, allowing businesses for more nuances insights and analysis. Almost six in 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a Juniper Research survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff. The technology is increasingly being tested or used by companies including Wal Mart and Visa to streamline supply chain, speed up payments and store records. Within five years, digital distributed ledgers will be utilized by 55 percent of companies with more than 1,000 employees. Pura Cryptocurrency[3] is the world's first socially and environmentally conscious cryptocurrency. As an international digital currency, it liberates users to transact with anyone in the world directly, privately and instantly across a peer-to-peer network that is secured by the blockchain. As a conscious cash movement for the common good, ten percent of all PURA created is contributed to PURAPlanet, a treasury trust dedicated to fund and track sustainable, environmental, and social projects around the globe.

But that was last year. What do experts think will happen in 2019 when it comes to data privacy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIn 2019, privacy will continue to be an area of focus for the global market, as new regulations such as ePrivacy start to be fleshed out and additional regions such as the U.S. look to implement their own data privacy laws, all of which could have global financial impact,\u201d said Mounir Hahad, head of Juniper Threat Labs, Juniper Networks, via email.</p><p>One thing is that we can expect more legislation surrounding <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">data privacy</emphasis>. In fact, expect data protection legislation to influence societal expectations on security, which will trickle down to companies and their supply chains, according to Geoff Forsyth, CTO at PCI Pal.</p><p>\u201cConsumers have always felt protective of their data, but with new legislation redefining the data landscape, consumers have grown more confident and firmer in demanding their data be treated with respect, that its uses are kept visible and clear, and that it is used only as they agreed,\u201d Forsyth said in an email comment. \u201cThe pressure these new societal expectations will exert cannot be overstated, both on public-facing companies and through them all the way down their supply chains.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Security and Privacy Will Merge</emphasis></p><p>We\u2019ve already begun to see a convergence of security and privacy; data privacy and data protection are separate but equal in this privacy-centric outlook. Consumers and employees \u2013 everybody, really \u2013 are paying more attention to how well organizations protect data and ensure data privacy. According to network security expert and Portnox CEO Ofer Amitai, expect to see more companies seek guidance and solutions to keep up with all the new compliance regulations.</p><p>However, privacy will take priority this year, as organizations adopt a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u201cPrivacy First\u201d approach</emphasis>, Don Foster stated in a Commvault blog post. But he doesn\u2019t anticipate adopting this approach will be easy. \u201cThe challenges these enterprises will face as they seek to integrate data privacy best practices into their existing applications, as well as new mobile, IoT and other applications, will be significant,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEnterprises will need AI-powered, automated, outcome-driven data management solutions to address these challenges if they hope to implement strong data privacy policies without sacrificing productivity or agility.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GDPR at a Year</emphasis></p><p>A personal prediction: In May, there will be countless evaluations of GDPR as the regulation hits its first anniversary. Okay, that\u2019s not a difficult prediction to make because we\u2019re already seeing evaluations of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">how GDPR has been working</emphasis>. Luther Martin, Micro Focus security technologist, predicted that GDPR will be impossible to enforce as we move forward. There has been a lot of chatter about enforcement and whether the fines will work as a deterrent. But Martin said the fines will be almost impossible to enforce because of political considerations or established laws and regulations.</p><p>\u201cIn the U.S., for example, 26 USC Sec 891 of the Internal Revenue Code allows the U.S. to arbitrarily double the taxes of business or individuals from countries that unfairly discriminate against U.S. businesses in certain ways,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIt's likely that levying large fines against U.S. tech giants for failing to comply with the GDPR would trigger Section 891 penalties, allowing arbitrary retaliatory doubling of taxes on EU businesses and citizens.\u201d</p><p>Expect other countries that don\u2019t already have such laws about penalties against large enterprise to come up with some, rather quickly, because it will be politically expedient to do so. Countries without similar laws, said Martin, will be at a disadvantage, \u201cleaving the world in a situation where all of the privacy laws that assert control over their citizens' data, no matter where the data is stored or processed, are rendered ineffective against businesses from more powerful countries.\u201d Or, in other words, countries required to enforce GDPR could find themselves between a rock and hard place trying to get organizations in countries like the U.S. and China to follow the regulations and pay the fines.</p><p>Even so, researchers at NordVPN think that GDPR has put such an important spotlight on data privacy that we\u2019ll continue to see the trend of more countries outside of the EU and more <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. states coming up with data privacy laws and regulations</emphasis>. And that\u2019s important, these researchers added, because too many of us are frustrated with the way big tech has handled personal data. Consumer trust, the researchers predicted, will play a major role in how big tech goes forward in their internal data privacy policies.</p><p>PJ Kirner, CTO and founder of Illumio, thinks that big tech and other organizations will take data privacy more seriously, and insist that these policies are followed by their vendors. \u201cIf a third-party vendor is managing critical data and systems, enterprises will increasingly require these vendors to adopt their internal security standards, Kirner said. \u201cFor example, we are already seeing the largest financial institutions executing this practice with the law firms that handle their eDiscovery, regulatory response, M&amp;A, and IP-related transactions. I think we\u2019ll see more organizations push their policies to their vendors in 2019 because they\u2019re starting to recognize the value of consistent and transparent security protocols across the digital supply chain. Not only will this provide peace of mind, it will also increase efficiency, streamline operations, and allow best practices to be shared.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sue Marquette Poremba has been writing about network security since 2008.

In this case the questions focused on the future of democracy, the problems digital technology has created and possible solutions to those problems. This is a nonscientific canvassing based on a non-random sample, so the results represent only the individuals who responded to the query and are not projectable to any other population.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pew Research Center and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center built a database of experts to canvass from several sources, including professionals and policy people from government bodies, technology businesses, think tanks and networks of interested networks of academics and technology innovators. The expert predictions reported here about the impact of digital technologies on key aspects of democracy and democratic representation and social and civic innovation came in response to a set of questions in an online canvassing conducted between July 3 and Aug. 5, 2019. In all, 697 technology innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and activists responded to at least one part of the battery of questions that are covered in this report. More on the methodology underlying this canvassing and the participants can be found here.</p><p>A large share of experts and analysts worry that people's technology use will mostly weaken core aspects of democracy and democratic representation in the coming decade. Yet they also foresee significant social and civic innovation between now and 2030 to try to address emerging issues.</p><p>In this new report, technology experts who shared serious concerns for democracy in a recent Pew Research Center canvassing weigh in with their views about the likely changes and reforms that might occur in the coming years.</p><p>Overall, 697 technology innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and activists responded to the following query:</p><p>Social and civic innovation and its impact on the new difficulties of the digital age : As the Industrial Revolution swept through societies, people eventually took steps to mitigate abuses and harms that emerged. For instance, new laws were enacted to make workplaces safer and protect children; standards were created for product safety and effectiveness; new kinds of organizations came into being to help workers (e.g., labor unions) and make urban life more meaningful (e.g., settlement houses, Boys/Girls Clubs); new educational institutions were created (e.g., trade schools); household roles in families were reconfigured.</p><p>Today's \"techlash\" illuminates the issues that have surfaced in the digital era. We seek your insights as to whether and how reforms to ease these problems and others might unfold.</p><p>The question: Will significant social and civic innovation occur between now and 2030? By \"social and civic innovation,\" we mean the creation of things like new technology tools, legal protections, social norms, new or reconfigured groups and communities, educational efforts and other strategies to address digital-age challenges.</p><p>Some 84% of these respondents say there will be significant social and civic innovation between now and 2030, while 16% say there will not be significant social and civic innovation in the timeframe.</p><p>Asked a follow-up question about whether humans' use of technology will lead to or prevent significant social and civic innovation, 69% of these expert respondents said they expect that technology use will help significantly mitigate problems, 20% predicted that technology use will effectively prevent significant mitigation of problems and 11% responded that it is likely that technology use will have no effect on social and civic innovation.</p><p>This is a nonscientific canvassing of experts, based on a non-random sample. The results represent only the opinions of individuals who responded to the query and are not projectable to any other population. The methodology underlying this canvassing is elaborated here. The bulk of this report covers these experts' written answers explaining their responses.</p><p>Respondents in this canvassing sound three broad themes about the changing technology landscape and how it will impact citizens' political and social activities.</p><p>First, they predict that overall connectivity between people and their devices will increase as more digital applications emerge that allow people to create, share and observe information. This trend could accelerate as people employ smart agents and bots to interact with other people or other people's avatars. These experts say persistent and expanded human connectivity will affect the way people engage with each other as citizens and influence how they work to build groups aimed at impacting policy and politics. Some argue this will change the way people interact with democratic institutions.</p><p>Second, the experts responding here foresee a sharp increase in connected devices for instance, wearables, household appliances, cars that could connect people even more deeply with their environments. Indeed, some believe the added aspects of connectivity will extend as the environment itself becomes \"smart\" as buildings, streets, plots of land and even bodies of water become loaded with sensors that feed data into analytics systems. This will impact the level of knowledge that people have about themselves and their environment. That, in turn, could drive policy change, as evidence-based insights about the world proliferate.</p><p>Third, most of these experts think the explosion of data generated by people, gadgetry and environmental sensors will affect the level of social and civic innovation in several potential directions. They argue that the existence of the growing trove of data and people's knowledge about its collection will focus more attention on privacy issues and possibly affect people's norms and behaviors. In addition, some say the way the data is analyzed will draw more scrutiny of the performance of algorithms and artificial intelligence systems, especially around issues related to whether the outcomes of data use are fair and explainable.</p><p>Two comments illustrate how these trends fit together and could prompt social and civic change.</p><p>M elissa Michelson, a professor of political science at Menlo College and author of \"Mobilizing Inclusion: Redefining Citizenship Through Get-Out-the-Vote Campaigns,\" wrote, \"I expect that by 2030 we will see increased pushback against the negatives of the digital age in the form of new technologies, more fact-checking and more skepticism by everyday Americans. What I see happening already is that people are more cynical but also more likely to engage in various forms of political participation, both on- and offline. There is an increasing recognition of the need for citizens to be savvy consumers of online information, and increased efforts by educators to arm their students with the critical tools they need to separate truth from fact. There is increasing pressure on social media companies to flag or remove information that is unreliable or inappropriate. Younger people are much better able to critically analyze online information in this way, and older people will age out of the system. Meanwhile, more and more tools are becoming available for helping everyone push back against disinformation.\"</p><p>Alexander B. Howard, independent writer, digital governance expert and open-government advocate, said, \"I expect to see improvements to access to information through mobile computing devices, wireless broadband internet connections, open data from private and public sector sources and mature gestural and vocal interfaces. Virtual assistants driven by artificial intelligence and personal data will anticipate and augment the information needs of individuals, along with the descendants of today's rudimentary chatbots. That which can be automated, will be. That in turn means access and equity and checking algorithmic discrimination in the provision of services or information will be a civil rights issue, along with the civil liberties challenges associated with increased data collection. Partisan polarization and increasing economic inequality may be mitigated by significant legislative changes, but dislocation and job loss from increased automation, when combined with environmental degradation driven by climate change, will put a premium on enacting reforms to the scale of the inbound challenges in the near term. Corporate influence on national governments will continue to present significant challenges to that occurring. Increasingly sophisticated disinformation that pollutes civic information ecosystems may be mitigated by the systematic development of more trust in validated sources, though illiberal political movements will create difficult conditions for the development of nuanced interventions that don't simply result in censorship of independent media and press freedoms.\"</p><p>Sorting through these predictions, several key types of innovations recurred across the experts' answers in this canvassing. Here below is a rundown in three tables of 10 of the most commonly mentioned areas of reforms where these experts expect to see innovations. The lists are a catalog not a consensus of the range of anticipated advances that respondents in this canvassing propose will be likely by 2030. These statements generally represent themes found in this study. Many do not represent any sort of predominant point of view of the experts canvassed.</p><p>Experts expect there may be social and civic innovation by 2030 in social media, privacy issues and struggles against misinformation</p><p>AREA AND DESCRIPTIONEXAMPLES OF ANTICIPATED INNOVATIONS</p><p>Social media</p><p>Some experts foresee a reckoning coming for social platform companies and leaders that could lead to large-scale changes.Regulation will hold social media companies liable for users' data privacy and safety.</p><p>The social platform companies of 2020 will be broken up or die out.</p><p>New platforms that do not rely on surveillance capitalism and targeted advertising will evolve.</p><p>A greater focus on honesty and accuracy on social media will emerge.</p><p>Social media platforms that focus on partisan interests will be developed.</p><p>Privacy issues</p><p>Actions will be taken to better protect people's privacy online.Regulation will be enacted to enforce digital privacy and punish abusers.</p><p>Public norms will change to focus more on protecting privacy online, and media forensics will be applied to tracking privacy infringement.</p><p>There will be greater utilization of smart contracts and privacy-by-design technology.</p><p>Cyberinsurance will be created to cover people who are victims of cybercrime, and there will be more-effective technology tools for privacy protection.</p><p>Users of free tools will be automatically informed and given choices when they are faced with a situation in which their personal information is the price of access.</p><p>Government-sponsored tools will be created to protect privacy.</p><p>The right to be forgotten will be embraced.</p><p>There will be less targeted advertising.</p><p>Misinformation</p><p>Due to growing concerns about the accuracy of information encountered online, efforts are being made to identify and address misinformation.There will be more education focused on digital literacy.</p><p>Sites and apps will have methods to instantaneously fact-check information.</p><p>Greater societal pressure will demand more accuracy and truth.</p><p>Social norms will change so that skepticism is the starting point of information searching.</p><p>There will be better tools to help people fact-check information found online, and trusted groups of verifiers will form to assess information quality.</p><p>There will be more face-to-face meetings to confirm information.</p><p>Source: Non-scientific canvassing of technology experts conducted July 3-Aug. 5, 2019.

N=697.</p><p>\"Experts Predict More Digital Innovation by 2030 Aimed at Enhancing Democracy\"</p><p>PEW RESEARCH CENTER and ELON UNIVERSITY'S IMAGINING THE INTERNET CENTER, 2020</p><p>Here are some of the thoughtful expert answers about the issues they think will dominate debates about the future of democracy and some reforms that could emerge in the coming decade:</p><p>Ethan Zuckerman, director of MIT's Center for Civic Media and co-founder of Global Voices, said, \"Over the next 10 years, I hope to see a wave of new platforms consciously designed to evoke different civic behaviors. We need mass innovation in design of social tools that help us bridge fragmentation and polarization, bring diversity into our media landscapes and help find common ground between disparate groups. With these as conscious design goals, technology could be a powerful positive force for civic change. If we don't take this challenge seriously and assume that we're stuck with mass-market tools, we won't see positive civic outcomes from technological tools.\"</p><p>Esther Dyson, internet pioneer, journalist, entrepreneur and executive founder of Way to Wellville, wrote, \"If tech doesn't contribute to solving some of the problems it creates, we are doomed. Used well, it can enable us to do many good things more broadly and more cheaply: education, connecting people in real life (Meetup, all kinds of matching/finding platforms), and so on. But we need to recognize the motivations behind these services and make sure that metabolism/money does not overwhelm human connection.\"</p><p>Jonathan Grudin, principal researcher for Microsoft, asked, \"Social and civic activity will continue to change in response to technology use, but will it change its trajectory? Can our fundamental human need for close community be restored or will we become more isolated, anxious and susceptible to manipulation? Social and civic innovation will be driven by people, with technology delivering and perhaps amplifying or obstructing social consensus.\"</p><p>David Weinberger, senior researcher at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, said, \"I see no reason to think that the current situation will change: Tech will cause problems that require innovative solutions and tech will be part of those solutions. Machine learning (ML) is right now an example of this, and given the pace of tech development, ML has at least another 10 years of serious innovation ahead of it. ML's ability to discern patterns in areas we formerly pridefully thought were Free-Will Zones and thus beyond prediction makes it both a source of unwanted control and a tool for detecting hidden effects of bias and for designing more equitable systems. For example, right now most of our focus is, understandably, on preventing ML from amplifying existing biases, but it can also be a tool for measuring and adjusting outcomes to avoid those biases. (I don't imagine that we will ever be able to relax our vigilance over ML's outcomes.)\"</p><p>These experts were also asked to comment about the likely degree of change and innovation that would occur by 2030 in these areas related to democracy and democratic representation:</p><p>Modulate the power of large tech companies</p><p>Lead to ethical advances in uses of algorithms</p><p>Improve the economic stability of the news media</p><p>Improve trust in democratic institutions</p><p>Establish social media platforms where beneficial self-expression, connection and fact-based information are dominant</p><p>Enable political activities that lead to progress in solving major policy problems</p><p>Establish an acceptable balance between personal privacy and public safety</p><p>Reduce worker vulnerabilities associated with technological disruptions</p><p>Improve physical health</p><p>Mitigate mental and emotional health issues tied to digital life.</p><p>The open-ended answers of the experts in this canvassing on each of these aspects of democratic life are woven into the text in the remainder of the report. In many cases, these experts' answers address several issues in one extended response for instance, by talking about their predictions for innovations that improve people's physical well-being alongside their predictions about the future of journalism. For the sake of continuity and coherence, we grouped many of these multiple-subject responses into a single section of the report, rather than spreading them among multiple topics. Some of the key experts' answers had this comprehensive sweep:</p><p>Doc Searls, internet pioneer and former editor-in-chief of Linux Journal, predicted that the internet will become more divided and business models will change, writing, \"Don't expect social media or its leading platforms to last. Their business model tracking-based advertising is morally corrupt and actually doesn't work very well, either for advertisers or ads' target populations. It's best just at paying intermediaries. We will find far better ways to connect demand and supply than robotic algorithm-driven behavioral targeting based on surveillance. The most positive changes will be in the marketplace once new technical means for connecting customers and companies are in place and better signaling takes place across new channels. The least-positive changes will be politics and governance, but only because they will improve more slowly under digital conditions. As for news, whole new institutions are likely to emerge, as old-fashioned print and broadcast-based systems get replaced by streaming, podcasting and who knows what else over the net. What won't change is people's tendency toward gossip, tribalism driven by gossip and the ability of anybody to inform anybody else about anything, including wrongly. The only places where news won't skew fake will be localities in the natural world. That's where the digital and the physical connect best. Also expect the internet to break into pieces, with the U.S., Europe and China becoming increasingly isolated by different value systems and governance approaches toward networks and what runs on them.\"</p><p>Robert Epstein, senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, said, \"The big tech companies, left to their own devices (so to speak), have already had a net negative effect on societies worldwide. At the moment, the three big threats these companies pose aggressive surveillance, arbitrary suppression of content (the censorship problem), and the subtle manipulation of thoughts, behaviors, votes, purchases, attitudes and beliefs are unchecked worldwide, and even former associates of Google and Facebook have warned about how such companies undermine democracy and 'hijack the mind.' The reason I'm optimistic about technology long-term is because I have successfully built and deployed two systems that passively monitor what big tech companies are showing people online, and I expect to build a much larger system in 2020 and ultimately to assist others in building a worldwide ecology of such systems. I'm also developing smart algorithms that will ultimately be able to identify online manipulations biased search results, biased search suggestions, biased newsfeeds, platform-generated targeted messages, platform-engineered virality, shadow-banning, email suppression, etc. in real time. Tech evolves too quickly to be managed by laws and regulations, but monitoring systems are tech, and they can and will be used to curtail the destructive and dangerous powers of companies like Google and Facebook on an ongoing basis.

When we talk about the opportunities for social innovation, we have to culturally contextualize ourselves. I'm going to start with the U.S.; technology in the U.S. is caught up in American late-stage (or financialized) capitalism where profitability isn't the goal; perpetual return on investment is. Given this, the tools that we're seeing developed by corporations reinforce capitalist agendas. Innovation will require pushing past this capitalist infrastructure to achieve the social benefits and civic innovation that will work in the United States. China is a whole other ball of wax. If you want to go there, follow up with me. But pay attention to Taobao centers. We haven't hit peak awful yet. I have every confidence that social and civic innovation can be beneficial in the long run (with a caveat that I think that climate change dynamics might ruin all of that), but no matter what, I don't think we're going to see significant positive change by 2030. I think things are going to get much worse before they start to get better. I should also note that I don't think that many players have taken responsibility for what's unfolding. Yes, tech companies are starting to see that things might be a problem, but that's only on the surface. News media does not at all acknowledge its role in amplifying discord (or its financialized dynamics). The major financiers of this economy don't take any responsibility for what's unfolding. Etc.\"</p><p>Barry Chudakov, principal at Sertain Research, said, \"We are in the midst of a remarkable social and civic experiment: democracy by device. The total installed base of Internet of Things-connected devices is projected to amount to 75.44 billion worldwide by 2025. Our devices are ubiquitous vectors of data. Our social and civic innovation has not kept pace. 'Techlash' is a groan of realization: As data assumes an ever-greater role in our day-to-day lives, imperatives emerge. Foremost among these is factfulness. Data summations will become like the atomic clock; we set our communal watches by them. Success in social and civic innovation will become data-driven and dependent. Tools presenting radical transparency will enable democracies to come through the meme wars and infowars that widespread device usage engenders. New groups and systems will emerge to demand (in Ray Dalio's words) radical truthfulness, which will depend on radical transparency. We must all see how information is presented to us, who is presenting it and have certainty that it is true or false. With this transparency and a commitment to truth and fact over innuendo, accusation and smear, democracy will survive. Technology's greatest contribution to social and civic innovation in the next decade will be to provide accurate, user-friendly context and honest assessment of issues, problems and potential solutions while at the same time maintaining ethical artificial intelligence and data protocols. We are facing greater accelerations of climate change, social mobility, pollution, immigration and resource issues. Our problems have gone from complicated to wicked. We need clear answers and discussions that are cogent, relevant and true to facts. Technology must guard against becoming a platform to enable targeted chaos, that is, using technology as a means to obfuscate and manipulate. We are all now living in Sim City: The digital world is showing us a sim, or digital mirror, of each aspect of reality. The most successful social and civic innovation I expect to see by 2030 is a massive restructuring of our educational systems based on new and emerging mirror digital worlds. We will then need to expand our information presentations to include verifiable factfulness that ensures any digital presentation faithfully and accurately matches the physical realities. ... Just as medicine went from bloodletting and leeches and lobotomies to open-heart surgery and artificial limbs, technology will begin to modernize information flows around core issues: urgent need, future implications, accurate assessment. Technology can play a crucial role to move humanity from blame fantasies to focused attention and working solutions.\"</p><p>We are in the midst of a remarkable social and civic experiment: democracy by device.</p><p>Barry Chudakov</p><p>Jennifer Jarratt, co-principal of Leading Futurists LLC, wrote, \"The development of new social technologies will provoke social change, some beneficial, some not. By 2030 we will have data we've never had before to enable us to influence people in new ways. I don't agree with the assumptions being made in the section where we are asked to rank items. Society, and people, aren't likely to become more idealistic or support 'good outcomes,' although they'll go along with change if it seems to benefit their own lives. And with new technologies come new crimes and criminals opportunities for all! I think we can become much more efficient at managing the everyday business of governing a complex society and at least in theory, we could have an uprising of willingness to rebuild society in a new model that works with the digital age. We might have to have a revolution first to get us there.\"</p><p>Stowe Boyd, consulting futurist expert in technological evolution and the future of work, responded, \"Technological change is an accelerant and acts on the social ills like pouring gasoline on a fire. In an uncontrolled hyper-capitalist society, the explosion in technologies over the past 30 years has only widened inequality, concentrated wealth and led to greater social division. And it is speeding up with the rise of artificial intelligence, which like globalization has destabilized Western industrial economies while admittedly pulling hundreds of millions elsewhere out of poverty. And the boiling exhaust of this set of forces is pushing the planet into a climate catastrophe. The world is as unready for hundreds of millions of climate refugees as it was for the plague. However, some variant of social media will likely form the context for the rise of a global movement to stop the madness which I call the Human Spring which will be more like Occupy or the Yellow Vests than traditional politics. I anticipate a grassroots movement characterized by general strikes, political action, protest and widespread disruption of the economy that will confront the economic and political system of the West. Lead by the young, ultimately this will lead to large-scale political reforms, such as universal health care, direct democracy, a new set of rights for individuals and a large set of checks on the power of corporations and political parties. For example, eliminating corporate contributions to political campaigns, countering monopolies and effectively accounting for economic externalities, like carbon.\"</p><p>Beth Noveck, director of NYU's Governance Lab and its MacArthur FoundationResearch Network on Opening Governance, said, \"While we worry with very good reason about the impact of new technology on the future of work, especially the dislocation of workers and decrease in wages as a result of automation, there are also hopeful advances in the use of new technology to improve working conditions, rendering work safer and more humane. In some cases, new technologies like robotics are eliminating repetitive, dreary assembly line tasks. In some cases, automation is helping to perform dangerous work that endangers worker health. In some cases, artificial intelligence technologies are making it possible to match workers to new education and employment opportunities that are best suited to them and making it easier for them to find work. In some cases, machine learning tools are able to monitor workplace conditions to improve worker safety. However, these positive benefits will scarcely be realized without the right policies to encourage invest in and use of such tools instead of simply the use of new technology to reduce labor costs. The future is by no means certain, but the potential is there. ... We will also see proliferating experiments with new kinds of tools to improve workplace conditions and worker safety. Where I am less optimistic is about the power of civil and social tech per se to upend the power of big tech companies or subvert the role of capital in our political and economic institutions. I think we will need far-reaching legislative and policy action to address inequality, the causes of which will not be solved by technology.\"</p><p>Brad Templeton, internet pioneer, futurist and activist, a former president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote, \"Imagining that there would be no innovation would be a remarkably stark view; the question remains about whether it will be enough. The greatest barrier is that legal and democratic institutions are deliberately resistant to change, so much so that improvements may only come outside them. Since there is now high awareness of these issues, I expect substantial effort on them. Effort will be more successful in private areas where innovation is more popular. Normally would be optimistic about success. Counter to that optimism is we now have parties actively fighting against success in some of these areas, so it's a question of who will win, not just is winning possible.\"</p><p>Gina Glantz, political strategist and founder of GenderAvenger, said, \"Watching the exponential growth of small-dollar fundraising on both sides of the aisle could well be an encouraging model for journalism, especially local journalism. The Guardian and Wikipedia have shown it is possible to create public enthusiasm and support. In a world where there is universal health care, the ability to develop technology to improve individual health through the use of a variety of tools is certainly a possibility.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123801631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6090-K9P1-JCBF-S0XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Google operates Google Pay in India, similar to Paytm. So, in effect Google could be abusing its position of power, which impacts competition, opine legal experts.<br/> 'Conflict of interest' Android enjoys a 90 per cent share in India. \"Such a conflict of interest is not healthy and requires constant attention from the Competition regulator,\" said Santosh Pai, Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies. <br/> Udai Singh Mehta, Deputy Executive Director, CUTS International, a think tank, is of the view that it raises questions about platform neutrality in the payments ecosystem.<br/> On September 18, Google removed Paytm for a few hours, citing that the latter, with its Paytm First Games, had violated its policies pertaining to gambling. Google said in a blog post that it did not allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting. Subsequently, Paytm removed an offer that gave its users stickers, for payments and money transfers, which could then be used to redeem cashbacks, and was reinstated.<br/> This, however, raises broader questions such as the one raised by Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma who has pointed out that the search giant is the 'judge, jury and executioner.'<br/> These issues resurfaced in August when Google was hit with a class-action antitrust lawsuit in the US for alleged abuse of its market power, including the exclusion of competition, the stifling of innovation, the inhibition of consumer choice, and Google's imposition of a 30 per cent transaction fee on Play Store transactions on app developers.<br/> Owner's right? So, as a platform owner, does Google not have the rights to impose certain policies? <br/> \"Every platform owner is free to impose policies for the use of its platform. Google Play policies for real money gambling, games and contests (which include fantasy sports) require such apps to be in compliance with local laws. Google is well aware that, having a dominant position in India, if it arbitrarily restricts applications providing competing services from the Play Store, without a compelling reason, then such action could be challenged as anti-competitive,\" stated Anupam Shukla, Counsel, Pioneer Legal.<br/> In India, fantasy sports are considered \"games-of-skill\" and not \"games-of-chance\" and are therefore not prohibited as per Centre's gambling laws. Also, gambling is a State subject. <br/> This also raises questions on consumer rights, and will more apps get removed? Buzz in the industry is that some other high profile apps, in the ongoing IPL, are under Google's scanner. \"Such issues will continue to play up, considering that every business forays into each other's terrains,\" said Lloyd Mathias, an angel investor and former head of marketing of HP.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A536631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WD-8271-JBYT-H3B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 20, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Google operates Google Pay in India, similar to Paytm. </p><p>So, in effect Google could be abusing its position of power, which impacts competition, opine legal experts.'Conflict of interest'Android enjoys a 90 per cent share in India. 'Such a conflict of interest is not healthy and requires constant attention from the Competition regulator,' said Santosh Pai, Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies.Udai Singh Mehta, Deputy Executive Director, CUTS International, a think tank, is of the view that it raises questions about platform neutrality in the payments ecosystem.On September 18, Google removed Paytm for a few hours, citing that the latter, with its Paytm First Games, had violated its policies pertaining to gambling. Google said in a blog post that it did not allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting. Subsequently, Paytm removed an offer that gave its users stickers, for payments and money transfers, which could then be used to redeem cashbacks, and was reinstated.This, however, raises broader questions such as the one raised by Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma who has pointed out that the search giant is the 'judge, jury and executioner.'These issues resurfaced in August when Google was hit with a class-action antitrust lawsuit in the US for alleged abuse of its market power, including the exclusion of competition, the stifling of innovation, the inhibition of consumer choice, and Google's imposition of a 30 per cent transaction fee on Play Store transactions on app developers.Owner's right?So, as a platform owner, does Google not have the rights to impose certain policies?'Every platform owner is free to impose policies for the use of its platform. Google Play policies for real money gambling, games and contests (which include fantasy sports) require such apps to be in compliance with local laws. Google is well aware that, having a dominant position in India, if it arbitrarily restricts applications providing competing services from the Play Store, without a compelling reason, then such action could be challenged as anti-competitive,' stated Anupam Shukla, Counsel, Pioneer Legal.In India, fantasy sports are considered 'games-of-skill' and not 'games-of-chance' and are therefore not prohibited as per Centre's gambling laws. Also, gambling is a State subject.This also raises questions on consumer rights, and will more apps get removed? Buzz in the industry is that some other high profile apps, in the ongoing IPL, are under Google's scanner. 'Such issues will continue to play up, considering that every business forays into each other's terrains,' said Lloyd Mathias, an angel investor and former head of marketing of HP. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-HIN104256160064678756975776100068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIN-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WH-X141-JCMN-Y2GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><timeReceived>12:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Hindu Business Line</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But focus on the issue is a net positive for the ongoing policy debate, they said. Experts question, though, whether attention to broadband as part of rural-focused campaign platforms will translate into a shift in support among those voters who moved away from Democrats in the 2016 election.</p><p>Rural broadband connectivity isn't the only telecom issue mentioned on the campaign trail; others include prison phone rates and undoing the FCC's rescission of its 2015 net neutrality rules. But it has clearly gotten the most attention, said Public Knowledge Policy Director Phillip Berenbroick. \"Part of it is\" that all the candidates are vying for Iowa voters in that state's first-in-the-nation Feb. 3 caucuses \"and a big issue in a lot of the rural states is access to broadband,\" he said. \"The campaigns understand these communities want connectivity and feel they've been left behind,\" especially amid the rollout of 5G in more urban areas.</p><p>President Donald Trump repeatedly voiced interest in working with Congress on an infrastructure package, including rural broadband, but \"we haven't actually seen anything that would really do that,\" Berenbroick said. The communications sector hoped for more appetite for infrastructure legislation this year because Democrats regained the majority in the House in the 2018 election (see 1811130011). Talks between Trump and Democratic leaders on a potential infrastructure package broke down in May (see 1905220076).</p><p>\"The moment has passed for infrastructure legislation\" to have a viable path forward before the 2020 election, said Cowen's Paul Gallant. \"There was a brief window\" during the last Congress when political dynamics would have made a consensus possible but once Democrats won the House majority last year \"that complicated dealmaking\" significantly. Trump in 2018 proposed $50 billion in federal funding for rural infrastructure projects allocated via state block grants, but the proposal congressional Democrats criticized it for not including dedicated broadband funding (see 1802120001).</p><p>\"While Democrats are picking numbers out of the sky\" in their broadband pitch to voters, the president \"has been busy delivering real results,\" emailed a Trump campaign spokesperson. \"This administration has focused on expanding broadband infrastructure, including investments in the cutting-edge industries to include rural broadband.\"</p><p>Five Democratic candidates still in the race proposed broadband funding plans in recent months, including four of the five hopefuls usually at the top of most recent primary polls -- former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also proposed broadband funding as part of her campaign (see 1908070070).</p><p>Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the other leading Democratic presidential candidate, hasn't released a specific broadband funding proposal but has spoken generally about the need to increase it. A climate policy platform she released Wednesday proposes requiring federal agencies to partner with rural electric cooperatives to help rural communities that lack broadband access. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee released broadband-related plans before suspending their presidential quests (see 1908210055).</p><p>Political Impact</p><p>Broadband funding proposals gave presidential rivals an opportunity to distinguish \"their views on the role of government,\" Gallant said. Announced plans range from Biden's $20 billion proposal to Sanders' $150 billion, which would require \"Big Tech companies to pay into\" the USF (see 1908220061). \"Biden is more moderate and centrist,\" while Sanders \"has a more revolutionary tone to a lot of his policies,\" Gallant said. Congressional Democrats focused on their Leading Infrastructure for Tomorrow's (Lift) America Act. HR-2741 would allocate $40 billion for broadband projects, $12 billion for next-generation 911 and $5 billion for a loan and credit program for broadband projects (see 1905150061).</p><p>In making concrete broadband proposals, the Democrats send \"a strong signal to rural voters that they matter\" in a way the party failed to do during the 2016 election, said University of Minnesota political science professor Tim Lindberg. The candidates' rural-focused plans alone aren't \"going to move the needle very much\" in swaying those voters from Republicans, Lindberg said. \"There are so many other issues on a local level that seem to be more pressing,\" like the economy and healthcare.</p><p>\"You have to override\" many rural voters' \"belief in smaller government,\" Lindberg said. \"If you're saying the federal government is going to provide $80 billion-worth\" of broadband funding, \"that's going to be a hard sell\" to rural voters. Trump would \"need to continue to lose support\" from rural voters at the same rate he has in recent months over his trade policies and other matters for the Democrats' proposals on broadband and other rural issues to sway that part of the electorate, said Texas Tech University political science professor Seth McKee. \"Otherwise it's going to be so marginal\" an issue \"that it doesn't even register when you look at the polls.\"</p><p>Lindberg and McKee divided on which party would benefit politically from the Trump-Capitol Hill impasse over infrastructure legislation. \"Democrats would have the high ground on that if they can be convincing in their argument,\" McKee said. \"Infrastructure was the one [policy] issue\" on the agenda after the 2016 election \"that clearly would have had bipartisan support but Trump never\" followed through.</p><p>\"Both parties\" can use the federal impasse on infrastructure to sway rural voters, but \"I don't think either the Republicans or the Democrats are going to use it well,\" Lindberg said.</p><p>Policy Debate</p><p>The Democratic contenders' interest in rural broadband likely means \"for the first time, specific broadband commitments will be part\" of the Democrats' election platform, Gallant said, citing earlier comments (see 1908280041). \"It fits naturally with a broader infrastructure pitch,\" he said now. \"Broadband is one of the sexier pieces of infrastructure, so I'm sure it will be highlighted,\" especially once the party adopts its platform during the July Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee.</p><p>\"There now seems to be national recognition that large stretches of rural America do not have broadband\" access and \"that so many candidates on the Democratic side are talking about the need for rural broadband funding is good news,\" said Internet Innovation Alliance honorary Chairman Rick Boucher. \"Good things can come from that in terms of solid proposals\" for a new administration if Trump loses re-election. \"It's terrific\" it's getting attention now, said Boucher, saying he was talking about it as Democratic House Communications Subcommittee chairman before the 2010 election.</p><p>Talk about broadband funding during the primaries only makes the policy debate \"even more complex\" because it will raise questions about potential federal action even as state governments move forward with their own plans, said American Action Forum Director-Technology and Innovation Policy Will Rinehart. \"It doesn't mean that an infrastructure bill is going to be any more likely to pass during the next Congress.\"</p><p>Net neutrality isn't likely to draw much attention during the primaries because there's no real distinction among the Democrats' positions here, Berenbroick and others said. Seventeen of the 21 current Democratic hopefuls declared support for restoring in some form the rules. Biden, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam and businessman Tom Steyer haven't taken a position.</p><p>If a question on net neutrality came up in primary debates, \"you might see people competing to have the strongest answer but essentially they'd all have the same response ... to put the old rules back,\" said Free Press General Counsel Matt Wood. Legislative efforts to restore the 2015 rules drew unanimous Democratic support in the Senate last year and in the House this year (see 1904100062), so it would be \"surprising if there was any candidate\" for the party's presidential nomination who opposed those regulations, Berenbroick said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X18-46B1-DYRJ-03T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 06, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

With technological advancement presenting us with the convenience of smartphones and tablets, children have familiarised themselves with the latest gadgets as well.</p><p><br/> Many countries, in fact, urge parents to keep their children away from television and gadgets up till a certain age.<br/>France, for instance, urges parents not to allow children under three to watch TV, and American paediatricians also favour a total ban on screen time until at least 18 months.<br/> Carole Bienaime-Besse, who sits on France's TV regulator, the CSA, claimed Sunday that overexposing babies and small children to digital devices has become a \"public health issue\".<br/> \"People are realising that screens can cause addiction even among very small children, and in extreme cases autistic problems, what is called virtual autism,\" she said.<br/> \"Silicon Valley also knows this. There are lots of educational apps for babies, but in the end the results are counterproductive,\" Bienaime-Besse said.<br/> Studies show that \"children over-exposed to them are the ones who find it hardest at school,\" she said.<br/>France banned its broadcasters from targeting under-threes in 2008, and blocked Fox-owned BabyTV from launching there.<br/> But some programme makers insist that bans do not work, especially with so many parents using television and devices to \"babysit\" their children.<br/> \"It is admirable, but probably unrealistic\" to try to keep small children away from screens, said Alice Webb, who heads the BBC's children's arm, CBBC, and the CBeebies network for pre-school children.<br/> \"Those times are long gone. Digital is everywhere. This is a tide you cannot get ahead of,\" she told top TV executives Sunday at the MIPJunior gathering at Cannes on the French Riviera.<br/> That said, the British public broadcaster is so worried about the digital \"wild, Wild West\" children are growing up in that it is holding a global summit in December to try to put heads together on how they might be better served and protected.<br/> \"We need to have this conversation now because we don't want to be saying to ourselves in 10 years time, 'What did we do to our children?'\" Webb told AFP.<br/> She said the BBC aimed CBeebies at children from two upwards, \"but we know children younger than that are watching. So we have to be realistic about this, and bear those children in mind\" knowing that the TV or a tablet may be their \"babysitter\".<br/> \"We have games and apps that are about helping children develop the cognitive skills that a two-year-old needs. This is about learning on screen and in the real world at the same time, it is not an either or and it's all about moderation,\" Webb argued.<br/> For older children, Webb said it was \"impossible to think we can control what goes online\".<br/> She said the only answer was to \"teach children what is and is not for them... how to develop critical thinking and how to cope when they see things they don't want.\"<br/> She said the BBC is setting up a new online resource called \"Own It\" to help children deal with the dangers and challenges of social media.<br/> While Instagram, Twitter and Facebook claim that only teenagers over 13 are allowed onto their networks, Webb said that in the UK 75 percent of 10-year-olds and above are on social media.<br/> Despite what the social media giants say, \"statistics suggest otherwise and they are finding it harder to stand behind that line,\" Webb said.<br/> Bienaime-Besse said regulators need stronger powers so they can act against inappropriate online content in the same way as they do with traditional broadcasters.<br/> \"I think it is absurd that the likes of Facebook and Twitter are not regulated like other content suppliers.\"<br/> And she was sceptical that the industry would regulate itself when it came to younger children.<br/> However, \"if you go to Silicon Valley, all the big tech executives send their children to Montessori schools without screens and just blackboards.<br/> \"And Steve Jobs of Apple did not allow his children to use an iPad.\"<br/> Bienaime-Bess said parents had to wake up to \"what we are holding in our hands. A child who cannot defend themselves should be protected from the harm that these very useful tools can bring.<br/> \"Kids should become masters of technology by learning coding\" rather than being slaves to it, she said.<br/> (With AFP inputs)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ZEENWS-n10226208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ZEENWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PR6-X061-DYDW-73X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423543</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Zee News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 16, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But it is worth listening to some of the big warnings too. Last month Kate Crawford, principal researcher at Microsoft Research, warned that the increasing power of AI could result in a \"fascist's dream\" if the technology were misused by authoritarian regimes. \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as we are seeing a step function increase in the speed of AI, something else is happening: the rise of ultra-nationalism, rightwing authoritarianism and fascism,\" Ms Crawford told the SXSW tech conference. The creation of vast data registries, the targeting of population groups, the abuse of predictive policing and the manipulation of political beliefs could all be enabled by AI, she said. Ms Crawford is not alone in expressing concern about the misapplication of powerful new technologies, sometimes in unintentional ways.</p><p>Sir Mark Walport, the British government's chief scientific adviser, warned that the unthinking use of AI in areas such as medicine and the law, involving nuanced human judgment, could produce damaging results and erode public trust in the technology. Although AI had the potential to enhance human judgment, it also risked baking in harmful prejudices and giving them a spurious sense of objectivity. \"Machine learning could internalise all the implicit biases contained within the history of sentencing or medical treatment - and externalise these through their algorithms,\" he wrote in an article in Wired.</p><p>As ever, the dangers are a lot easier to identify than they are to fix. Unscrupulous regimes are never going to observe regulations constraining the use of AI. But even in functioning law-based democracies it will be tricky to frame an appropriate response. Maximising the positive contributions that AI can make while minimising its harmful consequences will be one of the toughest public policy challenges of our times.</p><p>For starters, the technology is difficult to understand and its use is often surreptitious. It is also becoming increasingly hard to find independent experts, who have not been captured by the industry or are not otherwise conflicted. Driven by something approaching a commercial arms race in the field, the big tech companies have been snapping up many of the smartest academic experts in AI.</p><p>Much cutting-edge research is therefore in the private rather than public domain.</p><p>To their credit, some leading tech companies have acknowledged the need for transparency, albeit belatedly. There has been a flurry of initiatives to encourage more policy research and public debate about AI.</p><p><person><nameText>Elon Musk, </nameText></person>founder of Tesla Motors, has helped set up OpenAI, a non-profit research company pursuing safe ways to develop AI. Amazon, Facebook, Google DeepMind, IBM, Microsoft and Applehave also come together in Partnership on AI to initiate more public discussion about the real-world applications of the technology.</p><p>Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google DeepMind and a co-chair of the Partnership, says AI can play a transformative role in addressing some of the biggest challenges of our age. But he accepts that the rate of progress in AI is outstripping our collective ability to understand and control these systems. Leading AI companies must therefore become far more innovative and proactive in holding themselves to account. To that end, the London-based company is experimenting with verifiable data audits and will soon announce the composition of an ethics board to scrutinise all the company's activities.</p><p>But Mr Suleyman suggests our societies will also have to devise better frameworks for directing these technologies for the collective good. \"We have to be able to control these systems so they do what we want when we want and they don't run ahead of us,\" he says in an interview for the FT Tech Tonic podcast. Some observers say the best way to achieve that is to adapt our legal regimes to ensure that AI systems are \"explainable\" to the public.</p><p>That sounds simple in principle, but may prove fiendishly complex in practice. Mireille Hildebrandt, professor of law and technology at the Free University of Brussels, says one of the dangers of AI is that we become overly reliant on \"mindless minds\" that we do not fully comprehend. She argues that the purpose and effect of these algorithms must therefore be testable and contestable in a courtroom. \"If you cannot meaningfully explain your system's decisions then you cannot make them,\" she says. We are going to need a lot more human intelligence to address the challenges of AI.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6ujwiz48jxl5qu26i5f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NBK-TBD1-F0J6-J3B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Technology giants such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon will likely be impacted by this broader review.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Justice Department wants to know if the leading online players are \"engaging in anti-competitive practices and depriving users of benefits\". The probe comes at a time when there are increasing calls around the world for regulating these companies.</p><p>What is being reviewed?</p><p>The Justice Department's press release states that it will be reviewing \"whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power\". It will also check whether these players \"are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers\".</p><p>The review will consider \"widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online\". The department will be seeking information from the public and \"industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms\".</p><p>While it does not name the big tech companies, the dominance of Google in search, Facebook in social media, and Amazon in online retail is unparalleled, and all three will likely face a review of their market practices.</p><p>But why are these firms being reviewed?</p><p>In the US, Google has close to 90 per cent market share in search. Amazon's share in the online market space is around 37 per cent, according to a report by EMarketer in June 2019. In social media, Facebook remains dominant with its apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp having more than a billion users each.</p><p>In the past, Facebook has also been accused of stifling competition by either buying out rivals or by introducing features that are a direct copy of its biggest rivals.</p><p>Is it the first time that these companies are facing scrutiny?</p><p>The call for regulation is not new; indeed, there have been such demands across the world in the past.</p><p>Facebook was recently fined $5 billion by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for violating and misusing user privacy. Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has called for big tech companies such as Facebook to be broken up. There is a worry that these companies are completely monopolising the online space and killing all competition.</p><p>The European Union (EU) has hit Google with three separate fines since 2017; all fines have been on account of antitrust and anti-competitive practices. In March 2019, it was a 1.5 billion fine for Google misusing its AdSense technology. In 2018, the fine was a record 4.3 billion for misusing its dominant position with Android, and in 2017, the number stood at 2.4 billion for dominating shopping search results with its own pages and stifling competition.</p><p>Germany opened investigations into Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers in 2018 and, in 2019, Austria and Italy opened antitrust investigations against the e-commerce giant. On July 17, the EU opened a separate investigation into anti-competitive practices by Amazon.</p><p>Apple will face an antitrust inquiry from the EU as a formal probe will begin over music-streaming service Spotify's complaint that the technology giant was effectively charging a tax on its competitors by demanding a 30 per cent fee for in-app subscriptions and payments.</p><p>In India, Google was fined $21.1 million for search bias by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year.

Two groups of U.S. state attorneys general on Friday announced separate antitrust probes of large tech companies such as Alphabet's Google and Facebook. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are investigating the two firms, and could potentially probe Apple and Amazon. Here are three possible outcomes to investigations of the companies by U.S. regulators and state attorneys general. </p><p>BREAK THEM UP Senator Elizabeth Warren has vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected U.S. president to promote competition in the technology sector. While some Democratic lawmakers, and even a few Republicans, favor breaking up the companies, the appetite for such a dramatic action is not widespread in Washington. Tech companies are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent US$21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent US$14.2 million and Facebook spent US$12.62 million. Warren and other lawmakers argue big tech companies smother small businesses and start-ups that are a threat. Facebook critic and co-founder Chris Hughes says the social media company has too much power over speech and that it is willing to \"sacrifice security and civility for clicks.\" But antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&amp;T being the two biggest examples. The most famous case in recent memory is the government's effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact. MAKE THEM PAY HUGE FINES In its recent settlement with the Federal Trade Commission for privacy abuses, Facebook agreed to pay a US$5-billion fine after it was found to have inappropriately shared user data. Facebook, which also owns Instagram and Whatsapp, said it would do more to protect user privacy, but the overall deal was criticized by regulators and lawmakers for not doing enough to rein in Facebook's market power or make company executives accountable. The three Republican FTC commissioners who voted in favor of the settlement called it \"a complete home run\" that exceeded any possible award if the case had gone to court. They also said they did not have the power to impose greater restrictions on how Facebook collects, uses and shares data. While any future fines from the FTC, Justice Department or state attorneys general could be attention-grabbing in size, the companies are the world's most valuable by stock market valuation and can easily pay large fines. They each generate in excess of US$50 billion in sales each year. FORCE THEM TO AID COMPETITORS Democratic lawmakers in Washington have on several occasions suggested one way to address big tech's market power on social media would be to make it easier for consumers to move data like photographs and contacts from one application to another, potentially opening up a path for new tech entrants to compete with companies like Facebook. The idea, which is already part of European law, has the support of Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who leads the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, and Senator Mark Warner. Cicilline has said giving consumers the power to move their data would spur the growth of social media alternatives that could offer features such as greater privacy or less advertising. But the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out that on its own, \"data portability cannot magically improve competition; the ability to take your data to another service is not helpful if there are no viable competitors.\" They also noted in a September 2018 report that a data portability project between Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Google \"won't meaningfully help competition unless they allow users to move their data beyond a small cabal of incumbent services. Right now they don't.\" Facebook said last week in a white paper it \"supports the principle of data portability\" but did not outline specific future actions. Tech industry lobbyists at the Internet Association support the concept, and Facebook published research in support of the topic last week.

The matte...</p><p>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said it will block news sharing on its platforms in Australia if the government goes ahead with a law to force it, and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, to pay local media outlets for featuring their content on its platforms.   The matter is being watched closely around the world as it represents the biggest challenge so far to the way the U.S. tech giants use news on some of the world\u2019s biggest websites.  WHAT DOES THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION SAY?  ** The draft law states that Australian news outlets can negotiate individually or collectively with Facebook and Google over payment for content used on the tech firms\u2019 sites. Other tech firms may be added if they are deemed big enough.   ** If the parties cannot reach an agreement, an arbitrator will decide whose offer is more reasonable. If Facebook or Google break any resulting agreements, they can be fined up to A$10 million (5.52 million pounds) in civil penalties.   ** The draft also requires tech firms give media outlets notice when they change search algorithms in a way affecting the order in which content appears. They must also share their use of consumer data extracted from news content on their sites.   ** The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission began investigating \u201cbig tech\u201d in 2017 and sought feedback on the draft until Aug. 28. It now hopes to work with government and industry to redraft the law before it goes before parliament.   ** While internet and media companies have battled in other jurisdictions - notably in Germany over copyright of news snippets and other items published by Google - Australia\u2019s proposal represents the most expansive reform.  WHY WAS THE LAW PROPOSED?  ** In recent years, traditional media companies operating in Australia have suffered huge hits to income streams, such as subscriptions and advertising. For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, the competition regulator has said.   ** Last year, the regulator published a report stating news outlets lacked bargaining power when negotiating with digital firms over compensation for content posted on online platforms. It said this was a problem because those same publishers relied on Facebook and Google to reach many of their consumers.   ** The government wanted the tech giants to abide by a voluntary code. Citing lack of progress in discussions, it decided earlier this year that legislation was necessary.  WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN?  ** The local arm of News Corp is a vocal supporter  of the legislation. It partly blamed the tech companies for the closure of dozens of mastheads earlier this year.   ** Facebook and Google said they help connect media outlets with consumers, boosting their subscriptions and enabling them to charge advertisers more. Facebook said in the first five months of 2020 it sent 2.3 billion \u201cclicks\u201d worth about A$200 million to Australian news websites via articles appearing on Facebook users\u2019 pages. Google has said it would pay for content, though no major media organisation has agreed to its terms.   ** Australia has previously engaged in lengthy battles with major corporations. In 2012, the then centre-left government became the first in the world to prohibit cigarette companies from using designs on their packaging to attract consumers. Tobacco companies mounted legal challenges but the courts ultimately upheld the law.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42971197384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-H3P1-JCSC-J1FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The matte...</p><p>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said it will block news sharing on its platforms in Australia if the government goes ahead with a law to force it, and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, to pay local media outlets for featuring their content on its platforms.   The matter is being watched closely around the world as it represents the biggest challenge so far to the way the U.S. tech giants use news on some of the world\u2019s biggest websites.  WHAT DOES THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION SAY?  ** The draft law states that Australian news outlets can negotiate individually or collectively with Facebook and Google over payment for content used on the tech firms\u2019 sites. Other tech firms may be added if they are deemed big enough.   ** If the parties cannot reach an agreement, an arbitrator will decide whose offer is more reasonable. If Facebook or Google break any resulting agreements, they can be fined up to A$10 million (5.52 million pounds) in civil penalties.   ** The draft also requires tech firms give media outlets notice when they change search algorithms in a way affecting the order in which content appears. They must also share their use of consumer data extracted from news content on their sites.   ** The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission began investigating \u201cbig tech\u201d in 2017 and sought feedback on the draft until Aug. 28. It now hopes to work with government and industry to redraft the law before it goes before parliament.   ** While internet and media companies have battled in other jurisdictions - notably in Germany over copyright of news snippets and other items published by Google - Australia\u2019s proposal represents the most expansive reform.  WHY WAS THE LAW PROPOSED?  ** In recent years, traditional media companies operating in Australia have suffered huge hits to income streams, such as subscriptions and advertising. For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, the competition regulator has said.   ** Last year, the regulator published a report stating news outlets lacked bargaining power when negotiating with digital firms over compensation for content posted on online platforms. It said this was a problem because those same publishers relied on Facebook and Google to reach many of their consumers.   ** The government wanted the tech giants to abide by a voluntary code. Citing lack of progress in discussions, it decided earlier this year that legislation was necessary.  WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN?  ** The local arm of News Corp is a vocal supporter  of the legislation. It partly blamed the tech companies for the closure of dozens of mastheads earlier this year.   ** Facebook and Google said they help connect media outlets with consumers, boosting their subscriptions and enabling them to charge advertisers more. Facebook said in the first five months of 2020 it sent 2.3 billion \u201cclicks\u201d worth about A$200 million to Australian news websites via articles appearing on Facebook users\u2019 pages. Google has said it would pay for content, though no major media organisation has agreed to its terms.   ** Australia has previously engaged in lengthy battles with major corporations. In 2012, the then centre-left government became the first in the world to prohibit cigarette companies from using designs on their packaging to attract consumers. Tobacco companies mounted legal challenges but the courts ultimately upheld the law.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42971189144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-H3P1-JCSC-J1FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

In the case of the Florida papers that Archer looked at, for instance \u2014 The left-leaning Tampa Bay Times and right-leaning Tampa Tribune \u2014 the Times acquired the Tribune in 2016[1], and there's now just one newspaper[2] for Tampa Bay. (One of the questions in the acquisition FAQ[3] for readers: 'I've preferred the Tribune because I want conservative viewpoints on the editorial pages. </p><p>Does the Times publish those?') The EU tells big tech companies that the clock's ticking. The European Commission rolled out new guidelines for online platforms and search engines in Europe. From The Wall Street Journal[4]: The European Commission \u2014 the bloc's executive body\u2014 proposed new EU-wide regulations that would require web platforms, including search engines like Google, to provide more transparency about their search rankings. The rules also aim to prevent web platforms from offering unfair terms to small businesses that use their services to sell or promote products. Ahead of European Parliament elections in 2019, the commission also urged platforms to do more to halt the spread of disinformation or 'fake news,' on their sites, or face possible regulation. It asked web platforms to draw up a voluntary code of conduct by July with the aim of seeing changes by October. It said the EU was first pursuing industry self-regulation, but if that fails it would explore other options 'including regulatory ones targeted at a few platforms.' Some of the other measures the EC outlined include increased media literacy programming and a network of European fact-checkers; those are here[5]. Reuters' Rasmus Kleis Nielsen argues that a lot of these are awfully vague (thread).5. Creation of network of Research Centers focused on studying disinformation across the EU. Again, very little on this, and no clear commitment of $$$. Given how poorly understood precise nature of problem is, especially across very different member states, a missed opportunity \u2014 Rasmus Kleis Nielsen (@rasmus_kleis) April 26, 2018[6] Illustration from L.M.

But for years, John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms, where there are few pesky pedestrians or government rules to get in the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a glimpse of the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m., thanks to technology that left most of the driving to a computer.</p><p>The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually and handles the turns himself to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years,\" Poole said.</p><p>The advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbour can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard.</p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors is less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on. For now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel - even if they never touch it.</p><p>They've already started to transform farming: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self-guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice-president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group.</p><p>\"John Deere is the largest operator of autonomous vehicles,\" said Catherine Sandoval, a California public utilities commissioner, at a recent event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Some farmers aren't shy about their enthusiasm for the technology - even uploading videos showing it off online. One appears to show a tractor hauling a planter making a tightly choreographed turn without a driver in the cab. In another, the driver takes pictures, throws paper airplanes and balances a water bottle on his nose before appearing to nod off while the tractor keeps working his field.</p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much more quickly than consumer automakers - and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Self-driving tech is also pushing into other industrial sectors at a pace that outstrips the consumer market. Earlier this year, the first self-driving semitruck licenced to drive on public roads in the United States made its debut in Nevada. Self-driving trucks are being rolled out for mining and oil operations in remote parts of the world.</p><p>Still, issues such as digital security fears, along with more traditional physical safety concerns, make it hard for consumer automakers to get their self-driving vehicles past various regulators and on to public roads. But tractor makers have shown that much of the technology needed to fulfil the promise of autonomous vehicles is here.</p><p>\"All of the things we're doing on the farm will find their way into the consumer market in the coming years,\" Reed said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2015080134215425</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GK3-MH71-DY91-K2KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>August 1, 2015 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000292K</classCode><className>DEERE &amp;

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice, which both have jurisdiction to enforce antitrust laws, have divided oversight over the four companies, with Amazon and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple and Google under the Justice Department, sources told Reuters. The potential investigations have been welcomed by some consumer advocates, who say big technology companies stifle competition and hold too much sway over speech and commerce. But some legal experts said the investigations may not lead to major reforms, noting that U.S. law makes it difficult to prove an antitrust violation. </p><p>The following answers some questions about the basics of U.S. antitrust law and what regulators will focus on: What are antitrust laws for? Antitrust laws seek to promote fair competition. A law from 1914, the Clayton Act, lets the government block mergers that would harm consumers. The Sherman Act, passed in 1890, prohibits price-fixing conspiracies and other agreements that restrain competition. The Sherman Act also lays out rules regarding monopoly power. It is these laws that the Justice Department and the FTC would likely focus on if they initiate investigations of the technology companies, legal experts said. Why would Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple face scrutiny? The Justice Department's focus is expected to be on allegations that Google favors its own products in search results and abuses its clout in the online advertising market, although it is expected to look at all of the company's businesses, sources told Reuters. It is not known what aspects of Amazon, Facebook, and Apple could be investigated. Google has said that changes to its search algorithms are made with consumers in mind, and that it is transparent in how it promotes its own services. Facebook has been called a social media monopoly by co-founder Chris Hughes, who said in a New York Times op-ed that it should be forced to sell off subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg, in his own op-ed, said, \"In this competitive environment, it is hard to sustain the claim that Facebook is a monopoly.\" Clegg wrote that Facebook is responsible for the sort of rapid, consumer-friendly innovation antitrust law is meant to encourage. In the United States, half of all online shopping transactions happen on Amazon, giving the ecommerce company sway over merchants that use its platforms. But in a 2018 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said \"Amazon remains a small player in global retail\" because most commerce still happens offline. Finally, some software developers argue Apple has a monopoly on its app marketplace, and uses this power to demand hefty commissions and engage in other anticompetitive practices. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told CBS News in an interview that aired on Tuesday that Apple does not have a dominant position in any market. What would the U.S. government need to prove to bring a case against the tech companies? It is difficult to show a violation of U.S. antitrust law, legal experts said. It is not enough for regulators to establish that a company has monopoly power. They must also show anticompetitive conduct - an abuse of that dominant position aimed at bypassing fair competition. \"You can get a monopoly just by being a good competitor and that's fine,\" said Chris Sagers, a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University. The Department of Justice and the FTC also need to show that consumers are being harmed, something that in recent decades has typically been measured by whether prices are going up and innovation is slowing. Using these metrics, it could be difficult to prove that technology companies, which do not charge money for many of their services, are hurting consumers, some legal experts said. But Charlotte Slaiman, an antitrust lawyer with consumer rights group Public Knowledge, said there is a growing consensus among economists and the public that it is misleading to call services such as Google and Facebook free. \"What is really going on is that consumers are bartering with their data in exchange for a service,\" Slaiman said. In 2013, the FTC closed an investigation into Google's search practices. The agency said that, while Google's changes to how it displayed search results likely harmed some rivals, there was \"ample evidence\" that Google was trying to improve user experience. What can the U.S. government do if investigators find an antitrust violation? The FTC and Justice Department can both file civil lawsuits in federal court and ask judges to order changes to a company's business model. The Justice Department can also bring criminal antitrust cases, but those prosecutions usually relate to cartels and price-fixing, making charges against big technology firms unlikely.

It is these laws that the Justice Department and the FTC would likely focus on if they initiate investigations of the technology companies, legal experts said.<br/> Why would Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple face scrutiny?<br/> The Justice Department's focus is expected to be on allegations that Google favours its own products in search results and abuses its clout in the online advertising market, although it is expected to look at all of the company's businesses, sources told Reuters.<br/> It is not known what aspects of Amazon, Facebook, and Apple could be investigated.<br/>Google has said that changes to its search algorithms are made with consumers in mind, and that it is transparent in how it promotes its own services.<br/>Facebook has been called a social media monopoly by co-founder Chris Hughes, who said in a New York Times op-ed that it should be forced to sell off subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram.<br/>Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg, in his own op-ed, said, \"In this competitive environment, it is hard to sustain the claim that Facebook is a monopoly.\"<br/> Clegg wrote that Facebook is responsible for the sort of rapid, consumer-friendly innovation antitrust law is meant to encourage.<br/> In the United States, half of all online shopping transactions happen on Amazon, giving the ecommerce company sway over merchants that use its platforms.<br/> But in a 2018 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said \"Amazon remains a small player in global retail\" because most commerce still happens offline.<br/> Finally, some software developers argue Apple has a monopoly on its app marketplace, and uses this power to demand hefty commissions and engage in other anticompetitive practices.<br/>Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told CBS News in an interview that aired on Tuesday that Apple does not have a dominant position in any market.<br/> What would the U.S. government need to prove to bring a case against the tech companies?<br/> It is difficult to show a violation of U.S. antitrust law, legal experts said.<br/> It is not enough for regulators to establish that a company has monopoly power. They must also show anticompetitive conduct - an abuse of that dominant position aimed at bypassing fair competition.<br/> \"You can get a monopoly just by being a good competitor and that's fine,\" said Chris Sagers, a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University.<br/> The Department of Justice and the FTC also need to show that consumers are being harmed, something that in recent decades has typically been measured by whether prices are going up and innovation is slowing.<br/> Using these metrics, it could be difficult to prove that technology companies, which do not charge money for many of their services, are hurting consumers, some legal experts said.<br/> But Charlotte Slaiman, an antitrust lawyer with consumer rights group Public Knowledge, said there is a growing consensus among economists and the public that it is misleading to call services such as Google and Facebook free.<br/> \"What is really going on is that consumers are bartering with their data in exchange for a service,\" Slaiman said.<br/> In 2013, the FTC closed an investigation into Google's search practices. The agency said that, while Google's changes to how it displayed search results likely harmed some rivals, there was \"ample evidence\" that Google was trying to improve user experience.<br/> What can the U.S. government do if investigators find an antitrust violation?<br/> The FTC and Justice Department can both file civil lawsuits in federal court and ask judges to order changes to a company's business model.<br/> The Justice Department can also bring criminal antitrust cases, but those prosecutions usually relate to cartels and price-fixing, making charges against big technology firms unlikely.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n11039806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB7-8JC1-DYDW-74YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 13, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&amp;T being the two biggest examples. Hughes' call to split Facebook from WhatsApp and Instagram followed a March pledge by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, to break up big tech companies. </p><p>Facebook rejected Hughes' call for a breakup. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for,\" Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said in an emailed statement. What is Hughes' argument? Hughes called for the Federal Trade Commission, working with the Justice Department, to force Facebook to undo its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. He said the three could become separate publicly traded companies. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives would be required to divest management shares. Hughes' criticisms of Facebook focused on its massive power over speech, and the fact that it was a tool that Russia used to manipulate U.S. voters in 2016 with false news reports. He also expressed concern that Zuckerberg had outsized power in such a dominant firm, saying: \"Mark is a good, kind person. But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.\" How could a breakup happen? To force a company to break up, the government would have to file a lawsuit demonstrating that the firm has market power in the industry and that the deal has hurt consumers by pushing up prices or reducing product quality. This could be particularly hard in the case of Facebook or other technology companies, especially those that provide a free service to users. \"The case law as it stands today would make the structural breakup of any of these companies very challenging,\" an antitrust expert based in Washington said. It is rare for the government to seek to break up an existing company, but it has been done. Famously, the United States sued to break up Standard Oil, accusing it of being an abusive monopoly. The case was fought all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1911 that the company should be broken up. In 1974, the U.S. government filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&amp;T Corp because it had a monopoly on telephone lines. After eight years of litigation, the two sides reached a settlement that led to AT&amp;T giving up control of its regional operating companies, or Baby Bells. Perhaps the most famous case is the government's effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact. There are recent examples with smaller companies. The Justice Department forced consumer review website Bazaarvoice Inc to undo a 2012 merger with rival PowerReviews in 2014. The FTC this week won a victory in trying to break up a merger of two prosthetic knee makers: Otto Bock HealthCare North America, Inc and Freedom Innovations. An administrative law judge ruled in its favor on May 6. What about privacy issues? U.S. lawmakers are also considering privacy legislation that would weaken companies like Facebook by reducing the amount of personal user data they control, thus reducing their value to advertisers. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said in April that the was considering legislation that would focus on data portability, so users of one social media could take their information from one site to another. How powerful is Facebook? Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies, including their considerable political heft. Facebook has huge global reach, with 1.56 billion users daily as of March. It had 37,700 full-time employees as of the end of March spread around offices in 20 U.S. cities and dozens more around the world. Tech companies are among the biggest U.S. political donors. Google spent US$21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent US$14.2 million and Facebook spent US$12.62 million, according to their filings to U.S. Congress.

U.S. regulators don't think so. At the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Technology Policy Institute Conference in August 2018, Deputy Assistant Attorneys General Barry Nigro and Roger Alford said they'd be unlikely to bring antitrust cases against big tech companies based on their collections of large amounts of data. But this view contrasts with the European Union (EU), where a few companies already face enormous fines for what regulators there consider competitive dominance in big data. </p><p>In this hoganlovells.com interview, Hogan Lovells partners Falk Sch\u00f6ning, based in Brussels, and Logan Breed, based in Washington, D.C., discuss the contrasting perspectives of the EU and United States regarding big data, competition, and antitrust law, and how regulators are attempting to level the playing fields between large tech companies, smaller firms, and new entrants into the open market.How do regulators in the U.S. view the competitive significance of big data in their antitrust investigations?Logan Breed: The question of how the antitrust laws should handle the issue of big data is somewhat uncertain in the United States. There have not been any cases brought by U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies based on the idea that a set of data is competitively significant enough to cause any competitive violation to occur or for a transaction to be competitive. However, it is a topic that is getting attention in antitrust circles. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently embarked on a series of hearings to assess the state of competition and consumer protection law in the 21st century, and it will hold two days of hearings in November on the topic of 'Privacy, Big Data, and Competition.' It will be an opportunity for both sides of the debate to air their views publicly, and for the FTC to either come to some conclusions and write a report or leave those comments out there. It's unclear exactly how this will end up. Moreover, the U.S. Attorney General and the head of the DOJ Antitrust Division recently met with multiple state Attorneys General reportedly to discuss potential actions against big tech companies. There are examples of merger cases where data was significant, and there has been at least one case that the FTC brought, in which the remedy involved a licensing of data. But that's not exactly what the concept of big data and its competitive significance really means when people talk about it in the abstract. One potential issue would be if an acquisition or merger between two companies that have big datasets will create a unified dataset that is an impossible barrier to entry for other companies to compete with. Again, we've never seen a case like that. I suppose in the abstract, it's possible. But most big datasets are not unique and are not uniquely competitively significant. As a practical matter, I think it would be very difficult for a U.S. antitrust agency to prove that a transaction violated Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, which prohibits mergers and acquisitions that may tend to substantially lessen competition in a relevant antitrust market, solely on the basis of the fact that the merging companies have a lot of data.So when companies with a lot of big data merge datasets, you don't anticipate it will become a legal issue in the United States in the near term?Breed: At a recent conference, two DOJ Antitrust Division front-office leaders talked about big tech companies that have large amounts of data and the protests by smaller companies against the bigger companies about their data. But the upshot of their comments was that they think it would be very difficult in the United States to bring that kind of a case. Nevertheless, the economic power of big tech companies is a hot topic at a political level in the U.S. on both the left and right of the political spectrum, and big data will likely continue to be one of the issues that the detractors of big tech use. So the takeaway for clients is, there's a lot of noise right now about whether antitrust laws are adequate to rein in big companies, including big tech companies, and whether big data is an existential competitive threat that's going to undermine competition going forward. I think the answers to those questions are first, the antitrust laws are sufficient to take into account the competitive significance of big tech companies and their datasets. And second, big data in the abstract is not an existential threat to competition.There is some general concern that companies with big data may impact competition, but is there a specific issue that's up for debate?Falk Sch\u00f6ning: The starting point, and the big picture question, is whether or not there actually is a problem that any company has control of big data. To be provocative, you could say, these companies may have vast amounts of data, but so what? There is some agreement in both the United States and the EU that there could be an antitrust problem with those companies that control big data, but it is unclear what the problem is and for whom? Is it a problem for the consumers; for competitors, including the smaller digital companies out there; or the old, offline economy which is disrupted by big data companies? Depending on your perspective, you will come to totally different answers.How this is being handled in Europe? Are attitudes similar or different to the United States?Sch\u00f6ning: Indeed, they are somewhat different. This makes the topic interesting, relevant, and also difficult to handle for clients. In Europe, all the fuss about big data and antitrust that Logan mentioned has somewhat resonated with the authorities and politicians. It's not just an academic debate. The European Commission, the German Federal Cartel Office, the French Competition Authority and others \u2014 they all are not only talking at conferences about this. They have set up teams internally and they have published papers where they laid the groundwork for future antitrust investigations. So while I think we still have yet to have the big data case, I'm quite sure the authorities would want to look at the cases where all these theories are dealt with \u2014 and you can see from some of the enforcement actions that they're trying to. The other aspect, which I also find interesting, is whether antitrust law is fit for its purpose here. Should it actually be revamped to be brought into the 21st century? In Europe, there is a debate as to whether antitrust is really the instrument you want to use, or whether you need regulation of big data companies similar to telecommunications regulation. Such a real data regulator would be set up very specifically to protect companies from the abuse of a strong position by having that much data. That's the debate that politicians raise, and for our clients, that's a debate to be followed and engaged in because this would eventually decide about leveling the playing field where they are active. Breed: I think clients should think about whether they want to engage with these FTC hearings that are coming up, too. There will be opportunities for public comment.For companies in Europe, are there forums similar to the upcoming FTC hearings that Logan mentioned, where companies can engage in the debate?Sch\u00f6ning: They are plenty of public consultations on specific aspects of this, so that's an opportunity to engage and respond. For the larger digital players, you can assume that they all have their offices in Brussels and in the EU Member States and they do talk to the regulators, sit on panels, and express their views. Smaller or more specialized companies tend to so less, but they could think about using trade associations to get their voice heard. That part of the work is more public affairs. I think what's more interesting from a legal perspective, for us and our clients, is the compliance aspect. In Europe antitrust authorities may pick up this potential theory of harm about having a lot of data. So when you have a lot of data, you need to be very careful about what you're doing with it because otherwise someone could allege you are abusing it. So that becomes a compliance question. And for clients, the challenge is to include this new world in their existing compliance programs, which is typically done by training salespeople, or having audits where you look at salespeople's e-mails. But in a world of big data, you actually have to talk to the IT and software engineers and understand what they are working on.So you suggest companies rethink their compliance programs and involve their software engineers?Sch\u00f6ning: Yes, and there's even a term for it developed by the authorities in Europe: the European Commissioner for Competition is asking companies to apply something she calls 'compliance by design,' which means you can't hide behind an algorithm if you infringe antitrust laws. So we say, for example, my engineer developed the software that monitors the prices of all my competitors online. Whenever they change their price, my algorithm automatically changes our price, too. That may be nice if prices go down, but if everyone applies a similar algorithm, and if these algorithms are probably even self-learning, the computer programs may conclude that they are all better off if they increase prices. And then the question is, who's responsible? The machine can't be responsible in legal terms, so is the guy who developed the software responsible? Or the procurement person who bought the software from a third-party vendor? If you consider the aforementioned European Commission's approach, the company that applies the software could be responsible. But the legal conclusion to come to that point is not that straightforward.What do you expect to happen next in the discussion about big data and antitrust law?Sch\u00f6ning: The next level is whether it's a problem that we should solve at all by means of competition law. Here are two adjectives that describe competition law: it's flexible and it's case specific, so it will only be applied, say, to the company that has big data but not to all companies that hold some form of data. The sandwich shop, which happens to have a website where you can order your food, will not be the focus of the antitrust authorities. In contrast, regulation applies to everyone meeting certain criteria. Whereas the regulation could say, if you operate a website, you need to do this \u2014 competition law would not prescribe specific conduct but rather enforce the law only afterwards if problems occur. For large global companies, that's not a problem, because they have enough resources to deal with this. But for the sandwich shop, it could be a problem. That is \u2014 of course generalizing \u2014 the difference between competition law, which is flexible, and regulation. On the other hand, regulation also has advantages: it gives you predictability of rules. Competition law is what the lawyer calls ex post \u2014 only after something has happened. It's applied only if a regulator thinks your behavior is problematic. As you may have seen, some large digital players have been fined already in Europe. Even for a large company, these have been very significant fines. And because there is no book that talks about how you run a search engine or a social network by the law, the antitrust enforcement is not predictable. As Logan said, in the United States, to date there is much less risk of a fine. But in Europe, this lack of predictability can cost companies a lot of money.What's your perspective as to why Europe and the U.S. have such different approaches to big data and antitrust enforcement?Sch\u00f6ning: I think some Europeans are more concerned with data in the hands of companies than in the hands of the State. This is very different from the understanding of freedom in the United States, which is more about ensuring that your data is not in the hands of the state. That's very different, and it triggers why the EU has things like GDPR, which basically regulates how private companies can deal with your data, but not what the state can do with it.

I just can't get  enough of him.  That's it for us.  Thanks for inviting us into your home  tonight.  That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT.  Fair, balanced, unafraid, \"THE  STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.  Welcome back, Martha.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Hello there, Bret, good to see  you.  Breaking tonight, are guess is that -- what we are watching today  could be the beginning of the end for Facebook, and that the wild west of  the social media technology is about to run into a buzz saw that was set in  motion by Congress, and that Congress has long turned a blind eye.  Today,  Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Durbin cut to the chase on the hot issue of  censoring political thought on Facebook.  And also, how much is too much  sharing?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  There are a great many Americans who I think are  deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a  pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.  There have been  numerous instances where Facebook, in May of 2016, Gizmodo reported that  Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from  trending news, including stories about SEA-PAC, including stories about  Mitt Romney, and including stories about the lowest learner IRS scandal,  including stories about Glenn Beck.  In addition to that, Facebook has  initially shut down the Chick-fil-a Appreciation Day page, has blocked the  posts of Fox News reporter, has blocked over two dozen catholic pages, and  most recently, blocked Trump supporters' diamond and silks page with 1.2  million Facebook followers after determining their content and brand were  \"unsafe to the community.\"  To a great many Americans, that appears to be a  pervasive pattern of political bias, do you agree with that statement?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  Senator, let me say a few things about  this.  First, I understand where that concern is coming from because  Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an  extreme a left-leaning place.  And this is actually a concern that I have  and I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we don't have any  bias in the work that we do and I think it is a fair concern that people  would wonder about it.  </p><p>CRUZ:  But let me ask this: are you aware of any ad or page that has been  taken down from planned parenthood?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I'm not, but let me just -- </p><p>CRUZ:  How about moveon.org?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Sorry?</p><p>CRUZ:  How about moveon.org.  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm not specifically aware.</p><p>CRUZ:  How about any Democratic candidate?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm not specifically aware.  I mean, I'm not sure.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Would you be comfortable sharing with  us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DURBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about -- your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in  modern America in the name of \"connecting people around the world.\"  The  question basically of what information Facebook is collecting, who they're  sending it to, and whether they've ever ask me in advance my permission to  do that?  Is that a fair thing for a user of Facebook to expect?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, senator.  I think everyone should have control over how  their information is used.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Wow, and it is still going on tonight.  Leading that hearing  today: Senate Judiciary Chairman, Charles Grassley, he will join us in just  a minute.  Also, doing the questioning, Member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and David Kirkpatrick, who  literally wrote the book on the Facebook effect, he has been studying this  for over a decade.  We begin tonight with the Senate Judiciary Chairman  Chuck Grassley.  Senator, good to have you here tonight.  Tell me, you  know, what really stood out to you today?  What was accomplished today, do  you think, in this hearing?  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN:  Well, I wouldn't  say this as accomplishment, what's been accomplished.  But I would say that  it's pretty clear that Facebook does not have any sort of record or a total  amount of information that's been transferred.  They don't seem to audit --  have an audit of what's going on or at least it hasn't been audited to this  point.  And they don't know how much of that information has been shared  with third parties, and then the third parties, what they have done with  it.  And it seems to me that this is pretty essential for not only  Facebook, but other platforms to get this under control in order to  establish or reduce the skepticism and cynicism people have about these  platforms in the privacy and for the protection of privacy.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  But, I mean, there's some discussion that Facebook knows that  some regulation is obviously coming for them.  And that it's probably long  overdue, that they're already trying to figure ways to work around it.  I  mean, you know, do you have -- does it -- are you concerned, I guess, that  their ability to continue to collect data will outpace the Congress'  ability to do anything about it?  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  There's some legislation in on this and I would never try to  tell you or anybody else that's passing a bill is going to solve all  problems you want to or give the proper protection of the people.  And so,  there's two things to go in different directions.  One is this organization  can do the things that they need to do to police it properly and make sure  people's privacy is protected, and of course, people are cynical about  whether any corporation would do that, but it's possible.  And the other  one would be whatever laws or regulations we can pass, but we know FTC is  operated in this area of regulation and agreement with them back in, I  think, 2011 or 2012 and they didn't even follow that.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  I mean, you know, that's a good question.  I mean, the FCC was  -- shouldn't they have been protecting America's privacy?  I mean, I think  that that's their motto.  What were they doing about this for the last ten  years?  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  Well, that's something we haven't had an oversight hearing on  yet and that may be born in the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee  under Thune than it is under me, but it's something I'm very interested in  because you make laws.  And one of the things we have in the legislative  branch of government is oversight, constitutional oversight to make sure  that the laws are carried out the way Congress intended them.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Yes.  All right.  Chairman Chuck Grassley, great to see you  tonight.  Thank you very much.  I know you have to get back in there.   Thanks for making time for us tonight.  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Joining me now, Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Senate  Judiciary Committee Member, who also got to question Mark Zuckerberg  tonight.  Good to have a with us, Senator Coons.  You know, I want to play  this sound bite for you on competition because this is another area that  Congress perhaps could have some impact on Facebook and social media.   Here's Lindsey Graham.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Is there an alternative to  Facebook in the private sectors?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, senator.  The average American uses eight different apps  to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people -- ranging  from texting apps to e-mails.  </p><p>LINDSEY:  Which is any service you provide?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, we provide a number of different services.  </p><p>LIDNSEY:  Is Twitter the same as what you do?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It overlaps to the portion of what we do. </p><p>LINDSEY:  You don't think you have a monopoly?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Interesting answer from Mark Zuckerberg.  Your take on that,  senator.  You know, what can really -- what can you take away from today  and what can be accomplished?  </p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Well, today  was I hope the first of several hearings where we can make sure that  average Americans understand the ways in which they're personally  identifying data is being collected and gathered, monetized, and used.   Because Americans should know how their data is being used and it should be  used with their knowledge and with their consent.  One of the ways in which  I think Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg is getting into some trouble here, is  practices which when caught or brought to light, Zuckerberg apologizes for,  promises that they will make their best efforts to address, but then  several years later, have not yet been resolved.  One of the things I  question today was a way to add targeting on Facebook makes it possible to  be racially exclusionary in how you put out ads about housing availability.   One of the other issues that I asked of Mr. Zuckerberg was you make your  money by targeting advertising.  Would you allow a diet co manufacturer to  use your data to target teens anxious about their weight?  Or to allow a  casino to target those with gambling problems?  I think these are questions  worth exploring.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Here's Ben Sasse and Mark Zuckerberg on a broader issue that  relates in some ways to that.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA:  Can you imagine a world where you might  decide that pro-lifers are prohibited from speaking about their abortion  views on concept, on your platform?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I certainly would not want that to be the case.  </p><p>SASSE:  But it might be really unsettling to people who've had an abortion  to have an open debate about that, wouldn't it?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It might be but I don't think that that would fit any of the  definitions of what we have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, senator, at one point, Mark Zuckerberg said they're going  to use A.I., artificial intelligence, to govern and scan for hate speech.   Does that concern you?  I mean, could that get into some pretty tricky  territory here?  </p><p>COONS:  Absolutely.  I think that's one of the reasons were going to need  to have a robust and debate about what kind of tools and what kind of  standards Facebook is going to apply.  I applaud the fact that Facebook has  been very active in identifying and taking down materials that are posted  on Facebook by Jihadists groups that are advocating terrorism or violence,  but one person's hate speech in the context that the Senator Sasse was just  talking about is another person's firmly held political or personal or  religious beliefs.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Absolutely.</p><p>COONS:  And we need to make sure first that we don't infringe on the free- speech rights, and second, that we don't so over regulate social media that  we restricted it or constrain it because it is exactly the free and open  environment we provide here in the United States that has led to such  innovations as the creation of most of big tech leaders in the world.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And Ted Cruz pointed out some pretty interesting examples of  some of the things that have been combed out of Facebook for just those  reasons.  And most of them, you know, had to do with conservative political  thoughts.  So, we'll see.  Senator, thank you very much, good to see you  tonight.  </p><p>COONS:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, when we come back, the man who literally wrote the book on  \"The Facebook Effect\", David Kirkpatrick takes us behind the scenes of the  social media empire and what he thinks really happened in there today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Let's start  with the user agreement.  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you  and I say this gently -- your user agreement sucks.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Breaking tonight as this continues to unfold on Capitol Hill,  Mark Zuckerberg saying that artificial intelligence is going to lead the  way to determine what you can and cannot see on Facebook.  So, imagine  wrapping your head around that technology when Congress is still trying to  wrap their arms around what's been going on for the past decade.  So, that  led to a few uncomfortable moments when it came to Facebook's functionality  and how exactly all this works.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT), PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE:  How do you sustain a  business model in which users don't pay for your service?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, we run ads.  </p><p>HATCH:  I see.  So, you don't have bundled permissions for how I can agree  to what devices I may use that you may have contact with?  Do you bundle  that permission?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many data categories do restore, does Facebook  store on the categories that you collect?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, can you clarify what you mean?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many does Facebook store out of that?  Do you  store any?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I'm not actually sure what that is referring to. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Those are some uncomfortable moments out there today.  Let's  bring in somebody who wrote a book on the subject.  Here now: David  Kirkpatrick, author of \"The Facebook Effect\".  David, good to have you with  us today.  You know, there are times -- and it's not surprising -- I mean,  if I were sitting there questioning him, I probably have a hard time with  some of the technology involved as well, but it looks like they were all  talking right past each other.  Do you think that?  </p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR OF THE FACEBOOK EFFECT:  I think some more than  others.  I mean, a lot of the technologies that play and tools and product  design are quite complicated, especially for interactions that were four  minutes each with each senator.  So, I think, frankly, our senate, in  general, like all of our legislator is generally not technologically  literate enough.  But I think this was a little bit more of a show trial  than anything.  And I don't really blame them for their questions.  I think  he did a pretty good job answering on balance.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  In terms that -- you have said that you think that Facebook  could signal the end of global democracy as we know it.  And that these  hearings are the beginning of a real sea change in the relationship between  the government and technology.  Explain.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I don't -- that's not exactly what I believe.  I  believe that there's a threat to democracy if these systems are not  properly over seen and overregulated.  I mean, that's been proven in many,  many countries where Facebook has been egregiously manipulated by people  who are using it illegally or dishonestly and Facebook has not properly  regulated that.  So, there is a threat.  Is democracy at risk right now?   No, I don't think so.  Although, in countries like for example, Myanmar,  where democracy is very shaky to begin with, Facebook has had a very, very  dangerous effect.  The main point is, this is a global company operating in  190 countries.  In every single one, politics happens on its service.  And  we're relying on this commercial company to effectively regulate the public  square including politics.  That's just wrong.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  In terms of how it changes.  You know, in terms of the  regulation and how -- what the impact is on social media, because once you  open this can of worms, and maybe it should've been opened a long time ago,  it's going to change these companies and the future of them.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I think that's healthy and one of the things I was  quite impressed by and even a little surprised by with Zuckerberg today,  and I do know him fairly well, is he was really showing tremendous openness  to regulation.  At one point, he said -- promised one senator -- he would  submit a list of regulations that he thought should apply to Facebook.  He  at one another point said, that he thought the European approach had some  merits and that's a big confession that you never hear from American tech  CEOs.  So, he was taking major steps in this direction.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  But he knows he's going to get regulation.  I mean, so, this  was his moment to try to craft that conversation a little bit.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  I agree.  I think that's fair.  My own opinion is, all of  those things -- your privacy regulation is definitely are going to come out  of this, that's a healthy thing.  But the real issue is bigger.  It's how  does society at a global level deal with a global company that has all this  power and is, up to now, being complete unregulated.  But even with the  privacy laws here and there, it's not going to really change the macro  relationship.  We need a system that gives them more consultancy, more  interaction.  Otherwise, I don't think Facebook is stable for society.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  David Kirkpatrick, good to see you tonight.  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Everybody is going to pay a  price.  He will, everybody will.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Tough talk from President Trump aimed at Bashar al-Assad and  Syria and his ally, Vladimir Putin.  Is the United States about to unleash  retribution as early as tonight?  Ed Henry, Marie Harf, and General Jack  Keane with analysis as the president warns strongmen in Syria and Russia.   Next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tolerate a war criminal, we can't tolerate  someone who could more than hurt many of his own people, and this matter  should end immediately.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, we could get an announcement really at any moment from the  president regarding U.S. military action in Syria in response to the  weekend's horrific suspected chemical attack.  The president cancelled his  trip to South America, so that he can remain at the White House as all of  this develops.  This is not sitting well with Russia tonight, now  threatening \"grave repercussions if the United States takes actions against  Syria's Bashar al-Assad\".  Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry joins me  now live from the White House as we wait.  Ed?</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Martha, good to  see you there.  Keeping their cards very close to the vest here.  Remember  dating back to the campaign, President Trump vowed that he was going to  change the practice of tipping off any kind of U.S. military action, any  kind of troop movements, but tonight they are sending strong signals that  he is inching towards military action.  Today, the president spoke by phone  with key ally, British Prime Minister Theresa May, sent strong hints of  action coming by the fact that White House officials said both leaders  condemned what they called the Syrian President Assad \"vicious disregard  for human life.  The president and prime minister agreed not to allow the  use of chemical weapons to continue.\"  </p><p>More tea leaves to read into that trip that you mentioned that was  cancelled.  Vice President Mike Pence is now being sent to Peru for the  summit of Americas this weekend because the president has canceled his  planned trip to Peru and Colombia.  Likewise, the Defense Secretary James  Mattis has now pulled out of a weekend trip to Nevada and California.  He  has public said the U.S. is not ruling out military action.  Pentagon  officials, meanwhile, are calling out the Russian military for jamming U.S.  drones flying near Syria.  The pentagon says they are using sufficient  countermeasures to protect our manned and unmanned aircraft as those drones  scout out possible U.S. strikes against the Assad regime.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  been clear, we're working with our partners and allies and national  security team to look at all options.  And as we've said, all options are  on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of anything the president may  or may not do in response to what's taking place in Syria.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT:  The response has to have a  military component against Bashar al-Assad.  We also have to send a message  to his enablers -- Syria is enabled by Iran and Russia.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY:  And tomorrow, the USS Harry Truman is headed to the Mediterranean  on a preschedule deployment, but that will now put at least seven warships  with hundreds of cruise missiles in the region.  Remember last year, the  U.S. Navy launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria after another  chemical weapons attack.  That shows that right now, there is even more  firepower in the region, Martha.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Ed, thank you very much.  So, we know of at least three  suspected chemical attacks in Syria this year alone and scores of others in  the past few years, prompting a lot of questions about the what the Obama  administration did and did not do to stop the Assad regime.  Remember, they  insisted that Syria did not have any more chemical weapons.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANALYST AND FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE  OBAMA  STATE DEPARTMENT:  The secretary release a statement on the remaining  removal of chemical weapons in Syria.  All of the declared chemical weapons  now are out of Syria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And that would've been good news, if this turns up to not be  the case.  Marie Harf joins me now, she's the former State Department  Spokesperson -- you saw her back then, and now, a Fox News Analyst.  So,  Marie, you know, when you watch what has happened over the last several  years, your thoughts on the assumption at that point that those chemical  weapons have been cleared out of Syria.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, looking that clip you just a played, there was one word that  was a very key there and it's the word \"declared.\"  The 1300 metric tons of  chemical weapons that Syrian government declared were removed.  And I would  note that's more chemical weapons that we went to war over in Iraq.  Those  are weapons that if hadn't got them out of the county, very likely would  have fallen into the hands of ISIS.  But, and I say this honestly and  openly, clearly the Assad regime either kept some weapons and they didn't  declare them or they kept the ability to produce more.  So, clearly, not  everything was out and now we're facing a situation where because of that  2013 agreement, we were able to get a huge portion of the weapons out, but  not all of them.  And President Trump has a very serious decision to make  in the next coming days.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Yes.  I mean, we all remember the red line and President Obama  clearly stating that if that red line was crossed, and he saw, as he put  it, I believe, a bunch of chemical weapons moving around, they would take  action.  But then, the action that you discussed at the podium there was  the substitute for actual military action.  The belief that those are  chemical weapons have been cleared out.  I mean, you know, obviously, we  always have to assume that someone like Assad is not necessarily going to  declare everything that has and that leaving them in power.  President  Obama said time and time again, he must go.  Hillary Clinton said, he must  go.  So, trusting his word that he got them all may have been a mistake.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, it wasn't trust.  I mean, we did destroy, again, 1300 tons of  chemical weapons is nothing -- is no small feat, particularly in the middle  of an ongoing war.  That is true.  But I think what we've seen from  military action -- and look, I supported President Trump last year when he  took that military action after the last attack.  That also didn't stop  President Assad from continuing to use the chemical weapons he had left.   So, there are no good answers here.  I wish there were.  These are all  tough choices.  We took the choice of getting out a huge amount of chemical  weapons, particularly because a number of Republicans in Congress would not  give President Obama the authority to strike militarily.  We asked them and  they said no.  Now, they're singing a different tune.  But again, it's  taking military action, stop the use of chemical weapons, this latest  attack wouldn't have happened.  So, President Trump had put down a lot of  rhetoric, which I think is appropriate.  </p><p>Now, it's a question of what would he do?  And military action, which I  think is appropriate, has to be match with an ongoing diplomatic, strategic  plan to address this and not pull out before we're ready in Syria because  the Russians, the Iranians will fill that vacuum and it will get even  worse, Martha.  </p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST:  Understood.  Marie, thank you very much.</p><p>HARF:  Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Here now, General Jack Keane, Fox News senior strategic analyst  and chairman of the institute for the study of war.  It has been said,  general, 24 to 48 hours we're likely to see some action.  The president  said he doesn't like to telegraph exactly when that will be.  What do you  think?  </p><p>JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Certainly, I think, that's  probably likely.  It's a question of moving the assets into place and  getting it all ready to go.  Look, what happened a year ago, we had a  measured proportionate response, took down the airfield and the equipment  on it that had delivered the strike.  The intent was to deter Assad, that  didn't work.  It failed, actually.  He used chemical weapons again.  So,  what we shouldn't do is another measured proportionate response, yet  larger, because that would deter.  This guy has made up his mind.  He's  going to use chemical weapons for military purposes with get desired effect  he wants.  What we have to do is stop the use of chemical weapons.  </p><p>And by that, I mean, we have to destroy all his capabilities that deliver  those weapons.  So, we're talking about rotary and fixed wing aircraft.   We're talking about airfield, aviation fuels those airfields, aviation  maintenance, aviation ammunitions.  If he still has artillery delivered  chemical weapons, which he used to have and some people think he does, our  intel guys probably know for sure.  Then we should take down his artillery  as well.  We have a complication.  The Russians have strategically placed  technicians at all of these airfields with the thought that that would  discourage the United States from conducting another attack on these  airfields.  They did it after the last attack a year ago.  If we have until  the Russians already, we should tell them something like this.  Every  single military base that Syria owns in Syria is vulnerable to a potential  attack.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, get out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEANE:  And we're not going to be responsible for what happens to your  people if you don't safeguard them.  So, yes, an attack is imminent.  The  other thing is, listen, Iran, Russia, and Syria, they're pariahs in  international community.  We have got to go after them in a very public  way, condemnation, sanctions, and drag them in to international criminal  court.  I mean, it will make no difference to Assad, and no difference to  Iranians, but it will make a difference to Putin.  His public image is very  important to him, particularly at home.  We've got to really go after these  guys in a public way.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  The president, last time he approved air strikes to punish  Syria, he received a lot of support from the American people on that.   Sixty seven percent approving that move, and we all remember the dramatic  video that followed of what happened in terms of the tomahawk missiles that  were sent in.  The feeling now, if I have it correctly, that this would be  a much larger -- much larger operation, do you agree?  And, of course, then  the question becomes what happens the next day and the week after that?  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, I think it should be.  Now, whether -- I'm sure  there are those, like the last time, there were many who wanted to take  down all the airfields the last time, a year ago, which I think was much  more appropriate and people pushed back on that.  So, I don't know what  decisions the president has made.  But, yes, it would be a larger scale  operation.  We would be using standoff cruise missiles and other bombs,  with -- from surface, sub-surface ships, also from airplanes.  If you want  to take airfields out, we're probably running on stealth bombers to do that  because cruise missiles aren't good taking out airfields.  Yes, a larger  mission to be sure.  I think what's coming out of the mouth of the Iranians  and the Russians is pure bluster.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Well, they're all saying that they have nothing to do with it.   Russia and Assad say these were not their chemical weapons.  We have the  video, and I know you say that we have very good tracking of the delivery  system for these and we know exactly where they're coming from.  You know,  your response to those who suggest that perhaps this isn't what it looks  like.  </p><p>KEANE:  That's rubbish and it's ignorance speaking.  We track every single  aircraft that takes off from any airfield in Syria.  We track where it  goes.  We track it when it's executing its bombing run.  We know what  airplane that is.  We have eyewitness accounts of that airplane dropping  bombs on a building where chemical weapons impacted the people.  Those are  verifiable things.  And then, we do data analysis of the horrible photos  we've seen, match up the symptoms of those people with people who have had  that in the past.  Our intelligence agencies on Monday verified that Assad  has used, from helicopter attack again, a nerve agent and also chlorine  gas.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  General Jack Keane, thank you, always good to see you.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  You too.  So still ahead tonight, how China is signaling that  it may waive the white flag, at least to some extent, when it comes to  these tariffs.  Fascinating, shifting of the plate in this issue.  What  does it really mean here?  Also, the president's longtime lawyer now  reportedly under investigation for the $130,000 payment -- $150,000 payment  to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch, but many are remembering  that that same oligarch received payment from the Clinton Foundation, and  that investigation seem to go nowhere.  Victor Pinchuk is this person's  name.  He gave tens of millions of dollars, in fact, to the Clinton  Foundation.  Marc Thiessen and Zac Petkanas weighs in, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  This is the most  biased group of people.  These people have the biggest conflicts of  interest I've ever seen.  They're not looking at the other side, they're  not looking at the Hillary Clinton horrible things that she did and all of  the crimes that were committed.  They're not looking at all of the things  that happened that everybody is very angry about.  I can tell you from the  Republican side, and I think even the independent side.  They only keep  looking at us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  President Trump lashing out at Special Counsel Robert Mueller,  saying that he is ignoring the Clinton scandals among other things.  And  now, Mueller's reported looking into a September of 2015, $150,000 donation  to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch.  But what's not being  reported by many is that very same oligarch, the largest individual  contributor to the Clinton Foundation.  Trace Gallagher live in our west  coast newsroom with the back story tonight.  Hi, Trace.  </p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Martha.  The man in question  is 57-year-old Ukrainian steel magnate, Victor Pinchuk, whose father-in-law  was the president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005.  Pinchuk's $150,000  donation to the now defunct Trump Foundation was in exchange for Donald  Trump speaking via video linked to a 2015 business conference in Kiev.  The  donation was uncovered when the Robert Mueller investigation subpoenaed the  Trump organization.  The legal experts are having trouble finding the  bombshell in this revelations because, one, the speaking fee appears to be  both legal and common.  And, two, it also runs counter to any Russian  collusion argument considering Victor Pinchuk is hostile to Vladimir Putin.   And yet, the time of the payment, Donald Trump was still considered a long  shot to win the GOP nomination, much less the presidency.  </p><p>Then, there's the fact that Pinchuk considers himself a friend of Bill and  Hillary Clinton, and has given the Clinton Foundation up to $25 million,  including $8.6 million while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.  The New  York Times also reports that Pinchuk allowed the Clintons used of his  private jet.  And the payment from Pinchuk to Trump was solicited by former  Clinton advisor and Fox News contributor, Doug Schoen, who you may recall  pulled his report from Hillary Clinton in 2016 saying her presidency would  be hobbled with scandals like the email scandal, which, speaking of double  standards, the American spectator draws this parallel to the FBI's raid on  Trump attorney Michael Cohen.  Quoting here, Hillary Clinton and her chief  minion, Cheryl Mills, claims attorney-client privilege when Mills herself  was under investigation for obstruction.  And then, classified emails  showed up on Hillary's assistance husbands, Anthony Weiner's computer, who  is in prison for pornographic interaction with a minor online.  Has the  Clinton Foundation, or Huma Abedin's home, or Hillary's bathroom been known  not rated yet?  No.  And as for the $150,000 payment from the Ukrainian  oligarch to Trump, Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz, calls it a fake  story.  Martha.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Thank you, Trace.  Here with more, Marc Thiessen, American  Enterprise's chief scholar and a Fox News contributor, and Zac Petkanas, a  former senior DNC advisor who worked on the Clinton campaign.  Gentlemen,  when you look at these two scenarios, what is very -- what is abundantly  clear is that these two situations have been treated completely  differently.  That Hillary Clinton was treated with kid gloves, and the  investigation into Donald Trump is, you know, a door breaking down  environment, Marc, and then Zac.  </p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I mean, look, I will say  at the outset that I don't think either the Trump Foundation or the Clinton  Foundation should be taking money from oligarchs or from foreign  businessmen because it creates a conflict of interest adherently, so I  don't think they should be taking this money.  But you have to put this  into perspective.  Donald Trump took $150,000 for a speech to the Yalta  security conference, which is a conference that this oligarch put on.  The  Clinton Foundation took up to $25 million from the same oligarch.  He flew  Bill and Hillary Clinton around the world on his private jet.  He invited  Bill Clinton to a French ski resort for his 50th birthday.  And, by the  way, he paid Bill and Hillary Clinton to speak at the exact same conference  as Donald Trump.  So, how can it be a conflict for Donald Trump to have  taken this money to speak at this conference when Bill and Hillary were  paid to speak at the exact same conference?  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Why, Zac -- why are these two investigations treated so very  differently?  </p><p>ZAC PETKANAS, FORMER SENIOR DNC ADVISOR:  So, first off, I think you guys  got to pick your story here.  I mean, the original story from the White  House was they fired FBI Director James Comey because the FBI was too hard  on Hillary Clinton.  Now, you guys are saying that Hillary Clinton was  treated with kid gloves.  You guys can't have it both ways.  You've got to  pick one.  She was either roasted over the coals, which is why FBI Director  James Comey was fired, or she was -- that is the official reason from the  White House about why FBI Director James Comey was fired.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  No, it was an overall mishandling.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: . outline by Rod Rosenstein of a mishandling of the  investigation. </p><p>PETKANAS:  It's not just mishandling, it was the fact -- for example, the  new I.G. report that's going to come out that shows that they were very,  very hard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS:  I'm very much looking forward to it.  Because, for example, it  shows.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS:  It shows that the FBI was very, very hard on Hillary Clinton.   That's the only thing that's been leaked out in the I.G. report.  And so, I  don't understand this.  But in term of this particular, you know, case,  there're key differences between these donations.  The ones to the Trump  Foundation, for example, was secret.  The ones in the Clinton Foundation  was completely transparent.  There was a press release sent out -- it was  listed on the website.  The actual dollar amount was earmarked to go to  Ukraine to fight HIV/AIDS that was there.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  You know I hear what you're saying.  And as Marc points out,  perhaps neither one of these entities should have taken any money at all.   $25 million for the Clinton Foundation, $150,000 for Trump, maybe neither  one should -- but the point with where we're living right now.</p><p>THIESSEN:  Exactly.</p><p>MACCALLUM: . in this month, Marc, is that this shows that there is a  straying from this investigation into areas that just makes you wonder what  is Robert Mueller interested in in that transaction, do you think?  </p><p>THIESSEN:  I don't know, but we'll find out eventually.  I mean, look, this  is what happens when investigation started.  They start following trails  and they see where they lead, and there maybe nothing to this or there  maybe something.  But let's keep in mind also that there is an active FBI  investigation into the Clinton Foundation right now.  It's not getting a  lot of press attention.  But it was restarted last year by the FBI because  the Clinton justice department turned down request by the FBI in 2016 to  accelerate the investigation.  And only after the election where they're  allowed to do it.  So, there is a very serious investigation into  corruption and pay-to-play by the Clinton Foundation.  </p><p>And keep in mind that this oligarch when he was giving money to the Clinton  Foundation, it was while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.  He had,  according to the New York Times, he had more than a dozen meetings with  senior Clinton state department officials, and we know -- thanks to  Citizens United who released her emails that they were reporting back to  her on their meetings with him in those emails.  He had dinner with her at  her home and she lied about it.  She said she never saw him once when she  was secretary of state, but then the emails came out that shows that he was  on the guest list for a dinner at her home.  And this is also while this  guy was selling -- doing trade with Iran at the time when the United States  was under sanction, and he was in trouble with the commerce department for  steel dumping in the United States.  So, there is a lot more serious things  going on here with the Clinton Foundation than there's anything with a  $150,000.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And as you points out, the investigation has been reopened.   Zac, final thoughts goes to you.  </p><p>PETKANAS:  I mean, look, I think that people need to get a new hobby.  You  guys beat Hillary Clinton, you know.  I mean, it's time to move on, go for  a walk, go get a massage, you know, do whatever you've got to do to fill  the void in your souls.  But I understand why you're focused on Hillary  Clinton because you cannot defend Donald Trump.  But seriously, guys, it's  getting a little sad.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, Zac, do you think it's fair for the attorney's door to be  knocked down at four places where he lives?  Do you think that's a fair  carrying out of this investigation?  </p><p>PETKANAS:  I mean, he's being accused of some fairly serious criminal  activity, and so, yes, I believe that criminals should have their doors  knocked down if there is evidence that they're going to destroy evidence,  which is what the case here.  So, yes, I mean, these guys are criminals.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Case closed.  Case closed.  All right, Zac, thank you very  much.  Good to see you, Marc.  Good to have you both.  All right, coming up  next, is Chinese President Xi responding to President Trump's actions on  trade in a significant way that we haven't seen in a long time?  And how  the so-called trade war could hit some of the president's biggest  supporters, perhaps, the hardest.  A longtime soybean farmer gives us his  take on how he feels about all of this.  It's fascinating and it is next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Chinese President Xi announcing a pretty big move.  He says he  will significantly cut his country's automobile import tariff, which is  something President Trump has been wanting very much.  The news comes just  hours after President Trump ramped up the rhetoric in the trade fight  tweeting this, quote, when a car is sent to the United States from China,  the tariff to be paid of 2.5 percent.  When a car is sent from China -- to  China from the United States the tariff is 25 percent.  Does that sound  like free or fair trade?  No, he writes, it sounds like stupid trade and  it's been going on for years.  Late this afternoon, President Trump  tweeting that he's happy with the progress that is being made so far with  China.  So, who stands to lose the most in the trade war between the United  States and China?  Some say it is American farmers, specifically, soybean  farmers who reside largely in parts of the country that voted for President  Trump in 2016.  That is an intentional move on the put of the Chinese.   What many Americans don't know is how much their livelihood depends of  these soybean farmers who produce most of the feed used to raise chicken,  pork, beef, fish, and other foods that we eat every day.  Here now, David  Rodibaugh, for a longtime soybean farmer who served as director of the  Indiana Soybean Alliance.  It is good to have you with us tonight, David,  thank you very much.  So, as this stands now, what is the impact on you and  farmers like you?  </p><p>DAVID RODIBAUGH, DIRECTOR INDIANA SOYBEAN ALLIANCE:  Martha, I might say,  first of all, I do live in northwestern Indiana, and we farm with our -- my  three brothers and our families, we appreciate the chance to be with you  this evening.  Trade is really a big deal for us as farmers.  We have the  ability to raise abundant crops and good infrastructure to get these crops  to market, and our organizations have worked very diligently to get the  needs assessed of our customers around the world.  And so, we can produce  and be a reliable supplier.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Sure.  What's the impact of these tariffs on you?  Tell us how  would you be hurt by them do you believe?  </p><p>RODIBAUGH:  There is a potential that we would lose a great deal of our  market.  We do export a third of our beans to China, and so it's an  extremely big deal for us.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Understood.  Let me ask you one more question, does it change  how you feel about President Trump?  </p><p>RODIBAUGH:  I think we're taking a wait and see attitude on that.  We have  a great amount of confidence in our secretary of agriculture, Sonny Purdue,  and there's -- trade is a difficult thing.  There are many hurdles across.   We have a lot of confidence in our government officials who are charged  with doing that.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  All right.  David, we've got to go, but thank you so much and  we appreciate you being here tonight.  We hope you'll come back as this  moves along and tell us what you're thinking down the road.  Thank you,  sir.  All the best to you.</p><p>RODIBAUGH:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Quick break and we'll be right back with more of The Story.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  That is our story for tonight.  We are headed down to D.C.   We'll be there for day two of the Zuckerberg hearing.  Stick around, we'll  see you tomorrow night from D.C.  Tucker Carlson, coming up next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I just can't get  enough of him.  That's it for us.  Thanks for inviting us into your home  tonight.  That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT.  Fair, balanced, unafraid, \"THE  STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.  Welcome back, Martha.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Hello there, Bret, good to see  you.  Breaking tonight, are guess is that -- what we are watching today  could be the beginning of the end for Facebook, and that the wild west of  the social media technology is about to run into a buzz saw that was set in  motion by Congress, and that Congress has long turned a blind eye.  Today,  Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Durbin cut to the chase on the hot issue of  censoring political thought on Facebook.  And also, how much is too much  sharing?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  There are a great many Americans who I think are  deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a  pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.  There have been  numerous instances where Facebook, in May of 2016, Gizmodo reported that  Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from  trending news, including stories about SEA-PAC, including stories about  Mitt Romney, and including stories about the lowest learner IRS scandal,  including stories about Glenn Beck.  In addition to that, Facebook has  initially shut down the Chick-fil-a Appreciation Day page, has blocked the  posts of Fox News reporter, has blocked over two dozen catholic pages, and  most recently, blocked Trump supporters' diamond and silks page with 1.2  million Facebook followers after determining their content and brand were  \"unsafe to the community.\"  To a great many Americans, that appears to be a  pervasive pattern of political bias, do you agree with that statement?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  Senator, let me say a few things about  this.  First, I understand where that concern is coming from because  Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an  extreme a left-leaning place.  And this is actually a concern that I have  and I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we don't have any  bias in the work that we do and I think it is a fair concern that people  would wonder about it.  </p><p>CRUZ:  But let me ask this: are you aware of any ad or page that has been  taken down from planned parenthood?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I'm not, but let me just -- </p><p>CRUZ:  How about moveon.org?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Sorry?</p><p>CRUZ:  How about moveon.org.  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm not specifically aware.</p><p>CRUZ:  How about any Democratic candidate?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm not specifically aware.  I mean, I'm not sure.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Would you be comfortable sharing with  us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DURBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about -- your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in  modern America in the name of \"connecting people around the world.\"  The  question basically of what information Facebook is collecting, who they're  sending it to, and whether they've ever ask me in advance my permission to  do that?  Is that a fair thing for a user of Facebook to expect?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, senator.  I think everyone should have control over how  their information is used.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Wow, and it is still going on tonight.  Leading that hearing  today: Senate Judiciary Chairman, Charles Grassley, he will join us in just  a minute.  Also, doing the questioning, Member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and David Kirkpatrick, who  literally wrote the book on the Facebook effect, he has been studying this  for over a decade.  We begin tonight with the Senate Judiciary Chairman  Chuck Grassley.  Senator, good to have you here tonight.  Tell me, you  know, what really stood out to you today?  What was accomplished today, do  you think, in this hearing?  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN:  Well, I wouldn't  say this as accomplishment, what's been accomplished.  But I would say that  it's pretty clear that Facebook does not have any sort of record or a total  amount of information that's been transferred.  They don't seem to audit --  have an audit of what's going on or at least it hasn't been audited to this  point.  And they don't know how much of that information has been shared  with third parties, and then the third parties, what they have done with  it.  And it seems to me that this is pretty essential for not only  Facebook, but other platforms to get this under control in order to  establish or reduce the skepticism and cynicism people have about these  platforms in the privacy and for the protection of privacy.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  But, I mean, there's some discussion that Facebook knows that  some regulation is obviously coming for them.  And that it's probably long  overdue, that they're already trying to figure ways to work around it.  I  mean, you know, do you have -- does it -- are you concerned, I guess, that  their ability to continue to collect data will outpace the Congress'  ability to do anything about it?  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  There's some legislation in on this and I would never try to  tell you or anybody else that's passing a bill is going to solve all  problems you want to or give the proper protection of the people.  And so,  there's two things to go in different directions.  One is this organization  can do the things that they need to do to police it properly and make sure  people's privacy is protected, and of course, people are cynical about  whether any corporation would do that, but it's possible.  And the other  one would be whatever laws or regulations we can pass, but we know FTC is  operated in this area of regulation and agreement with them back in, I  think, 2011 or 2012 and they didn't even follow that.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  I mean, you know, that's a good question.  I mean, the FCC was  -- shouldn't they have been protecting America's privacy?  I mean, I think  that that's their motto.  What were they doing about this for the last ten  years?  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  Well, that's something we haven't had an oversight hearing on  yet and that may be born in the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee  under Thune than it is under me, but it's something I'm very interested in  because you make laws.  And one of the things we have in the legislative  branch of government is oversight, constitutional oversight to make sure  that the laws are carried out the way Congress intended them.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Yes.  All right.  Chairman Chuck Grassley, great to see you  tonight.  Thank you very much.  I know you have to get back in there.   Thanks for making time for us tonight.  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Joining me now, Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Senate  Judiciary Committee Member, who also got to question Mark Zuckerberg  tonight.  Good to have a with us, Senator Coons.  You know, I want to play  this sound bite for you on competition because this is another area that  Congress perhaps could have some impact on Facebook and social media.   Here's Lindsey Graham.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Is there an alternative to  Facebook in the private sectors?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, senator.  The average American uses eight different apps  to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people -- ranging  from texting apps to e-mails.  </p><p>LINDSEY:  Which is any service you provide?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, we provide a number of different services.  </p><p>LIDNSEY:  Is Twitter the same as what you do?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It overlaps to the portion of what we do. </p><p>LINDSEY:  You don't think you have a monopoly?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Interesting answer from Mark Zuckerberg.  Your take on that,  senator.  You know, what can really -- what can you take away from today  and what can be accomplished?  </p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Well, today  was I hope the first of several hearings where we can make sure that  average Americans understand the ways in which they're personally  identifying data is being collected and gathered, monetized, and used.   Because Americans should know how their data is being used and it should be  used with their knowledge and with their consent.  One of the ways in which  I think Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg is getting into some trouble here, is  practices which when caught or brought to light, Zuckerberg apologizes for,  promises that they will make their best efforts to address, but then  several years later, have not yet been resolved.  One of the things I  question today was a way to add targeting on Facebook makes it possible to  be racially exclusionary in how you put out ads about housing availability.   One of the other issues that I asked of Mr. Zuckerberg was you make your  money by targeting advertising.  Would you allow a diet co manufacturer to  use your data to target teens anxious about their weight?  Or to allow a  casino to target those with gambling problems?  I think these are questions  worth exploring.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Here's Ben Sasse and Mark Zuckerberg on a broader issue that  relates in some ways to that.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA:  Can you imagine a world where you might  decide that pro-lifers are prohibited from speaking about their abortion  views on concept, on your platform?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I certainly would not want that to be the case.  </p><p>SASSE:  But it might be really unsettling to people who've had an abortion  to have an open debate about that, wouldn't it?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It might be but I don't think that that would fit any of the  definitions of what we have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, senator, at one point, Mark Zuckerberg said they're going  to use A.I., artificial intelligence, to govern and scan for hate speech.   Does that concern you?  I mean, could that get into some pretty tricky  territory here?  </p><p>COONS:  Absolutely.  I think that's one of the reasons were going to need  to have a robust and debate about what kind of tools and what kind of  standards Facebook is going to apply.  I applaud the fact that Facebook has  been very active in identifying and taking down materials that are posted  on Facebook by Jihadists groups that are advocating terrorism or violence,  but one person's hate speech in the context that the Senator Sasse was just  talking about is another person's firmly held political or personal or  religious beliefs.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Absolutely.</p><p>COONS:  And we need to make sure first that we don't infringe on the free- speech rights, and second, that we don't so over regulate social media that  we restricted it or constrain it because it is exactly the free and open  environment we provide here in the United States that has led to such  innovations as the creation of most of big tech leaders in the world.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And Ted Cruz pointed out some pretty interesting examples of  some of the things that have been combed out of Facebook for just those  reasons.  And most of them, you know, had to do with conservative political  thoughts.  So, we'll see.  Senator, thank you very much, good to see you  tonight.  </p><p>COONS:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, when we come back, the man who literally wrote the book on  \"The Facebook Effect\", David Kirkpatrick takes us behind the scenes of the  social media empire and what he thinks really happened in there today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Let's start  with the user agreement.  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you  and I say this gently -- your user agreement sucks.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Breaking tonight as this continues to unfold on Capitol Hill,  Mark Zuckerberg saying that artificial intelligence is going to lead the  way to determine what you can and cannot see on Facebook.  So, imagine  wrapping your head around that technology when Congress is still trying to  wrap their arms around what's been going on for the past decade.  So, that  led to a few uncomfortable moments when it came to Facebook's functionality  and how exactly all this works.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT), PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE:  How do you sustain a  business model in which users don't pay for your service?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, we run ads.  </p><p>HATCH:  I see.  So, you don't have bundled permissions for how I can agree  to what devices I may use that you may have contact with?  Do you bundle  that permission?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many data categories do restore, does Facebook  store on the categories that you collect?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, can you clarify what you mean?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many does Facebook store out of that?  Do you  store any?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I'm not actually sure what that is referring to. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Those are some uncomfortable moments out there today.  Let's  bring in somebody who wrote a book on the subject.  Here now: David  Kirkpatrick, author of \"The Facebook Effect\".  David, good to have you with  us today.  You know, there are times -- and it's not surprising -- I mean,  if I were sitting there questioning him, I probably have a hard time with  some of the technology involved as well, but it looks like they were all  talking right past each other.  Do you think that?  </p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR OF THE FACEBOOK EFFECT:  I think some more than  others.  I mean, a lot of the technologies that play and tools and product  design are quite complicated, especially for interactions that were four  minutes each with each senator.  So, I think, frankly, our senate, in  general, like all of our legislator is generally not technologically  literate enough.  But I think this was a little bit more of a show trial  than anything.  And I don't really blame them for their questions.  I think  he did a pretty good job answering on balance.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  In terms that -- you have said that you think that Facebook  could signal the end of global democracy as we know it.  And that these  hearings are the beginning of a real sea change in the relationship between  the government and technology.  Explain.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I don't -- that's not exactly what I believe.  I  believe that there's a threat to democracy if these systems are not  properly over seen and overregulated.  I mean, that's been proven in many,  many countries where Facebook has been egregiously manipulated by people  who are using it illegally or dishonestly and Facebook has not properly  regulated that.  So, there is a threat.  Is democracy at risk right now?   No, I don't think so.  Although, in countries like for example, Myanmar,  where democracy is very shaky to begin with, Facebook has had a very, very  dangerous effect.  The main point is, this is a global company operating in  190 countries.  In every single one, politics happens on its service.  And  we're relying on this commercial company to effectively regulate the public  square including politics.  That's just wrong.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  In terms of how it changes.  You know, in terms of the  regulation and how -- what the impact is on social media, because once you  open this can of worms, and maybe it should've been opened a long time ago,  it's going to change these companies and the future of them.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I think that's healthy and one of the things I was  quite impressed by and even a little surprised by with Zuckerberg today,  and I do know him fairly well, is he was really showing tremendous openness  to regulation.  At one point, he said -- promised one senator -- he would  submit a list of regulations that he thought should apply to Facebook.  He  at one another point said, that he thought the European approach had some  merits and that's a big confession that you never hear from American tech  CEOs.  So, he was taking major steps in this direction.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  But he knows he's going to get regulation.  I mean, so, this  was his moment to try to craft that conversation a little bit.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  I agree.  I think that's fair.  My own opinion is, all of  those things -- your privacy regulation is definitely are going to come out  of this, that's a healthy thing.  But the real issue is bigger.  It's how  does society at a global level deal with a global company that has all this  power and is, up to now, being complete unregulated.  But even with the  privacy laws here and there, it's not going to really change the macro  relationship.  We need a system that gives them more consultancy, more  interaction.  Otherwise, I don't think Facebook is stable for society.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  David Kirkpatrick, good to see you tonight.  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Everybody is going to pay a  price.  He will, everybody will.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Tough talk from President Trump aimed at Bashar al-Assad and  Syria and his ally, Vladimir Putin.  Is the United States about to unleash  retribution as early as tonight?  Ed Henry, Marie Harf, and General Jack  Keane with analysis as the president warns strongmen in Syria and Russia.   Next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tolerate a war criminal, we can't tolerate  someone who could more than hurt many of his own people, and this matter  should end immediately.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, we could get an announcement really at any moment from the  president regarding U.S. military action in Syria in response to the  weekend's horrific suspected chemical attack.  The president cancelled his  trip to South America, so that he can remain at the White House as all of  this develops.  This is not sitting well with Russia tonight, now  threatening \"grave repercussions if the United States takes actions against  Syria's Bashar al-Assad\".  Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry joins me  now live from the White House as we wait.  Ed?</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Martha, good to  see you there.  Keeping their cards very close to the vest here.  Remember  dating back to the campaign, President Trump vowed that he was going to  change the practice of tipping off any kind of U.S. military action, any  kind of troop movements, but tonight they are sending strong signals that  he is inching towards military action.  Today, the president spoke by phone  with key ally, British Prime Minister Theresa May, sent strong hints of  action coming by the fact that White House officials said both leaders  condemned what they called the Syrian President Assad \"vicious disregard  for human life.  The president and prime minister agreed not to allow the  use of chemical weapons to continue.\"  </p><p>More tea leaves to read into that trip that you mentioned that was  cancelled.  Vice President Mike Pence is now being sent to Peru for the  summit of Americas this weekend because the president has canceled his  planned trip to Peru and Colombia.  Likewise, the Defense Secretary James  Mattis has now pulled out of a weekend trip to Nevada and California.  He  has public said the U.S. is not ruling out military action.  Pentagon  officials, meanwhile, are calling out the Russian military for jamming U.S.  drones flying near Syria.  The pentagon says they are using sufficient  countermeasures to protect our manned and unmanned aircraft as those drones  scout out possible U.S. strikes against the Assad regime.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  been clear, we're working with our partners and allies and national  security team to look at all options.  And as we've said, all options are  on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of anything the president may  or may not do in response to what's taking place in Syria.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT:  The response has to have a  military component against Bashar al-Assad.  We also have to send a message  to his enablers -- Syria is enabled by Iran and Russia.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY:  And tomorrow, the USS Harry Truman is headed to the Mediterranean  on a preschedule deployment, but that will now put at least seven warships  with hundreds of cruise missiles in the region.  Remember last year, the  U.S. Navy launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria after another  chemical weapons attack.  That shows that right now, there is even more  firepower in the region, Martha.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Ed, thank you very much.  So, we know of at least three  suspected chemical attacks in Syria this year alone and scores of others in  the past few years, prompting a lot of questions about the what the Obama  administration did and did not do to stop the Assad regime.  Remember, they  insisted that Syria did not have any more chemical weapons.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANALYST AND FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE OBAMA  STATE DEPARTMENT:  The secretary release a statement on the remaining  removal of chemical weapons in Syria.  All of the declared chemical weapons  now are out of Syria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And that would've been good news, if this turns up to not be  the case.  Marie Harf joins me now, she's the former State Department  Spokesperson -- you saw her back then, and now, a Fox News Analyst.  So,  Marie, you know, when you watch what has happened over the last several  years, your thoughts on the assumption at that point that those chemical  weapons have been cleared out of Syria.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, looking that clip you just a played, there was one word that  was a very key there and it's the word \"declared.\"  The 1300 metric tons of  chemical weapons that Syrian government declared were removed.  And I would  note that's more chemical weapons that we went to war over in Iraq.  Those  are weapons that if hadn't got them out of the county, very likely would  have fallen into the hands of ISIS.  But, and I say this honestly and  openly, clearly the Assad regime either kept some weapons and they didn't  declare them or they kept the ability to produce more.  So, clearly, not  everything was out and now we're facing a situation where because of that  2013 agreement, we were able to get a huge portion of the weapons out, but  not all of them.  And President Trump has a very serious decision to make  in the next coming days.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Yes.  I mean, we all remember the red line and President Obama  clearly stating that if that red line was crossed, and he saw, as he put  it, I believe, a bunch of chemical weapons moving around, they would take  action.  But then, the action that you discussed at the podium there was  the substitute for actual military action.  The belief that those are  chemical weapons have been cleared out.  I mean, you know, obviously, we  always have to assume that someone like Assad is not necessarily going to  declare everything that has and that leaving them in power.  President  Obama said time and time again, he must go.  Hillary Clinton said, he must  go.  So, trusting his word that he got them all may have been a mistake.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, it wasn't trust.  I mean, we did destroy, again, 1300 tons of  chemical weapons is nothing -- is no small feat, particularly in the middle  of an ongoing war.  That is true.  But I think what we've seen from  military action -- and look, I supported President Trump last year when he  took that military action after the last attack.  That also didn't stop  President Assad from continuing to use the chemical weapons he had left.   So, there are no good answers here.  I wish there were.  These are all  tough choices.  We took the choice of getting out a huge amount of chemical  weapons, particularly because a number of Republicans in Congress would not  give President Obama the authority to strike militarily.  We asked them and  they said no.  Now, they're singing a different tune.  But again, it's  taking military action, stop the use of chemical weapons, this latest  attack wouldn't have happened.  So, President Trump had put down a lot of  rhetoric, which I think is appropriate.  </p><p>Now, it's a question of what would he do?  And military action, which I  think is appropriate, has to be match with an ongoing diplomatic, strategic  plan to address this and not pull out before we're ready in Syria because  the Russians, the Iranians will fill that vacuum and it will get even  worse, Martha.  </p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST:  Understood.  Marie, thank you very much.</p><p>HARF:  Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Here now, General Jack Keane, Fox News senior strategic analyst  and chairman of the institute for the study of war.  It has been said,  general, 24 to 48 hours we're likely to see some action.  The president  said he doesn't like to telegraph exactly when that will be.  What do you  think?  </p><p>JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Certainly, I think, that's  probably likely.  It's a question of moving the assets into place and  getting it all ready to go.  Look, what happened a year ago, we had a  measured proportionate response, took down the airfield and the equipment  on it that had delivered the strike.  The intent was to deter Assad, that  didn't work.  It failed, actually.  He used chemical weapons again.  So,  what we shouldn't do is another measured proportionate response, yet  larger, because that would deter.  This guy has made up his mind.  He's  going to use chemical weapons for military purposes with get desired effect  he wants.  What we have to do is stop the use of chemical weapons.  </p><p>And by that, I mean, we have to destroy all his capabilities that deliver  those weapons.  So, we're talking about rotary and fixed wing aircraft.   We're talking about airfield, aviation fuels those airfields, aviation  maintenance, aviation ammunitions.  If he still has artillery delivered  chemical weapons, which he used to have and some people think he does, our  intel guys probably know for sure.  Then we should take down his artillery  as well.  We have a complication.  The Russians have strategically placed  technicians at all of these airfields with the thought that that would  discourage the United States from conducting another attack on these  airfields.  They did it after the last attack a year ago.  If we have until  the Russians already, we should tell them something like this.  Every  single military base that Syria owns in Syria is vulnerable to a potential  attack.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, get out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEANE:  And we're not going to be responsible for what happens to your  people if you don't safeguard them.  So, yes, an attack is imminent.  The  other thing is, listen, Iran, Russia, and Syria, they're pariahs in  international community.  We have got to go after them in a very public  way, condemnation, sanctions, and drag them in to international criminal  court.  I mean, it will make no difference to Assad, and no difference to  Iranians, but it will make a difference to Putin.  His public image is very  important to him, particularly at home.  We've got to really go after these  guys in a public way.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  The president, last time he approved air strikes to punish  Syria, he received a lot of support from the American people on that.   Sixty seven percent approving that move, and we all remember the dramatic  video that followed of what happened in terms of the tomahawk missiles that  were sent in.  The feeling now, if I have it correctly, that this would be  a much larger -- much larger operation, do you agree?  And, of course, then  the question becomes what happens the next day and the week after that?  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, I think it should be.  Now, whether -- I'm sure  there are those, like the last time, there were many who wanted to take  down all the airfields the last time, a year ago, which I think was much  more appropriate and people pushed back on that.  So, I don't know what  decisions the president has made.  But, yes, it would be a larger scale  operation.  We would be using standoff cruise missiles and other bombs,  with -- from surface, sub-surface ships, also from airplanes.  If you want  to take airfields out, we're probably running on stealth bombers to do that  because cruise missiles aren't good taking out airfields.  Yes, a larger  mission to be sure.  I think what's coming out of the mouth of the Iranians  and the Russians is pure bluster.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Well, they're all saying that they have nothing to do with it.   Russia and Assad say these were not their chemical weapons.  We have the  video, and I know you say that we have very good tracking of the delivery  system for these and we know exactly where they're coming from.  You know,  your response to those who suggest that perhaps this isn't what it looks  like.  </p><p>KEANE:  That's rubbish and it's ignorance speaking.  We track every single  aircraft that takes off from any airfield in Syria.  We track where it  goes.  We track it when it's executing its bombing run.  We know what  airplane that is.  We have eyewitness accounts of that airplane dropping  bombs on a building where chemical weapons impacted the people.  Those are  verifiable things.  And then, we do data analysis of the horrible photos  we've seen, match up the symptoms of those people with people who have had  that in the past.  Our intelligence agencies on Monday verified that Assad  has used, from helicopter attack again, a nerve agent and also chlorine  gas.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  General Jack Keane, thank you, always good to see you.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  You too.  So still ahead tonight, how China is signaling that  it may waive the white flag, at least to some extent, when it comes to  these tariffs.  Fascinating, shifting of the plate in this issue.  What  does it really mean here?  Also, the president's longtime lawyer now  reportedly under investigation for the $130,000 payment -- $150,000 payment  to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch, but many are remembering  that that same oligarch received payment from the Clinton Foundation, and  that investigation seem to go nowhere.  Victor Pinchuk is this person's  name.  He gave tens of millions of dollars, in fact, to the Clinton  Foundation.  Marc Thiessen and Zac Petkanas weighs in, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  This is the most  biased group of people.  These people have the biggest conflicts of  interest I've ever seen.  They're not looking at the other side, they're  not looking at the Hillary Clinton horrible things that she did and all of  the crimes that were committed.  They're not looking at all of the things  that happened that everybody is very angry about.  I can tell you from the  Republican side, and I think even the independent side.  They only keep  looking at us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  President Trump lashing out at Special Counsel Robert Mueller,  saying that he is ignoring the Clinton scandals among other things.  And  now, Mueller's reported looking into a September of 2015, $150,000 donation  to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch.  But what's not being  reported by many is that very same oligarch, the largest individual  contributor to the Clinton Foundation.  Trace Gallagher live in our west  coast newsroom with the back story tonight.  Hi, Trace.  </p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Martha.  The man in question  is 57-year-old Ukrainian steel magnate, Victor Pinchuk, whose father-in-law  was the president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005.  Pinchuk's $150,000  donation to the now defunct Trump Foundation was in exchange for Donald  Trump speaking via video linked to a 2015 business conference in Kiev.  The  donation was uncovered when the Robert Mueller investigation subpoenaed the  Trump organization.  The legal experts are having trouble finding the  bombshell in this revelations because, one, the speaking fee appears to be  both legal and common.  And, two, it also runs counter to any Russian  collusion argument considering Victor Pinchuk is hostile to Vladimir Putin.   And yet, the time of the payment, Donald Trump was still considered a long  shot to win the GOP nomination, much less the presidency.  </p><p>Then, there's the fact that Pinchuk considers himself a friend of Bill and  Hillary Clinton, and has given the Clinton Foundation up to $25 million,  including $8.6 million while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.  The New  York Times also reports that Pinchuk allowed the Clintons used of his  private jet.  And the payment from Pinchuk to Trump was solicited by former  Clinton advisor and Fox News contributor, Doug Schoen, who you may recall  pulled his report from Hillary Clinton in 2016 saying her presidency would  be hobbled with scandals like the email scandal, which, speaking of double  standards, the American spectator draws this parallel to the FBI's raid on  Trump attorney Michael Cohen.  Quoting here, Hillary Clinton and her chief  minion, Cheryl Mills, claims attorney-client privilege when Mills herself  was under investigation for obstruction.  And then, classified emails  showed up on Hillary's assistance husbands, Anthony Weiner's computer, who  is in prison for pornographic interaction with a minor online.  Has the  Clinton Foundation, or Huma Abedin's home, or Hillary's bathroom been known  not rated yet?  No.  And as for the $150,000 payment from the Ukrainian  oligarch to Trump, Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz, calls it a fake  story.  Martha.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Thank you, Trace.  Here with more, Marc Thiessen, American  Enterprise's chief scholar and a Fox News contributor, and Zac Petkanas, a  former senior DNC advisor who worked on the Clinton campaign.  Gentlemen,  when you look at these two scenarios, what is very -- what is abundantly  clear is that these two situations have been treated completely  differently.  That Hillary Clinton was treated with kid gloves, and the  investigation into Donald Trump is, you know, a door breaking down  environment, Marc, and then Zac.  </p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I mean, look, I will say  at the outset that I don't think either the Trump Foundation or the Clinton  Foundation should be taking money from oligarchs or from foreign  businessmen because it creates a conflict of interest adherently, so I  don't think they should be taking this money.  But you have to put this  into perspective.  Donald Trump took $150,000 for a speech to the Yalta  security conference, which is a conference that this oligarch put on.  The  Clinton Foundation took up to $25 million from the same oligarch.  He flew  Bill and Hillary Clinton around the world on his private jet.  He invited  Bill Clinton to a French ski resort for his 50th birthday.  And, by the  way, he paid Bill and Hillary Clinton to speak at the exact same conference  as Donald Trump.  So, how can it be a conflict for Donald Trump to have  taken this money to speak at this conference when Bill and Hillary were  paid to speak at the exact same conference?  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Why, Zac -- why are these two investigations treated so very  differently?  </p><p>ZAC PETKANAS, FORMER SENIOR DNC ADVISOR:  So, first off, I think you guys  got to pick your story here.  I mean, the original story from the White  House was they fired FBI Director James Comey because the FBI was too hard  on Hillary Clinton.  Now, you guys are saying that Hillary Clinton was  treated with kid gloves.  You guys can't have it both ways.  You've got to  pick one.  She was either roasted over the coals, which is why FBI Director  James Comey was fired, or she was -- that is the official reason from the  White House about why FBI Director James Comey was fired.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  No, it was an overall mishandling.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: . outline by Rod Rosenstein of a mishandling of the  investigation. </p><p>PETKANAS:  It's not just mishandling, it was the fact -- for example, the  new I.G. report that's going to come out that shows that they were very,  very hard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS:  I'm very much looking forward to it.  Because, for example, it  shows.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS:  It shows that the FBI was very, very hard on Hillary Clinton.   That's the only thing that's been leaked out in the I.G. report.  And so, I  don't understand this.  But in term of this particular, you know, case,  there're key differences between these donations.  The ones to the Trump  Foundation, for example, was secret.  The ones in the Clinton Foundation  was completely transparent.  There was a press release sent out -- it was  listed on the website.  The actual dollar amount was earmarked to go to  Ukraine to fight HIV/AIDS that was there.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  You know I hear what you're saying.  And as Marc points out,  perhaps neither one of these entities should have taken any money at all.   $25 million for the Clinton Foundation, $150,000 for Trump, maybe neither  one should -- but the point with where we're living right now.</p><p>THIESSEN:  Exactly.</p><p>MACCALLUM: . in this month, Marc, is that this shows that there is a  straying from this investigation into areas that just makes you wonder what  is Robert Mueller interested in in that transaction, do you think?  </p><p>THIESSEN:  I don't know, but we'll find out eventually.  I mean, look, this  is what happens when investigation started.  They start following trails  and they see where they lead, and there maybe nothing to this or there  maybe something.  But let's keep in mind also that there is an active FBI  investigation into the Clinton Foundation right now.  It's not getting a  lot of press attention.  But it was restarted last year by the FBI because  the Clinton justice department turned down request by the FBI in 2016 to  accelerate the investigation.  And only after the election where they're  allowed to do it.  So, there is a very serious investigation into  corruption and pay-to-play by the Clinton Foundation.  </p><p>And keep in mind that this oligarch when he was giving money to the Clinton  Foundation, it was while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.  He had,  according to the New York Times, he had more than a dozen meetings with  senior Clinton state department officials, and we know -- thanks to  Citizens United who released her emails that they were reporting back to  her on their meetings with him in those emails.  He had dinner with her at  her home and she lied about it.  She said she never saw him once when she  was secretary of state, but then the emails came out that shows that he was  on the guest list for a dinner at her home.  And this is also while this  guy was selling -- doing trade with Iran at the time when the United States  was under sanction, and he was in trouble with the commerce department for  steel dumping in the United States.  So, there is a lot more serious things  going on here with the Clinton Foundation than there's anything with a  $150,000.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And as you points out, the investigation has been reopened.   Zac, final thoughts goes to you.  </p><p>PETKANAS:  I mean, look, I think that people need to get a new hobby.  You  guys beat Hillary Clinton, you know.  I mean, it's time to move on, go for  a walk, go get a massage, you know, do whatever you've got to do to fill  the void in your souls.  But I understand why you're focused on Hillary  Clinton because you cannot defend Donald Trump.  But seriously, guys, it's  getting a little sad.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, Zac, do you think it's fair for the attorney's door to be  knocked down at four places where he lives?  Do you think that's a fair  carrying out of this investigation?  </p><p>PETKANAS:  I mean, he's being accused of some fairly serious criminal  activity, and so, yes, I believe that criminals should have their doors  knocked down if there is evidence that they're going to destroy evidence,  which is what the case here.  So, yes, I mean, these guys are criminals.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Case closed.  Case closed.  All right, Zac, thank you very  much.  Good to see you, Marc.  Good to have you both.  All right, coming up  next, is Chinese President Xi responding to President Trump's actions on  trade in a significant way that we haven't seen in a long time?  And how  the so-called trade war could hit some of the president's biggest  supporters, perhaps, the hardest.  A longtime soybean farmer gives us his  take on how he feels about all of this.  It's fascinating and it is next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Chinese President Xi announcing a pretty big move.  He says he  will significantly cut his country's automobile import tariff, which is  something President Trump has been wanting very much.  The news comes just  hours after President Trump ramped up the rhetoric in the trade fight  tweeting this, quote, when a car is sent to the United States from China,  the tariff to be paid of 2.5 percent.  When a car is sent from China -- to  China from the United States the tariff is 25 percent.  Does that sound  like free or fair trade?  No, he writes, it sounds like stupid trade and  it's been going on for years.  Late this afternoon, President Trump  tweeting that he's happy with the progress that is being made so far with  China.  So, who stands to lose the most in the trade war between the United  States and China?  Some say it is American farmers, specifically, soybean  farmers who reside largely in parts of the country that voted for President  Trump in 2016.  That is an intentional move on the put of the Chinese.   What many Americans don't know is how much their livelihood depends of  these soybean farmers who produce most of the feed used to raise chicken,  pork, beef, fish, and other foods that we eat every day.  Here now, David  Rodibaugh, for a longtime soybean farmer who served as director of the  Indiana Soybean Alliance.  It is good to have you with us tonight, David,  thank you very much.  So, as this stands now, what is the impact on you and  farmers like you?  </p><p>DAVID RODIBAUGH, DIRECTOR INDIANA SOYBEAN ALLIANCE:  Martha, I might say,  first of all, I do live in northwestern Indiana, and we farm with our -- my  three brothers and our families, we appreciate the chance to be with you  this evening.  Trade is really a big deal for us as farmers.  We have the  ability to raise abundant crops and good infrastructure to get these crops  to market, and our organizations have worked very diligently to get the  needs assessed of our customers around the world.  And so, we can produce  and be a reliable supplier.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Sure.  What's the impact of these tariffs on you?  Tell us how  would you be hurt by them do you believe?  </p><p>RODIBAUGH:  There is a potential that we would lose a great deal of our  market.  We do export a third of our beans to China, and so it's an  extremely big deal for us.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Understood.  Let me ask you one more question, does it change  how you feel about President Trump?  </p><p>RODIBAUGH:  I think we're taking a wait and see attitude on that.  We have  a great amount of confidence in our secretary of agriculture, Sonny Purdue,  and there's -- trade is a difficult thing.  There are many hurdles across.   We have a lot of confidence in our government officials who are charged  with doing that.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  All right.  David, we've got to go, but thank you so much and  we appreciate you being here tonight.  We hope you'll come back as this  moves along and tell us what you're thinking down the road.  Thank you,  sir.  All the best to you.</p><p>RODIBAUGH:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Quick break and we'll be right back with more of The Story.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  That is our story for tonight.  We are headed down to D.C.   We'll be there for day two of the Zuckerberg hearing.  Stick around, we'll  see you tomorrow night from D.C.  Tucker Carlson, coming up next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I just can't get enough of him. That's it for us. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced, unafraid, \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now. Welcome back, Martha.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hello there, Bret, good to see you. Breaking tonight, are guess is that -- what we are watching today could be the beginning of the end for Facebook, and that the wild west of the social media technology is about to run into a buzz saw that was set in motion by Congress, and that Congress has long turned a blind eye. Today, Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Durbin cut to the chase on the hot issue of censoring political thought on Facebook. And also, how much is too much sharing?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship. There have been numerous instances where Facebook, in May of 2016, Gizmodo reported that Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from trending news, including stories about SEA-PAC, including stories about Mitt Romney, and including stories about the lowest learner IRS scandal, including stories about Glenn Beck. In addition to that, Facebook has initially shut down the Chick-fil-a Appreciation Day page, has blocked the posts of Fox News reporter, has blocked over two dozen catholic pages, and most recently, blocked Trump supporters' diamond and silks page with 1.2 million Facebook followers after determining their content and brand were \"unsafe to the community.\" To a great many Americans, that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias, do you agree with that statement?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: Senator, let me say a few things about this. First, I understand where that concern is coming from because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extreme a left-leaning place. And this is actually a concern that I have and I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do and I think it is a fair concern that people would wonder about it.</p><p>CRUZ: But let me ask this: are you aware of any ad or page that has been taken down from planned parenthood?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not, but let me just --</p><p>CRUZ: How about moveon.org?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Sorry?</p><p>CRUZ: How about moveon.org.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I'm not specifically aware.</p><p>CRUZ: How about any Democratic candidate?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I'm not specifically aware. I mean, I'm not sure.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DURBIN: If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly here.</p><p>DURBIN: I think that might be what this is all about -- your right to privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern America in the name of \"connecting people around the world.\" The question basically of what information Facebook is collecting, who they're sending it to, and whether they've ever ask me in advance my permission to do that? Is that a fair thing for a user of Facebook to expect?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes, senator. I think everyone should have control over how their information is used.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Wow, and it is still going on tonight. Leading that hearing today: Senate Judiciary Chairman, Charles Grassley, he will join us in just a minute. Also, doing the questioning, Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and David Kirkpatrick, who literally wrote the book on the Facebook effect, he has been studying this for over a decade. We begin tonight with the Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley. Senator, good to have you here tonight. Tell me, you know, what really stood out to you today? What was accomplished today, do you think, in this hearing?</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN: Well, I wouldn't say this as accomplishment, what's been accomplished. But I would say that it's pretty clear that Facebook does not have any sort of record or a total amount of information that's been transferred. They don't seem to audit -- have an audit of what's going on or at least it hasn't been audited to this point. And they don't know how much of that information has been shared with third parties, and then the third parties, what they have done with it. And it seems to me that this is pretty essential for not only Facebook, but other platforms to get this under control in order to establish or reduce the skepticism and cynicism people have about these platforms in the privacy and for the protection of privacy.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But, I mean, there's some discussion that Facebook knows that some regulation is obviously coming for them. And that it's probably long overdue, that they're already trying to figure ways to work around it. I mean, you know, do you have -- does it -- are you concerned, I guess, that their ability to continue to collect data will outpace the Congress' ability to do anything about it?</p><p>GRASSLEY: There's some legislation in on this and I would never try to tell you or anybody else that's passing a bill is going to solve all problems you want to or give the proper protection of the people. And so, there's two things to go in different directions. One is this organization can do the things that they need to do to police it properly and make sure people's privacy is protected, and of course, people are cynical about whether any corporation would do that, but it's possible. And the other one would be whatever laws or regulations we can pass, but we know FTC is operated in this area of regulation and agreement with them back in, I think, 2011 or 2012 and they didn't even follow that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I mean, you know, that's a good question. I mean, the FCC was -- shouldn't they have been protecting America's privacy? I mean, I think that that's their motto. What were they doing about this for the last ten years?</p><p>GRASSLEY: Well, that's something we haven't had an oversight hearing on yet and that may be born in the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee under Thune than it is under me, but it's something I'm very interested in because you make laws. And one of the things we have in the legislative branch of government is oversight, constitutional oversight to make sure that the laws are carried out the way Congress intended them.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. All right. Chairman Chuck Grassley, great to see you tonight. Thank you very much. I know you have to get back in there. Thanks for making time for us tonight.</p><p>GRASSLEY: Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Joining me now, Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Senate Judiciary Committee Member, who also got to question Mark Zuckerberg tonight. Good to have a with us, Senator Coons. You know, I want to play this sound bite for you on competition because this is another area that Congress perhaps could have some impact on Facebook and social media. Here's Lindsey Graham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Is there an alternative to Facebook in the private sectors?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes, senator. The average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people -- ranging from texting apps to e-mails.</p><p>LINDSEY: Which is any service you provide?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well, we provide a number of different services.</p><p>LIDNSEY: Is Twitter the same as what you do?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: It overlaps to the portion of what we do.</p><p>LINDSEY: You don't think you have a monopoly?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Interesting answer from Mark Zuckerberg. Your take on that, senator. You know, what can really -- what can you take away from today and what can be accomplished?</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER: Well, today was I hope the first of several hearings where we can make sure that average Americans understand the ways in which they're personally identifying data is being collected and gathered, monetized, and used. Because Americans should know how their data is being used and it should be used with their knowledge and with their consent. One of the ways in which I think Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg is getting into some trouble here, is practices which when caught or brought to light, Zuckerberg apologizes for, promises that they will make their best efforts to address, but then several years later, have not yet been resolved. One of the things I question today was a way to add targeting on Facebook makes it possible to be racially exclusionary in how you put out ads about housing availability. One of the other issues that I asked of Mr. Zuckerberg was you make your money by targeting advertising. Would you allow a diet co manufacturer to use your data to target teens anxious about their weight? Or to allow a casino to target those with gambling problems? I think these are questions worth exploring.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Here's Ben Sasse and Mark Zuckerberg on a broader issue that relates in some ways to that. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA: Can you imagine a world where you might decide that pro-lifers are prohibited from speaking about their abortion views on concept, on your platform?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I certainly would not want that to be the case.</p><p>SASSE: But it might be really unsettling to people who've had an abortion to have an open debate about that, wouldn't it?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: It might be but I don't think that that would fit any of the definitions of what we have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, senator, at one point, Mark Zuckerberg said they're going to use A.I., artificial intelligence, to govern and scan for hate speech. Does that concern you? I mean, could that get into some pretty tricky territory here?</p><p>COONS: Absolutely. I think that's one of the reasons were going to need to have a robust and debate about what kind of tools and what kind of standards Facebook is going to apply. I applaud the fact that Facebook has been very active in identifying and taking down materials that are posted on Facebook by Jihadists groups that are advocating terrorism or violence, but one person's hate speech in the context that the Senator Sasse was just talking about is another person's firmly held political or personal or religious beliefs.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Absolutely.</p><p>COONS: And we need to make sure first that we don't infringe on the free- speech rights, and second, that we don't so over regulate social media that we restricted it or constrain it because it is exactly the free and open environment we provide here in the United States that has led to such innovations as the creation of most of big tech leaders in the world.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And Ted Cruz pointed out some pretty interesting examples of some of the things that have been combed out of Facebook for just those reasons. And most of them, you know, had to do with conservative political thoughts. So, we'll see. Senator, thank you very much, good to see you tonight.</p><p>COONS: Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, when we come back, the man who literally wrote the book on \"The Facebook Effect\", David Kirkpatrick takes us behind the scenes of the social media empire and what he thinks really happened in there today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER: Let's start with the user agreement. Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you and I say this gently -- your user agreement sucks.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight as this continues to unfold on Capitol Hill, Mark Zuckerberg saying that artificial intelligence is going to lead the way to determine what you can and cannot see on Facebook. So, imagine wrapping your head around that technology when Congress is still trying to wrap their arms around what's been going on for the past decade. So, that led to a few uncomfortable moments when it came to Facebook's functionality and how exactly all this works. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT), PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE: How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we run ads.</p><p>HATCH: I see. So, you don't have bundled permissions for how I can agree to what devices I may use that you may have contact with? Do you bundle that permission?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How many data categories do restore, does Facebook store on the categories that you collect?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, can you clarify what you mean?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How many does Facebook store out of that? Do you store any?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not actually sure what that is referring to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Those are some uncomfortable moments out there today. Let's bring in somebody who wrote a book on the subject. Here now: David Kirkpatrick, author of \"The Facebook Effect\". David, good to have you with us today. You know, there are times -- and it's not surprising -- I mean, if I were sitting there questioning him, I probably have a hard time with some of the technology involved as well, but it looks like they were all talking right past each other. Do you think that?</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR OF THE FACEBOOK EFFECT: I think some more than others. I mean, a lot of the technologies that play and tools and product design are quite complicated, especially for interactions that were four minutes each with each senator. So, I think, frankly, our senate, in general, like all of our legislator is generally not technologically literate enough. But I think this was a little bit more of a show trial than anything. And I don't really blame them for their questions. I think he did a pretty good job answering on balance.</p><p>MACCALLUM: In terms that -- you have said that you think that Facebook could signal the end of global democracy as we know it. And that these hearings are the beginning of a real sea change in the relationship between the government and technology. Explain.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, I don't -- that's not exactly what I believe. I believe that there's a threat to democracy if these systems are not properly over seen and overregulated. I mean, that's been proven in many, many countries where Facebook has been egregiously manipulated by people who are using it illegally or dishonestly and Facebook has not properly regulated that. So, there is a threat. Is democracy at risk right now? No, I don't think so. Although, in countries like for example, Myanmar, where democracy is very shaky to begin with, Facebook has had a very, very dangerous effect. The main point is, this is a global company operating in 190 countries. In every single one, politics happens on its service. And we're relying on this commercial company to effectively regulate the public square including politics. That's just wrong.</p><p>MACCALLUM: In terms of how it changes. You know, in terms of the regulation and how -- what the impact is on social media, because once you open this can of worms, and maybe it should've been opened a long time ago, it's going to change these companies and the future of them.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, I think that's healthy and one of the things I was quite impressed by and even a little surprised by with Zuckerberg today, and I do know him fairly well, is he was really showing tremendous openness to regulation. At one point, he said -- promised one senator -- he would submit a list of regulations that he thought should apply to Facebook. He at one another point said, that he thought the European approach had some merits and that's a big confession that you never hear from American tech CEOs. So, he was taking major steps in this direction.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But he knows he's going to get regulation. I mean, so, this was his moment to try to craft that conversation a little bit.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I agree. I think that's fair. My own opinion is, all of those things -- your privacy regulation is definitely are going to come out of this, that's a healthy thing. But the real issue is bigger. It's how does society at a global level deal with a global company that has all this power and is, up to now, being complete unregulated. But even with the privacy laws here and there, it's not going to really change the macro relationship. We need a system that gives them more consultancy, more interaction. Otherwise, I don't think Facebook is stable for society.</p><p>MACCALLUM: David Kirkpatrick, good to see you tonight. Thank you, sir.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everybody is going to pay a price. He will, everybody will.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Tough talk from President Trump aimed at Bashar al-Assad and Syria and his ally, Vladimir Putin. Is the United States about to unleash retribution as early as tonight? Ed Henry, Marie Harf, and General Jack Keane with analysis as the president warns strongmen in Syria and Russia. Next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can't tolerate a war criminal, we can't tolerate someone who could more than hurt many of his own people, and this matter should end immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, we could get an announcement really at any moment from the president regarding U.S. military action in Syria in response to the weekend's horrific suspected chemical attack. The president cancelled his trip to South America, so that he can remain at the White House as all of this develops. This is not sitting well with Russia tonight, now threatening \"grave repercussions if the United States takes actions against Syria's Bashar al-Assad\". Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry joins me now live from the White House as we wait. Ed?</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Martha, good to see you there. Keeping their cards very close to the vest here. Remember dating back to the campaign, President Trump vowed that he was going to change the practice of tipping off any kind of U.S. military action, any kind of troop movements, but tonight they are sending strong signals that he is inching towards military action. Today, the president spoke by phone with key ally, British Prime Minister Theresa May, sent strong hints of action coming by the fact that White House officials said both leaders condemned what they called the Syrian President Assad \"vicious disregard for human life. The president and prime minister agreed not to allow the use of chemical weapons to continue.\"</p><p>More tea leaves to read into that trip that you mentioned that was cancelled. Vice President Mike Pence is now being sent to Peru for the summit of Americas this weekend because the president has canceled his planned trip to Peru and Colombia. Likewise, the Defense Secretary James Mattis has now pulled out of a weekend trip to Nevada and California. He has public said the U.S. is not ruling out military action. Pentagon officials, meanwhile, are calling out the Russian military for jamming U.S. drones flying near Syria. The pentagon says they are using sufficient countermeasures to protect our manned and unmanned aircraft as those drones scout out possible U.S. strikes against the Assad regime. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president has been clear, we're working with our partners and allies and national security team to look at all options. And as we've said, all options are on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of anything the president may or may not do in response to what's taking place in Syria.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT: The response has to have a military component against Bashar al-Assad. We also have to send a message to his enablers -- Syria is enabled by Iran and Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: And tomorrow, the USS Harry Truman is headed to the Mediterranean on a preschedule deployment, but that will now put at least seven warships with hundreds of cruise missiles in the region. Remember last year, the U.S. Navy launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria after another chemical weapons attack. That shows that right now, there is even more firepower in the region, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Ed, thank you very much. So, we know of at least three suspected chemical attacks in Syria this year alone and scores of others in the past few years, prompting a lot of questions about the what the Obama administration did and did not do to stop the Assad regime. Remember, they insisted that Syria did not have any more chemical weapons. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANALYST AND FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE OBAMA STATE DEPARTMENT: The secretary release a statement on the remaining removal of chemical weapons in Syria. All of the declared chemical weapons now are out of Syria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: And that would've been good news, if this turns up to not be the case. Marie Harf joins me now, she's the former State Department Spokesperson -- you saw her back then, and now, a Fox News Analyst. So, Marie, you know, when you watch what has happened over the last several years, your thoughts on the assumption at that point that those chemical weapons have been cleared out of Syria.</p><p>HARF: Well, looking that clip you just a played, there was one word that was a very key there and it's the word \"declared.\" The 1300 metric tons of chemical weapons that Syrian government declared were removed. And I would note that's more chemical weapons that we went to war over in Iraq. Those are weapons that if hadn't got them out of the county, very likely would have fallen into the hands of ISIS. But, and I say this honestly and openly, clearly the Assad regime either kept some weapons and they didn't declare them or they kept the ability to produce more. So, clearly, not everything was out and now we're facing a situation where because of that 2013 agreement, we were able to get a huge portion of the weapons out, but not all of them. And President Trump has a very serious decision to make in the next coming days.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, we all remember the red line and President Obama clearly stating that if that red line was crossed, and he saw, as he put it, I believe, a bunch of chemical weapons moving around, they would take action. But then, the action that you discussed at the podium there was the substitute for actual military action. The belief that those are chemical weapons have been cleared out. I mean, you know, obviously, we always have to assume that someone like Assad is not necessarily going to declare everything that has and that leaving them in power. President Obama said time and time again, he must go. Hillary Clinton said, he must go. So, trusting his word that he got them all may have been a mistake.</p><p>HARF: Well, it wasn't trust. I mean, we did destroy, again, 1300 tons of chemical weapons is nothing -- is no small feat, particularly in the middle of an ongoing war. That is true. But I think what we've seen from military action -- and look, I supported President Trump last year when he took that military action after the last attack. That also didn't stop President Assad from continuing to use the chemical weapons he had left. So, there are no good answers here. I wish there were. These are all tough choices. We took the choice of getting out a huge amount of chemical weapons, particularly because a number of Republicans in Congress would not give President Obama the authority to strike militarily. We asked them and they said no. Now, they're singing a different tune. But again, it's taking military action, stop the use of chemical weapons, this latest attack wouldn't have happened. So, President Trump had put down a lot of rhetoric, which I think is appropriate.</p><p>Now, it's a question of what would he do? And military action, which I think is appropriate, has to be match with an ongoing diplomatic, strategic plan to address this and not pull out before we're ready in Syria because the Russians, the Iranians will fill that vacuum and it will get even worse, Martha.</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST: Understood. Marie, thank you very much.</p><p>HARF: Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Here now, General Jack Keane, Fox News senior strategic analyst and chairman of the institute for the study of war. It has been said, general, 24 to 48 hours we're likely to see some action. The president said he doesn't like to telegraph exactly when that will be. What do you think?</p><p>JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Certainly, I think, that's probably likely. It's a question of moving the assets into place and getting it all ready to go. Look, what happened a year ago, we had a measured proportionate response, took down the airfield and the equipment on it that had delivered the strike. The intent was to deter Assad, that didn't work. It failed, actually. He used chemical weapons again. So, what we shouldn't do is another measured proportionate response, yet larger, because that would deter. This guy has made up his mind. He's going to use chemical weapons for military purposes with get desired effect he wants. What we have to do is stop the use of chemical weapons.</p><p>And by that, I mean, we have to destroy all his capabilities that deliver those weapons. So, we're talking about rotary and fixed wing aircraft. We're talking about airfield, aviation fuels those airfields, aviation maintenance, aviation ammunitions. If he still has artillery delivered chemical weapons, which he used to have and some people think he does, our intel guys probably know for sure. Then we should take down his artillery as well. We have a complication. The Russians have strategically placed technicians at all of these airfields with the thought that that would discourage the United States from conducting another attack on these airfields. They did it after the last attack a year ago. If we have until the Russians already, we should tell them something like this. Every single military base that Syria owns in Syria is vulnerable to a potential attack.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, get out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEANE: And we're not going to be responsible for what happens to your people if you don't safeguard them. So, yes, an attack is imminent. The other thing is, listen, Iran, Russia, and Syria, they're pariahs in international community. We have got to go after them in a very public way, condemnation, sanctions, and drag them in to international criminal court. I mean, it will make no difference to Assad, and no difference to Iranians, but it will make a difference to Putin. His public image is very important to him, particularly at home. We've got to really go after these guys in a public way.</p><p>MACCALLUM: The president, last time he approved air strikes to punish Syria, he received a lot of support from the American people on that. Sixty seven percent approving that move, and we all remember the dramatic video that followed of what happened in terms of the tomahawk missiles that were sent in. The feeling now, if I have it correctly, that this would be a much larger -- much larger operation, do you agree? And, of course, then the question becomes what happens the next day and the week after that?</p><p>KEANE: Well, first of all, I think it should be. Now, whether -- I'm sure there are those, like the last time, there were many who wanted to take down all the airfields the last time, a year ago, which I think was much more appropriate and people pushed back on that. So, I don't know what decisions the president has made. But, yes, it would be a larger scale operation. We would be using standoff cruise missiles and other bombs, with -- from surface, sub-surface ships, also from airplanes. If you want to take airfields out, we're probably running on stealth bombers to do that because cruise missiles aren't good taking out airfields. Yes, a larger mission to be sure. I think what's coming out of the mouth of the Iranians and the Russians is pure bluster.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, they're all saying that they have nothing to do with it. Russia and Assad say these were not their chemical weapons. We have the video, and I know you say that we have very good tracking of the delivery system for these and we know exactly where they're coming from. You know, your response to those who suggest that perhaps this isn't what it looks like.</p><p>KEANE: That's rubbish and it's ignorance speaking. We track every single aircraft that takes off from any airfield in Syria. We track where it goes. We track it when it's executing its bombing run. We know what airplane that is. We have eyewitness accounts of that airplane dropping bombs on a building where chemical weapons impacted the people. Those are verifiable things. And then, we do data analysis of the horrible photos we've seen, match up the symptoms of those people with people who have had that in the past. Our intelligence agencies on Monday verified that Assad has used, from helicopter attack again, a nerve agent and also chlorine gas.</p><p>MACCALLUM: General Jack Keane, thank you, always good to see you.</p><p>KEANE: Good talking to you.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You too. So still ahead tonight, how China is signaling that it may waive the white flag, at least to some extent, when it comes to these tariffs. Fascinating, shifting of the plate in this issue. What does it really mean here? Also, the president's longtime lawyer now reportedly under investigation for the $130,000 payment -- $150,000 payment to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch, but many are remembering that that same oligarch received payment from the Clinton Foundation, and that investigation seem to go nowhere. Victor Pinchuk is this person's name. He gave tens of millions of dollars, in fact, to the Clinton Foundation. Marc Thiessen and Zac Petkanas weighs in, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: This is the most biased group of people. These people have the biggest conflicts of interest I've ever seen. They're not looking at the other side, they're not looking at the Hillary Clinton horrible things that she did and all of the crimes that were committed. They're not looking at all of the things that happened that everybody is very angry about. I can tell you from the Republican side, and I think even the independent side. They only keep looking at us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: President Trump lashing out at Special Counsel Robert Mueller, saying that he is ignoring the Clinton scandals among other things. And now, Mueller's reported looking into a September of 2015, $150,000 donation to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch. But what's not being reported by many is that very same oligarch, the largest individual contributor to the Clinton Foundation. Trace Gallagher live in our west coast newsroom with the back story tonight. Hi, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. The man in question is 57-year-old Ukrainian steel magnate, Victor Pinchuk, whose father-in-law was the president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005. Pinchuk's $150,000 donation to the now defunct Trump Foundation was in exchange for Donald Trump speaking via video linked to a 2015 business conference in Kiev. The donation was uncovered when the Robert Mueller investigation subpoenaed the Trump organization. The legal experts are having trouble finding the bombshell in this revelations because, one, the speaking fee appears to be both legal and common. And, two, it also runs counter to any Russian collusion argument considering Victor Pinchuk is hostile to Vladimir Putin. And yet, the time of the payment, Donald Trump was still considered a long shot to win the GOP nomination, much less the presidency.</p><p>Then, there's the fact that Pinchuk considers himself a friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, and has given the Clinton Foundation up to $25 million, including $8.6 million while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. The New York Times also reports that Pinchuk allowed the Clintons used of his private jet. And the payment from Pinchuk to Trump was solicited by former Clinton advisor and Fox News contributor, Doug Schoen, who you may recall pulled his report from Hillary Clinton in 2016 saying her presidency would be hobbled with scandals like the email scandal, which, speaking of double standards, the American spectator draws this parallel to the FBI's raid on Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Quoting here, Hillary Clinton and her chief minion, Cheryl Mills, claims attorney-client privilege when Mills herself was under investigation for obstruction. And then, classified emails showed up on Hillary's assistance husbands, Anthony Weiner's computer, who is in prison for pornographic interaction with a minor online. Has the Clinton Foundation, or Huma Abedin's home, or Hillary's bathroom been known not rated yet? No. And as for the $150,000 payment from the Ukrainian oligarch to Trump, Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz, calls it a fake story. Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Thank you, Trace. Here with more, Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise's chief scholar and a Fox News contributor, and Zac Petkanas, a former senior DNC advisor who worked on the Clinton campaign. Gentlemen, when you look at these two scenarios, what is very -- what is abundantly clear is that these two situations have been treated completely differently. That Hillary Clinton was treated with kid gloves, and the investigation into Donald Trump is, you know, a door breaking down environment, Marc, and then Zac.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. I mean, look, I will say at the outset that I don't think either the Trump Foundation or the Clinton Foundation should be taking money from oligarchs or from foreign businessmen because it creates a conflict of interest adherently, so I don't think they should be taking this money. But you have to put this into perspective. Donald Trump took $150,000 for a speech to the Yalta security conference, which is a conference that this oligarch put on. The Clinton Foundation took up to $25 million from the same oligarch. He flew Bill and Hillary Clinton around the world on his private jet. He invited Bill Clinton to a French ski resort for his 50th birthday. And, by the way, he paid Bill and Hillary Clinton to speak at the exact same conference as Donald Trump. So, how can it be a conflict for Donald Trump to have taken this money to speak at this conference when Bill and Hillary were paid to speak at the exact same conference?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Why, Zac -- why are these two investigations treated so very differently?</p><p>ZAC PETKANAS, FORMER SENIOR DNC ADVISOR: So, first off, I think you guys got to pick your story here. I mean, the original story from the White House was they fired FBI Director James Comey because the FBI was too hard on Hillary Clinton. Now, you guys are saying that Hillary Clinton was treated with kid gloves. You guys can't have it both ways. You've got to pick one. She was either roasted over the coals, which is why FBI Director James Comey was fired, or she was -- that is the official reason from the White House about why FBI Director James Comey was fired.</p><p>MACCALLUM: No, it was an overall mishandling.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: . outline by Rod Rosenstein of a mishandling of the investigation.</p><p>PETKANAS: It's not just mishandling, it was the fact -- for example, the new I.G. report that's going to come out that shows that they were very, very hard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS: I'm very much looking forward to it. Because, for example, it shows.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS: It shows that the FBI was very, very hard on Hillary Clinton. That's the only thing that's been leaked out in the I.G. report. And so, I don't understand this. But in term of this particular, you know, case, there're key differences between these donations. The ones to the Trump Foundation, for example, was secret. The ones in the Clinton Foundation was completely transparent. There was a press release sent out -- it was listed on the website. The actual dollar amount was earmarked to go to Ukraine to fight HIV/AIDS that was there.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know I hear what you're saying. And as Marc points out, perhaps neither one of these entities should have taken any money at all. $25 million for the Clinton Foundation, $150,000 for Trump, maybe neither one should -- but the point with where we're living right now.</p><p>THIESSEN: Exactly.</p><p>MACCALLUM: . in this month, Marc, is that this shows that there is a straying from this investigation into areas that just makes you wonder what is Robert Mueller interested in in that transaction, do you think?</p><p>THIESSEN: I don't know, but we'll find out eventually. I mean, look, this is what happens when investigation started. They start following trails and they see where they lead, and there maybe nothing to this or there maybe something. But let's keep in mind also that there is an active FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation right now. It's not getting a lot of press attention. But it was restarted last year by the FBI because the Clinton justice department turned down request by the FBI in 2016 to accelerate the investigation. And only after the election where they're allowed to do it. So, there is a very serious investigation into corruption and pay-to-play by the Clinton Foundation.</p><p>And keep in mind that this oligarch when he was giving money to the Clinton Foundation, it was while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. He had, according to the New York Times, he had more than a dozen meetings with senior Clinton state department officials, and we know -- thanks to Citizens United who released her emails that they were reporting back to her on their meetings with him in those emails. He had dinner with her at her home and she lied about it. She said she never saw him once when she was secretary of state, but then the emails came out that shows that he was on the guest list for a dinner at her home. And this is also while this guy was selling -- doing trade with Iran at the time when the United States was under sanction, and he was in trouble with the commerce department for steel dumping in the United States. So, there is a lot more serious things going on here with the Clinton Foundation than there's anything with a $150,000.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And as you points out, the investigation has been reopened. Zac, final thoughts goes to you.</p><p>PETKANAS: I mean, look, I think that people need to get a new hobby. You guys beat Hillary Clinton, you know. I mean, it's time to move on, go for a walk, go get a massage, you know, do whatever you've got to do to fill the void in your souls. But I understand why you're focused on Hillary Clinton because you cannot defend Donald Trump. But seriously, guys, it's getting a little sad.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, Zac, do you think it's fair for the attorney's door to be knocked down at four places where he lives? Do you think that's a fair carrying out of this investigation?</p><p>PETKANAS: I mean, he's being accused of some fairly serious criminal activity, and so, yes, I believe that criminals should have their doors knocked down if there is evidence that they're going to destroy evidence, which is what the case here. So, yes, I mean, these guys are criminals.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Case closed. Case closed. All right, Zac, thank you very much. Good to see you, Marc. Good to have you both. All right, coming up next, is Chinese President Xi responding to President Trump's actions on trade in a significant way that we haven't seen in a long time? And how the so-called trade war could hit some of the president's biggest supporters, perhaps, the hardest. A longtime soybean farmer gives us his take on how he feels about all of this. It's fascinating and it is next.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Chinese President Xi announcing a pretty big move. He says he will significantly cut his country's automobile import tariff, which is something President Trump has been wanting very much. The news comes just hours after President Trump ramped up the rhetoric in the trade fight tweeting this, quote, when a car is sent to the United States from China, the tariff to be paid of 2.5 percent. When a car is sent from China -- to China from the United States the tariff is 25 percent. Does that sound like free or fair trade? No, he writes, it sounds like stupid trade and it's been going on for years. Late this afternoon, President Trump tweeting that he's happy with the progress that is being made so far with China. So, who stands to lose the most in the trade war between the United States and China? Some say it is American farmers, specifically, soybean farmers who reside largely in parts of the country that voted for President Trump in 2016. That is an intentional move on the put of the Chinese. What many Americans don't know is how much their livelihood depends of these soybean farmers who produce most of the feed used to raise chicken, pork, beef, fish, and other foods that we eat every day. Here now, David Rodibaugh, for a longtime soybean farmer who served as director of the Indiana Soybean Alliance. It is good to have you with us tonight, David, thank you very much. So, as this stands now, what is the impact on you and farmers like you?</p><p>DAVID RODIBAUGH, DIRECTOR INDIANA SOYBEAN ALLIANCE: Martha, I might say, first of all, I do live in northwestern Indiana, and we farm with our -- my three brothers and our families, we appreciate the chance to be with you this evening. Trade is really a big deal for us as farmers. We have the ability to raise abundant crops and good infrastructure to get these crops to market, and our organizations have worked very diligently to get the needs assessed of our customers around the world. And so, we can produce and be a reliable supplier.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Sure. What's the impact of these tariffs on you? Tell us how would you be hurt by them do you believe?</p><p>RODIBAUGH: There is a potential that we would lose a great deal of our market. We do export a third of our beans to China, and so it's an extremely big deal for us.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Understood. Let me ask you one more question, does it change how you feel about President Trump?</p><p>RODIBAUGH: I think we're taking a wait and see attitude on that. We have a great amount of confidence in our secretary of agriculture, Sonny Purdue, and there's -- trade is a difficult thing. There are many hurdles across. We have a lot of confidence in our government officials who are charged with doing that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. David, we've got to go, but thank you so much and we appreciate you being here tonight. We hope you'll come back as this moves along and tell us what you're thinking down the road. Thank you, sir. All the best to you.</p><p>RODIBAUGH: Thank you very much.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Quick break and we'll be right back with more of The Story.</p><p>MACCALLUM: That is our story for tonight. We are headed down to D.C. We'll be there for day two of the Zuckerberg hearing. Stick around, we'll see you tomorrow night from D.C. Tucker Carlson, coming up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I just can't get  enough of him.  That's it for us.  Thanks for inviting us into your home  tonight.  That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT.  Fair, balanced, unafraid, \"THE  STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.  Welcome back, Martha.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Hello there, Bret, good to see  you.  Breaking tonight, are guess is that -- what we are watching today  could be the beginning of the end for Facebook, and that the wild west of  the social media technology is about to run into a buzz saw that was set in  motion by Congress, and that Congress has long turned a blind eye.  Today,  Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Durbin cut to the chase on the hot issue of  censoring political thought on Facebook.  And also, how much is too much  sharing?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  There are a great many Americans who I think are  deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a  pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.  There have been  numerous instances where Facebook, in May of 2016, Gizmodo reported that  Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from  trending news, including stories about SEA-PAC, including stories about  Mitt Romney, and including stories about the lowest learner IRS scandal,  including stories about Glenn Beck.  In addition to that, Facebook has  initially shut down the Chick-fil-a Appreciation Day page, has blocked the  posts of Fox News reporter, has blocked over two dozen catholic pages, and  most recently, blocked Trump supporters' diamond and silks page with 1.2  million Facebook followers after determining their content and brand were  \"unsafe to the community.\"  To a great many Americans, that appears to be a  pervasive pattern of political bias, do you agree with that statement?  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  Senator, let me say a few things about  this.  First, I understand where that concern is coming from because  Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an  extreme a left-leaning place.  And this is actually a concern that I have  and I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we don't have any  bias in the work that we do and I think it is a fair concern that people  would wonder about it.  </p><p>CRUZ:  But let me ask this: are you aware of any ad or page that has been  taken down from planned parenthood?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I'm not, but let me just -- </p><p>CRUZ:  How about moveon.org?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Sorry?</p><p>CRUZ:  How about moveon.org.  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm not specifically aware.</p><p>CRUZ:  How about any Democratic candidate?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm not specifically aware.  I mean, I'm not sure.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Would you be comfortable sharing with  us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DURBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about -- your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in  modern America in the name of \"connecting people around the world.\"  The  question basically of what information Facebook is collecting, who they're  sending it to, and whether they've ever ask me in advance my permission to  do that?  Is that a fair thing for a user of Facebook to expect?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, senator.  I think everyone should have control over how  their information is used.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Wow, and it is still going on tonight.  Leading that hearing  today: Senate Judiciary Chairman, Charles Grassley, he will join us in just  a minute.  Also, doing the questioning, Member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and David Kirkpatrick, who  literally wrote the book on the Facebook effect, he has been studying this  for over a decade.  We begin tonight with the Senate Judiciary Chairman  Chuck Grassley.  Senator, good to have you here tonight.  Tell me, you  know, what really stood out to you today?  What was accomplished today, do  you think, in this hearing?  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN:  Well, I wouldn't  say this as accomplishment, what's been accomplished.  But I would say that  it's pretty clear that Facebook does not have any sort of record or a total  amount of information that's been transferred.  They don't seem to audit --  have an audit of what's going on or at least it hasn't been audited to this  point.  And they don't know how much of that information has been shared  with third parties, and then the third parties, what they have done with  it.  And it seems to me that this is pretty essential for not only  Facebook, but other platforms to get this under control in order to  establish or reduce the skepticism and cynicism people have about these  platforms in the privacy and for the protection of privacy.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  But, I mean, there's some discussion that Facebook knows that  some regulation is obviously coming for them.  And that it's probably long  overdue, that they're already trying to figure ways to work around it.  I  mean, you know, do you have -- does it -- are you concerned, I guess, that  their ability to continue to collect data will outpace the Congress'  ability to do anything about it?  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  There's some legislation in on this and I would never try to  tell you or anybody else that's passing a bill is going to solve all  problems you want to or give the proper protection of the people.  And so,  there's two things to go in different directions.  One is this organization  can do the things that they need to do to police it properly and make sure  people's privacy is protected, and of course, people are cynical about  whether any corporation would do that, but it's possible.  And the other  one would be whatever laws or regulations we can pass, but we know FTC is  operated in this area of regulation and agreement with them back in, I  think, 2011 or 2012 and they didn't even follow that.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  I mean, you know, that's a good question.  I mean, the FCC was  -- shouldn't they have been protecting America's privacy?  I mean, I think  that that's their motto.  What were they doing about this for the last ten  years?  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  Well, that's something we haven't had an oversight hearing on  yet and that may be born in the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee  under Thune than it is under me, but it's something I'm very interested in  because you make laws.  And one of the things we have in the legislative  branch of government is oversight, constitutional oversight to make sure  that the laws are carried out the way Congress intended them.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Yes.  All right.  Chairman Chuck Grassley, great to see you  tonight.  Thank you very much.  I know you have to get back in there.   Thanks for making time for us tonight.  </p><p>GRASSLEY:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Joining me now, Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Senate  Judiciary Committee Member, who also got to question Mark Zuckerberg  tonight.  Good to have a with us, Senator Coons.  You know, I want to play  this sound bite for you on competition because this is another area that  Congress perhaps could have some impact on Facebook and social media.   Here's Lindsey Graham.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Is there an alternative to  Facebook in the private sectors?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, senator.  The average American uses eight different apps  to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people -- ranging  from texting apps to e-mails.  </p><p>LINDSEY:  Which is any service you provide?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, we provide a number of different services.  </p><p>LIDNSEY:  Is Twitter the same as what you do?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It overlaps to the portion of what we do. </p><p>LINDSEY:  You don't think you have a monopoly?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Interesting answer from Mark Zuckerberg.  Your take on that,  senator.  You know, what can really -- what can you take away from today  and what can be accomplished?  </p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Well, today  was I hope the first of several hearings where we can make sure that  average Americans understand the ways in which they're personally  identifying data is being collected and gathered, monetized, and used.   Because Americans should know how their data is being used and it should be  used with their knowledge and with their consent.  One of the ways in which  I think Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg is getting into some trouble here, is  practices which when caught or brought to light, Zuckerberg apologizes for,  promises that they will make their best efforts to address, but then  several years later, have not yet been resolved.  One of the things I  question today was a way to add targeting on Facebook makes it possible to  be racially exclusionary in how you put out ads about housing availability.   One of the other issues that I asked of Mr. Zuckerberg was you make your  money by targeting advertising.  Would you allow a diet co manufacturer to  use your data to target teens anxious about their weight?  Or to allow a  casino to target those with gambling problems?  I think these are questions  worth exploring.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Here's Ben Sasse and Mark Zuckerberg on a broader issue that  relates in some ways to that.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA:  Can you imagine a world where you might  decide that pro-lifers are prohibited from speaking about their abortion  views on concept, on your platform?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I certainly would not want that to be the case.  </p><p>SASSE:  But it might be really unsettling to people who've had an abortion  to have an open debate about that, wouldn't it?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It might be but I don't think that that would fit any of the  definitions of what we have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, senator, at one point, Mark Zuckerberg said they're going  to use A.I., artificial intelligence, to govern and scan for hate speech.   Does that concern you?  I mean, could that get into some pretty tricky  territory here?  </p><p>COONS:  Absolutely.  I think that's one of the reasons were going to need  to have a robust and debate about what kind of tools and what kind of  standards Facebook is going to apply.  I applaud the fact that Facebook has  been very active in identifying and taking down materials that are posted  on Facebook by Jihadists groups that are advocating terrorism or violence,  but one person's hate speech in the context that the Senator Sasse was just  talking about is another person's firmly held political or personal or  religious beliefs.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Absolutely.</p><p>COONS:  And we need to make sure first that we don't infringe on the free- speech rights, and second, that we don't so over regulate social media that  we restricted it or constrain it because it is exactly the free and open  environment we provide here in the United States that has led to such  innovations as the creation of most of big tech leaders in the world.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And Ted Cruz pointed out some pretty interesting examples of  some of the things that have been combed out of Facebook for just those  reasons.  And most of them, you know, had to do with conservative political  thoughts.  So, we'll see.  Senator, thank you very much, good to see you  tonight.  </p><p>COONS:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, when we come back, the man who literally wrote the book on  \"The Facebook Effect\", David Kirkpatrick takes us behind the scenes of the  social media empire and what he thinks really happened in there today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Let's start  with the user agreement.  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you  and I say this gently -- your user agreement sucks.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Breaking tonight as this continues to unfold on Capitol Hill,  Mark Zuckerberg saying that artificial intelligence is going to lead the  way to determine what you can and cannot see on Facebook.  So, imagine  wrapping your head around that technology when Congress is still trying to  wrap their arms around what's been going on for the past decade.  So, that  led to a few uncomfortable moments when it came to Facebook's functionality  and how exactly all this works.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT), PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE:  How do you sustain a  business model in which users don't pay for your service?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, we run ads.  </p><p>HATCH:  I see.  So, you don't have bundled permissions for how I can agree  to what devices I may use that you may have contact with?  Do you bundle  that permission?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many data categories do restore, does Facebook  store on the categories that you collect?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, can you clarify what you mean?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How many does Facebook store out of that?  Do you  store any?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, I'm not actually sure what that is referring to. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Those are some uncomfortable moments out there today.  Let's  bring in somebody who wrote a book on the subject.  Here now: David  Kirkpatrick, author of \"The Facebook Effect\".  David, good to have you with  us today.  You know, there are times -- and it's not surprising -- I mean,  if I were sitting there questioning him, I probably have a hard time with  some of the technology involved as well, but it looks like they were all  talking right past each other.  Do you think that?  </p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR OF THE FACEBOOK EFFECT:  I think some more than  others.  I mean, a lot of the technologies that play and tools and product  design are quite complicated, especially for interactions that were four  minutes each with each senator.  So, I think, frankly, our senate, in  general, like all of our legislator is generally not technologically  literate enough.  But I think this was a little bit more of a show trial  than anything.  And I don't really blame them for their questions.  I think  he did a pretty good job answering on balance.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  In terms that -- you have said that you think that Facebook  could signal the end of global democracy as we know it.  And that these  hearings are the beginning of a real sea change in the relationship between  the government and technology.  Explain.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I don't -- that's not exactly what I believe.  I  believe that there's a threat to democracy if these systems are not  properly over seen and overregulated.  I mean, that's been proven in many,  many countries where Facebook has been egregiously manipulated by people  who are using it illegally or dishonestly and Facebook has not properly  regulated that.  So, there is a threat.  Is democracy at risk right now?   No, I don't think so.  Although, in countries like for example, Myanmar,  where democracy is very shaky to begin with, Facebook has had a very, very  dangerous effect.  The main point is, this is a global company operating in  190 countries.  In every single one, politics happens on its service.  And  we're relying on this commercial company to effectively regulate the public  square including politics.  That's just wrong.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  In terms of how it changes.  You know, in terms of the  regulation and how -- what the impact is on social media, because once you  open this can of worms, and maybe it should've been opened a long time ago,  it's going to change these companies and the future of them.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, I think that's healthy and one of the things I was  quite impressed by and even a little surprised by with Zuckerberg today,  and I do know him fairly well, is he was really showing tremendous openness  to regulation.  At one point, he said -- promised one senator -- he would  submit a list of regulations that he thought should apply to Facebook.  He  at one another point said, that he thought the European approach had some  merits and that's a big confession that you never hear from American tech  CEOs.  So, he was taking major steps in this direction.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  But he knows he's going to get regulation.  I mean, so, this  was his moment to try to craft that conversation a little bit.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  I agree.  I think that's fair.  My own opinion is, all of  those things -- your privacy regulation is definitely are going to come out  of this, that's a healthy thing.  But the real issue is bigger.  It's how  does society at a global level deal with a global company that has all this  power and is, up to now, being complete unregulated.  But even with the  privacy laws here and there, it's not going to really change the macro  relationship.  We need a system that gives them more consultancy, more  interaction.  Otherwise, I don't think Facebook is stable for society.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  David Kirkpatrick, good to see you tonight.  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Everybody is going to pay a  price.  He will, everybody will.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Tough talk from President Trump aimed at Bashar al-Assad and  Syria and his ally, Vladimir Putin.  Is the United States about to unleash  retribution as early as tonight?  Ed Henry, Marie Harf, and General Jack  Keane with analysis as the president warns strongmen in Syria and Russia.   Next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can't tolerate a war criminal, we can't tolerate  someone who could more than hurt many of his own people, and this matter  should end immediately.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, we could get an announcement really at any moment from the  president regarding U.S. military action in Syria in response to the  weekend's horrific suspected chemical attack.  The president cancelled his  trip to South America, so that he can remain at the White House as all of  this develops.  This is not sitting well with Russia tonight, now  threatening \"grave repercussions if the United States takes actions against  Syria's Bashar al-Assad\".  Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry joins me  now live from the White House as we wait.  Ed?</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Martha, good to  see you there.  Keeping their cards very close to the vest here.  Remember  dating back to the campaign, President Trump vowed that he was going to  change the practice of tipping off any kind of U.S. military action, any  kind of troop movements, but tonight they are sending strong signals that  he is inching towards military action.  Today, the president spoke by phone  with key ally, British Prime Minister Theresa May, sent strong hints of  action coming by the fact that White House officials said both leaders  condemned what they called the Syrian President Assad \"vicious disregard  for human life.  The president and prime minister agreed not to allow the  use of chemical weapons to continue.\"  </p><p>More tea leaves to read into that trip that you mentioned that was  cancelled.  Vice President Mike Pence is now being sent to Peru for the  summit of Americas this weekend because the president has canceled his  planned trip to Peru and Colombia.  Likewise, the Defense Secretary James  Mattis has now pulled out of a weekend trip to Nevada and California.  He  has public said the U.S. is not ruling out military action.  Pentagon  officials, meanwhile, are calling out the Russian military for jamming U.S.  drones flying near Syria.  The pentagon says they are using sufficient  countermeasures to protect our manned and unmanned aircraft as those drones  scout out possible U.S. strikes against the Assad regime.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president has  been clear, we're working with our partners and allies and national  security team to look at all options.  And as we've said, all options are  on the table, but I'm not going to get ahead of anything the president may  or may not do in response to what's taking place in Syria.  </p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT:  The response has to have a  military component against Bashar al-Assad.  We also have to send a message  to his enablers -- Syria is enabled by Iran and Russia.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY:  And tomorrow, the USS Harry Truman is headed to the Mediterranean  on a preschedule deployment, but that will now put at least seven warships  with hundreds of cruise missiles in the region.  Remember last year, the  U.S. Navy launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria after another  chemical weapons attack.  That shows that right now, there is even more  firepower in the region, Martha.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Ed, thank you very much.  So, we know of at least three  suspected chemical attacks in Syria this year alone and scores of others in  the past few years, prompting a lot of questions about the what the Obama  administration did and did not do to stop the Assad regime.  Remember, they  insisted that Syria did not have any more chemical weapons.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANALYST AND FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE  OBAMA  STATE DEPARTMENT:  The secretary release a statement on the remaining  removal of chemical weapons in Syria.  All of the declared chemical weapons  now are out of Syria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And that would've been good news, if this turns up to not be  the case.  Marie Harf joins me now, she's the former State Department  Spokesperson -- you saw her back then, and now, a Fox News Analyst.  So,  Marie, you know, when you watch what has happened over the last several  years, your thoughts on the assumption at that point that those chemical  weapons have been cleared out of Syria.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, looking that clip you just a played, there was one word that  was a very key there and it's the word \"declared.\"  The 1300 metric tons of  chemical weapons that Syrian government declared were removed.  And I would  note that's more chemical weapons that we went to war over in Iraq.  Those  are weapons that if hadn't got them out of the county, very likely would  have fallen into the hands of ISIS.  But, and I say this honestly and  openly, clearly the Assad regime either kept some weapons and they didn't  declare them or they kept the ability to produce more.  So, clearly, not  everything was out and now we're facing a situation where because of that  2013 agreement, we were able to get a huge portion of the weapons out, but  not all of them.  And President Trump has a very serious decision to make  in the next coming days.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Yes.  I mean, we all remember the red line and President Obama  clearly stating that if that red line was crossed, and he saw, as he put  it, I believe, a bunch of chemical weapons moving around, they would take  action.  But then, the action that you discussed at the podium there was  the substitute for actual military action.  The belief that those are  chemical weapons have been cleared out.  I mean, you know, obviously, we  always have to assume that someone like Assad is not necessarily going to  declare everything that has and that leaving them in power.  President  Obama said time and time again, he must go.  Hillary Clinton said, he must  go.  So, trusting his word that he got them all may have been a mistake.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, it wasn't trust.  I mean, we did destroy, again, 1300 tons of  chemical weapons is nothing -- is no small feat, particularly in the middle  of an ongoing war.  That is true.  But I think what we've seen from  military action -- and look, I supported President Trump last year when he  took that military action after the last attack.  That also didn't stop  President Assad from continuing to use the chemical weapons he had left.   So, there are no good answers here.  I wish there were.  These are all  tough choices.  We took the choice of getting out a huge amount of chemical  weapons, particularly because a number of Republicans in Congress would not  give President Obama the authority to strike militarily.  We asked them and  they said no.  Now, they're singing a different tune.  But again, it's  taking military action, stop the use of chemical weapons, this latest  attack wouldn't have happened.  So, President Trump had put down a lot of  rhetoric, which I think is appropriate.  </p><p>Now, it's a question of what would he do?  And military action, which I  think is appropriate, has to be match with an ongoing diplomatic, strategic  plan to address this and not pull out before we're ready in Syria because  the Russians, the Iranians will fill that vacuum and it will get even  worse, Martha.  </p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST:  Understood.  Marie, thank you very much.</p><p>HARF:  Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Here now, General Jack Keane, Fox News senior strategic analyst  and chairman of the institute for the study of war.  It has been said,  general, 24 to 48 hours we're likely to see some action.  The president  said he doesn't like to telegraph exactly when that will be.  What do you  think?  </p><p>JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Certainly, I think, that's  probably likely.  It's a question of moving the assets into place and  getting it all ready to go.  Look, what happened a year ago, we had a  measured proportionate response, took down the airfield and the equipment  on it that had delivered the strike.  The intent was to deter Assad, that  didn't work.  It failed, actually.  He used chemical weapons again.  So,  what we shouldn't do is another measured proportionate response, yet  larger, because that would deter.  This guy has made up his mind.  He's  going to use chemical weapons for military purposes with get desired effect  he wants.  What we have to do is stop the use of chemical weapons.  </p><p>And by that, I mean, we have to destroy all his capabilities that deliver  those weapons.  So, we're talking about rotary and fixed wing aircraft.   We're talking about airfield, aviation fuels those airfields, aviation  maintenance, aviation ammunitions.  If he still has artillery delivered  chemical weapons, which he used to have and some people think he does, our  intel guys probably know for sure.  Then we should take down his artillery  as well.  We have a complication.  The Russians have strategically placed  technicians at all of these airfields with the thought that that would  discourage the United States from conducting another attack on these  airfields.  They did it after the last attack a year ago.  If we have until  the Russians already, we should tell them something like this.  Every  single military base that Syria owns in Syria is vulnerable to a potential  attack.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, get out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEANE:  And we're not going to be responsible for what happens to your  people if you don't safeguard them.  So, yes, an attack is imminent.  The  other thing is, listen, Iran, Russia, and Syria, they're pariahs in  international community.  We have got to go after them in a very public  way, condemnation, sanctions, and drag them in to international criminal  court.  I mean, it will make no difference to Assad, and no difference to  Iranians, but it will make a difference to Putin.  His public image is very  important to him, particularly at home.  We've got to really go after these  guys in a public way.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  The president, last time he approved air strikes to punish  Syria, he received a lot of support from the American people on that.   Sixty seven percent approving that move, and we all remember the dramatic  video that followed of what happened in terms of the tomahawk missiles that  were sent in.  The feeling now, if I have it correctly, that this would be  a much larger -- much larger operation, do you agree?  And, of course, then  the question becomes what happens the next day and the week after that?  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, I think it should be.  Now, whether -- I'm sure  there are those, like the last time, there were many who wanted to take  down all the airfields the last time, a year ago, which I think was much  more appropriate and people pushed back on that.  So, I don't know what  decisions the president has made.  But, yes, it would be a larger scale  operation.  We would be using standoff cruise missiles and other bombs,  with -- from surface, sub-surface ships, also from airplanes.  If you want  to take airfields out, we're probably running on stealth bombers to do that  because cruise missiles aren't good taking out airfields.  Yes, a larger  mission to be sure.  I think what's coming out of the mouth of the Iranians  and the Russians is pure bluster.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Well, they're all saying that they have nothing to do with it.   Russia and Assad say these were not their chemical weapons.  We have the  video, and I know you say that we have very good tracking of the delivery  system for these and we know exactly where they're coming from.  You know,  your response to those who suggest that perhaps this isn't what it looks  like.  </p><p>KEANE:  That's rubbish and it's ignorance speaking.  We track every single  aircraft that takes off from any airfield in Syria.  We track where it  goes.  We track it when it's executing its bombing run.  We know what  airplane that is.  We have eyewitness accounts of that airplane dropping  bombs on a building where chemical weapons impacted the people.  Those are  verifiable things.  And then, we do data analysis of the horrible photos  we've seen, match up the symptoms of those people with people who have had  that in the past.  Our intelligence agencies on Monday verified that Assad  has used, from helicopter attack again, a nerve agent and also chlorine  gas.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  General Jack Keane, thank you, always good to see you.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  You too.  So still ahead tonight, how China is signaling that  it may waive the white flag, at least to some extent, when it comes to  these tariffs.  Fascinating, shifting of the plate in this issue.  What  does it really mean here?  Also, the president's longtime lawyer now  reportedly under investigation for the $130,000 payment -- $150,000 payment  to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch, but many are remembering  that that same oligarch received payment from the Clinton Foundation, and  that investigation seem to go nowhere.  Victor Pinchuk is this person's  name.  He gave tens of millions of dollars, in fact, to the Clinton  Foundation.  Marc Thiessen and Zac Petkanas weighs in, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  This is the most  biased group of people.  These people have the biggest conflicts of  interest I've ever seen.  They're not looking at the other side, they're  not looking at the Hillary Clinton horrible things that she did and all of  the crimes that were committed.  They're not looking at all of the things  that happened that everybody is very angry about.  I can tell you from the  Republican side, and I think even the independent side.  They only keep  looking at us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  President Trump lashing out at Special Counsel Robert Mueller,  saying that he is ignoring the Clinton scandals among other things.  And  now, Mueller's reported looking into a September of 2015, $150,000 donation  to the Trump Foundation from a Ukrainian oligarch.  But what's not being  reported by many is that very same oligarch, the largest individual  contributor to the Clinton Foundation.  Trace Gallagher live in our west  coast newsroom with the back story tonight.  Hi, Trace.  </p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Martha.  The man in question  is 57-year-old Ukrainian steel magnate, Victor Pinchuk, whose father-in-law  was the president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005.  Pinchuk's $150,000  donation to the now defunct Trump Foundation was in exchange for Donald  Trump speaking via video linked to a 2015 business conference in Kiev.  The  donation was uncovered when the Robert Mueller investigation subpoenaed the  Trump organization.  The legal experts are having trouble finding the  bombshell in this revelations because, one, the speaking fee appears to be  both legal and common.  And, two, it also runs counter to any Russian  collusion argument considering Victor Pinchuk is hostile to Vladimir Putin.   And yet, the time of the payment, Donald Trump was still considered a long  shot to win the GOP nomination, much less the presidency.  </p><p>Then, there's the fact that Pinchuk considers himself a friend of Bill and  Hillary Clinton, and has given the Clinton Foundation up to $25 million,  including $8.6 million while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.  The New  York Times also reports that Pinchuk allowed the Clintons used of his  private jet.  And the payment from Pinchuk to Trump was solicited by former  Clinton advisor and Fox News contributor, Doug Schoen, who you may recall  pulled his report from Hillary Clinton in 2016 saying her presidency would  be hobbled with scandals like the email scandal, which, speaking of double  standards, the American spectator draws this parallel to the FBI's raid on  Trump attorney Michael Cohen.  Quoting here, Hillary Clinton and her chief  minion, Cheryl Mills, claims attorney-client privilege when Mills herself  was under investigation for obstruction.  And then, classified emails  showed up on Hillary's assistance husbands, Anthony Weiner's computer, who  is in prison for pornographic interaction with a minor online.  Has the  Clinton Foundation, or Huma Abedin's home, or Hillary's bathroom been known  not rated yet?  No.  And as for the $150,000 payment from the Ukrainian  oligarch to Trump, Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz, calls it a fake  story.  Martha.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Thank you, Trace.  Here with more, Marc Thiessen, American  Enterprise's chief scholar and a Fox News contributor, and Zac Petkanas, a  former senior DNC advisor who worked on the Clinton campaign.  Gentlemen,  when you look at these two scenarios, what is very -- what is abundantly  clear is that these two situations have been treated completely  differently.  That Hillary Clinton was treated with kid gloves, and the  investigation into Donald Trump is, you know, a door breaking down  environment, Marc, and then Zac.  </p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I mean, look, I will say  at the outset that I don't think either the Trump Foundation or the Clinton  Foundation should be taking money from oligarchs or from foreign  businessmen because it creates a conflict of interest adherently, so I  don't think they should be taking this money.  But you have to put this  into perspective.  Donald Trump took $150,000 for a speech to the Yalta  security conference, which is a conference that this oligarch put on.  The  Clinton Foundation took up to $25 million from the same oligarch.  He flew  Bill and Hillary Clinton around the world on his private jet.  He invited  Bill Clinton to a French ski resort for his 50th birthday.  And, by the  way, he paid Bill and Hillary Clinton to speak at the exact same conference  as Donald Trump.  So, how can it be a conflict for Donald Trump to have  taken this money to speak at this conference when Bill and Hillary were  paid to speak at the exact same conference?  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Why, Zac -- why are these two investigations treated so very  differently?  </p><p>ZAC PETKANAS, FORMER SENIOR DNC ADVISOR:  So, first off, I think you guys  got to pick your story here.  I mean, the original story from the White  House was they fired FBI Director James Comey because the FBI was too hard  on Hillary Clinton.  Now, you guys are saying that Hillary Clinton was  treated with kid gloves.  You guys can't have it both ways.  You've got to  pick one.  She was either roasted over the coals, which is why FBI Director  James Comey was fired, or she was -- that is the official reason from the  White House about why FBI Director James Comey was fired.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  No, it was an overall mishandling.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: . outline by Rod Rosenstein of a mishandling of the  investigation. </p><p>PETKANAS:  It's not just mishandling, it was the fact -- for example, the  new I.G. report that's going to come out that shows that they were very,  very hard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS:  I'm very much looking forward to it.  Because, for example, it  shows.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETKANAS:  It shows that the FBI was very, very hard on Hillary Clinton.   That's the only thing that's been leaked out in the I.G. report.  And so, I  don't understand this.  But in term of this particular, you know, case,  there're key differences between these donations.  The ones to the Trump  Foundation, for example, was secret.  The ones in the Clinton Foundation  was completely transparent.  There was a press release sent out -- it was  listed on the website.  The actual dollar amount was earmarked to go to  Ukraine to fight HIV/AIDS that was there.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  You know I hear what you're saying.  And as Marc points out,  perhaps neither one of these entities should have taken any money at all.   $25 million for the Clinton Foundation, $150,000 for Trump, maybe neither  one should -- but the point with where we're living right now.</p><p>THIESSEN:  Exactly.</p><p>MACCALLUM: . in this month, Marc, is that this shows that there is a  straying from this investigation into areas that just makes you wonder what  is Robert Mueller interested in in that transaction, do you think?  </p><p>THIESSEN:  I don't know, but we'll find out eventually.  I mean, look, this  is what happens when investigation started.  They start following trails  and they see where they lead, and there maybe nothing to this or there  maybe something.  But let's keep in mind also that there is an active FBI  investigation into the Clinton Foundation right now.  It's not getting a  lot of press attention.  But it was restarted last year by the FBI because  the Clinton justice department turned down request by the FBI in 2016 to  accelerate the investigation.  And only after the election where they're  allowed to do it.  So, there is a very serious investigation into  corruption and pay-to-play by the Clinton Foundation.  </p><p>And keep in mind that this oligarch when he was giving money to the Clinton  Foundation, it was while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.  He had,  according to the New York Times, he had more than a dozen meetings with  senior Clinton state department officials, and we know -- thanks to  Citizens United who released her emails that they were reporting back to  her on their meetings with him in those emails.  He had dinner with her at  her home and she lied about it.  She said she never saw him once when she  was secretary of state, but then the emails came out that shows that he was  on the guest list for a dinner at her home.  And this is also while this  guy was selling -- doing trade with Iran at the time when the United States  was under sanction, and he was in trouble with the commerce department for  steel dumping in the United States.  So, there is a lot more serious things  going on here with the Clinton Foundation than there's anything with a  $150,000.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  And as you points out, the investigation has been reopened.   Zac, final thoughts goes to you.  </p><p>PETKANAS:  I mean, look, I think that people need to get a new hobby.  You  guys beat Hillary Clinton, you know.  I mean, it's time to move on, go for  a walk, go get a massage, you know, do whatever you've got to do to fill  the void in your souls.  But I understand why you're focused on Hillary  Clinton because you cannot defend Donald Trump.  But seriously, guys, it's  getting a little sad.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  So, Zac, do you think it's fair for the attorney's door to be  knocked down at four places where he lives?  Do you think that's a fair  carrying out of this investigation?  </p><p>PETKANAS:  I mean, he's being accused of some fairly serious criminal  activity, and so, yes, I believe that criminals should have their doors  knocked down if there is evidence that they're going to destroy evidence,  which is what the case here.  So, yes, I mean, these guys are criminals.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Case closed.  Case closed.  All right, Zac, thank you very  much.  Good to see you, Marc.  Good to have you both.  All right, coming up  next, is Chinese President Xi responding to President Trump's actions on  trade in a significant way that we haven't seen in a long time?  And how  the so-called trade war could hit some of the president's biggest  supporters, perhaps, the hardest.  A longtime soybean farmer gives us his  take on how he feels about all of this.  It's fascinating and it is next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Chinese President Xi announcing a pretty big move.  He says he  will significantly cut his country's automobile import tariff, which is  something President Trump has been wanting very much.  The news comes just  hours after President Trump ramped up the rhetoric in the trade fight  tweeting this, quote, when a car is sent to the United States from China,  the tariff to be paid of 2.5 percent.  When a car is sent from China -- to  China from the United States the tariff is 25 percent.  Does that sound  like free or fair trade?  No, he writes, it sounds like stupid trade and  it's been going on for years.  Late this afternoon, President Trump  tweeting that he's happy with the progress that is being made so far with  China.  So, who stands to lose the most in the trade war between the United  States and China?  Some say it is American farmers, specifically, soybean  farmers who reside largely in parts of the country that voted for President  Trump in 2016.  That is an intentional move on the put of the Chinese.   What many Americans don't know is how much their livelihood depends of  these soybean farmers who produce most of the feed used to raise chicken,  pork, beef, fish, and other foods that we eat every day.  Here now, David  Rodibaugh, for a longtime soybean farmer who served as director of the  Indiana Soybean Alliance.  It is good to have you with us tonight, David,  thank you very much.  So, as this stands now, what is the impact on you and  farmers like you?  </p><p>DAVID RODIBAUGH, DIRECTOR INDIANA SOYBEAN ALLIANCE:  Martha, I might say,  first of all, I do live in northwestern Indiana, and we farm with our -- my  three brothers and our families, we appreciate the chance to be with you  this evening.  Trade is really a big deal for us as farmers.  We have the  ability to raise abundant crops and good infrastructure to get these crops  to market, and our organizations have worked very diligently to get the  needs assessed of our customers around the world.  And so, we can produce  and be a reliable supplier.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Sure.  What's the impact of these tariffs on you?  Tell us how  would you be hurt by them do you believe?  </p><p>RODIBAUGH:  There is a potential that we would lose a great deal of our  market.  We do export a third of our beans to China, and so it's an  extremely big deal for us.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Understood.  Let me ask you one more question, does it change  how you feel about President Trump?  </p><p>RODIBAUGH:  I think we're taking a wait and see attitude on that.  We have  a great amount of confidence in our secretary of agriculture, Sonny Purdue,  and there's -- trade is a difficult thing.  There are many hurdles across.   We have a lot of confidence in our government officials who are charged  with doing that.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  All right.  David, we've got to go, but thank you so much and  we appreciate you being here tonight.  We hope you'll come back as this  moves along and tell us what you're thinking down the road.  Thank you,  sir.  All the best to you.</p><p>RODIBAUGH:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MACCALLUM:  Quick break and we'll be right back with more of The Story.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACCALLUM:  That is our story for tonight.  We are headed down to D.C.   We'll be there for day two of the Zuckerberg hearing.  Stick around, we'll  see you tomorrow night from D.C.  Tucker Carlson, coming up next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

But with state capitols suddenly rushing to beat D.C. to the punch, big tech may have been worried about the wrong regulators all along. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, a coalition of around three dozen state attorneys general, led by Texass Ken Paxton, will convene Monday outside the U.S. Supreme Court to announce a formal antitrust investigation into Google. That announcement comes just days after New York Attorney General Letitia Jamess Friday statement that she was launching a separate antitrust probe into Facebook, joined by six other states and the District of Columbia. </p><p>Industry experts say its highly unusual for states to overtake the federal government in such high-profile antitrust investigationsand particularly for them to do so with such broad, bipartisan support from attorneys general across the country. But the attempt to leapfrog the burgeoning antitrust efforts by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department against Facebook, Google, and other sprawling tech firms is merely the latest in an explosion of state activity targeting the tech industry. Consider the state-led lawsuit against the telecommunications mega-merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, which quietly picked up support from Illinoiss attorney general last week and now boasts the support of 16 states plus the District of Columbia. Experts say its the first time the states have challenged a major telecom merger despite its approval by the DOJ and the Federal Communications Commission. There has never been a deal in which the states acted in a large group before the DOJ decided, and contrary to the DOJ decision, said Blair Levin, a former FCC official and scholar at the Brookings Institution who called the lawsuit unprecedented. Theres also the privacy case brought against Facebook by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, which continues despite the record-breaking FTC settlement reached with the company in July. The risk for Facebook and Google is that that becomes a model for other states to go after the biggest companies on privacy, using state consumer-protection law, said Paul Gallant, an industry analyst at Cowen and Company. The same phenomenon is playing out in statehouses, where lawmakers continue to express frustration over the slow pace of tech-policy reform in Washington.  Many observers are aware of Californias successful push to pass privacy legislation last year, which has prompted copycat bills throughout the country and on Capitol Hill. There are also new laws passed in both California and Washington state to mandate new net-neutrality protections following the FCCs rollback of federal rules in 2017.  But in state capitols across the country, experts say theres more tech-focused legislation percolating just below the surface.  Gigi Sohn, a former aide to ex-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and a fellow at Georgetown University, said shes aware of advocates talking to officials in New York about a state law to regulate the discriminatory use of artificial intelligence. And she expects issues such as childrens online privacy and the mapping of rural broadband coverage to crop up in future legislative debates across the country. Sohn calls the dramatic escalation in state activity on tech policy absolutely unusual. But, in her view, the increased activity is more than justified by the glacial pace of reform in Washington and the increasing centrality of technology in the lives of citizens. I think the states see themselvesrightfully so, in my opinionas the bulwark against an administration thats just tossing out consumer protections left and right, she said. Progressive fury at the Trumps administrations rapid deregulatory agenda is undoubtedly driving many of the state-led campaigns on tech issues. But there have also been significant Republican initiatives in recent months.  In April, the Texas Senate passed legislation designed to crack down on tech platforms allegedly censoring conservative viewpoints. The bill didnt make it through the state House. Its sponsor, state Sen. Bryan Hughes, did not respond to a request for comment.  But Ian Adams, the vice president of policy at the libertarian tech group TechFreedom and a former longtime GOP staffer in the California legislature, said its likely just a matter of time before Republican lawmakers in other states introduce similar legislation. I think it comes down to electoral politics, Adams said. These companies are not as popular as they once were ... and Republicans are not immune to picking a fight that just a couple of years ago, ideologically, would not have been on their radar. The presence of a number of Republican attorneys general in both the antitrust probes against Silicon Valley and the lawsuit challenging the T-Mobile-Sprint merger further illustrates the bipartisan nature of the pushback. And in some ways, experts see those law enforcement efforts as having a greater impact than anything state legislatures can accomplish in the near future. Theres been more activism at the state [attorney general] level than ever, Gallant said. And I think only now is this starting to get appreciated by Washington and Wall Street. Experts anticipate that increased activism will continue for some time. I think were in the second inning, Levin said. And, I would also say, this strikes me as the kind of game very capable of going into extra innings. If federal regulators fail to move aggressively on their own antitrust and privacy concerns, experts increasingly believe, state attorneys general would be willing to go it alone. Their efforts could include mandating major business-model changes, limiting the types of data tech companies can gather, or even forcing divestitures or breakups of sprawling technology or telecom firms.  Those would all be dramatic, even unprecedented, steps for any state to take in the absence of federal support. But as the T-Mobile-Sprint challenge gains steam and the state push on antitrust escalates, it makes sense to expect the unexpected. I think, historically, the state [attorneys general] have almost always deferred to their federal counterparts, Gallant said. But I think thats changing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-681292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X11-5J31-DY4X-T122-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1072\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

The document described in the video below is available HERE.[1] Research into state health regulations by Fog City Midge shows that new guidance for the definition of COVID-19 positive infections is likely the biggest background cause in a dramatic upswing in positive test results. WATCH:[embedded content]. This revelation would explain exactly why those who construct the reporting systems are pushing so hard for contact tracing. According to the new guidance anyone who comes into contact with a person who tests positive is now also considered positive. [pdf link][2] Nice convenient way to inflate the infection rate. The verified source is Here[3]  In order to support the most important political objectives of the DNC writ large in the 2020 election, COVID-19 hype is essential: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/corporate_liar_1.jpg\">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/corporate_liar_1.jpg</url> Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot easily achieve 'mail-in' voting; which they desperately need in key battleground states in order to control the outcome. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot shut down rallies and political campaigning efforts of President Trump; which they desperate need to do in key battleground states. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot block the campaign contrast between an energetic President Trump and a physically tenuous, mentally compromised, challenger. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats do not have an excuse for cancelling the DNC convention in Milwaukee; thereby blocking Team Bernie Sanders from visible opposition while protecting candidate gibberish from himself. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats do not have a mechanism to keep voters isolated from each-other; limiting communication and national debate adverse to their interests. COVID-19 panic pushes the national conversation into the digital space where Big Tech controls every element of the conversation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/zogby-poll-biden-dementia.jpgWithout\">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/zogby-poll-biden-dementia.jpgWithout</url> COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot keep their Blue state economies easily shut-down and continue to block U.S. economic growth. All thriving economies are against the political interests of Democrats. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot easily keep club candidate Joe Biden sealed in the basement; where the electorate is not exposed to visible signs of his dementia. Without COVID-19 panic it becomes more difficult for Big Tech to censor voices that would outline the fraud and scheme. With COVID-19 panic they have a better method and an excuse. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot advance, influence, or organize their preferred presidential debate format, a 'virtual presidential debate' series. [Comrade Gretchen Whitmer knows this plan, hence she cancelled the Michigan venue] All of these, and more, strategic outcomes are based on the manufactured weaponization of the COVID-19 virus to achieve a larger political objective. There is ZERO benefit to anyone other than Democrats for the overwhelming hype surrounding COVID-19. It is not coincidental that all corporate media are all-in to facilitate the demanded fear that Democrats need in order to achieve their objectives. Thus there is an alignment of all big government institutions and multinationals to support the same. Nothing is coincidental. Everything is political. <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/trump-suit-5.jpghttps://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/biden-nuts-1.jpg\">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/trump-suit-5.jpghttps://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/biden-nuts-1.jpg</url> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8jy9hyl6iqjas6e/NEW%20Covid-19%20Case%20Definions.pdf?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/8jy9hyl6iqjas6e/NEW%20Covid-19%20Case%20Definions.pdf?dl=0</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eagenda.collincountytx.gov/docs/2020/CC/20200518_2481/48410%5FExplanation%2Epdf\">https://eagenda.collincountytx.gov/docs/2020/CC/20200518_2481/48410%5FExplanation%2Epdf</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://collincountytx.new.swagit.com/videos/62477%20%20tell%20them%20to%20start%20at%2015:00%20and%20go%20to%20at%20least%2032:00\">https://collincountytx.new.swagit.com/videos/62477%20%20tell%20them%20to%20start%20at%2015:00%20and%20go%20to%20at%20least%2032:00</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ATOM127393159374562034075776100166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATOM-127393</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608H-NF21-F03R-N23W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><timeReceived>3:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Conservative Treehouse</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>media bias</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CDC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Notorious Liars</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID-19</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>propaganda</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Professional Idiots</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>States</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001344</classCode><className>POLITICAL DEBATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Authored by Marshall Auerback and Jan Ritch-Frel. This article was produced byEconomy for All[3], a project of the Independent Media Institute[4]  The coronavirus pandemic has upended the global economic system, and just as importantly, cast out 40 years of neoliberal orthodoxy that dominated the industrialized world.    Forget about the 'new world order[5].' Offshoring and global supply chains are out; regional and local production is in. Market fundamentalism is pass; regulation is the norm. </p><p>Public health is now more valuable than just-in-time supply systems. Stockpiling and industrial capacity suddenly make more sense, which may have future implications inthe recently revived antitrust debate[6]in the U.S.  Biodata will drive the next phase of social management and surveillance, with near-term consequences for the way countries handle immigration and customs. Health care and education will become digitally integrated the way newspapers and television were 10 years ago. Health care itself will increasingly be seen as a necessary public good, rather than a private right, until now in the U.S. predicated on age, employment or income levels. Each of these will produce political tensions within their constituencies and in the society generally as they adapt to the new normal.  This political sea change doesn't represent a sudden conversion to full-on socialism, but simply a case of minimizing our future risks of infection by providing full-on universal coverage. Beyond that, as Professor Michael Sandelhas argued[7], one has to query the 'moral logic' of providing 'coronavirus treatment for the uninsured,' while leaving 'health coverage in ordinary times to the market' (especially when our concept of what constitutes 'ordinary times' has been upended).  Internationally, there will be many positive and substantial international shifts to address overdue global public health needs and accords on mitigating climate change. And it is finally dawning on Western-allied economic planners that the military price tag that made so-called cheap oil and cheap labor possible is vastly higher than investment in advanced research and next-generation manufacturing.  This also means that the old North (developed world) versus South (emerging world) division thatlong preoccupied scholars and policymakers in the post-World War II period[8]will become increasingly stark again, particularly for those emerging economies that have hitherto attracted investment largely on the grounds of being repositories of low-cost labor. They will now find themselves picking sides as they seek assistance in an increasingly divided and multipolar world.  The fault lines of the next economic era have already begun to surface, creating friction with the previous international structure of banking and finance, trade and industry. There is a force beyond elites and critical industries driving this: The proletariat has literally become the 'precariat.'  In the U.S. and Europe, the staggering number of service economy workers are going to be quickly politicized by the shortfalls: People have seen a collapse in income, and big failures in education, and health care. Union-busting, pension fleecing, and austerity budgets and new technologies that concentrate wealth away from labor have created a circumstance where ownership and profit models must be revisited to sustain stability. The needs are too acute to be distracted by the lies of Trump, or the inadequate responses in other parts of the industrialized world.The current crisis will likely prompt geopolitical and economic shifts and dislocations we haven't seen since World War II.  Death of Chimerica, the Rise of New Production Blocs  One of the biggest casualties of the current order is the breakdown of 'Chimerica[9],' the decades-old nexus between the U.S. and Chinese economies, along with other leading countries' partnerships with Chinese manufacturing. While the geopolitics of blame for the origins of coronavirus continue to shake out, the process that saw a decrease in exports from China to the U.S. from$816 billion in 2018 to $757 billion in 2019[10]will accelerate and intensify over the next decade.  While a decoupling is unlikely to lead to armed conflict, a Cold War style of competition could emerge as a new global fault line. Much as the Cold War did not preclude some degree of collaboration between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, so too today there may still be areas of cooperation between Washington and Beijing from climate to public health, advanced research to weapons proliferation.  Nor does this shift necessarily spell the sudden collapse of Chinese power or influence\u2014it has a colossal and still-growing domestic market and is on the international leaderboard for a wide range of advanced indicators. But its status as the world's most desirable offshore manufacturing hub is a thing of the past, along with the economic stability that steady inflows of foreign capital brought with it. It does show a susceptibility to domestic stress, with the Hong Kong protests last year providing a hint of what is in store as the party leadership can't pivot to new realities that include slower economic growth and declining foreign investment.  As investment flows turn inward back to industrialized countries, there will likely be corresponding diminution of the global labor arbitrage emanating from the emerging world. In general, that's a negative for the global South, but potentially a positive factor for workers elsewhere, whose wages and living standards have stagnated for decades as they lost jobs to competing overseas low-cost manufacturing centers (the increase in inequalityis principally[11]a product of 40 years of sustained attacks on unions). The jobs won't be the same, but to be sure, manufacturing incomes exceed those of the service industry.  As each country adopts a 'sauve-qui-peut[12]' mentality, businesses and investors are drawing the necessary conclusions. Coronavirus has been a wake-up call, as countries trying to import medical goods from existing global supply chains face ashortage of air and ocean freight options[13]to ship goods back to home markets. Already, the Japanese government has announced its plans 'to spend over $2 billion to help its country's firms move production out of China,'according to the Spectator Index[14]. TheEU leadership[15]is publicly indicating a policy of subsidy and state investment in companies to prevent Chinese buyouts or undercutting prices.  Two billion dollars is small potatoes compared to what is likely to be spent by the U.S. and other countries going forward. And it can't simply be done via research and development tax credits. The state can and must drive this redomiciling process in other ways: vialocal content requirements (LCRs)[16], tariffs, quotas and/or government procurement local sourcing requirements. And with a $750-billion-plus budget, the U.S. military will likely play a role here, as itponders disruptions from overseas supply sources[17].  Of course, if the U.S. does this, other parts of the world\u2014China, the EU, Japan\u2014will likely do the same, which will accelerate the regionalization trends in trade. This may mean that some U.S. firms will have to operate in foreign markets through local subsidiaries with local content preferences and local workforces (that is how it worked in the 1920s\u2014Ford UK was a mostly local British company, different from the U.S. Ford Motor Company, but with shared profits).  An examination of U.S. planning for the post-1945 world reveals the emphasis was on free trade in raw materials mostly, not finished goods. (The U.S. only adopted one-way 'free trade' with its Asian and European allies later as a Cold War measure to accelerate their development and keep them in the American orbit.)  Domestically within the U.S., asDalia Marin writes[18], the coming declines in interest rates will accelerate 'robot adoption' by 75.7 percent, with concentration 'in the sectors that are most exposed to global value chains. In Germany, that means autos and transport equipment, electronics, and textiles\u2014industries that import around 12 percent of their inputs from low-wage countries. Globally, the industries where the most reshoring activity is taking place are chemicals, metal products, and electrical products and electronics.'  As the coronavirus pandemic is illustrating, a viable industrial ecosystem cannot work effectively if it is dispersed to too many geographic extremities or there are insufficient redundancies built into the transportation of goods back into the home market (rail, highway, etc.).Proximityhas become a significant competitive advantage for manufacturers, and a strategic advantage for governments. But the U.S. government must play an expanded role in the planning process. The U.S. is still a leader in many high-tech areas, but is suffering the consequences of a generation-long effort to undermine the government's natural role as an economic planner.  In the form of the regionalized blocs that are being sketched, in the Americas, Mexico is likely to be one of the leading recipients of American foreign direct investment (FDI). It already has a$17 billion medical device industry[19]and is sure to absorb much more capacity from China. This hasalready started to happen as a result of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, or new NAFTA)[20]. Furthermore, theWashington Post reports[21]that '[a]s demand soars for medical devices and personal protective equipment in the fight against the coronavirus, the United States has turned to the phalanx of factories south of the border that are now the outfitters of many U.S. hospitals.' This is in addition to thethousands of assembly plants already in place[22]in Mexico since the establishment of NAFTA. Indeed, if the jobs that had moved to China move to Mexico, Central America, and South America, this likely addresses many long-standing social tensions in regard to immigration management, currency imbalances and corresponding black market industries (ironically, it also likely means the end of Trump's wall, as the industrial ecosystem of the Americas becomes more cohesive and widespread).  Big Business Is Good Business  But this will also have significant impacts closer to home: Much as Franklin Delano Roosevelt ultimatelyprioritized domestic ramp-ups in wartime production over trust-busting[23], so too national champions are likely to feature more prominently today, as domestic scale and balance sheet strength are given precedence to accommodate the drive to revive employment quickly,and work collaboratively to halt the spread of the coronavirus[24]. The scale of companies will not be regarded as a political problem if they can both deliver for consumers and show the capacity of following political direction for what the public's needs are. Tech companies like Apple and Google are stepping up to fill the void left bymassive federal government dysfunction[25]. The 'break up Big Tech[26]' voices are nowhere to be heard at the moment.  We still need a more robust form of regulation for these corporate behemoths, but via a system of regulation that is 'function-centric,' rather than size-centric. As co-author Marshall Auerbackhas written before[27], this kind of regulation 'restricts the range of corporate activities (e.g., structural separation so as to prevent companies like Amazon and Google from owning both the platform as well as participating as a seller on that platform), or the prices such companies can charge (as regulators often do for utilities or railways). These considerations would be 'size neutral': they would apply independently of corporate size per se.'  Capitalism has always had its plutocrats, but scaling back America's overly financialized model (by preventing stock buybacks, to cite one example) would represent a useful reform and prevent a lot of economic waste. Instead of going to enrich executives and shareholders beyond the dreams ofCroesus[28], that measure might help to ensure that the profits of these companies will be directed to the workers' wages (which also means supporting increased unionization), or plowed back into investment (e.g., increased robotics).  Biodata, Privacy, and an End to Pandemic Profiteering  And there are fault lines in the business world. The pharmaceutical and medical research industries face immense pressure from other businesses to end the pandemic so they can get back to profitability. That means temporarily setting aside profits and pooling intellectual property to encourage collaborative efforts on the part of biotech and pharmaceutical companies to find proper treatments for COVID-19, and make them freely available, especially if governments were to waive antitrust scrutiny in exchange for all of the data Big Pharma companies collectively hold. Asthe Guardian reports[29], '[t]here is a precedent. Last June, 10 of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies\u2014including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline\u2014announced they would pool data[30]for an AI-based search for new antibiotics, which are urgently needed as antibiotic-resistant bacteria have proliferated across the world, threatening the growth of untreatable disease.'  Privacy advocates are already expressing concerns[31]about a growing and overweening medical surveillance state. These surveillance concerns lack historical context: From the 19th century on, serious health problems were met by hardline government policies to reduce them. Policies ranging from quarantine to vaccine were not always mandatory, but there was an understanding that personal concessions had to be made to manage a huge population and an advanced society; the Constitution was not a suicide pact. We can further alleviate those concerns today by ensuring that the information uncovered does not become a precondition or additional cost of receiving insurance coverage. In light of coronavirus, cost savings of incorporating biodata into immigration and customs are a no-brainer for governments, and are certain to cause friction with individuals who may not want to give blood or saliva to get a visa or work permit, and agribusiness leaders who know that safety measures cut into profitability. But the scales have tipped in the other direction.  North Versus South  What about the other countries in the developing world that don't have close geographic proximity to a home market, or abundant supplies of key commodities required for 21st-century manufacturing needs, or even a well-developed manufacturing base (in other words, the countries that have hitherto been large recipients of investment solely on the grounds of cheap labor)? Many of them have faced immediate pressure with the collapse in global trade, unprecedented capital flight that is sure to grow as the coronavirus spreads, all the while coping with COVID-19 with highly inadequate health systems.  In the meantime,the multi-trillion-dollar market for emerging market debt[32], both sovereign bonds and commercial paper, has collapsed. Many of these countries, via their state pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, have become the ultimate endpoint for many of the newer asset-backed securities that finally revived years after the 2008 financial crisis. This has become the potential new stress point in the $52 trillion 'shadow banking[33]' market. The U.S. Federal Reserve has sought to ease the funding stresses of much of the developing economies by offering central bank swap lines. It has also broadened prime dealer collateral acceptance rules, and set up commercial paper swap facilities, all of which have eased short-term funding pressures in these economies that have incurred substantial dollar liabilities.  As the emerging world central banks then start to lend on those lines to their own banks, it should start to alleviate the shortage of dollars in the offshore dollar funding markets. We are starting to see some easing of stresses,notably in Indonesia[34]\u2014because it's an exporter of resources more than a cheap labor price economy.  But whereas in previous emerging markets crises, China was able to buttress these economies via initiatives such as the 'Belt and Road Initiative[35],' Beijing itself is likely to be buffeted by the twin shocks of declining global trade and a reversal of foreign direct investment, which declined 8.6 percent in the firsttwo months of this year[36].  Longer-term, many other countries face comparable challenges to China: Capital controls, collapsing domestic currencies, and widespread debt defaults are likely to become the norm. That's alreadyhappened to serial defaulter Argentina again[37]. South Africa has beendowngraded to junk status[38]. Turkey remains vulnerable. The so-called 'BRICS' economies\u2014Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa\u2014are all sinking like bricks. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that coronavirus and likely future pandemics will create additional stresses on developing economies that depend on their labor price advantage in the international marketplace to survive.  By contrast, countries like South Korea and Taiwan have had a 'good crisis.' Both have vibrant manufacturing sectors and created successful multiparty democracies.Foreign investment in South Korea[39]continued to grow in the first quarter of this year, as it rapidly moved to contain the spread of COVID-19 through an extensive testing regime (while keeping its economy open). Similarly in Taiwan, by activating a national emergency response system launched in 2004 (following the SARS virus), that country has mounteda thoroughly competent coronavirus intervention of unprecedented effectiveness[40]. The results speak for themselves: as of April 15, inSouth Korea, a mere 225 deaths[41], while inTaiwan, an astonishingly low total of six deaths[42]in a country of 24 million people\u2014this despite far more exposure to infected Chinese visitors than Italy, Spain or the U.S.  Of course, the very success of Taiwan's response revives another potential fault line, namely the tension underlying the'One China'[43]policy. Before COVID-19, it is noteworthy that the WHO 'even refused to publicly report Taiwan's cases of SARS until public pressure prompted numbers to be published under the label of 'Taiwan, province of China,''according to Dr. Anish Koka[44]. At the very least, Taiwan's divergent approach and success at fighting the pandemic will bolster its pro-independence factions.  The question of foreign nations upholding Taiwan's sovereignty with regard to China is increasingly thorny, given Beijing's growing military capacities. This will present an ongoing diplomatic challenge to Western parties who seek to increase engagement with Taipei without heightening tensions in the region.  A Recalculation of 'Economic Value'  We have outlined many fault lines likely to be exposed or exacerbated as a consequence of COVID-19. Happily, there is one fault line likely to be slammed shut: namely, the false dichotomy that has long existed between economic growth and environmentalism. TheGlobal Assessment from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services[45]reports that 'land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23 percent of the global land surface, up to US$577 billion in annual global crops are at risk from pollinator loss and 100-300 million people are at increased risk of floods and hurricanes because of loss of coastal habitats and protection.' Likewise, the study cites the fact that as of 2015, 33 percent of marine fish stocks 'were being harvested at unsustainable levels,' and notes the rise of plastic pollution (which 'hasincreased tenfold since 1980[46]'), both of which play a key role in degrading ecosystems in a manner that ultimately destroys economic growth.  Finally, repeated pandemics over the past few decades have shown these are not blips, but recurrent features of today's world. Hence, there is an increasing public appetite for regulation to deal with this ongoing problem. Some industries, such as agribusinesses, won't like this, but the concerns are well-founded. According toexpert Josh Balk[47], 75 percent of new diseases start in domestic and wild-caught animals, and 2.2 million people die each year from illnesses transferred from animals. The majority of these are transferred from poorly regulated factory farm chickens, cows and pigs; still, the 'wet markets'[48]of Asia and Africa, and the trade in potential 'transfer species[49],' such as pangolins, a major driver of the$19 billion-a-year[50]global trade in illegal wildlife, must also be addressed. Beijing has suggested it willban trade in illegal wildlife and seek tighter regulation of the wet markets[51]. The latter in particular may be easier said than done, according toDr. Zhenzhong Si[52], a research associate at Canada's University of Waterloo who specializes in Chinese food security, sustainability, and rural development. Dr. Siargued that[53]'[b]anning wet markets is not only going to be impossible, but will also be destructive for urban food security in China as they play such a pivotal role in ensuring urban residents' access to affordable and healthy food.'  To be fair, this isn't the first time that the sacred tenets of the global economic framework have dealt with a crisis that seemed to usher in a new era. The same thing happened in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. But that was largely seen as a financial crisis, a product of faulty global financial plumbing that nobody truly understood, as opposed to a widespread social collapse closely approximating the conditions of the Great Depression as we have today.  Not only has the current lockdown put the entire global economy into deep freeze, but it also came amidst a backdrop of widespread political and social upheaval, and a faux recovery whose fruits were largely restricted to the top tier. A collateralized debt obligation is not intuitively easy to grasp. By contrast, being forced to stay at home, deprived of vital income and isolated from loved ones, while health care workers perish from overwork and lack of protective gear, is a different order of magnitude.  Even as we re-integrate, it is hard to envisage a return to the 'old normal.' Trade patterns will change. Self-sufficiency and geographic proximity will be prioritized over global integration. There will be new winners and losers, but it is worth noting that the model of capitalism we are describing\u2014one that does not feature obscenely overcompensated CEO pay co-existing with serf labor and the widespread offshoring of manufacturing\u2014has existed in different forms in the U.S. from 1945 into the 1980s, and still exists in parts of Europe (Germany) and East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) to this day.  Our everyday lives will be impacted as selective quarantines and some forms of social distancing become the new normal (much as they were when we dealt with tuberculosis epidemics). All of this has implications for a multitude of industries: restaurants, leisure, travel, tourism, sporting events, entertainment, and media, as well as our evolving definition of 'essential' industries. Even our concept of personal privacy will likely have to be amended, especially in regard to medical matters. Concerns about medical surveillance\u2014stigma (STDs, alcoholism, mental illness) and denial of insurance\u2014can be alleviated if everyone is guaranteed treatment regardless of ability to pay, which will mean greater government intrusion into the lives of citizens and activities of businesses as the public sector seeks to socialize costs.  Taken in aggregate, we are about to experience the most profound social, economic and political changes since World War II.

The country laid out rules in advance of technology to encourage its development, said Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who served as president from 2006 to 2016.</p><p>\"What we did in Estonia was to build the system up from the legal and constitutional requirements to determine what government may and what it may not do,\" he says.</p><p>\"Whatever a legally constrained democratic government will leave untouched by digitisation will be digitised anyway, but by the tech sector.\"</p><p>The nation of 1.3 million people is now home to hundreds of tech start-ups, a national electronic ID card system that lets citizens engage with their government or businesses virtually, and an e-residency program that makes Estonia a gateway to the European Union for entrepreneurs.</p><p>Ilves plans to visit Australia in early April, as Australia's approach to technology comes under renewed scrutiny.</p><p>ANU Cyber Institute chief Lesley Seebeck wrote at the start of this year <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/surviving-in-a-world-of-sharper-technological-competition/\">that the dominant policies on technology and society enunciated in Australia \"have been shaped by fear\".</url></p><p>\"Security concerns alone should not dictate our future,\" Seebeck wrote. \"Nor should national security be conflated with strategy and statecraft.\"</p><p>The problems of social media livestreaming massacres is just one issue. In 2018 the Assistance and Access Bill, requiring companies to cooperate with the government when it seeks information held on encrypted devices, was passed, creating new uncertainty for Australia's tech sector. </p><p>The difficulties around regulation and tech continue to mount. Regulators are looking at energy giant Alinta after reporting by The Age, Sydney Morning Herald and ABC's 7.30 revealed the energy giant failed to enforce data storage conditions which were a condition of its sale to a Chinese company almost three years ago. This week Australia's information and privacy commissioner, Angelene Falk, launched legal action against Facebook, accusing the social media giant of \"serious and/or repeated interferences\" with user privacy in breach of the law.</p><p>In its current phase Australia remains a \"taker\" rather than a maker of systems, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/surviving-in-a-world-of-sharper-technological-competition/\">Seebeck wrote in January</url>: \"Australians have not yet started to consider what a future liberal, Western digital democracy might look like in a world of technologically-driven competition.\"</p><p>Events as varied as the surge of coronavirus misinformation online, the cyberhacking of parliament last year and the ongoing debate about digital privacy show how the government's challenges are increasingly internet-related.</p><p>Getting the ground rules right is important because technological disruption tends to move at a faster pace than governments can, Ilves says.</p><p>Looking at the area of medical records, he asks: \"Would you want your medical records stored securely in a government-regulated system where you determine who can see your records, or have a tech company do it and sell your data to whomever wants it?\"</p><p>The culture clash between the expanding world of technology and cutbacks in governance frames the debate: \"When we look at all the evidence from the past several years we realise that we have lawmakers and politicians who do not understand technology and tech companies that couldn't care less about the law or the political consequences of what they are doing.\"</p><p>Even specific elements of technology have proven difficult. An example is algorithms, the all-important decision-making keys that social media platforms use to decide what content is served up and to whom.</p><p>Without a basic understanding of algorithms, governments struggle to understand how platforms are used to spread hate speech, conspiracy theories and financial scams.</p><p>Ilves applauds the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's plan to operate a specialist office to scrutinise the algorithms behind Facebook and Google platforms.</p><p>\"Understanding algorithms is already one of the great challenges of digital regulation and defence of human rights and privacy,\" he says. \"Anything that improves governmental expertise in the digital realm can only be positive.\"</p><p>These concerns aren't abstractions for Ilves. Born in Sweden to Estonian parents and raised in New Jersey, he learned as a young man to write computer code in the language known as Basic. He watched as computers migrated from university laboratories into living rooms and finally people's pockets.</p><p>He also worked as a journalist in Munich during the Cold War, helping provide Estonians behind the Iron Curtain with a fact-based alternative to Soviet propaganda.</p><p>After the Soviet Union collapsed and Estonia regained its independence, Ilves was instrumental in the country's adoption of computers to help it modernise.</p><p>Molly McKew, an information war analyst and adviser, says Estonia's embrace of technology has let it \"skip a bunch of phases\" of development: \"It kind of went from a left-behind, post-World War II state directly into the modern era - and it feels it.</p><p>\"You feel it with the people ??? the older generation that has struggled to catch up [and] the younger generation that's really pressing forward and integrated into Europe.\"</p><p>Estonia has also been on the frontline of the most sinister aspects of tech disruption.</p><p>In May 2007, Russian hackers directed waves of cyberattacks at Estonia for weeks, knocking websites for the government, parliament, ministries, political parties, banks and media offline.</p><p>The \"distributed denial of service\" attacks by hackers came in response to the decision to move a Soviet-era statue of a Russian soldier in Estonia's capital, Tallinn, to a less prominent spot.</p><p>The 2007 cyber attack, which some labelled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/web-war-cyberattack-russia-estonia/\">\"Web War 1\"</url>, was an unprecedented event. Estonia, a NATO member, struggled to get the alliance to believe it was occurring.</p><p>Ilves, who had become president the year before, says the daily meeting of NATO ambassadors was \"dismissive\", initally suspecting the whole thing was simply a manifestation of anti-Russian sentiment.</p><p>\"No one understood the nature of DDOS attacks and that botnets encompass much of the world, so they demanded proof the attacks came from Russia.</p><p>\"The US and the UK got it, as I recall, but otherwise we were dealing with diplomats and governments who had no clue about anything remotely related to cyber security,\" he remembers.</p><p>The attack showed that, using information in this way, a state need not \"leave home\" to attack another state and do real damage.</p><p>Since then, malign activity on the internet has only evolved. \"I have been an optimist for decades - after all, technology allowed my country to bootstrap itself out of Soviet backwardness - but I am pessimistic about our politicians' understanding of technology and the ethics of tech companies,\" Ilves says.</p><p>He sees the internet splitting into different worlds: there is the surveillance capitalism model in which \"the tech industry moves ahead in leaps and bounds off the profits of hoovering up users' data\".

According to jail officials, most of the prisoners are aged between 18 and 45 and include politicians, students, businessmen, among others. They are lodged in barracks that are separate from other sections and a common demand from them is English newspapers. Amil Bhatnagar reports.</p><p>Site decided, Govt clears mega solar project in Leh and Kargil</p><p>The decks have been cleared for a Rs 50,000 crore grid-connected solar photo-voltaic project across Leh and Kargil districts - the single biggest investment proposal in the region since Ladakh was designated as a Union Territory. A tender will be issued for selection of the project developer, who will be responsible for setting up the solar PV project.</p><p>Motor Vehicles Act: These are the states that have slashed fines</p><p>Uttarakhand became the second state after Gujarat to announce a cut in penalties for traffic violations under the new Motor Vehicles Act. Few states have adopted the Act in its entirety, while several states have put it on hold. We take a look at how the amended Act is being implemented across the country.</p><p>Editorial: Nitish vs who </p><p>The poster wars in Bihar are an early intimation of the 2020 assembly polls, and larger political trends. It is also true that in a state where parties are weakly institutionalised, politics has long been dominated by personalities anyway. Yet, the promotion of Modi, Nitish and Tejashwi by their respective parties in Bihar today is significant.</p><p>Gurpreet Singh Sandhu: The boy at the dike</p><p>Gurpreet Singh Sandhu's goalkeeping against Qatar kept India afloat against the Asian champions in the World Cup qualifier, leading the team to a goalless draw. Qatar had a go from all angles. But the 27-year-old custodian had them all covered.</p><p>What Rajya Sabha MPs earned from directorships, professions </p><p>A report has analysed the pecuniary interests declared by 213 sitting members of Rajya Sabha.

US President Donald Trump has said she is \"perhaps worse than any person (he's) ever met.\"</p><p>And finally</p><p>The UK government announced a new two-year post-study work visa for the 2020-21 intake of students to universities. A long-standing demand from Indian students, the visa will offer opportunities to work or look for work after graduating. After the two years, they can switch onto the skilled work visa if the job meets the skill requirement of the route.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0049457283</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1N-1DR1-JB5M-W325-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DEB4</classCode><className>NASH HOLDINGS LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Speaking during an on-stage interview with The Verge at Arizona's recently reported[1] annual Code Conference, the former employees expressed a similar discomfort with the present direction of their previous employers but with surprisingly divergent perspectives on how the problems should be handled. Nicole Wong, for instance, stated her concern that some lawmakers and regulators are actively looking into breaking up companies such as Google and Twitter -- where Ms. Wong previously served in a capacity as a senior leader on legal matters. </p><p>Ms. Wong indicates that the problem isn't necessarily the size of the companies but that it's past time for both regulations to be put in place and to determine what the underlying problems are at the companies. One-time Facebook product manager Antonio Garcia Martinez disagrees with regard to his own former employer. According to Mr. Martinez, the basis of justification for breaking up Facebook comes down to its 'massive economies of scale.' In effect, the company owns too much of its respective market across multiple services. Problems the company is facing, Mr. Martinez says, would be solved if it had more viable competition. Finally, ex-Google communications lead Jessica Powell does not believe Google will be swayed by pressure from external sources. Instead, regulation will be 'awkward' and worthy of criticism when it does happen, with the bulk of change coming from within the company itself via internal pushback from its diverse array of employees. Different solutions for different transgressions and responses Differences in opinions about exactly how each of the tech[2] giants should be handled seem to stem from the wide-range of circumstances that have led to each falling under the watchful eye of the U.S. government in recent months. Some of the companies in question, namely Facebook and Google, have faced growing scrutiny from governments around the world due to a variety of issues related to their handling of customer data. For Google, that's extended to its policies regarding competitors as well. Most of Google's pushback has taken the form of employee protests and revolts across a number of issues from its involvement in government-backed drone programs and China-specific search engines to its mishandling of internal employee affairs. External conflict for the search giant has come as a result of its management of Android OS and its policies regarding customer data. But it has also been the focus of attention due to problems with transparency about those policies and a lack of user control over personal data. Most of those externally-sourced issues have been or have begun to be addressed. Facebook's problems with protecting its users and against misuse by foreign governments, combined with concern about its growing influence and how ubiquitous its social media services are, have been particularly prominent. Despite repeated call-outs and promises to change, the company has continued to have an enormous assortment of problems and scandals -- with the majority of its problems beginning in the wake of its Cambridge Analytica scandal. Tying into that problem and into beliefs that the company needs to be broken up, it also serves as the parent company of several of the world's most popular social networking sites and apps. Each of those effectively overseen by a single CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who also happens to fill the roleChairman at Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook execs have been at the center of several investigations and probes into the company for more than a year. Concerns about Twitter[3], in the meantime, have been similar to those faced by Google but with a much more political bent and a mix of the issues that Facebook has faced as well. Specifically with claims that it silences users who don't agree with the company's internal culture, specifically political opponents, and that it hasn't done enough to combat those problems. The company's response has been similar to Google's too, in that the company has begun combatting the problems head-on whether through troll and bot account crackdowns on its social media service and through new policy measures. Ongoing investigations The biggest problems currently facing big tech companies from Washington[4] center around Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon. Probes have reportedly been kicked off regarding worries about possible breaches related to antitrust laws in a joint effort from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department. The FTC is expected to look into activities and policies at Amazon and Facebook, while the Justice Department will have a similar undertaking but specifically where Apple and Google are concerned. It is not unlikely that even if no new fines or criminal charges are brought against the company, the agencies will be closely examining where new regulations are needed and whether the companies should be split up. DemocraticSenator Elizabeth Warren and several other lawmakers and state-level representatives have called for just such an action to be taken. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rieMhe2jGWY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rieMhe2jGWY</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/11/18661701/facebook-google-twitter-executives-casey-newton-code-conference\">https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/11/18661701/facebook-google-twitter-executives-casey-newton-code-conference</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/tech-news\">https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/tech-news</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/09/twitter-does-not-use-political-ideology-to-make-decisions-on-content.html\">https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/09/twitter-does-not-use-political-ideology-to-make-decisions-on-content.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/06/amazon-google-alphabet-apple-facebook-antitrust-investigation.html\">https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/06/amazon-google-alphabet-apple-facebook-antitrust-investigation.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AHED1301771560373607517251764100247</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AHED-130177</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB5-M431-JCMN-Y37W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"981\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Android Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Most of these deals were completed in the last couple of years, reflecting the growth of the fintech industry in Singapore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We stumbled into it, because people started approaching us,\" he said, referring to fintech. He has at least one meeting each week with an emerging start-up in this area.</p><p>Mr Rozario, a 28-year veteran at Citi who was tapped to run Fullerton Financial in 2003, observed that banks cut their risk appetite in the post-crisis period, which gives fintechs significant elbow room to meet financing needs. \"As fintechs evolve, banks can satisfy the higher risk appetite of borrowers and investors with a collaborative approach, rather than change their risk profile to enter a new space.\"</p><p>While he declined to say which other fintechs have attracted his attention, he said one area where fintech can tackle gaps is in peer-to-peer lending.</p><p>Smaller businesses in Asia still find it tough to secure financing, and with algorithms used to create new forms of credit underwriting, peer-to-peer lenders have a fighting chance in meeting financing demand, he observed.</p><p>But the crux is for peer-to-peer lenders to stay disciplined, and to hold strong \"know-your-customer\" standards, noted Mr Rozario, whose last assignment with Citibank was a roll-out of a risk model for SME banking across 15 emerging markets.</p><p>He pointed to the recent fraud case hit by one of the peer-to-peer lenders that has taken some shine from the industry. BT had reported in April that peer-to-peer lender Capital Springboard found last year that it had sold nearly S$7 million in fake invoices to investors - with all 60 sham invoices from a single SME.</p><p>To take on the consumer finance space, Mr Rozario has rounded up investors for StashAway, a licensed robo-advisor that aims to help Singapore retail investors build their retirement nest egg.</p><p>It is estimated that Singaporeans on average keep more than 30 per cent of their money in bank accounts, compared to less than 20 per cent for Americans. This means Singaporeans are having a significant part of their purchasing power eroded by inflation at a time when they are due to live longer.</p><p>StashAway, which offers 19 exchange-traded funds to retail investors and invests according to risk profiles of clients, follows a model developed in parts of US and Europe.</p><p>The aim is to offer a low-cost option to investors planning for the long term. Mr Rozario said: \"It's been very refreshing to see a platform so focused on figuring out how to provide for customers for the long term, while using technical efficiency to reduce the costs of running such a platform.\"</p><p>Asia Capital has also pumped money into CCRManager, a fintech that focuses on the sale of trade loans on the secondary market, playing to Singapore's strength as a trade hub. \"Today, banks sell these assets among each other in a very outdated manner, in a way which I would think keeps compliance managers on the edge of their seats,\" he said. More than 40 banks have signed up with the digital platform to distribute trade assets.</p><p>Where Mr Rozario would be more cautious is in the area of payments, which has attracted some 60 per cent of venture capital funds. In his view, payments make sense only when the service goes hand-in-hand with wealth management services, with Ant Financial leading the way in this regard. \"I'm not sure that that in itself will be profitable, but it's complementing something else.\"</p><p>He noted that in time, banks would have to collaborate with fintechs to get a lift in income, with return on equity for most banks at mere low double-digit levels.</p><p>Mr Rozario, the ex-CEO of Bank Danamon in Indonesia - which is due to be controlled by Japan's MUFG in an acquisition announced late last year - also observed that there has been regulatory interference in certain areas, such as in micro-financing in parts of Asean, which has damaged business models.</p><p>He did not list examples, but it has been reported that the Indonesian government has capped lending rates at under 10 per cent.</p><p>\"Billions of users are using Big Tech products on a daily basis to run their lives. To begin to use financial products from Big Tech is not such a big jump,\" he said.</p><p>\"Banks need to make an honest assessment of their core competencies, risk appetite, culture and ability to change and innovate fast. They should defend what is most valuable to them and serve as an aggregator for other areas that will benefit their customers,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Rozario acknowledged that there may be some froth in the venture capital market, but said Asia Capital has avoided aggressive bidding, and would not spread itself too thin by taking punts. Instead, he would play the role of rainmaker, bringing in strategic investors for the funding round, and taking a seat on the board. \"Investing is not about putting chips on a table. We like to think about opportunities that make economic sense.\"</p><p>He also sees the growth of the venture capital space as a consequence of a growing wealth centre here. In good time, Singapore can attract venture capital funds for investments into the region as well.</p><p>\"We are not threatened by more supply,\" he said. \"People who have excess wealth to put some percentage of wealth into high-risk ventures should do it. (Others) put money in art, and some put it in wine.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mr Rozario says fintech can tackle gaps in peer-to-peer lending.

Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trade in digital technology and services has become a central element of international economic relations[1]. Since 2014, more than half of services traded between the EU and US are digital (Meltzer, 2014). A substantial part of this trade is associated with the transfer of data, some of it personal, some of it machine generated. Emerging technologies such as 5G and the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d, as well as growing middle classes worldwide are set to further increase digital trade. Despite this, conflicts have arisen over how to use those growing amounts of data, giving way to conflicting regulatory approaches. Calls for \u201cdata sovereignty\u201d, i.e. enhanced control of data controllers over data have increased (Otto <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>, 2016; Cory, 2017). Competition law is increasingly applied to tackle growing data-monopolies. </p><p>In addition, data protection law has become the primary mode of regulation to those segments of traded data, which can be related to individuals. To ensure that individuals remain protected in an international data economy, EU legislators have created two safeguards: The lex loci solutionis (\u201cLaw of the place where relevant performance occurs\u201d) requires any data processor to follow the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) whenever European customers\u2019 data are processed. To give additional protection to data which are transferred abroad, GDPR principles have become enshrined into international trade agreements. Preeminent examples of the latter are the EU-US Privacy Shield, or relevant parts of the recently signed EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (\u201cJefta,\u201d for Japanese-European Free Trade Agreement). All of those agreements are subjected to the GDPR. In spite of this, both mechanisms are devised to protect <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">European</emphasis> customers. Nevertheless, most globally operating digital service providers claim that they will adhere to GDPR standards globally, granting all their customers the same level of data protection. The GDPR\u2019s reach therefore seems to extend beyond the European market and its customers. By setting the standards for the largest consumer market worldwide, it pressures globally operating firms to adopt its principles for all their customers. This paper aims to explain this process, thereby also outlining potential conflicts arising from such modes of global rule making.</p><p>To date, much of the conflicts on international data protection occur across the Atlantic, between the two biggest economies and trading partners of the world. Often, those conflicts are articulated in judicial decisions, restricting the options for legislators. The EU\u2019s binding Charter of Fundamental Rights predetermines a solid frame for policy-making, with the European Court of Justice not hesitating to remind European Commission, Council and Parliament of safeguarding citizens\u2019 basic rights. The first conflicts over data protection led to trade negotiations in the 1990s, which were only seemingly resolved by the Safe-Harbour Agreement in 2000 (Whitman, 2004). The issue reemerged in the wake of the NSA revelations by Edward Snowden (Bendiek, 2014). In October 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) overturned the Commission\u2019s Safe-Harbour Agreement not adequately protecting EU citizens\u2019 right to privacy. In early February 2016, the European Union and the USA agreed to replace Safe Harbour with the EU-US Privacy Shield. Yet conflicting conceptions of privacy and data protection are not exclusive to transatlantic trade. With digital business growing globally, newer markets inevitably enter trade relations with the EU. Conflicts over data transfers with India, the Mercosur and the European neighborhood are on the horizon (European Commission, 2017).</p><p>Using the distinction between positive and negative forms of market integration as a starting point (Scharpf, 1997), this paper examines the question of how the EU is projecting its own data protection regime to third states. The so-called California effect (Vogel, 1997), as well as the utilization of trade agreements in the EU\u2019s foreign policy and external relations, are well researched. With decreasing effectiveness and limited territorial reach of its enlargement policy, the EU found trade agreements to be particularly effective to set standards on a global level (Lavenex and Schimmelfennig, 2009). The existence of the single market makes the Union not only an important <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">locus</emphasis> of regulation but also a strong economic actor with the global ambition of digital assertiveness. In the past, establishing standards for the EU\u2019s vast consumer market has proven effective in compelling non-European market participants to join.</p><p>In chapter two, after outlining the significance of international data transfers and trade for the global economy, the article proceeds by briefly describing its theoretical approach in chapter three. In chapter four, the European conception of data protection and privacy will be presented, with a particular focus on recent judicial decisions and legislative reform. Chapter five will exemplify possible conflicts arising from national or regional laws being applied to global markets by example of the GDPR and the CLOUD Act. Chapter four will summarize the findings and point out future challenges for international data transfers.</p><p>2. The growth in digital services trade</p><p>The growth of the internet has enormously expanded the importance of data transfer and the trade in services involving data protection. Today, data are transferred as a side effect of the use of digital services, for example data transfer involved in using digital insurance services. Moreover, data are not only utilized by multinationals managing decentralized production in global value chains, but are the very essence of online platforms offering services in communication, product development and, crucially, targeted advertisement (Christl, 2017; Bennett, 2012)[2].</p><p>Part of this transferred data encompass machine data, i.e. data produced by jet engines, lifts or cars, whose export thus implies data transactions in the service sector, for example, as the basis for repair and maintenance work. The rules applied to such data will shape the provision of this kind of after-sales services: retaining it will enable an exporter to conduct maintenance work as a service export. Using and analyzing the data generated and exchanged by digitally networked products, such as fridges and thermostats, on the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d requires free international exchange. Yet the term \u201cmachine data\u201d often conceals persisting personalization: although generated by machines, such data still reveal information about the individual user. Additionally, it is problematic to assume that consumers truly approve the use and processing of such a plethora of personal data only because they use the products gathering such data. In reality, consumers often lack the skills required to understand privacy mechanisms. Their interest in using the services on offer outweighs their knowledge about data protection (Hofmann and Bergemann, 2017).</p><p>In view of the rapidly growing role of IT goods and services, the USA possesses a strong interest in free international exchange of data, but so do important parts of the European economy. Digital services such as e-consulting are becoming increasingly important. They already represent more than 50 per cent of transatlantic service exports (USA 72 per cent, European Union 63 per cent) and they supply important production inputs for export goods (Meltzer, 2014). Significant sectors of industry are interested in exporting these products, as well as improving their access to imports that help them to lower their costs and improve their competitiveness. Transatlantic relations in connection with \u201ccomputer services\u201d touch on practically all commercially used personal data. According to the USA International Trade Commission (USITC), the internet reduces average trading costs by 26 per cent. Especially in developing countries, the market for digital services is set to grow considerably. Large parts of the world will join the internet using mobile devices, 54 per cent of which will be \u201csmart\u201d by 2018 (up from 21 per cent in 2013).</p><p>3. Trading up of data protection law</p><p>In European data protection law, it is the EU which has become the champion of consumers, supporting their rights even if that means confronting the big tech companies of the Silicon Valley. Already in the negotiation processes for the first common rules on data protection, which culminated in the Data Protection Directive in 1995, consumer rights were emphasized. While common rules should ease transnational data flows, they should also strengthen the individual fundamental right to privacy both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vis-\u00e0-vis</emphasis> the state and private actors (Gonz\u00e1lez Fuster, 2014). As a result, European Data Protection Law exemplifies both positive and negative forms of integration (Scharpf, 2002). It is negative, or market <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">making</emphasis>, by homogenizing the patchwork regulations which had limited intra-European data transfers prior to common legislation. It is positive, or market <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">shaping</emphasis>, by granting rights to data subjects and creating obligations for data processors.</p><p>The EU enshrined both privacy and data protection in its Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Art. 7 and Art. 8, respectively. Its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives robust individual rights to the so-called data subject. EU data protection legislation hence introduced additional rules for market actors, aiming to empower consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vis-\u00e0-vis</emphasis> producers (as well as citizens <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vis-\u00e0-vis</emphasis> the state) and weaker market participants across jurisdictions (B\u00f6rzel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>, 2003). The effects of these European regulations on the US market are stunning to many observers. \u201cIronically, many Americans are going to find themselves protected from a foreign law\u201d, said Rohit Chopra, the Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission (FTA) (Romm <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>, 2018). The EU has emerged as the most powerful regulator of Silicon Valley, \u201cstepping in where Washington has failed or simply has been unwilling \u2013 to limit some of the United States\u2019 most lucrative and politically influential companies\u201d (ibid.).</p><p>3.1 Explaining trading up</p><p>How could this happen? How to understand that the politically divided EU exerts such a strong influence on the largest digital economy of the world which hosts the most sophisticated producers of high-end technology? An important explanation for this process has been forwarded by David Vogel (1997). In \u201cTrading Up\u201d, Vogel aimed to show the beneficial effects of free trade on consumer protection, arguing that free trade will often lead to stronger and more consumer-friendly regulations. He based his claim on three arguments. First, stiffer regulations may strengthen the competitive advantage of firms, thus providing strong incentives to implement them even if they produce additional costs. Second, large import markets can set product standards unilaterally and compel outsiders to meet them if they are to benefit from exports. Finally, to the extent that markets are governed by parties that are sensitive to consumer concerns, their governments often have negotiated international agreements that foster their implementation.</p><p>Especially the two latter arguments, relating to the power of markets and the importance of international agreements, are insightful for understanding the effects of European data protection law on the US market. Following Vogel, we can observe the working of a so-called California effect. The term refers originally to the introduction of new regulations in California in the 1980s, proscribing rigid and environmentally friendly standards for car emissions. In order not to lose the (huge) Californian market, American car manufacturers were confronted with the options of either accepting the additional production costs of two different standards (one for California and one for the rest of the world) or to universalize the more rigid standards. The outcome is well known. It took the car manufacturers of the USA, and a little later of the rest of the world, little time to understand that implementing one standard, and serving one market, is cheaper than two, even if that implies adhering to higher standards overall.</p><p>The same exists today with regard to the comparatively rigid European data protection law. For global companies like Google, Facebook or Amazon, it is not an option to leave the European market. At the same time, it is an extraordinary burden to organize their business along two different sets of legal regulations. The inherent mobility of data necessitates <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de facto</emphasis> transnational regulation. For now, it is far more efficient to implement the rigid European regulations on a global scale, instead of trying to align digital markets with national borders.[3] As a result, the large providers of digital services claim to offer to the American consumer the same level of protection as they do for Europeans customers. The outcome is straight forward: although legally only aiming to safeguard EU customers who rely on foreign based services, the EU <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de facto</emphasis> extends the territorial reach of its data protection law, forcing foreign market participants to obey EU law irrespective of whether they serve EU, US or any other customers.</p><p>Yet from the EU\u2019s perspective, this indirect effect of European law on extraterritorial markets is not sufficient. Acknowledging the mobility of data and the importance of US digital service providers, the EU is additionally negotiating international agreements to ensure that EU customers\u2019 data is also protected when processed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">abroad</emphasis>, outside of its own jurisdiction. While not forcing third states to adopt EU legislation, adequacy agreements nevertheless aim to ensure that the third state\u2019s level of data protection is adequate, i.e. grants similar rights as EU law does.</p><p>3.2 Justifying external effects</p><p>This approach is not without criticism. Scholars have repeatedly warned of a regulative fragmentation, in which conflicting national legislation on the transnational policy field of internet governance may limit the internet\u2019s openness (Mueller, 2017; Reinsch, 2018). For overcoming friction in transatlantic market making, the strict application of the principle of due diligence might bridge the gap in the transatlantic digital economy. Due diligence derives its particular normative force from the idea that states are not only responsible for keeping law and order on their own territories, but also bear responsibility for the external consequences of internal regulations (Bendiek, 2014). As we have seen, decisions taken by individual states increasingly have an impact beyond their national territory. That is why the principle claims that states must exercise care with such decisions and be accountable to one another for them. As far as the internet is concerned, states in cooperation with other states are obliged to do everything that may be reasonably expected of them to help deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d.</p><p>Due diligence is an important principle in all matters relating to international relations. It safeguards that states do not violate their mutual interests but treat each other respectfully. It is doubtful, however, whether the principle pays sufficient attention to the asymmetrical character of global market making and its direct effect on individual citizens. The global polity has a striking imbalance between well-organized capital interests, on the one hand, and diffuse consumer interests on the other (Olson, 2003). Market-making follows the path of negative integration (Scharpf, 2002) and has become largely disembodied from political control and ambitious social standards (Ruggie, 1982). The interests of consumers are therefore easily neglected and, in the absence of unilateral state interventions, more often than not subject to a regulatory race to the bottom (Delaware-effects). The alternative to EU external effects is thus not democracy or any other form of good governance but the dominance of market processes and disrespect for consumer concerns. Justifying the EU\u2019s external effects is thus coterminous with defending the right of global consumers to digital services that live up to the best standards of privacy and protection. This paper describes the process of externalizing EU governance by showing why and how the EU disseminates its data protection principles in the global digital economy. To this end, official trade agreements, key legislative acts and judicial decisions tackling the issues of data sovereignty, data protection and data transfers will be analyzed.</p><p>4. The European conception of data protection</p><p>After the OECD issued its non-binding Privacy Guidelines in 1980, the Council of Europe adopted the first legally binding Convention on Data Protection in 1981. In the following years, datafication increased, and European policy makers acknowledged the needs for regulating data protection at EU level. By the early 1990s, Parliament and Commission began to negotiate the Data Protection Directive. While Parliament stressed the fundamental rights dimension of data protection, the Commission focused on the market making function, which common data laws would have (Gonz\u00e1lez Fuster, 2014). The Directive was adopted in 1995, displaying both the positive and negative dimensions of data protection, aiming \u201cto protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data\u201d as well as to ensure the \u201cfree flow of personal data between Member States\u201d. A Directive on privacy and electronic communications (ePrivacy Directive) followed in 2002, supplemented in 2009 with a cookie law to protect personal data generated in the form of cookies when using the internet.</p><p>Apart from legislation, privacy rights were further strengthened by the ECJ. Following Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the extent of NSA surveillance, the Facebook critic Maximilian Schrems took the Irish data protection authority to court in June 2013, challenging the authorities\u2019 claim that his data was sufficiently safeguarded by Facebook. In April 2014, the ECJ ruled general data retention unlawful, contradicting EU secondary legislation which had required all member states to pass data retention laws (C-203/15 and C-698/). In May 2014, the ECJ formulated the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in another judgement (C-131/12), stating that search engines must adhere to data protection law and cannot fall back on American law, even if the parent company is headquartered in the USA and its data are processed there. Following the decision, EU citizens now have the right to demand for the search engines to delete their personal information. The ECJ\u2019s Safe Harbour ruling (C-362/14) of October 2015 supported Schrem\u2019s view and demanded a reformation of the transatlantic data transfer agreement Safe Harbour, to ensure sufficient protection of EU customers\u2019 privacy as a fundamental right (Carrera and Guild, 2015). In mid-December 2015, three years after the Commission had published its initial draft law, the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission passed the GDPR, in co-decision, leaving a two-year implementation phase before it entered into force in May 2018. The Regulation applies to all processors of personal data, both public and private. Yet there are exceptions: In certain particularly sensitive areas such as education or health, member states can draw data localization laws, in order to avoid sensitive data being transferred abroad. In addition, the police and judicial system is excluded, and is covered by its own new data protection directive, which was negotiated simultaneously. The GDPR was meant to be accompanied by the e-Privacy Regulation, which would offer the same safeguards to all forms of electronic communication. However, conflicts over how to regulate online tracking technologies have delayed the legislative process \u2013 by now it seems unlikely to pass Council and Parliament before the European Parliament\u2019s election in May 2019.</p><p>Both European legislative and judicial developments in recent years have hence strengthened an inherently positive <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis> negative conception of data protection. Data transfers are seen as crucial to revive the slowing European economy. Moreover, the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection are increasingly understood as vital for liberty and democracy (Bennett, 2012). In liberal societies, the argument goes, the right to privacy is constitutive, for without privacy there can be no liberty. Although in the US privacy and civil liberties are closely related too, USA data protection and privacy laws have a different focus. In the USA, the focus is not on the protection of human dignity, but on freedom in the sense of liberty as a civil right of the individual, who wishes to be \u201cfree of legal regulations\u201d (Bendiek <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>, 2015).</p><p>4.1 The general data protection regulation</p><p>The GDPR brings for the first time harmonized, directly binding data protection law throughout the European Union and is intended to avoid member states competing to offer the weakest protections. \u201cEuropean law on European soil\u201d is the Commission\u2019s motto. The GDPR keeps many of the cornerstones in European data protection law, including the requirement to obtain users\u2019 explicit consent if personal data is collected, the limitation to use the data only for predetermined purposes and the principle to collect as little data as possible. Users\u2019 rights to have stored information deleted (the right to be forgotten) and to take their data from one provider to the next (portability) are also enshrined in the GDPR. Data subjects will further gain the right to object to automated decision making. Companies will have to supply products with data-protection-friendly default settings (privacy by design and by default). New data protection and security requirements will promote IT products whose technological configuration facilitates the protection of private data. Additionally, data controllers will have to prove that they undertake appropriate safeguards by conducting data protection impact assessments (DPIA) and recording their use of personal data. Many of those principles have not yet been put into practice and are heavily contested. Their ultimate implementation will be a result of negotiations between supervisory authorities, legal scholars and data processors, many of which will ultimately be decided in court.</p><p>Certain aspects of the GDPR have attracted criticism. In the European Union, data processing is tied to a defined purpose that limits its application, a principle unknown in the USA. The proposed limitations fundamentally contradict the business logic of online platforms like Facebook and Amazon, since big data applications systematically subvert the concept. Big data\u2019s basic logic is to gather and analyze enormous quantities of data and then to use it for many different purposes, rather than repeatedly for the same purpose. In fact, it is frequently statistical analysis of big data that generates new possibilities for using personal data in the first place. Big data technologies further endanger pseudonymization and anonymization processes, since individuals can often be re-identified by analyzing and triangulating enough data (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Cukier, 2013). Also the GDPR\u2019s segments on automated decision making, often discussed as \u201calgorithmic\u201d or \u201crobotic\u201d decision making received heated debate, with critics both arguing it would stifle innovation or curb individual freedoms. Many still put hope into DPIAs as a process oriented solution, which could provide enough flexibility to reconcile rapid technological change with static regulatory principles.</p><p>Independent national data protection authorities will be crucial for the successful implementation of the GDPR. They are fulfilling an increasingly important regulatory and complaint-handling role, monitoring how personal data is used in the information society and imposing sanctions as necessary. Firms from third states which operate within the EU\u2019s market will also have to obey the new European rules, with violations subject to fines of up to 4 per cent of annual turnover or 20 million euro \u2013 whichever is higher. The ECJ has emphasized the need for \u201ccomplete independence\u201d of data protection authorities in order to ensure effective protection of the data subject\u2019s rights (518/07). Through consistency and cooperation mechanisms, companies will be addressed by a single lead authority and consumers wishing to lodge complaints against providers in other EU member-states will be able to do so in their own language through the relevant agency in their own country. Through their European forum, the European Data Protection Board, which gathers authorities\u2019 representatives from all 28 member states, data protection authorities will gain considerable powers. Acting with a simple majority, the EDPB can issue decisions on landmark cases and settle conflicts on data protection principles.</p><p>For international data transfers, two elements of the GDPR are especially important: its territorial scope and its requirements for adequacy clauses. Regarding the GDPR\u2019s territorial scope, the legislators aimed to account for the international character of many digital services. To ensure that European customers would also be protected when using services from companies abroad, the GDPR covers all processing of personal data within EU borders, as well as all processing of EU customers\u2019 data abroad, if the company directly targeted or advertised to customers residing in the EU. This extended territorial scope has attracted criticism, especially for the enforcement problems it creates (Kuner, 2015).</p><p>The GDPR additionally re-orders the mechanism for international data transfers. Carrying the exclusive competence for external trade, also under the GDPR, the Commission is responsible to negotiate adequacy agreements. Apart of binding corporate rules, adequacy agreements are the EU\u2019s principal way to formulate rules on international data flows. Adequacy agreements allow transfers of personal data to third countries, if the country\u2019s level of data protection is equivalent to the EU\u2019s. Already under the Data Protection Directive from 1995, adequacy agreements existed, albeit mostly focusing on the adequacy of the third state\u2019s legal provisions (Bennett, 2012). Under the GDPR, and as a consequence of the ECJ\u2019s \u201cSchrems\u201d decision, adequacy agreements include both the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de jure</emphasis> as well as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de facto</emphasis> dimensions, meaning that also the regulatory oversight over the third state\u2019s data protection and privacy laws must be taken into account. Under the GDPR, the Commission must consult the European Data Protection Board when concluding an adequacy agreement, opening the EDPB a chance to demand the creation of similar oversight structures as they exist in the EU. Every four years, the Commission must reevaluate the agreements, ensuring that protection levels have remained adequate. An adequacy finding also serves as the basis for transatlantic arrangements such as the EU\u2013USA Privacy Shield.</p><p>4.2 Trade agreements and data protection</p><p>International agreements on data trade are not exclusively covered by EU initiatives. Trade in services is regulated by the WTO\u2019s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of 1995, while a separate Information Technology Agreement abolishes tariffs on listed IT products (Schmieg and Bendiek, 2016). GATS involves general duties: All trading partners must be treated equally, transparency standards must be implemented and service providers must be granted the same treatment as their domestic counterparts. The liberalization duties of individual WTO members are listed in so-called schedules (Schmieg and Bendiek, 2016). GATS distinguishes four modes of supply of trade in services. Although numerous electronic services did not yet exist when GATS came into force, many are nonetheless covered by the GATS classification. Certain services can be provided both digitally and by other methods.</p><p>Many aspects of trade in digital services touch on questions of data protection in dimensions that were inconceivable when the GATS was drawn up in 1995. Today, the coordination of the various national data storage regimes is rudimentary or non-existent, and their relationship to international trade law is unclarified. The exceptions laid out in GATS form the legal basis for data protection rules. GATS Article III permits parties to keep information confidential in specific circumstances such as public interest, while GATS Article XIV (General Exceptions) underlines the right of parties to adopt and enforce laws and regulations. This also applies to the protection of privacy in relation to the processing and dissemination of personal data. The GATS Annex on Financial Services, section 2 (Domestic Regulation) specifies that parties are under no obligation to reveal information relating to individuals\u2019 business bank and accounts, or to confidential and other information in the possession of public entities. GATS created the basis for a further liberalization of trade in services, which was originally to take place at the multilateral level. However, not all the parties were interested in further opening their service sectors. Currently, as a result, only plurilateral talks on a Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) are being conducted under the auspices of the WTO. The European Union is negotiating on new principles for domestic regulation of ICT services (including cross-border data transfers), electronic commerce and computer-related services.</p><p>In relation to data protection, the European Commission emphasizes that TiSA will contain the same safeguards as GATS. At the same time, it argues that the data transfer rules discussed for TiSA are inspired by similar provisions in existing free trade agreements, for example with South Korea. Article 7.43 of the latter agreement explicitly states that both parties should develop appropriate privacy protection rules, especially in relation to the transfer of personal data. As such, the South Korea FTA goes further than previous exceptions, regarding the proposed rules not as possible exemptions from free trade, but stressing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the need to develop adequate safeguards in the first place</emphasis>. However, critics fear that the USA has already asserted its own diverging interests in the TiSA talks, and that TiSA will provide for free data transfer between its signatories.</p><p>4.3 Safe harbour, privacy shield and other \u201cadequacy agreements\u201d</p><p>The Safe-Harbour Agreement was adopted in 2000. It was designed to ensure that US companies give adequate protection to European users\u2019 privacy when they process their data stateside (Monteleone, and Puccio, 2017). De facto, although not de jure, this was a decision by the Commission, in which it classified companies that agreed to observe particular data protection standards and submit to controls by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as safe harbors. The former FTC Commissioner Julie Brill pointed out that in the fifteen years of its existence just four reports of violations had been received from European data protection authorities, while altogether 4,400 US companies had registered on the basis of the agreement. During the same period, she said, the FTC had investigated numerous violations and initiated legal action in 39 cases, including against Facebook. However, critics point out that the small number of legally relevant cases could also imply Safe Harbour\u2019s weak effectiveness because it complicates complaints for affected individuals.</p><p>In October 2015, the ECJ ruled Safe Harbor invalid. The Court based its verdict on the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights. Data protection, the verdict read, was a fundamental right enabling the superior right of privacy. Consequently, the verdict underlined the crucial role of national data protection authorities, their independence, and their right to assess and intervene in international data transfers (Carrera and Guild, 2015). The Court singled out US government access to European users\u2019 data for particular criticism.</p><p>Following the decision and under pressure of the European forum of national data protection authorities, the European Union and the USA agreed to a new arrangement for data exchange: the EU-US Privacy Shield. Under the agreement, the US Department of Commerce will monitor US companies processing data from Europe. In other words, the US side agreed to regulation conducted by its own authorities. The two partners will review the agreement\u2019s implementation annually. Anyone who believes their data privacy rights have been violated on account of US national security interests will be able to turn to an ombudsman operating independently of the US security agencies. In case of conflict, there will be a free mediation process. Such relatively complicated and ineffective enforcement and oversight will produce legal insecurity in the medium term.</p><p>In addition to the EU\u2013US privacy shield, the EU has adequacy agreements with Andorra, Argentina, Canada (restricted to commercial organizations), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay. Within the negotiations over JEFTA, also Japan will soon be included in this list, with South Korea being the most likely follow up (European Commission, 2018c, 2018b). Current negotiations over a free trade agreement with Indonesia have further shown that the Commission will ultimately put data protection above the free flow of data, arguing that as a fundamental right, it is \u201cnot negotiable\u201d (European Commission, 2018a).</p><p>5. Conclusions</p><p>Data protection is today one of the most important policy fields for states to reassure their sovereignty online. The EU has become a major player in this area. It has one of the biggest consumer markets worldwide and is self-confidently using its policy-leverage for promoting its citizens\u2019 and consumers\u2019 desire for privacy and data protection, even if that conflicts with the interests of its trading partners. The conflict between Europe and the US on this issue is symptomatic, in that it merged questions of trade, regulatory oversight and fundamental rights. Different conceptions of privacy and conflicting interests in trade and regulatory affairs will persist, not only across the Atlantic, but in all international digital trade relations.</p><p>Most of the current debate takes place on the transatlantic level. Yet, frictions over the matter of international data transfers are likely to increase globally. Once more, businesses from emerging economies aim to serve European customers. To date, most transnational digital business activities take place between established democracies. Although differences in the conceptions of data protection and privacy exist, those states understand the importance of both in principle \u2013 and have developed certain safeguards for data subjects. To acknowledge privacy rights of data subjects will remain a fundamental precondition for anyone operating in the European market, as will appropriate oversight bodies. Either way, with digital markets expanding in territorial scope, international norms of data protection will have to be developed. The existing patchwork of agreements does not answer the question of how to reconcile free data flows with the fundamental right to privacy exhaustively. However, it is opening the door for future legal integration.</p><p>The need for international agreements and oversight bodies to avoid regulatory fragmentation and to increase regulatory effectiveness will rise. With data protection becoming ever more relevant for all digital matters, it may learn a lesson from internet governance, become more transnational and include more stakeholders. The European system is well equipped to become a role model in this regard, since data protection authorities already cooperate closely with companies in order to support an efficient implementation process.</p><p>With its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU may have defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data being stored and evaluated according to US law. However, it has also set an influential precedent of extra-territorial applicability of its legislation \u2013 despite having previously criticized the US for such practices. By now, international companies increasingly store data of European customers in Europe to prevent conflicts with EU law. With this decision, the EU will apply its own law on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Conflicts created through the extra-territorial effects of national law may contradict the principle of due diligence obligations but are nevertheless not illegitimate. They may, however, have further unintended effects. Other major economies are likely to be less reluctant in the future about passing legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This could result in a collision course for different national legal systems, which would encourage the fragmentation of the global economic space and the Internet. The Privacy Shield and the transatlantic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are therefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process.</p><p>Indeed, conflicts over data flows have also emerged in other policy areas: When in 2013 Microsoft denied the FBI access to communication data stored in Ireland, a year long legal battle followed, in which the US Software giant was caught between conflicting legislations, ultimately arguing that it saw no legal obligation to forward data stored on foreign soil to US services. The conflict was only settled in 2018, when the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act or CLOUD Act was pushed through Congress without a parliamentary hearing, giving US investigators worldwide access to servers owned by US companies. The CLOUD Act also expressly stipulates that the USA must enter into government agreements with foreign states that allow foreign investigative authorities access to data stored by US companies. In return, US investigators will also have access to data stored in the respective country. Yet by only allowing for bilateral agreements with national governments, the CLOUD Act circumvents the EU as a possible contracting party. The EU, as well as its member states however prefer to find an agreement between the EU and the US.</p><p>The CLOUD Act hence demonstrates similar complexities and possible conflicts surrounding unilateral legislation as the GDPR does. While both contain passages stipulating the creation of international agreements and contracts, they simultaneously aim for extraterritorial and even global reach. While their goals \u2013 privacy protection and effective law enforcement \u2013 are fully legitimate, they open the gate for future conflicts on the regulation of the digital economy. Legislators are well advised to pay more attention to the due-diligence norm when unilaterally drafting rules for the digital economy. Due diligence stresses the cooperative, inclusive and transparent global character of good international governance, without concealing their domestic foundations. It should be considered to be the lowest common denominator in international relations and seems to be a suitable approach for transnational data flows.</p><p>Notes</p><p>1.Parts of this article are based on SWP comments, published as Bendiek, A. and Schmieg, E.

Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  We're watching earnings.  ExxonMobil just hitting the tape right now.  Two Dow components in fact reporting this hour.  Oil giant, ExxonMobil is hitting the tape right now with $63.63 billion dollars in revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chevron is coming out later this hour.  As you can see, both stocks are fractionally better on the session.  ExxonMobil pretty much flat.  Chevron up two-thirds of a percent ahead of this.  ExxonMobil shares are trading down right now as we are looking at some disappointment on these numbers as they just right now hit the tape.  Revenue is $63.63 billion.  We want to find out what the company is saying about the road ahead.</p><p>The stock has now traded lower, going into these numbers as the numbers are hitting the tape, and as you can see, we are showing you revenue is light versus the estimate which was $64.8 billion in revenue.  And the actual numbers are 63.6 billion.  So we got a slight miss on revenue for ExxonMobil.  That's a Dow component that's going to impact markets this morning.  The stock down 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>We are also waiting on GDP.  This is the first reading of the first quarter.  The estimate there is growth of two percent although there is a lot higher numbers on the street.  J.P. Morgan is looking for 2.9 percent in GDP.  Others are around 2.3 percent but the estimates that we've got for GDP for the first quarter is two percent even.  Those numbers out in 30 minutes time.  As you can see, futures are lower this morning.</p><p>Dow futures indicating a decline of 75 points right out of the gate, about a quarter of a percent lower.  Exxon is going to be an issue here.  S&amp;P 500 down five points down five points right now and the NASDAQ down almost a point, fractional move.  Intel is set to cut 28 points off the Dow Industrials at the opening of trading.  So Intel is also an issue when you look at Intel and ExxonMobil looks like we're going to have a down opening this morning.</p><p>Yesterday markets were pretty active.  And take a look what happened at the close.  DowIndustrials were down 135 points at the close yesterday.  As you can see, one-half of one percent.  S&amp;P 500 down one point, the NASDAQ was up -- the NASDAQ was up 16 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>European indices right now looking like this and they are mostly lower.  FT-100 down20 points, CAC quarante in Paris is down one point and the DAX Index also slipping its negative territory right now down about a point as you can see.  And in Asia overnight, the markets there were focused on the Japanese industrial production.  It was down at the fastest pace in almost four years.  The Nikkei Average down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite was down 1-1/4 percent.  Xi Jinping made some comments that it is willing to make some real concessions to the United States including protecting I.P.  The President of China made some important comments overnight about the Chinese economy and what they're going to do.  We've got all of those comments coming up.  And then there's this.  The Uber IPO offering 180 million shares.</p><p>The company says it will price between $44 and $50 a share.  The company will start its road show today.  Border crisis.  At least 1300 immigrants staged a mass escape from a Mexican shelter.  What the Pentagon is looking to do about the growing problem of people crossing the border into the United States.  And then there's this.  2020 race, we're covering this morning.  Former Vice President Joe Biden said he asked former President Obama not to endorse him.</p><p>Yes.  He did not want the endorsement.  President Trump says, Sleepy Joe will not be able to do the job.  He calls him not the brightest light bulb in the group.  The President has started the attacks on what could did his competitor come next year's election, Joe Biden.  Breaking news right now.  Exxon is reporting its first quarter earnings.  We told you the numbers and it is a revenue missed Lauren Simonetti with more on the Exxon quarter.  Lauren, over to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Yes.  And Exxon, Maria, as you know is one of the two Dow stocks that our energy components reporting today at -- with the two, three percent decline in the stock to three percent decline that we're seeing right now.  This is set to shave about 13 points from the Dow Jones Industrial average.  But just so you know, if you add Exxon and Chevron together, this is just about five percent price weighting.</p><p>Let's get to these Exxon numbers because they are disappointing.  If you look at the bottom line, the EPS number, we got 55 cents a share, we were looking for 69 cents and we're seeing a miss on revenue as well.  It came in a $63.63 billion.  The street was looking for 64.82.  If you look deeper into this report, there is also a slight miss on the amount of oil that Exxon was hoping to pump per day.</p><p>They were looking at a number of four million barrels per day.  That came in slightly below that at 3.98 million.  Look ahead to this conference call.  It's rare but we will once again hear from the CEO Darren Woods on that call.  The focus on Wall Street we heard a few days ago that deeper into this report, there is also a slight miss on the amount of oil that Exxon was upping their dividend to 87 cents.</p><p>That was about a six percent increase.  Wall Street and analyst want to see more share buybacks, increasing of dividends and basically to get the debt down for these oil giants, Exxon being one of them.  So, unfortunately this looks like loser today.  It's coming back a little bit.  The stock right now but still down well over two percent, Maria.  Chevron is coming out in about a half hour time.</p><p>Let me just get you the preview for that company.  We're looking for $1.30 per share in earnings.  Revenue of $38.42 billion.  And of course with the Chevron story, we want to hear any and everything and if there will be a bidding war with Occidental who has a higher bid for Anadarko at this point.  So, that stock ahead of the earnings for Chevron is down just about half of one percent.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thanks so much.  The stock of Exxon, one of the issues for the Dow certainly day down almost three percent.  We are waiting on GDP.  We want lock the at Trump economy right now.  President Trump touted tax cuts and economic accomplishments in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.  We have gotten rid of the individual mandate.  We had the biggest cut in regulations which is one of the things creating all great jobs because we have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had.  Today we have most people working literally today just came out we have the most people working, than we've ever had in the history of our country almost 160 million people are working to have jobs.</p><p>And it is incredible the economy is setting records.  When foreign leaders come in to see me, Sean, they always say, thank you and it's great to meet you, sir, and congratulations on your economy.  It's the greatest economy anywhere in the world which it is, nobody is even close to us.  And that's because of the things we've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This as we are waiting on the first quarter GDP this morning.  It is due out in about 25 minutes.  Joining me right now is Harvard economics professor, former IMF Chief Economist, Ken Rogoff.  Ken, it is always good to see you.</p><p>KEN ROGOFF, HARVARD ECONOMICS PROFSSOR:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  How would you characterize the economy right now?</p><p>ROGOFF:  It is very strong.  I mean, the U.S. economy is on oasis of strength outside of China anywhere in the world, it's doing very well.  I mean, it's not growing at six percent, but we're probably growing at 2-1/2 percent and I think it is possible we could be growing at three percent in coming years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, we're getting the GDP out for the first quarter.  We had a government shutdown, we had worries about Europe, worries about China in the first quarter.  What would you say about things slowing down as a result of some of the outside forces that the U.S. is facing like Europe?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, it hasn't happened.  I think we talked about that when I came on last and we were wondering, you know, you were wondering if it would come here but it hasn't.  Europe has picked up a little China, it's definitely stabilized but it hasn't hit us.  Now, you can't read that much into one quarter's numbers and stuff like inventory accumulation.  People might over rushed imports ahead of something, there goes the shutdown.</p><p>I don't know what it's going to be.  I'd say between two and 2-1/2.  But it isn't anything like some of the predictions that we were hearing a month ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It can, everybody's hair was on fire six months, recession is coming and we just keep getting one number better than the next every day.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Yes.  The global economy is stable.  I think even compared to a couple weeks ago when I was at the IMF meetings, the global economy is looking more stable.  I mean, China is a declining trend.  Europe may look like Japan over the next 10 or 20 years.  But the United States seems to be rising above that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me ask you about the op-ed that you wrote.  You wrote an op-ed this morning on big tech going into 2020 and the presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, her plan to reign big tech.  Your write this, Warren is courageous because big tech is big money for most leading Democratic candidates.  Particularly progressives for whom California is a variable campaign financing ATM.</p><p>And although one can certainly object, Warren is not alone in thinking that tech giants have gained excessive market dominance.  In fact it is one of the few issue in Washington on which there is some semblance of agreement and you're right because you got Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both saying two different sides of the spectrum, both saying, get these companies to break up.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, I don't know what the solution is but it isn't just big tech, it's big everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Big pharma.  The rise in monopoly power or something that's really started to sees economist a little last couple years.  The Fed had its Jackson Hole big central bankers conference about that last year.  The antitrust has been asleep the last 40 years.  Forget about the last years.  And big tech is kind of the poster child of this but they're not the only one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you know what, it's not just bigness for the tech companies.  I mean, they've actually abused their power.  When you take a look at how they've given, you know, all the privacy breaches, just given our data away, selling it to the advertising industry.  So, do you think we're going to see a heavier hand in terms of regulation?  You know what Europe has done.  I don't think the U.S. is going to see -- do what Europe has done.</p><p>They're really come down hard on these companies but will we see some tweaking in terms of the regulatory burdens?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Oh, absolutely.  I have heard this phrase surveillance capitalism that we've moved into.  I think as people understand when you write, you know, an e-mail, if you may see an advertisement about it later.  If you do it on your Gmail, I mean, there are concerns like that that are coming out.  But the idea that some of the big tech companies would be able to buy up potential competitors I think is very problematic and they haven't been cautious on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I -- you know, it's interesting because you know, we know this is coming, it's got to come, right?  And yet, these stocks are trading at incredible valuations.  So, I wonder what they think.</p><p>ROGOFF:  So, one thing is that the United States is just ruling in tech.  I was recently in China and you think about, oh, the China is going to take over.  Well, they are competitors.  I think the thing I learned more and more is Europe is not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROGOFF:  United States --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- one innovation out that's come of Europe in the last 10 years.</p><p>ROGOFF:  I -- you're putting me on the spot --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGOFF:  The research was probably done in the United States.  I mean, they have a lot of patents but then you find out the research teams are here in the United States.  So the U.S. is really leading the world in a lot of things and that I think is one of our sources of strength.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there is worry that China is ahead of us on A.I.?</p><p>ROGOFF:  They are.  And it was interesting President Xi made some concessions about trade and all things they would do but I didn't hear anything about cyberspying or cybersecurity.  I don't -- I don't think they will invent anything in A.I. that we didn't invent first and they steal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see.  And by the way, President Xi Jinping on the tape this morning with comments he made yesterday that they're going to start protecting intellectual property.  They're going to buy more and they're going to -- from the U.S. and they're going to open up their markets.  So, obviously the President's, you know, pushing back on China is moving the needle in terms of what the Chinese are willing to do.</p><p>ROGOFF:  This was remarkable because, you know, everyone said the Chinese, they will move but they will not move because the U.S. is complaining.  You let us do it if you push us, we won't do anything.  And, you know, he didn't mention cyberspying but he talked about intellectual property.  They event went to a currency agreement which I frankly don't think is a good idea.  I think it's a bad concession but even to that, it was -- yes, really quite remarkable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Remarkable what Xi Jinping said last night, right?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Yes.  Absolutely, absolutely.  I mean, I don't know if he will do what he said he is going to do but that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the thing.  That's why they're fighting over an enforcement mechanism.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, that is not going to happen in a good way.  But the fact he said it is already really surprising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I totally agree.  Now, you made comments recently on the Federal Reserve suggesting that the world may be facing an end to central bank independence.  What do you think?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, I mean, certainly you look around at smaller countries, you know, Turkey, Hungary, Venezuela, Argentina, there have been a lot of problems with central bank independents.  But I think the fundamental problem is a lot of people, you talk to people and they say, inflation, that's 20th century.  You can't have inflation in the 21st Century.  Why do we need an independent central bank on?  I think they've got that so wrong.  Unfortunately in some countries I hope not ours will find out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  You're to be my special guest this weekends, Ken, and I'm -- I appreciate you joining me this weekend on \"MARIA BARTIROMO'S WALL STREET\", THAT'S tonight AT 9:00 p.m. Eastern.  Join myself and Ken Rogoff for that.  We will see you little later.  Thank you, Ken.</p><p>Coming up, the advance reading on first quarter GDP is due out in about 15 minutes' time.  We are expecting two percent growth for the quarter.  This is the first reading for the first quarter.  We'll have that number when we come right back.  And then earnings in focus.  Disappointing results from oil giant ExxonMobil.  Stock is down 2-1/3 percent right now.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Dow component, ExxonMobil disappointing on earnings this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more details.  Gerri, good morning.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey Maria, good morning to you.  Yes.  We have a double disappointment, a miss on the bottom and top lines, 55 cents a share was earnings expectations of 69 cents a share on revenue.  $63.36 billion was the number expectations of 64.82 billion.</p><p>Crude prices strengthening during the quarter.  The company said but weaker in the fourth quarter.  We're watching for Chevron in moments. $1.30 a share is the expectation.  Will they up their offer for Anadarko, we'll be watching for that.  American Airlines beating APS estimates coming at 52 cents a share versus 51.  Missing estimates on revenue.  They say that their results affected by higher oil prices in the government shutdown.</p><p>Amazon last night, profit more than doubles but people didn't like the revenue growth slowing, sluggish on line retails blamed here.  One day free shipping for prime members, that's my good news story for you today.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  The advance reading on first quarter GDP due out in 10 minutes' time.  We're expecting growth of two percent for the quarter.  We'll have that number when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- 20 in focus, President Trump weighing in on the 2020 Democratic primary candidates last night on \"HANNITY.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that, you know, when you look at Joe, I've known Joe over the years.  He's not the brightest light bulb in the group, I don't think but he has a name that they know.  He is fading very fast.  I think he is fading very, very fast.  It looks like he is going to be a thing in the past pretty soon but he was -- he was a hot item for a little while.  Well, I don't -- I don't see either of them.</p><p>I think she is got a little bit of a nasty wit but that might be it.  And Mayor Pete is not going to make it.  I would hope he would.  I hope --I'm rooting for him but he's not going to make.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former House Speaker, Fox News Contributor, author of the new book, the political thriller, Collusion, just out by Newt Gingrich.  Newt, it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the new book.  First, let's talk about the President's assessment --</p><p>GINGRICH:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you agree with what he just said?</p><p>GINGRICH:  Oh pretty much.  So I think the problem that Vice President Biden has that he has a past.  My newsletter today talks about the Kate Smith statute being taken down in Philadelphia from the flyers arena.  Because out of 3,000 songs she recorded in her career, in 1931 recorded two songs that had what are seen as racist language and, therefore, she is no longer acceptable even though she introduced America to the song God Bless America and became a national icon.</p><p>Now, he is going to find himself in the Kate Smith statute problem.  Anita Hill repudiates his effort to apologize, he has yet to be encountered on the fact that he used to support amendments with Jesse Helms to stop bussing for desegregation purposes.  You go back ahead a long career.  And you deal with the modern left-wing Democrats, they have zero tolerance for anybody who is imperfect and he is by definition going to turn out pretty imperfect.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, we want to turn to the Russia investigation, Newt, we've got new techs messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.  They show that the two were discussing using post-election briefings to the Trump team to gain more information on the campaigns dealings with Russia.  Senate Homeland Security Committee members urged Attorney General Barr to investigate this matter.</p><p>Look, Mr. Speaker we know for the last two years you've heard it here first, that there was no collusion and this whole narrative was a complete lie.  Do you think there's going to be accountability here?</p><p>GINGRICH:  I hope so.  I have a lot of faith in the Attorney General Barr.  I think he believes in the rule of law.  We had an amazing level of corruption.  I think the President is right.  It was in effect and attempted coup to defeat the duly elected president of the United States on the part of the deep state.  And you had FBI bureaucrats who talking upon themselves to try to reverse the results of the election.</p><p>And I think that clearly had the fingerprints, just talking right back to Joe Biden by the way because you had the Attorney General doing things that he should not have been doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH:  You know, you have to presume that Vice President and President Obama knew it and then you ask the question, so did Joe Biden know any of this?  I mean, was he in the loop?  Was he aware of what's going on?  I don't think this is going to go away.  I think now it's going to get worse for the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  What did Biden know.  Tom, you've written about this obviously in RealClearPolitics and we want to know how high up the ladder this was in the Obama administration because the strategy to take Trump down was so -- I mean, it was just so wide ranging from informants to the dossier, to MediaLink strategy.  It's incredible.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, REALCLEARPOLITICS, COFOUNDER AND PRESIDENT:  It is.  And I do think we will get accountability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do?</p><p>BEVAN:  I do.  We may not get it as quickly as we want because -- but I do think there is going to be accountability.  We will find out exactly how this happened.  I think Republicans, Lindsey Graham in the Senate in particular will be able to drive the process to try to and uncover as much get -- and as much transparency.  We deserve this transparency.  The American people deserve it especially after what we just went through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it was two years, Newt, of this, you know, collusion delusion where the whole country is going on this goose chase because people like, you know, John -- people like Brennan and Clapper are using words like treason and collusion.</p><p>GINGRICH:  Right.  I mean, look -- I mean, look, I think there are so many people guilty trying of trying to undermine the U.S. constitution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH:  This has to be thoroughly looked at.  But let me also point out that Mueller at some point had to know there was no collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I wonder when he knew it that he let the midterm elections come and go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right?  He let the midterm elections come and go.</p><p>GINGRICH:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All about this in Newt's new book, Collusion.  Newt Gingrich, great to see you, sir. I want to get to a break because we got the GDP on the other side of this break.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 26th.  We're waiting on breaking news right now.  The advanced reading on first quarter GDP due out in about 10 seconds.  Economists are looking for growth of at least two percent.  The estimates go all the way up to 2.9 percent if you believe J.P. Morgan.  We're also waiting on earnings, Dow Component Chevron is 3.2.  3.2 percent is the number on GDP this morning.  That is a very strong number for the first quarter advanced.</p><p>Let's look at markets to see if we have any changes here because you're looking at oil stocks.  We're waiting on Chevron earnings but the market is coming back from the lows here with this GDP number out, up 3.2 percent, much better than the estimates which calls for growth of two percent, all the way to 2.9 percent.  This is a very strong number for the first quarter and of course remember we had a government shutdown, we had worries about slow growth, and coming off of a very volatile end of year last year with markets trading real volatile and down at the end last year.  First quarter GDP, bouncing back up 3.2 percent, is the number and that is moving markets this morning.  Take a look at futures now, all in positive territory across the board.  Dow Industrials up nine points, S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/4 and the NASDAQ up 33 points with this first quarter GDP number, which is above expectations.</p><p>Intel and Exxon are pressures on the Dow Industrials, however.  We are expecting Exxon and Intel to be lower on the heels of disappointments on earnings.  Joining us right now for reaction on the GDP number is MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy.  Stephanie, great to see you.  And the last time you were here, you said we're going to start seeing good shoots, green shoots.</p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Positive news in the economy.  Is this what you were referring to?</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, this first quarter number, though, is a real surprise.  I mean I was thinking that we would start to see stronger numbers as we got into the second quarter the fact that first quarter growth was so much stronger than expected is amazing.  I -- you know, I was prepared to talk about how inventories were going to be a contribution to the number and that would be part of what was driving it up, but I wasn't expecting a three handle on this number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So it's going to be interesting to look at the details here, but again there was going to be a big contribution from inventories which obviously isn't a positive going forward because you have to unwind those inventories, and then another contributing factor was going to be trade, where we were actual going to see an increase in exports which would help drive, you know, narrow the trade deficit and lift GDP, and that's not going to continue cps the strength in the dollar is going to act as a headwind to that.</p><p>But I agree with you, Maria.  I mean I think this number looks stronger and I think moving through the next let's say four, six weeks, we should see some stronger consumer numbers which is going to be, you know, it'd be really interesting in what the consumer spending component was here, but I do think we'll see stronger some stronger prints there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean -- I mean the personal -- the personal consumption number is what we want to really focus on in the GDP.  Last week, when I interviewed Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, he basically said that the economy -- the consumer's balance sheet is the best that it's been in 30 years because of very low debt, and wages which are up better than three percent year-over-year.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I guess the important thing with the consumer is that you're painting them with one brush and there really isn't an average consumer any more.  There is the high end and the low end.  But I do think we should see some stronger numbers on the consumer franchise because there they were so depressed for three months.  We, you know, we had retail sales, basically down for three months straight and consumer spending more broadly was weaker.</p><p>And part of that was a function of the meltdown in the fourth quarter in the markets that really depressed psychology, both on the consumer front and the corporate front.  But what I think is fascinating about this first quarter GDP print is now it sets up the dilemma that I talked about with you talking when I was talking about this risk of an upside bounce, upside risk, is that we have the fed meeting next week.</p><p>And, you know, what is Powell going to say about they backpedaled frantically here talking about even pausing the unwind of the balance sheet, the markets pricing in a rate cut, then we get this number?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  I mean I don't know if anyone was looking for three percent growth in any quarter this year --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  -- much less the first quarter which is the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the question now becomes, what does the fed say at that meeting on Wednesday?  Are they going to tilt toward, \"Well, we're out of the way, no rate hikes certainly?\"  People talk about a rate cut or are they going to say things are coming back, things are strong, maybe a rate hike is on the table for 2019?</p><p>POMBOY:  I mean, how manic depressive do they look?  I mean with apologies to your former employer, these guys start to look like the Jim Cramers of monetary policy.  You know, there -- you know, one day, they think the economy is hot, and the next day they think it's soft.  So, I think this is really going to set up the dilemma for the financial markets is that better news now, they don't know what to do with that, well, does the bond market selloff here?  And if it does, doesn't that have a dampening effect on the stock market?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  I mean I fear the return of the bond vigilantes, which is what I talked to you about the last time, is that stronger growth really sets up increased volatility in the financial markets which generally is not a friend to prices, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  Uncertainty is going to be a major issue here around monetary policy.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP:  Does this help us take a ever harder stance against China right now with the trade negotiations?</p><p>POMBOY:  I guess that's a good point, yes.  You know, their data started to look a little better, but this number is definitely, like I said, you know, you didn't expect three percent in any quarter, much less the first quarter which is normally just really seasonally weak.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's what -- here's what Jamie Dimon told me, the head of the nation's largest bank, just last week about the consumer and the economy today.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE.  What we see in the U.S. is that the American consumer, their balance sheet, their incomes, are going -- are strong, not weak, more people going back to the workforce, which is a good thing, companies are in very good shape, profits are good, capital expenditures still going up, business and consumer confidence high levels, housings in short supply, so it's kind of a tailwind.  The -- and the fed is on pause, which I think they did the right thing, which means it's going to give people more time to adjust a little bit of slowdown.</p><p>But it's -- it seems it's just a little slowdown.  And just -- other than trade, I'm not sure what's going to stop it in the next year or two.  I'm prepared for it to get bad, but I'm not predicting it.  I'm saying, no, you can actually have a pretty good environment for a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't see a recession in the next couple of years?</p><p>DIMON:  I don't.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No recession.  So where did this come from, that we were going to see a recession in 2019 and 2020?</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, I think the one pushback I would have to him and the risk I view of the recession comes from the corporate sector.  You know, he makes a good point that the consumers' in better shape than they were, that's not the problem this time.  The problem is the leveraging up in the corporate sector, and we have a huge amount of debt rolling this year.  We have almost $800 billion in corporate debt that rolls this year, and another $900 billion next year.  Corporate borrowing costs have rallied back alongside with the stock market over the last few months, but they're still above where they were in September and they're well above where they were at the lows.</p><p>So, we're going to see corporations trying to, you know, refinance this massive amount of debt, and, you know, if my concerns about the return of the bond vigilantes bear any sort of fruit, that could create some real dislocations on the corporate side, which ultimately hits back to consumers because if companies are having struggles refinancing debt, they're certainly not going to rush out to increase wages and hire more people.  So, it all kind of feeds back together.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  All valid points, for sure, but at the same time, the bull market surpassing that 10-year mark, sort of giving investors' confidence that, you know, no, this wasn't just a seven to ten-year cycle after the great recession, but actually this may have legs to go a lot further.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean what I come back to on the stock market front is it's all going to coming down to earnings, you know.  I think that the first quarter obviously, people have sort of kitchen sink that, we know the first quarter numbers are going to be weak, but the forecast look for an increase in earnings, in the out quarters and ultimately going back to double digits next year.  So this is really viewed as sort of a one queue phenomenon and everything will recover.</p><p>and, again, you know, my concerns about the corporate borrowing side have me less bullish on the earnings outlook, and I think that could be a risk, you know, that maybe if you look at guidance, for example, even as companies are sort of narrowly beating this incredibly depressed guidance in the -- expectations in the first quarter, guidance is really fairly negative, certainly very cautious in the out quarter.  So, we'll see what happens there, but I think that could be the real wrinkle in the whole picture, is what happens with this leveraging of the corporate balance sheets, not the consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first reading of the GDP for the first quarter, it is up 3.2 percent, the estimate calls for growth two percent, this is wildly better than expectations, some people were expecting up to 2.9 percent.  That was the estimate out of J.P. Morgan, but whatever way you look at it, this has smashed through estimates on the GDP number.  Tom, how do you see it?</p><p>BEVAN:  Well, again, I'm -- my wheelhouse is politics, right?  So, I look at all these numbers through the political lens.  I mean this is a huge win for President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>TOM:  You know, we were talking about the trade war with China, everyone's talking -- I mean just a few weeks ago, we had the fed saying .5 percent growth for first quarter?  We're now 3.2.  So, this is -- the economy continues to be much more resilient than people have estimated.  And that bodes well for him moving into his reelection.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  By the way, we have a huge week next week, we got the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, as you noted.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The China PMIs, that's the Purchasing Managers Index, this gives us a sense of manufacturing in China for the month of April.  You've got inflation numbers, the PCE coming out next week, and then, of course, you got the jobs numbers at the end of the week, no doubt we're going to see wages probably either go up, or stay at a level of 3.2 percent year-over-year.  So, this is all good news.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  It's going to be -- it's going to be a very interesting week because like you talked about, we have all those indicators, we also have personal income and spending numbers, the broader numbers, and it'll be interesting to see what Powell says about that in the presser on the 1st.  It's really -- this is the conundrum now, is good news good news or is good news bad news?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me just -- let me just give you a couple of highlights here because the first quarter consumer spending was up 1.2 percent --</p><p>POMBOY:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- versus fourth quarter 2-1/2 percent.  You have business investment, up 2.7 percent, equipment up two tenths of a percent, intellectual property software in terms of business investment, 8.6 percent, Stephanie.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Business investment into intellectual property and software up 8.6 percent.  That is a fantastic number.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when people say capex has slowed down, I'm not buying it, OK?  Capex into I.P. up 8-1/2 percent.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes, that's actually -- that number is stronger, the other ones are weaker than expected, although PCE was pretty much exactly as expected, the consumer spending number at 1-2, I think estimates were for 1-1, which, again, is less than half of what it was in the prior quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The first quarter PCE price index, up six tenths of a percent.</p><p>POMBOY:  Uh-huh.  So we'll see what Powell says about that.  I mean I think that's a little heavier than he might necessarily want to see.  All in all, this is going to be right now the Fed is scratching its head as to what they're going to do, and I would focus very heavily on the bond market over the next few weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  All right.  We're going to --</p><p>POMBOY:  I think that's really going to be the story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be watching that.  As we've been talking, we haven't even mentioned Chevron earnings, they're mixed.  Let's get to Lauren Simonetti.  She's looking at the Chevron quarter right now.  Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, Maria.  And investors are trying to figure out how to respond this.  Initially the stock went up as opening bell.  Chevron is a Dow Component, it has a three percent waiting on that average.  It's still up, it did go down.  Now it's up about not even a tenth of one percent, at 117.98.  The number that was impressive was the bottom line number, EPS was $1.39 a share, as you noted, Maria.  The expectation was $1.30, net income coming at $2.6 billion, that was better than expected.  The problem is with revenue, $35.2 billion, the estimate was for $38.4 billion.</p><p>So I'm still going through this report, of course we need to listen to the conference call.  we need to hear if anything, and I'm sure there will tons of questions from the CEO Mike Wirth, he's going to be quizzed about is Chevron going to up their bid for Anadarko after that occidental bid came in.  Oil promises have been higher, so this is good for the -- for the oil companies, but you have to remember when a lot of them started lowering their estimates, that was when oil was much lower than it is right now.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Joining us right now, PRICE Futures Group Energy Analyst, Phil Flynn.  Phil, weight in here on the Chevron numbers, especially since occidental petroleum is going to be outbidding Chevron in its acquisition of Anadarko.  It's offering $38 billion, which, of course, is topping the chevron bid, which was $33 billion.  We got a fight going on for this company.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP ENERGY ANALYST:  You sure do, and I think this is the first of many, Maria, down in the Permian Basin.  All the big oil companies, ExxonMobil, Chevron, you name it, think the future is down in taxes, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Its energy in fact --</p><p>FLYNN:  With the Shell oil right now in, and so this is what we're seeing right now at this time.  So, if you look at what's really going on here, you know, with today's earning, it really shows you that Chevron looks like it's a much better-run company than ExxonMobil if you compare the two people.  Chevron's been a leader, of course.  They were first in the Permian, they've expanding first, ExxonMobil has been playing a lot of catchup right now, but if you compare the two earnings, Chevron looks like they're doing a much, much better job.</p><p>Now one of the problems we had with ExxonMobil, of course, high Canadian crude products that hurt them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Phil.  Thank you so much.  Phil Flynn joining us there on oil this morning.  Final comments from you, Stephanie Pomboy.  When you look at where energy is right now, does that have a potential to cutting to growth given the fact that oil prices are all the way up above 60 or --</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, it's sort of perverse, because --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Close to 60 now.</p><p>POMBOY:  -- the initial effect is to boost the headline numbers, you know.  If you're a consumer, suddenly you've got to pay a lot more at the gas tank, you pay that, and then when you realize those prices aren't coming back down, you have to cut back somewhere else so ends up having a depressing affect later on.</p><p>But the initial impact is to inflate both the inflation and the spending numbers, which is another reason why I think the near-term numbers could continue to surprise on the upside (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We leave it there.  Stephanie, great to get your analysis always.</p><p>POMBOY:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Stephanie Pomboy joining us there.  The advance reading on first quarter GDP, it was 3.2 percent, that was much higher than expectations of two percent.  Stuart Varney will weigh in on that coming up.</p><p>Then pain at the pump, we are taking you live to California this morning where gasoline prices are soaring to historic highs.  There's the price of oil moving up.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The GDP number is just out.  It beat expectations, up 3.2 percent on growth wildly better than anybody expected.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  How'd you like that number, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, I loved it.  I wonder what the Democrats are going to think.  I mean here they've gone full tilt to socialism, just as capitalism turns over the goodies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  3.2 percent growth in the first quarter of the year, what's Joe Biden going to say?  What's the first thing out of his mouth when someone says, \"Hey, three percent growth in the first quarter of the year, wasn't supposed to be like this.  Is it still going to go for taxing increases?  Is it still going to go for more red tape?  What about Bernie?  It's so unfair that we have to change the whole system, move away from capitalism, and go to socialism when you got three percent growth in the first quarter of the year?  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is just a prize that's landed in President Trump's lap.  And he created this, make no mistake.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's god deregulation.  He did tax reform we know these kinds of policies work, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  And he's pro-business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You had four percent growth in the second quarter last year.  You got 3-1/4 percent growth this corner.</p><p>VARNEY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give me a break.</p><p>VARNEY:  And you were --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's this recession that everybody's going nuts about?</p><p>VARNEY:  You were talking about these capex, capital investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean in software eight percent, was it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  8.6 percent, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Put the word out, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is prosperity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, I'm saying the today, Stu, that's for sure.</p><p>VARNEY:  Love it.

Robert, good morning to you.</p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Well, if you drive higher gasoline prices at the pump, may not be breaking news, but what is as (INAUDIBLE) take a quick move.  We literally just saw them raising the prices here at this station, not just a little bit, up 20 cents a gallon, and that's $3.00 for a typical fill up of your tank there, extra you're paying.  Take a look at the prices nationally.  Gasoline price is spiking to the highest since Halloween, almost three bucks a gallon here in California, even higher topping four bucks a gallon.</p><p>We have to go to august of 2014 to see how high it's -- though the highest hits then.  It was then one, of course, taxes of the about a dollar a gallon here, extra in California.  Governor Gavin Newsom just this week calling for an investigation to what he is suggesting maybe inappropriate industry practices, and the industry, and refinery shutting down for maintenance or other issues.</p><p>Now keep in mind, prices typically are jumping this time of year as we start ramping into Memorial Day, but that's still a month away and they'll have to stay higher given higher and experts say the jump is going to go even higher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG SHUPE, SPOKESPERSON, AAA:  Of course we're used to paying higher prices being here in California.  And on the West Coast.  But the double-digit increases that we've seen over the last couple of weeks have really given a lot of drivers a sense of sticker shock.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAY:  Yes, Maria.  We're getting close to five bucks a gallon here for the most expensive gasoline.  That is sticker shock even for those of us who live here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GRAY:  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think California lawmakers really need to take a look at what happened when the federal government cut taxes, and how it moved the needle on economic growth.  We'll be watching that story, Robert.  Thank you.  Robert Gray this morning in L.A.  Still ahead, the border crisis.  I'm headed to the U.S.-Mexico border this weekend where I will be live for a special edition of \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"  Join me live Sunday morning at 10 a.m. Eastern as I walk the border, and take a look at the activity in terms of apprehensions.

Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, April 26th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning.  The Uber IPO -- we've got news.  The company says it will offer 180 million shares priced at between $44 and $50 apiece.  This as the company begins its road show today.  The company will go public in the next week.</p><p>Earnings in focus this morning, take a look.  Two Dow components reporting their first quarter this morning -- oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron.  American Airlines also reporting this hour with their fleet of 737 Max jets still grounded.  We will have the numbers and full analysis.</p><p>Right now, all of the above are trading up fractionally.</p><p>Intel earnings warning meanwhile, the stock of Intel tumbling this morning after the company forecast weaker demand for Cloud services and a slowdown in China.  The stock is down 7.5 percent right now.</p><p>Broader market is showing some weakness as well.  Take a look at futures where the Dow futures are down 27 points, the S&amp;P futures down 1 point, the Nasdaq is up though, extending a big rally yesterday.  The Nasdaq futures up 12 points.</p><p>Yesterday, 3M was the big issue for the Dow.  It cut 194 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average accounting for all of the decline of 135 points on the Dow yesterday.  S&amp;P was down 1 point.  But the Nasdaq was up a quarter of a percent.  It was up 16 points as technology continues to get a bid.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices look like this and they are mixed.  FT 100 down 14 points.  The CAC 40 in Paris is up 8.  And the DAX index in Germany up 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, take a look at the numbers.  You do have the Shanghai composite taking a hit, down 1.25 percent in China.</p><p>Japanese industrial production down at its fastest pace in almost four years, slipping 4.6 percent.  That has to do with weakness in the economy there.  The Nikkei average was down a quarter of a percent as you can see.</p><p>And Walmart store of the future -- the retailer opening an A.I.-powered store to the public.  Wait until you see this.  We're going to take you inside there.</p><p>And then the NFL draft, the first round full of trades and surprises last night, find out the key players teams scooped up, coming up.</p><p>Fortnite meets the \"Avengers\" -- the popular video game teams up with the blockbuster film adding a black widow skin for a limited time.  We will have that coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning and joining me to break it all down:  Fox Business Network's Jackie DeAngelis; the Brewer Group CEO, former investment banker and former NFL star Jack Brewer; and RealClearPolitics co-founder and president, Tom Bevan.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER, REALCLEARPOLITICS:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP:  Yes.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The NFL draft, you had to be watching that last night.</p><p>BREWER:  I was locked in.  I watched every single pick.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes?</p><p>BREWER:  It was a lot of fun.  And I said this earlier.  It's amazing to see what this has become.  It's like a real event.  The ratings are skyrocketing.</p><p>You know, I remember this time last year I didn't know what situation the NFL would be in.  You talk about the concussion issues.  You know, you talk about all the things, you know, from the player kneeling issues.  The NFL is so resilient.  It's like that shield can't be stopped.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.  But you know, they've got Sunday and Thursday on Fox.  They've got ESPN on Monday.  And you have the NFL network is doing all of this, and like a big presentation around the NFL draft.  How does that work where the NFL has the NFL network and then they also obviously have amazing partners in Fox, among others.</p><p>BREWER:  They've been so creative with their TV deals and their contracts in the way that they negotiate them.  Just take for example the draft.  So you have three different networks, each day, that are covering the draft.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BREWER:  So, you know, you had your first round picks.  Today, you'll have second and third round which is another event.  And then on Saturday, you're going to have rounds four through seven which another network is going to carry and these ratings just continue to skyrocket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.  it's really become a real event.  We're going to talk all about that this morning.</p><p>But first, our top story right now.  And that is the Trump economy.</p><p>President Trump touting tax cuts and economic accomplishments in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity last night.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.  We have gotten rid of the individual mandate.  We had the biggest cut in regulations, which is one of the things creating all of these great jobs because we have the best unemployment numbers that we've ever had.</p><p>Today we have the most people working, literally today, just came out.  We have the most people working that we've ever had in the history of our country.  Almost 160 million people are working, they have jobs.</p><p>And it's incredible.  The economy is setting records.  When foreign leaders come in to see me, Sean, they always say thank you, it's great to meet you, sir, and congratulations on your economy.  It's the greatest economy anywhere in the world, which it is.  Nobody is even close to us.  And that's because of the things we've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're going to get another window into that economy this morning when we get the GDP data.  That's coming out in an hour and-a-half.  Stay with us on that GDP number coming out.</p><p>But first joining us right now to talk more about that is the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath sporting a beard this morning -- Jon.  Hey -- looking good.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Yes.  I took a few days off and didn't shave.  I thought I'd see how it works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks good.  I'm a fan.  Good to see you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for being here -- Jon.</p><p>What's your take on the economy right now?  What's your expectation on the GDP?  And is that priced into the market, do you think?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think the watch word on the GDP report today is going to be resilience.  That's the key word that I'm looking at.  You know, when we started out the first quarter a lot of estimates for growth were really ratcheted down by these investment banks on Wall Street because we had the government shutdown.  You know, we had financial markets in a tizzy late last year.  We had a lot of concerns about trade.</p><p>As the quarter progressed, as we got into April and we really started seeing data on how things worked, all of those estimates for first quarter growth came up and we're now looking at some number in excess of 2 percent.  That's pretty good because, you know, first quarter tends to be a soft quarter and the face of all the head winds like the government shutdown to get a number of two plus percent I think will be a really strong sign for this economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So what happens next?  I mean, we were all worried at the end of last year about things slowing down, the Federal Reserve totally pivots.  You've got a fed meeting next week, potential Federal Reserve board nominee Stephen Moore says that he's committed to the process but would bow out if he was a liability.  A lot of stuff going on around the Fed.</p><p>First, give me your expectation for the fed meeting next week, then I want to get your take on Stephen Moore.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I don't think the Fed is going to be doing anything.  They've signaled pretty clearly that they don't intend to do anything right now.</p><p>But, you know, since we're talking about numbers, you have to look forward to the inflation numbers coming out of the Commerce Department on Monday.  Inflation looks like it's softened and if it under-shoots the Fed's 2 percent inflation target for a few more months, we could be talking about interest rate cuts later this year which again will add juice to the economy.</p><p>And then since we're looking forward on growth, I think there's going to be an agreement in August or September for more spending out of Washington in the new fiscal year.  So I think that's also going to add some tailwinds to this economy.</p><p>So, you know, low inflation and strong growth, the Fed could be on hold.  It could even be cutting rates.  But I think the Fed is really a positive for this economy right now, not a headwind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You think Stephen Moore makes it?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's really hard to say.  You know, it's going to be -- I think this one -- the Cain case did not go to the Senate.  I think the Stephen Moore case will go to the Senate.  And I think it will be a close call, you know, really as to whether Republicans want to get behind their own man.</p><p>Be's been a partisan for Republican policy making.  We have to see if the party lines up behind him.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Jon -- it's Jackie DeAngelis.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Great to be here.  Great to see you.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  I want to go back to that point that you made about the potential for inflation to be under the target and the Fed to say hey, we actually need to cut rates.  If you had to game the chances on that, what would you say?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, some of it is going to have to do with energy prices which are hard to predict.  You know, if they continue to rise over the next few months and the headline inflation numbers pick up then maybe the Fed says no.</p><p>But what I'm looking at on Monday is prices excluding food and excluding energy, the last couple readings we've seen on this have been soft.  And, you know, a lot of people on Wall Street are talking right now about what the Fed did in the mid-1990s when, you know, they saw global headwinds, they saw inflation soften and they took out some insurance.</p><p>They didn't say we're going to do a whole bunch of interest rate cuts but they did one or two.  And they might be talking about an insurance policy if they see these inflation numbers soften.</p><p>BEVAN:  Jon -- this is Tom Bevan.  Great to see you.</p><p>I've got a political question for you.  We've been talking about how Democrat now as we head into the 2020 campaign -- how they're going to attack Trump on the economy because clearly it's one of his strongest points.  What can the Democrats point to, to make their case why they can do a better job on the economy than Trump's done?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think a really big part of this upcoming election is going to be about the question of inequality.  And you know, a lot of Republican supporters, a lot of supporters of President Trump are blue collar workers and a lot's going to come down to the question of are they participating in the upturn that we're getting.</p><p>We're seeing a lot of growth in urban areas, in rural manufacturing areas.  You know, they've been through a long, hard period of competition from the rest of the world.  And you know, we have to see if that's really -- if the economy's resilience right now is feeding out to those groups.  And I think that's going to be the case that Democrats make, that they can address issues of inequality and the evenness of growth as it's being spread.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's definitely the issue.</p><p>All right.  We will get the GDP -- did you want to say something else -- Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  You know, I want to ask Jack a question.  I'm a big football fan.  I want to know how my Giants did last night.  Do you think they solved their problems?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good question.</p><p>BREWER:  That's a great question, brother.  And I love the beard because I'm going for the same look.</p><p>But you know, I'm an optimist.  And I would say that --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Oh, that's a bad introduction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a bad beginning.  That's a bad beginning.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's your answer.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BREWER:  I know but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What the heck happened to the Giants?</p><p>BREWER:  Listen --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They lost Jack Brewer, that's one thing.</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  That was a long time ago.  But I will tell you this, if that boy comes out and throws the ball well after he replaces Eli, we'll all be happy.</p><p>But we did pick up a great cornerback though.  That was an awesome pick at the end of the first round.  I think he's going to make a lot of plays.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  All right.  I feel a little better this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There is your answer.  Jon -- I just tweeted out a picture of you and your new beard.  We'll see what viewers say.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Ok.  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's on my Twitter feed.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  All right.  Let me know.  That will decide whether I shave this weekend or not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Viewers will decide.  Jon -- we'll see you soon.</p><p>BREWER:  Ok -- Jon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a good weekend, my friend.  Jon Hilsenrath, \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>Coming up, earnings in focus this morning.  American Airlines due out later this hour.  ExxonMobil and Chevron reporting next hour.  We'll have all the numbers and analysis.  They've been impacting markets this morning.</p><p>And then there's this.  Walmart taking shopping to the next level, the retail giant unveils its store of the future.  We'll bring you there, next up.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Uber is lowering its valuation target once again ahead of next month's expected IPO.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Maria -- the company is trimming its valuation between $80 and $90 billion.  That's according to a report in the Journal.  Now that is down from nearly $100 billion at first projected.  Sources say Uber plans to price its shares between $44 and $50 each, granting as much $10 billion.  Uber's IPO could be the second largest in U.S. history.</p><p>Well, Amazon's latest earnings soaring past expectations, but the company is warning its operating profit for the second quarter is going to fall as it shortens delivery times for prime customers.  Right now it's two days.  They're aiming for one.  Shares of Amazon are higher in the premarket.</p><p>And we're also watching shares of American Airlines parent company.  Earnings expected to fall more than 30 percent from a year ago on slightly higher revenue.  American up almost two percent right now.</p><p>Amazon up a little more than half a percent.</p><p>We're also going to hear from the oil patch this morning.  Dow components -- ExxonMobil and Chevron coming out with their results in the next hour-- Maria.  So a lot more big earnings numbers coming own.  Nothing slows down on a Friday.</p><p>And then there is -- Saudi Arabia's public investment fund reportedly in talks with banks to raise a short-term loan for as much as $8 billion for new investments.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" says the PIF is considering raising debt as part of its funding options.  The PIF now working to the deliver Crown Prince's Mohammed bin Salman' ambitious economic program, designed to free the kingdom from dependence on oil exports.</p><p>And then there is this.  The U.S. home ownership rate falling for the first time in more than two years.  The rate just at 64.2 percent of the first quarter from 64.8 percent.  And of course, quarter analysts say Analysts say many potential first time buyers are feeling the effects of rising mortgage rates --0 Maria.</p><p>Those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  thank you so much, Cheryl.  That Uber story is a good one because we're waiting on this IPO.  But I guess Lyft took the expectations down a bit -- Jackie .</p><p>DEANGELIS:  And there is going to be a lot of focus on this because Uber was the bigger name.  So Lyft was sort of the test case.  And when it came public March 29 at the Nasdaq, you know, it soared that day well over the pricing, over $87, it priced $70 to $72.  And then this drop now since it's been trading, more than 20 percent.</p><p>So investors got really excited and then potentially burned there.  So that's what traders are going to be thinking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The company loses money, no profit yet.  I mean that's something that we're seeing this huge slate of IPOs, for 2019 and it's great.  It's good for the markets but differentiating who is profitable and who isn't is important.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  It's really important.  And obviously the expectations too are hopefully long-term, sort of getting in early on some things but you have to be really careful about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BREWER:  Jackie -- how do you price in the fact that we know that the pricing is going up, they've got to raise their fares for Uber and already I mean I personally I'm looking at my Uber and I'm like man, this is getting more and more expensive.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  It's amazing.  Especially here in New York City, you know, you have to congestion pricing and also we need to watch the oil prices very carefully as well.  Close to $65  a barrel now.</p><p>We're going to have energy earnings today.  But that's going to have an impact on these companies, too.</p><p>Gas prices go up, their expenses go up, you pay more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's it.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>The President just tweeted, he's tweeting this morning on Otto Warmbier.  He wrote this, \"No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not $2 million, not anything else.  This is not the Obama administration that paid $1.8 billion for four hostages or gave five terrorist hostages plus who soon went back to battle for traitor Sergeant Bergdahl.\"</p><p>The President tweeting on this as of course, we are watching the story coming in out of North Korea said that they want to be paid for Otto Warmbier's care. Of course, he died after being    in a coma.</p><p>Meanwhile there's Carlos Ghosn fallout.  The former Nissan chairman was released on bail last night but with conditions.  As we told you those conditions yesterday right here.</p><p>This as Renault is now saying it would like to merge with Nissan.  That did not work out well for Carlos Ghosn, that's for sure.</p><p>The Arizona Cardinals making history with the first pick in the NFL draft.  The highlights from the draft last night, coming up right here.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Now this, Renault is planning to propose a partnership with Nissan.  That is according to the \"Wall Street Journal this morning.  This as former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn was released from Japan jail last night with conditions.  Ghosn said this in a statement, \"I maintain my innocence and am committed to vigorously defending myself against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.  I hope to be given a fair trial where the truth will come to light and I will be fully vindicated.\"</p><p>Joining me right now if Michigan State University law professor and the Japanese legal system co-author Frank Ravitch. And good to see you -- Frank.   Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>You've got to explain the judiciary system in Japan for us because right from the get-go, I reported on this program that I felt that this was a total coup.  That Carlos Ghosn was thrown in jail because the government as well as a lot of people under him were worried that they were going to merge Renault and Nissan.  He was just let out with these conditions that he's not allowed to speak to his wife which is extraordinary.</p><p>Can you explain how the Japanese judicial system works that they can just throw a guy in jail without any due process?</p><p>FRANK RAVITCH, LAW PROFESSOR, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY:  This is actually an issue that's very controversial even in Japan.  The pre-trial detention system there, what they're REALY going for, they try to get concessions.  And you know, they have a very high conviction rate, a big part of that is because they use -- they're able to use things like isolation and pressure to try to get confessions.</p><p>And, you know, there's a few factors there.  I mean one is what's happened with him -- I mean there's a few things that are unusual, for example, being re-arrested after coming out on bail.</p><p>But a lot of this is stuff that Japanese legal scholars and others have complained about as being a real problem in the system, where you can be detained, you can be interrogated.  Your lawyer won't necessarily be present when you're interrogated even though you have a right to a lawyer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RAVITCH:  And so it's really a problematic situation.  There's actually an amendment right now that's proposed to the Japanese criminal code that that would change that.  But for now, obviously that's not in place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think he's going to get a fair trial?  I mean, that's all he wants is a fair trial.</p><p>RAVITCH:  I think it's -- you know, that's a really fascinating question, because, you know, Japan is very -- for all the lack of due process during the detention phase of things, there really is pretty good due process at the trial level.  But it's a fascinating cultural thing because in Japan what they really want to see is contrition.</p><p>They want to see people -- most trials in Japan are not about challenging the claims of the prosecutors.  They're about lowering sentences.  Because frequently it's based on confession.  But in less than 10 percent of cases are people actually challenging the charges.  But when they do, there is a -- I think there is a chance at a fair trial.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that's the thing.  I mean they've been keeping him in detention with the lights on 24/7.  They took away his watch.  He never knows what time it is.  He's got the lights on all day long.</p><p>This is a way to torture him so that he doesn't know what time it is, what day it is and now he has agreed to these strict conditions for his release.  He's not allowed to contact his wife.</p><p>My sources tell me he will not be able to speak to his wife, Carole, without a lawyer present.  I spoke with Carole Ghosn earlier this month in an exclusive interview and this is what she told me, what happened when the officers raided their home and then they interrogated her.  She didn't commit any crime.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAROLE GHOSN, WIF OF CARLOS GHOSN:  They took my passport.  I didn't understand why they took my passport.  I'm not under arrest.  I'm not a suspect.  They took my phone.  They took my laptop.  They took these letters that I wrote every day to Carlos while he was in the detention center.</p><p>They took all the papers that his lawyers gave him regarding the case, which is -- they're not supposed to take all these things.  And then they wanted to take me in for questioning and I said no, I want a lawyer, I'm an American citizen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She was here.  She was crying on-set.  She was so upset, Frank.  And you know, Jack brewer is with me this morning.  Look at the pictures of Carlos Ghosn.  He's been completely diminished and for what?  Because he wanted to merge a French company with the jewel that is Nissan of the Tokyo government?</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  It's just heartbreaking. I mean look at this.  Look at the front page of the Wall Street journal.  The man looks like he's aged 25 years.  At what point does this become a human rights issue?</p><p>RAVITCH:  Well I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What do you think -- Frank?</p><p>RAVITCH:  I mean I think, you know, there's a lot going on here.  I mean these detentions that happen, I mean, it's not like people are hosing him down with water and things like that.  What they use to get the confession is isolation.  The reason a watch is taken away, they're worried about people committing suicide.  They take anything away that could be used in that way.</p><p>But what they're really doing, the isolation is really pretty horrific.  So you know, in a Japanese prison, their prisons are light years ahead of ours in terms of cleanliness and food and things like that.  But during the detention period, you're truly isolated.  And that is a way to try to get a confession out of him.</p><p>With that said, I'm still not -- I mean this is something that the trial will show.  I'm not 100 percent convinced that this is all about Nissan because of the fact that, you know, Renault, the investigations in France by Renault were turned over to prosecutors there.  And so I think that there is some concern I think with these newer charges.</p><p>The older charges from March have to do with the Japanese law in 2009 which required executive compensation to be divulged.  There could have been some innocent mistake on his part in terms of how -- you know, in Japan, compensation has to be divulged when fixed, not when released.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I am being told that the reason they came up with this new charge and this new restriction that he's not allowed to speak to his wife is because she did an interview with me and because went and wrote an op ed in the \"Washington Post\".  They want to shut her up.</p><p>So she comes to this set two weeks ago, she sits here, she does an interview with me.  The Japanese prosecutor was mad that she spoke out and told us and by the way, I was supposed to do an interview with Carlos Ghosn and they found out and they re-arrested him.  So they want to shut them up.</p><p>RAVITCH: Well, I think this -- one of the fundamental problems with the Japanese detention system is that they -- frequently, when someone is about to be released, they'll file new charges so that the person can be held longer.  I'm not sure they're as worried about the western media as we think that they are.  There's sort of following the rules.</p><p>One of the interesting things about them preventing him from speaking to her, there's this -- there's this element in the Japanese criminal process where if someone is -- there's a fear that someone will hide evidence or you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they think she's going to destroy evidence.  That's what they -- that's what they told her that she's going to destroy evidence.</p><p>Frank, it's great to get your take on this.  Thanks very much.  Frank Ravitch joining us there.</p><p>I should point out that today President Trump is hosting Prime Minister Abe at the White House.  I don't think this is going to come up.  But it's interesting to take note of that.</p><p>Quick break and then Walmart is getting smart, the retail giant unveils its store of the future, complete with artificial intelligence.  We're going to show you that when we come back.</p><p>And then, flying high on earnings, American Airlines set to report right after this break.  The numbers when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, American Airlines reporting first quarter earnings better than expected.  Lauren Simonetti with the numbers right now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  A penny better than expected when looking at the bottom line here, Maria.  For the first quarter, American Airlines reporting EPS of $0.52 a share.  Revenue and ever so slight miss.  The expectation was $10.6 billion, we got $10.58 billion.  Investors are not liking it.  The stock is down two percent in the premarket.</p><p>But here's some other news and the headwinds for many of the airlines including American, it's higher oil prices, it's the government shutdown and of course, the big one, the Boeing 737 Max grounding.  American has 24 of these jets.  They don't run a lot of flights a day, just 115 flights a day out of 6,500 flights.  But the impact on 2019 pretax earnings from that, from the grounding of this Boeing jet, $350 million.  Investors not liking thus far this earnings report from American, a beat on the top line, slight miss on the -- on the bottom line, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, the stock is down as you said and we'll be watching that.  Thank you so much, Lauren Simonetti.</p><p>Meanwhile, our top story this half an hour, capitalism versus socialism, looks like that's what the 2020 presidential race is setting up to be.  Candidate such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren campaigning on platforms that increase taxes on millionaires and billionaires, but recent tax returns show that Sanders is a millionaire himself.  Here's Senator Sanders during his recent Fox News Town Hall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have an absurd tax system and while millions of people today are paying actually more in taxes than they anticipated, Amazon, Netflix, and dozens of maj or corporation as a result of Trump's tax bill pay nothing in federal taxes.  I think that's a disgrace.</p><p>You raised the issue I am a millionaire.  Well, actually this year, we had $560,000 in income and that's a lot of money.  And that money in my case, my wife's case, it came from a book that I wrote, pretty good book.  You might want to read it.  It's a best seller.  It sold all over the world and we made money.  So if anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not going to do it.</p><p>In my view, people, whether it's me, you, probably make a lot more money than I do, but whether it's me or you or anybody else, I think wealthy people and large corporations that are making billions in profits should start paying their fair share of taxes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the former CKE Restaurant CEO, former Labor Secretary nominee as well and the author of the Capitalist Comeback, author Andy Puzder.  Great to see you, Andy.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, AUTHOR, CAPITALIST COMEBACK:  Great to be here, Maria, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about this?  The whole presidential election being set up, capitalism versus socialism?</p><p>PUZDER:  I think it's great.  I think it's a huge win for the president.  We had an -- you had an earlier guest that was talking about income inequality being a big issue in the election.  And I would -- I would really like to see people on the news networks focus on how Democrats measure income inequality.  Because what they usually use is a report by a professor named Saez out of U.C. Berkley that measures uses pretax income and pre-government transfers income.</p><p>In other words, he ignores the fact that the top 20 percent of earners pay 95 percent of taxes and that ignores the fact that a lot of that money gets transferred down to the bottom 20 percent through things like Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, section eight housing.</p><p>So, you're not accurately measuring income inequality.  The CBO looked at it and found that it was 25 to 30 percent less if you included the government transfers and taxes.</p><p>The second thing is, if you just want to look at wages, that's great.  Under President Trump, wages have been up over three percent for eight consecutive quarters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PUZDER:  If you look at lower income people like people in restaurants and hotels, it's up about five percent.  It's harder to find blue collar workers than white collar workers for the first time in decades.  And the New York Fed just came out with a report that said starting salaries over the last four months have gone from $55,000 to $66,000.</p><p>So, Democrats are going to be in the position of telling working class Americans who do you believe, us or your wallets?  I mean, your wallets are bigger.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Democrats are saying, though, that a big portion of the population does not have any money for an emergency.  They can't come up with $400 if they had an emergency.  So what do you think the answer is to lift people out of poverty, to lift the lower end of the income scale?</p><p>PUZDER:  Look, there's only one way to reduce income inequality and make sure people at the bottom end of the income scale have more money.  And that's to increase wages.  And the only time wages go up is if you have economic growth, you have employers competing for employees, driving wages up and we've seen that.  We've seen that in this economy.  Amazon, Target, Costco, have all gone to $15.00 and major banks have gone.  Bank of America is not going to $17.00, they say they're going to go to $20.00.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>PUZDER:  That's going to drive wages up.  It will reduce income inequality.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, well, you know, wages are up, Tom Bevan, 3-1/4 percent year over year.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS:  Andy, this is Tom Bevan.</p><p>PUZDER:  Hi, Tom.</p><p>BEVAN:  Good to see you.</p><p>PUZDER:  Good to see you.</p><p>BEVAN:  Look, the reason Democrats are proposing many of these policies, Elizabeth Warren just came out with a student -- canceling all student loan debt.  We're talking about Medicare for All, we're talking about free child care, etcetera, etcetera.  It's because there is actually some popularity among the public for these policies.  He used Trump as admitted that Democrats -- this is going to be a challenge for him.  The Democrats want to put a -- I think he said, quote, Rolls Royce in everyone's pocket.</p><p>So, how does Trump combat that when knowing that there are big swab of population out there that are open to these kind of -- you know, socialist type policies.</p><p>PUZDER:  Let me -- let me tell you two things about that.  One is, you could implement all of Elizabeth Warren's tax increases and all of Bernie Sanders social redistributionist policies that take those tax dollars and spread them to the bottom and the way they measure income inequality it wouldn't change income inequality one dollar.</p><p>President Trump has a problem.  It's hard to fight against free stuff.  If the American people don't want economic growth, if they don't want to see their lives improve based upon what they do, if they don't want to see the kind of society that a capitalist economy creates, if they just want free stuff like the people in Venezuela once did or the Soviet Union or Cuba, well, then they should vote for people like Bernie Sanders who loves being a millionaire, isn't at all ashamed of it.  Criticizes Amazon and Netflix for not paying taxes, right.  He criticizes them.</p><p>However, he used every deduction he could to lower his taxes.  He took full advantage of the tax rates and the tax bill he voted against.  He then comes out and says well, I paid what I owed.  Well, guess what?  So did Amazon and Netflix.  I mean, they're all paying what they owe.  He's a hypocrite.  He's out to get power.  He does everything -- look, it's sort of a -- you know, do what I -- do what I say, not what I do type of philosophy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.</p><p>PUZDER:  I mean he's -- you know, I'm not ashamed of being rich, well neither is President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Go ahead, Jack.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  Andy, this is Jack Brewer.</p><p>PUZDER:  Hi, Jack.</p><p>BREWER:  I think the heart and soul of America, the American working class, want to reward people that work at the end of the day.  And so I think it's really a messaging issue that I see for the -- for the Republicans to be honest with you.  Because if Bernie Sanders goes out to certain populations and is showing that Amazon or Google is paying a small amount of taxes, that can possibly get into the ears of a lot of Americans.  How do the Republicans combat that?</p><p>PUZDER:  Well, the first thing I'd do is point out that he's a hypocrite.  His defense is that he's paying what he owes.  He's criticizing companies that also pay what they owe.  So I think it's -- first of all, what he's doing is hypocritical.</p><p>Second of all, you know, we could explain the reasons companies like that aren't paying taxes at the moment.  For example, they had big capital losses, that there were people that invested in those companies when the stock was very low, put their fortunes into it.  Jeff Bezos spent everything he had on Amazon, created the greatest distribution system in the history of the world, benefits all of us and the only reason he's paying lower taxes is because he's recouping the losses that Amazon made or Amazon is paying less taxes because it's recouping the losses it incurred when it was first formed.  So we can explain it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let me ask you about Walmart.  We've been -- we've been talking about this this morning.  The company unveiled a store in long island powered by A.I., it's called the Intelligent Retail Lab, uses artificial intelligence powered cameras to monitor inventory and stock levels, Andy.  This is your business.  Tell me about this and how A.I. is really going to change the shopping experience.</p><p>PUZDER:  Well, I think it will be tremendous for shoppers.  I think it will make things easier.  It will also make it so that individual businesses are more profitable.  They can -- then they can try and hire better employees, they can lift wages as they compete for employees and businesses will be able to open more outlets.  The more profitable out -- the more profitable an outlet is, the more of them you can open.  So it can create more jobs, it can increase wages.</p><p>And you've got to remember at the beginning of the -- the end of the Obama presidency, beginning of the Trump presidency, there was a big push in the restaurant sector to automate.  And McDonald's has done it, Wendy's has done it.  All of the big companies have done it.  Yet hiring in those -- in that sector has continued to grow.  We in vow that more Americans working than ever before.  And a big portion of that comes from the lower end, the lower working class jobs that have been created despite automation.</p><p>So I think if we have economic growth, automation is very healthy because it makes businesses more profitable.  They can grow.  If we don't have economic growth, it could be a problem because it would replace jobs.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Andy, good morning, it's Jackie.</p><p>PUZDER:  Hi, Jackie.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  I just want to get back to this theme of capitalism versus socialism.  The two sides have become so polarized as of late and obviously we're discussing the fact that president -- Joe Biden is putting his hat in the ring for the presidential race.</p><p>And so, the question here is, you know, there was a time where it was good to be middle of the road.  But actually, is that going to be a disadvantage for him?</p><p>PUZDER:  Well, I don't really know if Joe Biden, I would consider him middle of the road.  Maybe in today's -- you know, very, very diver -- where there -- where there's such separation between the parties he'd be closer to the middle.</p><p>But look, he was part of the Obama administration.  You either -- if you want the Obama administration level of economic growth, wage growth and job growth, then you should vote for Joe Biden.  If you want to continue with the great prosperity we've experienced, stick with President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Andy, good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>PUZDER:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy Puzder.</p><p>Coming up next, Kyler Murray making NFL history, the Arizona Cardinals taking him as the number one pick.

Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With the first pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, the Arizona Cardinals select Kyler Murray, quarterback, Oklahoma.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the first round of the NFL Draft in the books.  It saw plenty of trades and surprises.  Joining us right now is Fox's 24/7 Sports reporter Jared Max and former Jets, Falcons and Lions safety Eric Coleman.  Plus our panel, former NFL star, Jack Brewer joining us.  As along with Jackie DeAngelis, Great to see everybody today.  Your reaction?</p><p>Eric, thanks for being here.  Your reaction to the Draft last night.</p><p>ERIC COLEMAN, FORMER NFL SAFETY, JETS, FALCONS AND LIONS:  I was excited.  You know, it's always fun seeing these young men who worked so hard in college get to reach their dreams and get drafted to the NFL and it's an exciting time for the fans as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, what did you think?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  What stole the show last night for me was Christian Wilkins the player on the Miami Dolphins who got drafted early on.  Just an exceptional human being, graduated in Clemson in three years and then went out on stage when he was drafted.  Roger Goodell wasn't ready for it.  He jumped up and gave him a big shoulder bump.</p><p>COLEMAN:  That was awesome.</p><p>MAX:  And nearly took out the commissioner last night.  How about this yet, two tight ends from Iowa taken in the first round.  Never before have two tight ends from the same school gone in the first two rounds, let alone like the first 20 picks.</p><p>BREWER:  And three defensive linemen from Clemson.</p><p>MAX:  In the top 17.</p><p>BREWER:  Amazing, I thought I was watching the SEC Draft for a little while.  I think every player was coming out of SEC.  I mean, it really tell you it's a testament on what the conference has been able to do on number of talent.</p><p>But you know, Eric like you and I played, you know, played during the same time.  And to see the Draft become what it's become, the spectacle of what it's become and I would love to hear your thoughts on that.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Oh, it's amazing.  You know, I was at the Draft last year in Dallas.  And you would have thought the Super Bowl was going on during the Draft.  And you know, I take back the time when I was drafted in 2004, you know, the second round -- the second -- it was Saturday and Sunday.  On Sunday, when I was drafted in the fifth round, the first round was on ESPN.  The second round was ESPN2.  My grandmother didn't have ESPN2 at the time.  Now, you know, it's on national networks and getting all kinds of ratings.  It's a beautiful thing they have done.</p><p>BREWER:  It really is.  And then, I mean, Kyler Murray, Jared, you talked about it before.  A guy that can play baseball at that level to then go on and be the first pick in the NFL Draft, I said he needs to send a million dollar check to Russell Wilson.  Because without Russell Wilson, you would never see a guy that's 5'9\", 5'10\" get picked number one at quarterback position in the NFL.  What do you think?</p><p>MAX:  Doug Flutie couldn't do it back in the day.  5'10\" in an eight, they've only been two other players in NFL history shorter taken with the first overall pick.  So we see how much does size matter here in the NFL.</p><p>And Murray obviously he's the first player ever taken in the first round of both the baseball and the football Draft.  You thought he'd go play for the Oakland A's.  And then he had such a great senior season, won the Heisman and now goes to the NFL.  I hope he works out, because he's such an exciting player.  What a great smile.  He just brings a great energy.</p><p>And how about that pink suit last night?  You ever see something like that before?  Kyler Murray going first overall last night.  And Eli Manning is likely successor, Daniel Jones out of Duke goes to the Giants.  I understand you were at a Draft party last night, Giants fans, how were they on Daniel Jones?</p><p>COLEMAN:  It was interesting.  I was at MetLife Stadium.  The Jets and the Giants both had Draft parties and to watch the reaction of the Giants fans when Daniel Jones was picked.  It was kind of surprising.  And everyone was disappointed.  But you know, I think that ultimately the Giants got the quarterback who they wanted, a franchise guy who can succeed Eli Manning.  He trained under coach Cutliffe who coached Eli and Peyton Manning.  So, he had -- he had some great coaching on his way up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what happens tonight?</p><p>MAX:  Tonight we have rounds number -- round numbers two and three and then on the following day we'll have rounds four through seven.  I mean, the NFL Draft is just a tiny bit of what it used to be but what's so amazing about the NFL Draft also is who goes late.  Tom Brady was a sixth round pick.  Some of the best players in history were never even drafted.  And you wonder, I mean, how important is it, the NFL Draft, right?  I mean, if you think about that as a player, like some of the best, Jack?</p><p>BREWER:  It is.  I mean, it's very important but I think the best thing that I've seen is you're seeing guys come in prepared for the league, not just on the field, but off the field.  You're hearing more and more stories about guys that are in the community, doing positive things, like you just said.  You know, seeing these players that are getting their degrees in three years, Amen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Great conversation.  Eric, thank you for joining the conversation.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Eric Coleman AND Jared Max, thank you.</p><p>Make sure to catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Sirius Radio XM115.</p><p>Still ahead, we're watching earnings heavy hitters, Exxon Mobil and Chevron will be reporting in the next hour.

American Airlines also reporting with their fleet of 737 Max jets still, grounded.  We'll have the numbers and full analysis coming up.</p><p>Big numbers from Amazon, meanwhile, the retailer's profit doubling to a record high number, now, investing in one-day delivery for prime members.  And the Uber IPO is happening, the ride hailing giant lowering its valuation target to 80 to $90 billion ahead of going public.  The company beginning its road show, today.</p><p>And the 2020 race is on, former Vice President Joe Biden saying that he asked former President Barack Obama not to endorse him.  He said he asked for that.  President Trump saying Sleepy Joe will not be able to do the job, and calling him not the brightest light bulb in the group.</p><p>And then a measles outbreak, hundreds of students and staff quarantined now at California Universities.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's check markets this morning.  Take a look at Futures.  As we expect, the market to open flat, really.  We got a market that is down, predominantly.  The Dow Industrials down 26 points right now, S&amp;P 500 down 2, and the NASDAQ, however, is up, it is up 9 and 3 quarters points right now.</p><p>We're, of course, watching earnings.  We've got technology earnings in full swing.  Amazon posted a double beat last night.  The company says it plans to spend upwards of $800 million, making one-day-delivery free for Amazon prime members.</p><p>The stock this morning is up about one percent, after the moves last night.  Joining us right now is Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson.  And David, it is good to see you this morning.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, your reaction to the Amazon numbers?</p><p>NELSON:  Look, there's probably something for bulls and bears in this -- in this report.  You know, certainly a monster bottom line beat.  But it's important to note that this is a company that can print just about anything that it wants.  All they have to do is just cut back on CapEx and you can really flow those earnings.  I think for the bears, what they'll point to is, the slowing revenue growth.</p><p>You know, we're down to about 16, 17 percent, that's below what we've seen in previous years.  And maybe the law of large numbers is starting to, you know, step in for this company.  But I think you hit on an important point.  You know, certainly, the big news was last night on the call, talking about the rollout of this new service for prime.</p><p>If you think back 14 years ago, is when they introduced two-day delivery.  Now they're going to try to morph that down to just one day.  And it's almost a -- almost a Trojan Horse, as Morgan Stanley points out this morning.  They're going to move into the logistics business pretty heavily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, they're trying to get into every business, I feel like.  And when Amazon gets in the business, you better -- you better watch out below.</p><p>NELSON:  And that's really maybe the only risk for this company is regulatory.  People are going to look at this company as they march from business to business to business, and people -- you know, somebody in Washington is going to want to do something about that.</p><p>But, unfortunately, the anti-trust laws were really designed to more deal with a company like, say, Standard Oil.  Not going to really work for an Amazon.  If they're going to do anything, they'd have to, you know, rewrite anti-trust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the other earnings today.  You got Chevron, Exxon Mobil, American Airlines, reporting later this morning, your reaction to the earnings picture, so far.  I feel like the estimates have come down so much that they actually beat the lowered estimates.</p><p>NELSON:  Yes, yes, we've been had.  The CEOs, you know, back in the last quarter, they were tripping over themselves to cut guidance, you know, coming into this quarter.  And you saw it in the semis; you saw it across the board.</p><p>Back six months ago, numbers for semis including Intel, were down from $1.07 down to 0.87-cents, so they just barely made the number.  And that was true for a lot of companies.  They stepped over the lowered bar because analysts just cut too far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, what are you expecting for the rest of the year, then?</p><p>NELSON:  Look, we still have all the usual suspects to worry about.  You know, certainly, China trade, a paralyzed Washington.  And look, we're not cheap at this point.  We're just under 17 times earnings.  I think the one thing that I look at is interest rates.  As long as interest rates remain benign, then stocks are just a better asset class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you don't think the Feds is going to move, raising rates --</p><p>NELSON:  No, I mean, this rally is largely on the heels of the Fed, a 180-degree reversal from Jay Powell and company.  And without it, frankly, we wouldn't have had the recovery that we had.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, do you think that they would cut rates at any -- at any point this year?  I mean, you've got a European economy right now, that's lucky if it grows one percent.</p><p>NELSON:  You know, it's a possibility, because we don't live in a vacuum, and they understand that now.  I think that was really the mistake.  What we saw last year was clearly a policy mistake.  What I would rather see them do is focus on the balance sheet.</p><p>I think it's a mistake to stop rolling that off, even at $3-1/2 trillion where they get down to, that's 7 times where we were pre the financial crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I know.  But, I mean, they were on auto pilot at the end of last year, right?</p><p>NELSON:  That was the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed to look at that and say, wait a minute, we're on auto pilot, let's look at the economy and assess, because that's a form of tightening.</p><p>NELSON:  It is.  It is.  But I thought they could have done something on an incremental basis.  To do nothing, how long are they going to go?  At some point, I think they have to address it.  But for now, the markets like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right.  We will leave it there.  David, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>NELSON:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, David Nelson joining us there.  We want to turn to Uber, the company is ready to kick off its investor road show, today.  However, going into the road show, it's actually lowering its valuation target ahead of next month's expected IPO.  Jackie DeAngelis is looking at that this morning.  Good morning, Jacky.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Maria, good morning to you.  And this is such a highly anticipated IPO, especially as the pipeline is now starting to open, and you're right, they did lower the valuation, 80 to $90 billion, instead of 90 to $100 billion.</p><p>The price range looking for -- Uber is looking for is $44.00 to $50.00.  And this is interesting because it's a conservative approach as this company is getting on the road to assess an investor appetite here.  And it comes after Lyft went public on March 29th, at the NASDAQ.</p><p>Now, remember, that price, $70.00 to $72.00, it popped over $87.00 in its opening trade.  It's down 22 percent, since then.</p><p>So, a lot of people said, oh, Uber has the advantage because it's going second.  Well, Lyft didn't do so well.  So, in some senses, a lot of investors are wondering if they necessarily want to step into this.  That said, the Wall Street Journal reporting a lot of big interest in it.  And, of course, those conversations are going to continue, and they're going to have to sell this company in the road show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, that's amazing.  This company has credible valuation, even that the -- even though they cut it, Jackie, it's a lot higher than something like a Lyft, and Lyft hasn't made a dime.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Absolutely.  And that's what everybody has been saying since talk of Uber coming public at all.  Is this company actually worth that valuation?  And that's what investors are going to have to determine here.  And there's a lot of excitement around IPOs right now, and a lot of interest in it, generally, on the floor of the stock exchange.</p><p>The traders saying we're glad the pipe is opening up.  But you want to make sure that you're getting into a good investment, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching that.  Jackie, we'll see you in a little bit, thanks so much, Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>Meanwhile, Intel, is out with an earnings warning this morning, Cheryl Casone on that in headlines this morning, Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, some rough news for Intel shareholders, the stock tumbled in the post-market and the premarket as well.  It is down, as you can see, more than 7-1/2 percent right now.  They issued a disappointing outlook to investors.</p><p>Now, the new CEO, Bob Swan, lowered Intel's revenue guidance for the rest of the year due to a dramatic slowdown in China, and weaker demand from Cloud-computing companies.  Now, the down beat guidance coming, as Intel's latest earnings actually topped expectations.  So, there you go, a stock to watch today.</p><p>Well, shares of Ford are rallying after its latest earnings came in better-than-expected.  Ford's operating profit jumped 12 percent from a year ago, thanks in part to strong gains in pickup and SUV sales in the U.S.  People love their trucks.  Revenues slipped 4 percent to $40 billion, hurt, though, by lower vehicle sales worldwide.</p><p>OK.  Some good news, bad news from Deutsche Bank this morning, the European investors are watching, the bank announced cost cutting, helped boost the first quarter profits, 67 percent jump there.  But, they cut their 2019 revenue target saying they do expect essentially flat full year revenues.</p><p>Now, the earnings report coming just one day, as we reported yesterday, the bank ended those merger talks, Maria, with that smaller rival Commerce Bank.</p><p>And merger talks to tell you about in the car industry, Renault, planning to propose a partnership with Nissan.  This is according to the Journal.  Nissan and Renault are going to each receive a roughly 50 percent stake in the new company.  Reports say Renault made a similar offer in January, after their alliance was rocked by the arrest of former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn in November.  Nissan did reject it.</p><p>So, timing is everything, right, with this news with Renault and Nissan, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know, I mean, the partnership idea did not work that well for Carlos Ghosn, did it?</p><p>CASONE:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, he's out on bail at this point.  We'll have more news on that this morning.  Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Coming up, 2020 presidential race is on, President Trump says \"Sleepy Joe\" Biden will not be able to do the job and calls him not the brightest light bulb in the group.  We're going to talk about the big race coming up.  And then the measles outbreak, hundreds of students and staff quarantined at universities this morning, back in a minute with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have a big show this morning.  Coming up, former Speaker of theHouse, FOX News contributor, and Co-Author of the new book, Collusion, Newt Gingrich is here.</p><p>Former CEO OF CKE Restaurant and Author of the Capitalist Comeback, Andy Puzder, joining us this morning, along with Harvard University Economics Professor, former IMF Chief Economist, Ken Rogoff here, ahead of the GDP number which we're going to be getting, in about two hours.</p><p>But first, 2020, in focus this morning, Joe Biden is campaigning for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, without the endorsement of former President Obama.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I asked President Obama not to endorse and he doesn't want to -- we should -- whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Jackie DeAngelis is here, along with the Brewer Group CEO and former NFL Star himself, Jack Brewer is joining us, along with RealClearPolitics Co-Founder and President, Tom Bevin.  Good to see everybody this morning.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I mean, come on, you ask somebody not to endorse you?  Do we believe this?</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP:  You know, it's the way you start it off, I think.  I mean, if Joe was to come out and say, you know, oh, me and Barack are tied hand in hand, I'm sure he would get a lot of backlash.  But, I can't wait to see this battle, just like a -- you know, it's going to be like a first round fight.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  I think you ask, you say I don't want to be endorsed because you're worried you're not going to get the endorsement, and then you're worried if you do, what repercussions it could have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, they were very close.  But the fact that the President -- President Obama is saying, look, we're going to weigh, we're going to look at this, you know, with the primary and see what voters decide and then get behind the candidate.  Is -- you know, it makes me feel like he doesn't want Biden, Tom, he wants to back a different horse.</p><p>BEVAN:  No.  And there were questions about why the Obamas weren't coming out and supporting Biden when all of this inappropriate touching stuff came out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>BEVAN:  Then, they're reporting that he -- that Obama had been taking meetings with other candidates.  And so, this is not a surprise that Obama is going to stay on the sidelines and, clearly, nobody believes that Biden didn't or asked him not to endorse him.  It's ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so silly.</p><p>BEVAN:  Yes, it's silly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes, don't endorse me.  I don't want any endorsements right now.  The President, meanwhile, weighed in on Joe Biden last night.  He was on Hannity.  Watch this.  I think it was on last night, with Hannity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think that, you know, when you look at Joe, I've known Joe over the years.  He's not the brightest light bulb in the group, I don't think.  But he has a name that they know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is starting off with the suggestions about Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, not the brightest light, what's your take.</p><p>BEVAN:  I thought Sleepy Joe was lame.  And, you know, Trump has to up his nickname game, a little bit.  But, look, Biden's biggest asset, in this field, is his electability, right?  Even folks who -- he's not their first choice in the Democratic primary, think he has the best chance of beating Trump.</p><p>So, that has to be, sort of, the central theme of his campaign.  He has to be able to say, look, your heart may be with one of these other candidates for whatever reason, you may think I'm too old, too white, too male, but I'm the guy who can win, none of these other folks can.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEVAN:  And that's -- if he can stick with that, and really leverage that, he's got -- he's got a chance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is that it, Tom?  I mean, what is his policy -- you know, what's the policy platform?  I mean, is it just, take down Trump?</p><p>BEVAN:  For a lot of folks, it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's it?</p><p>BEVAN:  Yes.  No, and Biden --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't think that's going to fly for the American people.</p><p>BEVAN:  Well, and Biden has to be careful not to get -- not to get fallen with all these other candidates who get dragged to the left and start endorsing policies like, you know, voting for terrorists in prison, and things like that.  He's got to be able to, sort of, withhold -- withstand that, because that's the core of his argument to the electorate.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  I think he's really going to have to come at President Trump and hit him hard on the economy because that's been his best performance metric, you know, since he has been in office.  So, that's really going to be the issue.  I think a lot of people are going to stand back and say can he compete on the economy and would he be able to lead in the same way.  It's a big question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With the economy doing as well as it is, they're going to have to come up with something else because the economy, we're looking at record unemployment lows, we're looking at wages finally, you know, rising for the first time, in a decade.  What do you think, Jack?</p><p>BREWER:  I don't think he'll be able to go far enough left, because, you know, Joe cannot stick to a talking point if it goes too far left.  He's going to always be that Joe who's going to say the things that he feels.  I think he's going to turn off.  Seriously, he's going to turn off the far-reaching new Democratic Party that have been coming closer and closer to socialist.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is Biden a bigger challenge to Trump than Bernie, or is Bernie the real threat?  Because I think if Hillary hadn't, you know, totally, you know -- if everybody wasn't in the tank for Hillary, last time, I think he would've had a real shot, Bernie Sanders.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  I think so too.  I think the problem was people just didn't like Hillary and they wouldn't give her the vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  They might have given it to him.  And so, he might have, sort of, missed his opportunity in some senses.</p><p>BEVAN:  I do think that Biden connects more with the working class voter in those states that are going to matter, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and the like, than Bernie does.  The other thing I'd say to Jack's point, look, the longer this become, is a wide open scrum, and that progressive vote is distributed among a number of candidates, the better Biden's chances are.</p><p>If that vote -- if people drop out in that vote, consolidates behind one or two candidates, that could be trouble for Biden.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  But it's going to be hard for him to get that Sanders vote, that AOC kind of vote, and that is really, sort of, up and coming part of the population.  Obviously, the President doesn't have to worry about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, they're so left that, you know, it's even hard for Howard Schultz, it's hard for, you know, a Joe Biden, because they're trying to sell themselves as moderates.  Guess what?  Much of the party doesn't want a moderate.</p><p>BREWER:  I think that gets you into the game, but you cannot win the general election, if you're that far left.  I don't think -- I think if he had to face a Bernie Sanders, he demolishes him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, the NFL draft was last night, and then we're going to talk about this today.  But, as a former NFL star, Jack, what did you think about the draft?</p><p>BREWER:  It was unbelievable to see the crowds.  I mean, if you watched that draft yesterday, it's become an event, like a Super Bowl, really.  I mean, I think there was 3, 400,000 people outside.  It's really amazing.  And to see a first round draft pick is also the first round draft pick in baseball.  I mean, this kid is a freak of nature.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And not only that, but the NFL network does, I mean, they do a lot of pomp and circumstance around this now.</p><p>BREWER:  They do.  I think the viewership was estimated to be around 11-1/2 million, unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is unbelievable.  All right, we'll talk more about that.  We got Jack Brewer on the panel today.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook troubles, the social media giant now under investigation for collecting e-mails and it sues three people over Instagram likes.  Wait until you hear this story.  We're going to explain it coming up, and then, the measles outbreak, hundreds of students and staff on two California campuses, have been quarantined.  That's all next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning, the Denver Post reporting multiple people are dead in a fiery crash near Colorado Mills Parkway, the I-70 closed eastbound.  There was an explosion and fire as a runaway semi plows into traffic, colliding with a school bus, 3 trucks and 12 cars, the crash, under investigation this morning.</p><p>The L.A. Times this morning, writes amid measles fears, more than 200 students and staff at L.A. universities have been quarantined.  Students at UCLA and Cal State L.A. are being asked to stay home this morning, in an effort to stem an outbreak.</p><p>Health officials ordering students and staff exposed to the measles, who cannot prove they are vaccinated, be quarantined.  And the New Orleans Advocate this morning, writes, New Orleans high school student gets 115 college acceptance letters, offered $3.8 million in scholarships.</p><p>High school senior Antoinette Love, says that she started applying to schools in September, and did not stop until her mailbox was overflowing with acceptance letters and scholarship offers.  The 18-year-old plans to major in Elementary Education.  Wow.  That's a nice story, isn't it?  You want to see that.</p><p>BREWER:  Very impressive.</p><p>BEVAN:  Back in my day, you apply to, what, three colleges, four colleges.  Now, you can just hit a button, you can apply to hundreds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that how you do it?</p><p>BEVAN:  Yes, yes.  So, that's why acceptance rates have gone down across the board.  But, you know, stories like this, 115?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty amazing.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  In my day, for acceptance, you would actually get a letter in the mail, now, you get an electronic.  You've seen those videos where the kids are sitting and their family around them and they just explode with happiness if they get into the school of their choice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I sort of like that, when it comes in the mail.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Yes.  Yes, there's something nice about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, quick break, and then, the trouble with Facebook, the social media giant under investigation this morning, by the New York Attorney General.  Plus, it's lawsuit over Instagram likes, the stock is down this morning.</p><p>And then, chief personalities, Bridgewater's Ray Dalio tests the personalities of Bill Gates and Elon Musk, hear the key area that both of them scored low in.  That's coming up, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 26th, your top stories right now, just before 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>We have breaking news right now, Uber IPO, with more details right now.

They did miss a record close, though, on the NASDAQ.  The Dow weighed down by 3M, which was down nearly 13 percent at the close yesterday.</p><p>Take a look at yesterday's numbers, at 4:00 on Wall Street.  The Dow Industrials gave up 135 points, one-half of one percent.  The S&amp;P was down one point.  The NASDAQ was up, though, it was up 16 points at the close, and the momentum continues this morning.</p><p>Let's check European indices right now.

We got your movie platform coming up for the weekend.</p><p>But first, our top stories this half an hour.  U.S.-China trade.  Chinese President Xi Jinping, signaling potential approval for President Trump's trade demands.</p><p>In a speech at the Belt and Road Forum, Xi Jinping pledged to address state subsidies, protect intellectual property rights, and allow foreign investment in most -- in more sectors, certainly.</p><p>A number of industries, all key issues in the trade negotiations right now.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with Robert Lighthizer, is set to travel to China for talks next week after my exclusive interview on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  He will join me Monday morning.  So, joining me for that before he leaves for China.</p><p>Joining us right now is the author of The Coming Collapse of China, Gordon Chang.  And Gordon, it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think gets done next week in China with these two gentlemen traveling to Beijing on Monday?</p><p>CHANG:  I've given up forecasting on this.  I mean, there's been a lot of optimistic stories over the course of the last six months.  Almost all of them have proved to really been premature.</p><p>You know, people say that there is going to be a trade deal, and it looks like it -- you know, Xi Jinping might come to Washington in June.  President Trump signaling that yesterday.  But, you know, things have falling off the cliff so many times.  So, you know, I'm saying, who knows?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, for a while, they were back and forth over the enforcements action that will be put.  Some kind of enforcement mechanism put in this deal.  So, should China steal?  Or go back on its promises, they can snap back to something on tariffs to enforce the situation.  Is that the sticking point right now, or is it something else?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, it is enforcement, but this is fantasyland.  You know, their idea is that we're going to put a provision in this agreement that China won't retaliate if we impose costs for China breaking the deal.  That is just ludicrous.  You know, and if we think that this is actually going to work, we're just deluding ourselves.  So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Tom, how do you see it?</p><p>BEVAN:  Well, my question, Gordon is, you know, under previous administrations, we tried to sort of a go along, get along strategy.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.</p><p>BEVAN:  We don't want a ruffling feathers.  Trump clearly changed the mentality when he came in and sort of punched China in the face.  Said, \"We're going to take a different approach.\"</p><p>Seems to be you are saying neither approach is really works.  So, what is the answer?  How do we stop China from cheating in?  Because countries around the globe sort of -- and even folks in America, they agree with the fundamental premise, but they may disagree about how to go about doing it.  So, what do we need to do to get this done?</p><p>CHANG:  We need to disengage our economy from China's if we want to reduce.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how do you do that?</p><p>BEVAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's the second-largest economy.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, it's already happening, though, Maria.  You know, companies are starting to see what's going on in China.  They are starting to losing patience, which is the reason why Xi Jinping is showing some flexibility.  Especially, in his talk at the Belt and Road Forum.</p><p>But you know, companies are now starting to say, look, India is important, China's economy is slowing.  The Chinese won't stop stealing.  And so, you know, I -- that that's the road we need to go.</p><p>I know that it is difficult politically to do.  But nonetheless, the economics are going to eventually dictate that.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Gordon, I'm curious what you think because there was a lot of talk about Xi Jinping coming here, having a meeting with the president at Mar-a-Lago.  Now, we're talking about sending our own delegation to China, and maybe they'll send the delegation back in May.  So, what happened there?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, you know, basically, now, Steve Bannon, I think to call that he said, this is a truce.  You know, President Trump sees a need, you know, 2020 elections.  Xi Jinping has a lot of reasons internally for a truce because he's got a weaker economy.  He's getting a lot of flak from people.  So, it would look good for him as well.</p><p>So, this isn't going to last, though, because we have decades of failed trade agreements.  And so, a signing up another trade agreement is not the remedy for decades of Chinese dishonesty.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Interesting.  Sorry, does that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about North Korea?  I mean, North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un telling the Korean central news agency.  The U.S. has been acting in bad faith since Kim met with President Trump in Hanoi.  Kim Jong-un making the comments during the summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>I mean, it's amazing to me that Putin just gets himself involved in everything.  Kim is warning that relations between North Korea and the U.S. could return to the original state.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, and then, they eventually will because -- you know, as you get to 2020, that important date in November, you know, the Democrats are going to rightly say, Trump's policies have failed.  So Trump has to pivot.  And I think the way he will pivot is to go back to vigorous enforcement of sanctions.</p><p>You know, Kim Jong-un, said that we have been bad since that Hanoi summit.  And that's an indication that he got what he wanted from Putin at that summit in Vladivostok.  But the point here is, you know, I think Kim is stalling.  When they talk about multilateral guarantees, the need for them, that's much more difficult to negotiate.  It takes a lot longer to get there, that means Kim can stall.</p><p>And also for Putin, it means he's got a place at the table because Russia will be giving those guarantees.  That gives them a veto over the final deal.  This is not going in the right direction.  But the good news, Maria, President Trump can turn around and say, \"I've had enough of this, I'm going to start sanctioning the Russians, the Chinese, the South Koreans.  I'm going to make everybody hurt.  And then, Kim will have no choice but to do what Trump wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will he do that?</p><p>CHANG:  I think he will.  Because as you say, this is a president who will punch you in the face if you don't give him what he wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.</p><p>BREWER:  As long as he doesn't start back shooting missiles, I'm OK with it all.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what about what he said about the death of Otto Warmbier?  I mean, the U.S. receiving a $2 million hospital bill from North Korea for Warmbier's care.  Warmbier who fell into a coma while being locked up in North Korea.  As you know, he died days after being returned to the United States.</p><p>And Washington Post this morning is reporting that the envoy sent to retrieve Warmbier, signed an agreement to pay on instructions from President Trump.  But a source is telling Fox News that the U.S. did not pay.</p><p>Can you imagine?  They basically killed him in North Korea, and now they want money for the care.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, the North Koreans will never see a penny of that.  And, you know, what we do to bring people back sometimes people may say is too much, but it's important for us to bring Americans back from regimes like that.</p><p>So, I'm not terribly fussed about signing an agreement that we have no intention to honor.  You know, and that's exactly what we did.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Yes, and it's interesting.  Because I've lived at China, and I've also lived in the Middle East.  Two dangerous places if you're detained for some reasons.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  So, I definitely believe the U.S. should support people if they do run into trouble in some of these foreign countries.  And as the White House said, they said we're not commenting on it because our negotiations are private, and that's actually what helps us with the success of them.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, it was very important to bring Otto Warmbier back even if in that coma.  Because these are just is symbolic.  And we're just not going to leave Americans at their hands.  But you know, on the other hand, we're just not going to pay.</p><p>This sort of is very similar to what happened in April 2001 with the EP-3, the Navy reconnaissance plane.  The Chinese give us a bill for room and board.  And we actually -- we offered to pay it.  But you know, the negotiations stalled.  So, we never paid the Chinese either.  And we shouldn't pay these regimes.  I don't mind agreeing to pay, but we should never, never, ever pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take about Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin?  I mean, Putin just wants it, get involved everywhere.  He's trying to replace the U.S. in the Middle East as the outsider.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, he's -- you know, cozying up to North Korea.  Trying to make it look like he had anything to do with these -- you know, calls for denuclearization.</p><p>CHANG:  Well, the one thing about Putin is that first of all, you know, Russia as a superpower is a piglet.  So, he doesn't really have the resources to trouble us in North Asia.  And he's much more focused on the Middle East, Central Asia, and the near abroad, in other words, Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  He will cause real trouble there because that's important to him.  In North Asia, he'll just sort of bedevil us, and Trump can give him a hard time in return.  Which is what our president should do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I -- we'll see who we watching the developments.  Gordon, it's great to see you.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Gordon Chang, there.  New legal troubles we will for Facebook.  Cheryl Casone with that in headlines now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  New York's attorney general is now investigating Facebook for collecting e-mails of more than a million users.</p><p>Social network admitted last week it had unintentionally uploaded e-mails of new users and had been doing it since May of 2016.</p><p>Meantime, Facebook is filling its own filing -- excuse, me its own lost.  So, they're suing a company and three people in New Zealand for allegedly selling fake likes and followers to Instagram users.</p><p>And you may have to find a new way to pass the time at work.  Facebook is cracking down on those really fun personality quizzes.  The company is saying that quiz apps will be banned completely, but they're going to be subject to heightened scrutiny.</p><p>The new policy coming a year after Cambridge Analytica reaped data about millions of Facebook users without their permission.</p><p>Well, speaking of personality quizzes, some big technology leaders coming up short on one part of a character test given by hedge fund founder, Ray Dalio.  Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos scored well for being assertive and open-minded, but not so well in another category concern for others.</p><p>Dalio, says a low score doesn't mean the leaders are heartless, but won't let hurt feelings stand in their way.  Dalio gives a similar personality test to people looking to join his company, Bridgewater Associates.  Of course, it's the largest hedge fund.  $150 billion in assets under management.</p><p>I don't think, I agree with the Bill Gates part of this one.  But OK, Maria, that's just my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's funny to see this.</p><p>CASONE:  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you guys think about that?</p><p>BREWER:  Ray Dalio is using all the money, so, whenever he -- whenever he talks, I listen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEVAN:  It's simply -- I mean, look, it's always interesting to see what these folks who are very, very successful in business when they share traits like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEVAN:  It's fascinating to watch.  That's can you see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is.  Because they have done so well.</p><p>BEVAN:  Yes, and clearly, there's -- there is something that it takes to have that sort of drive, and even if it's maybe not the best characteristic, it's what's propelled them to their success.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For sure.  I will take a short break.  When we come back, we are back in business on earnings.</p><p>Exxon and Chevron will be reporting earnings this morning.  Plus, American airlines hitting the tape next hour.  All numbers that we will have for you, coming up.</p><p>Plus, the end of an era, \"Avengers: End Game,\" shakes up to smash box-office records this weekend.  A full film roundup for your weekend, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We turn to earlier -- we have breaking news this morning on Uber.  The company is announcing that it expects its IPO price -- the company also revealing the IPO will release up to 180 million shares of stock.  Jack, you reported on this at the top of the show.  This is going to be the deal of the year, right?</p><p>DEANGELIS:  It really is.  And I think the company is going with that conservative strategy here.  Remember, we were tossing around numbers on valuation of $120 billion.  Even at the high end of the range, they are well below that at this point, so I think they're taking a cautious approach.  When they approach the street to get investors excited about this deal, mostly because of what they saw happen with Lyft.  Now, I think it's a very different company, but at the same time you sort of have to take your cues from the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about lift and the fact that it hasn't made any money.  This company public and did well on day one, but then proceeded to trade down.  I mean, should we be looking at Lyft as, you know, as a predicate for what might happen with Uber?</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Unfortunately, I think that's what a lot of people are going to do even though the companies are different and there are nuances that investors will be looking at, but that's sort of just the precedent that's been set.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's Lyft shares right now, up two-thirds of a percent this morning.  Well, we've been covering Lyft and a lot of big news this -- it's been a really busy week.  Take a look at the highlights from MORNINGS WITH MARIA this week, in case you missed it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  33,000 e-mails, he didn't have somebody bust up his phone with a hammer, and he didn't bleach bit which is what organized criminals do and terrorists launder money.  Bleached by the server -- she did what we call obstructive acts, precisely what couldn't be found with regard to the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the Mueller report?</p><p>KEN STARR, FORMER UNITED STATES SOLICITOR GENERAL:  Great news for the country; we don't want our president to be in league with foreign power whether it's Russia or anyone else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think William Barr is going to investigate the investigators?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think every indication is that he is going to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, you were tapped by the president to be nominated for a spot on the Federal Reserve Board but you have pulled your consideration back, declining that.  What led to the decision, Herman?</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST:  The straw that broke the camel back was a discussion that I had with two administration staffers who told me all the things that I could not do if I became a Federal Reserve board governor.  I could not run my business; I could not pursue my business interests and I had to be nonpolitical.  That's like taking a racehorse, putting them in a stable and not letting him run.</p><p>BRIAN HOOK, DIRECTOR OF POLICY PLANNING AND SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR TO SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO:  The current set of oil waivers expire on May 2nd.  We've been working very closely with the Saudis and the Emiratis, with American producers to ensure that even as we take off the last one million barrels that Iran exporting, that we still have a very well-supplied and stable oil market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These boots were made for you.  (INAUDIBLE) custom boots has built a reputation for its patriotic custom cowboy boots.  Tell us about how you make them?</p><p>LISA SORRELL, COWBOY BOOT MAKER:  Each boot is personally made by me from hand tools and vintage machinery and flat pieces of leather.  And it's just me in my shop, by myself, build a pair of boots.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to introduce you to a Room that is bringing privacy to work.  The company producing a soundproof of office phone booth, and it's an office phone booth -- giving workers a private space for meetings, phone calls and everyday office task.  What are the benefits of using this phone booth?</p><p>BRIAN CHEN, CEO, ROOM:  Well, first of all, it's soundproof so it reduces noise by 29 decibels.  We've achieved that by using over a thousand recycled plastic bottles in the walls of this phone booth, that's used for sound absorbing.  We also do that -- we use this (INAUDIBLE) which seals magnetically.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Woods will never be the same.  A new camping experience provided by Brooklyn-based Terra Glamping.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  These are our sleeping tents that we have at our glamping hotels.  And all of the tents have memory phone mattresses and beautiful betting on them, so that when you're -- you can sleep after (INAUDIBLE), you can have that fresh air wafting through, but you can be comfortable.  We have everything that you need from, you know, face wash and sunscreen to cell phone chargers and books.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking of (INAUDIBLE), reporting earnings this Wednesday -- investors are getting a preview of the new driverless car technology today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It almost reminds me of Apple when it came out.  You know, it wasn't as cool as its iPhone; the technology and the ecosystem had to catch up when all the pieces were in place.  Up into that point, it can be very disappointing to people who think they're going to get kicked from knight rider.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Generation-Z, the hitting the brakes apparently when it comes to getting a driver's license and actual buying cars.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Not cool, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you and I were teenagers -- I mean, it was the cool thing to get your license and get a car.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I got my driver's license in a Ford F-150 pick-up truck.  And I wrecked -- I had an accident about two weeks after I got my driver's license.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh no.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And my father still reminds me because there's a missing bush in somebody's front yard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Before we're done, we still have one promise to keep.  If we can't protect the Earth, we can be damn sure we'll avenge it.  Whatever it takes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from the movie of the year, could be the movie of the summer: \"Avengers: Endgame,\" it hit theaters yesterday.  The conclusion of the Marvel Universe's infinity saga is projected to smash box office records this weekend.  Joining me is WBAI Radio Chief Film Critic Mike Sargent.  Great to see you, Mike.</p><p>MIKE SARGENT, CHIEF FILM CRITIC, WBAI RADIO:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You saw it and you loved it.</p><p>SARGENT:  Not only did I love it, but you know, you have put this in context.  It's historical -- nothing has been done on this scale to have 21 films over ten years that take place in the same universe, interconnected then put it all together and give a satisfying end.  That's kind of amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, it is.</p><p>SARGENT:  It is.  And what's great about this is and what Marvel has done is each film, each character has its own tone but not just tone but it's a different genre.  You know, a Thor movie is fish out of water, Spiderman's coming-of-age, the Winter Soldier is a spy movie.  This has everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, was this the right -- the fitting finale to the saga that began with Iron Man back in 2008?</p><p>SARGENT:  Not only is it a fitting saga, but I would even suggest: go back and watch any of old the movies that you loved and it will pay off when you see this movie.  Because this movie, really, you will gasp, you will laugh, you will clap, you will cry --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>SARGENT:  You'll everything -- everything you want to do in a movie, you will do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You loved it.</p><p>SARGENT:  I couldn't not love it.  Let me just say that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happens next from Marvel?  I mean, in the movie universe, they've been at this since 2008, so what happens now?</p><p>SARGENT:  Well, two things.  I have prediction.  First of all, you know, we're kind of -- this is kind of the end, the Endgame is the end of an old regime.  We're going to have new Avengers, new heroes, new focuses.  So, I think we're going to have a lot more female heroes, heroes of color, and just characters that you didn't know so well about -- you know, like \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\"  I think that's what's going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  I see.  All right, let me ask you about the cast of this next James Bond movie, because it's been unveiled: Oscar Winner, Rami Malek.  Is that how you say --</p><p>SARGENT:  Rami Malek, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- playing the film's villain in what will be Daniel Craig's final turn as 007.</p><p>SARGENT:  Well, I think it's going to be a great cast.  I think Rami Malek is a great villain.  He's not somebody you really see as a villain because he's always such a nice guy -- you know, just won an Oscar for playing Freddie Mercury.  But I think the rest of the cast is pretty great too.  I think at this point, you know, so much has happened with his character; this is kind of the final arc, the end game for James Bond.  So, we have to really how they're going to wrap things up for this closure to this bond chapter until they reboot him and make him -- who knows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  He was great as Freddie Mercury.  That movie was great.  I loved it.</p><p>SARGENT:  Well, you know, he's a great actor.  He's one of those actors who's been around a long time.  You'll realize: oh, he was in that, he was in that, he was in this -- and you didn't realize, because he's such a character actor.  So, it's good to see him getting his deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is.  All right, so \"Avengers\" is the film of the weekend.</p><p>SARGENT:  It's not the film of the weekend or the film of the year --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Film of the year?</p><p>SARGENT:  I think it's the film of the decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>SARGENT:  Think about it, it is going to make quite potentially and maybe I'll be back to talk about it -- almost $1 billion in four or five days.  Worldwide.  That's never been done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm going to go on that recommendation.  Mike, good to see you.</p><p>SARGENT:  You have.  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Mike Sargent, there.  Still ahead, stay with us, when Fortnite meets the Avengers -- a new gaming crossover now getting a lot of attention.  That's next hour right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2216419838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-79N1-DY0W-413W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 26. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. We're watching earnings. ExxonMobil just hitting the tape right now. Two Dow components in fact reporting this hour. Oil giant, ExxonMobil is hitting the tape right now with $63.63 billion dollars in revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chevron is coming out later this hour. As you can see, both stocks are fractionally better on the session. ExxonMobil pretty much flat. Chevron up two-thirds of a percent ahead of this. ExxonMobil shares are trading down right now as we are looking at some disappointment on these numbers as they just right now hit the tape. Revenue is $63.63 billion. We want to find out what the company is saying about the road ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The stock has now traded lower, going into these numbers as the numbers are hitting the tape, and as you can see, we are showing you revenue is light versus the estimate which was $64.8 billion in revenue. And the actual numbers are 63.6 billion. So we got a slight miss on revenue for ExxonMobil. That's a Dow component that's going to impact markets this morning. The stock down 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>We are also waiting on GDP. This is the first reading of the first quarter. The estimate there is growth of two percent although there is a lot higher numbers on the street. J.P. Morgan is looking for 2.9 percent in GDP. Others are around 2.3 percent but the estimates that we've got for GDP for the first quarter is two percent even. Those numbers out in 30 minutes time. As you can see, futures are lower this morning.</p><p>Dow futures indicating a decline of 75 points right out of the gate, about a quarter of a percent lower. Exxon is going to be an issue here. S&amp;P 500 down five points down five points right now and the NASDAQ down almost a point, fractional move. Intel is set to cut 28 points off the Dow Industrials at the opening of trading. So Intel is also an issue when you look at Intel and ExxonMobil looks like we're going to have a down opening this morning.</p><p>Yesterday markets were pretty active. And take a look what happened at the close. DowIndustrials were down 135 points at the close yesterday. As you can see, one-half of one percent. S&amp;P 500 down one point, the NASDAQ was up -- the NASDAQ was up 16 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>European indices right now looking like this and they are mostly lower. FT-100 down20 points, CAC quarante in Paris is down one point and the DAX Index also slipping its negative territory right now down about a point as you can see. And in Asia overnight, the markets there were focused on the Japanese industrial production. It was down at the fastest pace in almost four years. The Nikkei Average down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite was down 1-1/4 percent. Xi Jinping made some comments that it is willing to make some real concessions to the United States including protecting I.P. The President of China made some important comments overnight about the Chinese economy and what they're going to do. We've got all of those comments coming up. And then there's this. The Uber IPO offering 180 million shares.</p><p>The company says it will price between $44 and $50 a share. The company will start its road show today. Border crisis. At least 1300 immigrants staged a mass escape from a Mexican shelter. What the Pentagon is looking to do about the growing problem of people crossing the border into the United States. And then there's this. 2020 race, we're covering this morning. Former Vice President Joe Biden said he asked former President Obama not to endorse him.</p><p>Yes. He did not want the endorsement. President Trump says, Sleepy Joe will not be able to do the job. He calls him not the brightest light bulb in the group. The President has started the attacks on what could did his competitor come next year's election, Joe Biden. Breaking news right now. Exxon is reporting its first quarter earnings. We told you the numbers and it is a revenue missed Lauren Simonetti with more on the Exxon quarter. Lauren, over to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes. And Exxon, Maria, as you know is one of the two Dow stocks that our energy components reporting today at -- with the two, three percent decline in the stock to three percent decline that we're seeing right now. This is set to shave about 13 points from the Dow Jones Industrial average. But just so you know, if you add Exxon and Chevron together, this is just about five percent price weighting.</p><p>Let's get to these Exxon numbers because they are disappointing. If you look at the bottom line, the EPS number, we got 55 cents a share, we were looking for 69 cents and we're seeing a miss on revenue as well. It came in a $63.63 billion. The street was looking for 64.82. If you look deeper into this report, there is also a slight miss on the amount of oil that Exxon was hoping to pump per day.</p><p>They were looking at a number of four million barrels per day. That came in slightly below that at 3.98 million. Look ahead to this conference call. It's rare but we will once again hear from the CEO Darren Woods on that call. The focus on Wall Street we heard a few days ago that deeper into this report, there is also a slight miss on the amount of oil that Exxon was upping their dividend to 87 cents.</p><p>That was about a six percent increase. Wall Street and analyst want to see more share buybacks, increasing of dividends and basically to get the debt down for these oil giants, Exxon being one of them. So, unfortunately this looks like loser today. It's coming back a little bit. The stock right now but still down well over two percent, Maria. Chevron is coming out in about a half hour time.</p><p>Let me just get you the preview for that company. We're looking for $1.30 per share in earnings. Revenue of $38.42 billion. And of course with the Chevron story, we want to hear any and everything and if there will be a bidding war with Occidental who has a higher bid for Anadarko at this point. So, that stock ahead of the earnings for Chevron is down just about half of one percent. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren. Thanks so much. The stock of Exxon, one of the issues for the Dow certainly day down almost three percent. We are waiting on GDP. We want lock the at Trump economy right now. President Trump touted tax cuts and economic accomplishments in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. We have gotten rid of the individual mandate. We had the biggest cut in regulations which is one of the things creating all great jobs because we have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. Today we have most people working literally today just came out we have the most people working, than we've ever had in the history of our country almost 160 million people are working to have jobs.</p><p>And it is incredible the economy is setting records. When foreign leaders come in to see me, Sean, they always say, thank you and it's great to meet you, sir, and congratulations on your economy. It's the greatest economy anywhere in the world which it is, nobody is even close to us. And that's because of the things we've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This as we are waiting on the first quarter GDP this morning. It is due out in about 25 minutes. Joining me right now is Harvard economics professor, former IMF Chief Economist, Ken Rogoff. Ken, it is always good to see you.</p><p>KEN ROGOFF, HARVARD ECONOMICS PROFSSOR: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. How would you characterize the economy right now?</p><p>ROGOFF: It is very strong. I mean, the U.S. economy is on oasis of strength outside of China anywhere in the world, it's doing very well. I mean, it's not growing at six percent, but we're probably growing at 2-1/2 percent and I think it is possible we could be growing at three percent in coming years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, we're getting the GDP out for the first quarter. We had a government shutdown, we had worries about Europe, worries about China in the first quarter. What would you say about things slowing down as a result of some of the outside forces that the U.S. is facing like Europe?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, it hasn't happened. I think we talked about that when I came on last and we were wondering, you know, you were wondering if it would come here but it hasn't. Europe has picked up a little China, it's definitely stabilized but it hasn't hit us. Now, you can't read that much into one quarter's numbers and stuff like inventory accumulation. People might over rushed imports ahead of something, there goes the shutdown.</p><p>I don't know what it's going to be. I'd say between two and 2-1/2. But it isn't anything like some of the predictions that we were hearing a month ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It can, everybody's hair was on fire six months, recession is coming and we just keep getting one number better than the next every day.</p><p>ROGOFF: Yes. The global economy is stable. I think even compared to a couple weeks ago when I was at the IMF meetings, the global economy is looking more stable. I mean, China is a declining trend. Europe may look like Japan over the next 10 or 20 years. But the United States seems to be rising above that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Let me ask you about the op-ed that you wrote. You wrote an op-ed this morning on big tech going into 2020 and the presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, her plan to reign big tech. Your write this, Warren is courageous because big tech is big money for most leading Democratic candidates. Particularly progressives for whom California is a variable campaign financing ATM.</p><p>And although one can certainly object, Warren is not alone in thinking that tech giants have gained excessive market dominance. In fact it is one of the few issue in Washington on which there is some semblance of agreement and you're right because you got Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both saying two different sides of the spectrum, both saying, get these companies to break up.</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, I don't know what the solution is but it isn't just big tech, it's big everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good point.</p><p>ROGOFF: Big pharma. The rise in monopoly power or something that's really started to sees economist a little last couple years. The Fed had its Jackson Hole big central bankers conference about that last year. The antitrust has been asleep the last 40 years. Forget about the last years. And big tech is kind of the poster child of this but they're not the only one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you know what, it's not just bigness for the tech companies. I mean, they've actually abused their power. When you take a look at how they've given, you know, all the privacy breaches, just given our data away, selling it to the advertising industry. So, do you think we're going to see a heavier hand in terms of regulation? You know what Europe has done. I don't think the U.S. is going to see -- do what Europe has done.</p><p>They're really come down hard on these companies but will we see some tweaking in terms of the regulatory burdens?</p><p>ROGOFF: Oh, absolutely. I have heard this phrase surveillance capitalism that we've moved into. I think as people understand when you write, you know, an e-mail, if you may see an advertisement about it later. If you do it on your Gmail, I mean, there are concerns like that that are coming out. But the idea that some of the big tech companies would be able to buy up potential competitors I think is very problematic and they haven't been cautious on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, I -- you know, it's interesting because you know, we know this is coming, it's got to come, right? And yet, these stocks are trading at incredible valuations. So, I wonder what they think.</p><p>ROGOFF: So, one thing is that the United States is just ruling in tech. I was recently in China and you think about, oh, the China is going to take over. Well, they are competitors. I think the thing I learned more and more is Europe is not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROGOFF: United States --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- one innovation out that's come of Europe in the last 10 years.</p><p>ROGOFF: I -- you're putting me on the spot --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGOFF: The research was probably done in the United States. I mean, they have a lot of patents but then you find out the research teams are here in the United States. So the U.S. is really leading the world in a lot of things and that I think is one of our sources of strength.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there is worry that China is ahead of us on A.I.?</p><p>ROGOFF: They are. And it was interesting President Xi made some concessions about trade and all things they would do but I didn't hear anything about cyberspying or cybersecurity. I don't -- I don't think they will invent anything in A.I. that we didn't invent first and they steal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll see. And by the way, President Xi Jinping on the tape this morning with comments he made yesterday that they're going to start protecting intellectual property. They're going to buy more and they're going to -- from the U.S. and they're going to open up their markets. So, obviously the President's, you know, pushing back on China is moving the needle in terms of what the Chinese are willing to do.</p><p>ROGOFF: This was remarkable because, you know, everyone said the Chinese, they will move but they will not move because the U.S. is complaining. You let us do it if you push us, we won't do anything. And, you know, he didn't mention cyberspying but he talked about intellectual property. They event went to a currency agreement which I frankly don't think is a good idea. I think it's a bad concession but even to that, it was -- yes, really quite remarkable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Remarkable what Xi Jinping said last night, right?</p><p>ROGOFF: Yes. Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, I don't know if he will do what he said he is going to do but that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the thing. That's why they're fighting over an enforcement mechanism.</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, that is not going to happen in a good way. But the fact he said it is already really surprising.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I totally agree. Now, you made comments recently on the Federal Reserve suggesting that the world may be facing an end to central bank independence. What do you think?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, I mean, certainly you look around at smaller countries, you know, Turkey, Hungary, Venezuela, Argentina, there have been a lot of problems with central bank independents. But I think the fundamental problem is a lot of people, you talk to people and they say, inflation, that's 20th century. You can't have inflation in the 21st Century. Why do we need an independent central bank on? I think they've got that so wrong. Unfortunately in some countries I hope not ours will find out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. You're to be my special guest this weekends, Ken, and I'm -- I appreciate you joining me this weekend on \"MARIA BARTIROMO'S WALL STREET\", THAT'S tonight AT 9:00 p.m. Eastern. Join myself and Ken Rogoff for that. We will see you little later. Thank you, Ken.</p><p>Coming up, the advance reading on first quarter GDP is due out in about 15 minutes' time. We are expecting two percent growth for the quarter. This is the first reading for the first quarter. We'll have that number when we come right back. And then earnings in focus. Disappointing results from oil giant ExxonMobil. Stock is down 2-1/3 percent right now. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Dow component, ExxonMobil disappointing on earnings this morning. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more details. Gerri, good morning.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey Maria, good morning to you. Yes. We have a double disappointment, a miss on the bottom and top lines, 55 cents a share was earnings expectations of 69 cents a share on revenue. $63.36 billion was the number expectations of 64.82 billion.</p><p>Crude prices strengthening during the quarter. The company said but weaker in the fourth quarter. We're watching for Chevron in moments. $1.30 a share is the expectation. Will they up their offer for Anadarko, we'll be watching for that. American Airlines beating APS estimates coming at 52 cents a share versus 51. Missing estimates on revenue. They say that their results affected by higher oil prices in the government shutdown.</p><p>Amazon last night, profit more than doubles but people didn't like the revenue growth slowing, sluggish on line retails blamed here. One day free shipping for prime members, that's my good news story for you today. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you. The advance reading on first quarter GDP due out in 10 minutes' time. We're expecting growth of two percent for the quarter. We'll have that number when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- 20 in focus, President Trump weighing in on the 2020 Democratic primary candidates last night on \"HANNITY.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think that, you know, when you look at Joe, I've known Joe over the years. He's not the brightest light bulb in the group, I don't think but he has a name that they know. He is fading very fast. I think he is fading very, very fast. It looks like he is going to be a thing in the past pretty soon but he was -- he was a hot item for a little while. Well, I don't -- I don't see either of them.</p><p>I think she is got a little bit of a nasty wit but that might be it. And Mayor Pete is not going to make it. I would hope he would. I hope --I'm rooting for him but he's not going to make.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now, former House Speaker, Fox News Contributor, author of the new book, the political thriller, Collusion, just out by Newt Gingrich. Newt, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congrats on the new book. First, let's talk about the President's assessment --</p><p>GINGRICH: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you agree with what he just said?</p><p>GINGRICH: Oh pretty much. So I think the problem that Vice President Biden has that he has a past. My newsletter today talks about the Kate Smith statute being taken down in Philadelphia from the flyers arena. Because out of 3,000 songs she recorded in her career, in 1931 recorded two songs that had what are seen as racist language and, therefore, she is no longer acceptable even though she introduced America to the song God Bless America and became a national icon.</p><p>Now, he is going to find himself in the Kate Smith statute problem. Anita Hill repudiates his effort to apologize, he has yet to be encountered on the fact that he used to support amendments with Jesse Helms to stop bussing for desegregation purposes. You go back ahead a long career. And you deal with the modern left-wing Democrats, they have zero tolerance for anybody who is imperfect and he is by definition going to turn out pretty imperfect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, we want to turn to the Russia investigation, Newt, we've got new techs messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. They show that the two were discussing using post-election briefings to the Trump team to gain more information on the campaigns dealings with Russia. Senate Homeland Security Committee members urged Attorney General Barr to investigate this matter.</p><p>Look, Mr. Speaker we know for the last two years you've heard it here first, that there was no collusion and this whole narrative was a complete lie. Do you think there's going to be accountability here?</p><p>GINGRICH: I hope so. I have a lot of faith in the Attorney General Barr. I think he believes in the rule of law. We had an amazing level of corruption. I think the President is right. It was in effect and attempted coup to defeat the duly elected president of the United States on the part of the deep state. And you had FBI bureaucrats who talking upon themselves to try to reverse the results of the election.</p><p>And I think that clearly had the fingerprints, just talking right back to Joe Biden by the way because you had the Attorney General doing things that he should not have been doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH: You know, you have to presume that Vice President and President Obama knew it and then you ask the question, so did Joe Biden know any of this? I mean, was he in the loop? Was he aware of what's going on? I don't think this is going to go away. I think now it's going to get worse for the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a really good point. What did Biden know. Tom, you've written about this obviously in RealClearPolitics and we want to know how high up the ladder this was in the Obama administration because the strategy to take Trump down was so -- I mean, it was just so wide ranging from informants to the dossier, to MediaLink strategy. It's incredible.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, REALCLEARPOLITICS, COFOUNDER AND PRESIDENT: It is. And I do think we will get accountability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You do?</p><p>BEVAN: I do. We may not get it as quickly as we want because -- but I do think there is going to be accountability. We will find out exactly how this happened. I think Republicans, Lindsey Graham in the Senate in particular will be able to drive the process to try to and uncover as much get -- and as much transparency. We deserve this transparency. The American people deserve it especially after what we just went through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it was two years, Newt, of this, you know, collusion delusion where the whole country is going on this goose chase because people like, you know, John -- people like Brennan and Clapper are using words like treason and collusion.</p><p>GINGRICH: Right. I mean, look -- I mean, look, I think there are so many people guilty trying of trying to undermine the U.S. constitution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH: This has to be thoroughly looked at. But let me also point out that Mueller at some point had to know there was no collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I wonder when he knew it that he let the midterm elections come and go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right? He let the midterm elections come and go.</p><p>GINGRICH: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All about this in Newt's new book, Collusion. Newt Gingrich, great to see you, sir. I want to get to a break because we got the GDP on the other side of this break. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 26th. We're waiting on breaking news right now. The advanced reading on first quarter GDP due out in about 10 seconds. Economists are looking for growth of at least two percent. The estimates go all the way up to 2.9 percent if you believe J.P. Morgan. We're also waiting on earnings, Dow Component Chevron is 3.2. 3.2 percent is the number on GDP this morning. That is a very strong number for the first quarter advanced.</p><p>Let's look at markets to see if we have any changes here because you're looking at oil stocks. We're waiting on Chevron earnings but the market is coming back from the lows here with this GDP number out, up 3.2 percent, much better than the estimates which calls for growth of two percent, all the way to 2.9 percent. This is a very strong number for the first quarter and of course remember we had a government shutdown, we had worries about slow growth, and coming off of a very volatile end of year last year with markets trading real volatile and down at the end last year. First quarter GDP, bouncing back up 3.2 percent, is the number and that is moving markets this morning. Take a look at futures now, all in positive territory across the board. Dow Industrials up nine points, S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/4 and the NASDAQ up 33 points with this first quarter GDP number, which is above expectations.</p><p>Intel and Exxon are pressures on the Dow Industrials, however. We are expecting Exxon and Intel to be lower on the heels of disappointments on earnings. Joining us right now for reaction on the GDP number is MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy. Stephanie, great to see you. And the last time you were here, you said we're going to start seeing good shoots, green shoots.</p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Positive news in the economy. Is this what you were referring to?</p><p>POMBOY: Well, this first quarter number, though, is a real surprise. I mean I was thinking that we would start to see stronger numbers as we got into the second quarter the fact that first quarter growth was so much stronger than expected is amazing. I -- you know, I was prepared to talk about how inventories were going to be a contribution to the number and that would be part of what was driving it up, but I wasn't expecting a three handle on this number.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>POMBOY: So it's going to be interesting to look at the details here, but again there was going to be a big contribution from inventories which obviously isn't a positive going forward because you have to unwind those inventories, and then another contributing factor was going to be trade, where we were actual going to see an increase in exports which would help drive, you know, narrow the trade deficit and lift GDP, and that's not going to continue cps the strength in the dollar is going to act as a headwind to that.</p><p>But I agree with you, Maria. I mean I think this number looks stronger and I think moving through the next let's say four, six weeks, we should see some stronger consumer numbers which is going to be, you know, it'd be really interesting in what the consumer spending component was here, but I do think we'll see stronger some stronger prints there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean -- I mean the personal -- the personal consumption number is what we want to really focus on in the GDP. Last week, when I interviewed Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, he basically said that the economy -- the consumer's balance sheet is the best that it's been in 30 years because of very low debt, and wages which are up better than three percent year-over-year.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes. I mean I guess the important thing with the consumer is that you're painting them with one brush and there really isn't an average consumer any more. There is the high end and the low end. But I do think we should see some stronger numbers on the consumer franchise because there they were so depressed for three months. We, you know, we had retail sales, basically down for three months straight and consumer spending more broadly was weaker.</p><p>And part of that was a function of the meltdown in the fourth quarter in the markets that really depressed psychology, both on the consumer front and the corporate front. But what I think is fascinating about this first quarter GDP print is now it sets up the dilemma that I talked about with you talking when I was talking about this risk of an upside bounce, upside risk, is that we have the fed meeting next week.</p><p>And, you know, what is Powell going to say about they backpedaled frantically here talking about even pausing the unwind of the balance sheet, the markets pricing in a rate cut, then we get this number?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>POMBOY: I mean I don't know if anyone was looking for three percent growth in any quarter this year --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>POMBOY: -- much less the first quarter which is the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the question now becomes, what does the fed say at that meeting on Wednesday? Are they going to tilt toward, \"Well, we're out of the way, no rate hikes certainly?\" People talk about a rate cut or are they going to say things are coming back, things are strong, maybe a rate hike is on the table for 2019?</p><p>POMBOY: I mean, how manic depressive do they look? I mean with apologies to your former employer, these guys start to look like the Jim Cramers of monetary policy. You know, there -- you know, one day, they think the economy is hot, and the next day they think it's soft. So, I think this is really going to set up the dilemma for the financial markets is that better news now, they don't know what to do with that, well, does the bond market selloff here? And if it does, doesn't that have a dampening effect on the stock market?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>POMBOY: I mean I fear the return of the bond vigilantes, which is what I talked to you about the last time, is that stronger growth really sets up increased volatility in the financial markets which generally is not a friend to prices, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>POMBOY: Uncertainty is going to be a major issue here around monetary policy.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP: Does this help us take a ever harder stance against China right now with the trade negotiations?</p><p>POMBOY: I guess that's a good point, yes. You know, their data started to look a little better, but this number is definitely, like I said, you know, you didn't expect three percent in any quarter, much less the first quarter which is normally just really seasonally weak.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here's what -- here's what Jamie Dimon told me, the head of the nation's largest bank, just last week about the consumer and the economy today. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE. What we see in the U.S. is that the American consumer, their balance sheet, their incomes, are going - - are strong, not weak, more people going back to the workforce, which is a good thing, companies are in very good shape, profits are good, capital expenditures still going up, business and consumer confidence high levels, housings in short supply, so it's kind of a tailwind. The -- and the fed is on pause, which I think they did the right thing, which means it's going to give people more time to adjust a little bit of slowdown.</p><p>But it's -- it seems it's just a little slowdown. And just -- other than trade, I'm not sure what's going to stop it in the next year or two. I'm prepared for it to get bad, but I'm not predicting it. I'm saying, no, you can actually have a pretty good environment for a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you don't see a recession in the next couple of years?</p><p>DIMON: I don't.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: No recession. So where did this come from, that we were going to see a recession in 2019 and 2020?</p><p>POMBOY: Well, I think the one pushback I would have to him and the risk I view of the recession comes from the corporate sector. You know, he makes a good point that the consumers' in better shape than they were, that's not the problem this time. The problem is the leveraging up in the corporate sector, and we have a huge amount of debt rolling this year. We have almost $800 billion in corporate debt that rolls this year, and another $900 billion next year. Corporate borrowing costs have rallied back alongside with the stock market over the last few months, but they're still above where they were in September and they're well above where they were at the lows.</p><p>So, we're going to see corporations trying to, you know, refinance this massive amount of debt, and, you know, if my concerns about the return of the bond vigilantes bear any sort of fruit, that could create some real dislocations on the corporate side, which ultimately hits back to consumers because if companies are having struggles refinancing debt, they're certainly not going to rush out to increase wages and hire more people. So, it all kind of feeds back together.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: All valid points, for sure, but at the same time, the bull market surpassing that 10-year mark, sort of giving investors' confidence that, you know, no, this wasn't just a seven to ten-year cycle after the great recession, but actually this may have legs to go a lot further.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes. I mean what I come back to on the stock market front is it's all going to coming down to earnings, you know. I think that the first quarter obviously, people have sort of kitchen sink that, we know the first quarter numbers are going to be weak, but the forecast look for an increase in earnings, in the out quarters and ultimately going back to double digits next year. So this is really viewed as sort of a one queue phenomenon and everything will recover.</p><p>and, again, you know, my concerns about the corporate borrowing side have me less bullish on the earnings outlook, and I think that could be a risk, you know, that maybe if you look at guidance, for example, even as companies are sort of narrowly beating this incredibly depressed guidance in the -- expectations in the first quarter, guidance is really fairly negative, certainly very cautious in the out quarter. So, we'll see what happens there, but I think that could be the real wrinkle in the whole picture, is what happens with this leveraging of the corporate balance sheets, not the consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is the first reading of the GDP for the first quarter, it is up 3.2 percent, the estimate calls for growth two percent, this is wildly better than expectations, some people were expecting up to 2.9 percent. That was the estimate out of J.P. Morgan, but whatever way you look at it, this has smashed through estimates on the GDP number. Tom, how do you see it?</p><p>BEVAN: Well, again, I'm -- my wheelhouse is politics, right? So, I look at all these numbers through the political lens. I mean this is a huge win for President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>TOM: You know, we were talking about the trade war with China, everyone's talking -- I mean just a few weeks ago, we had the fed saying .5 percent growth for first quarter? We're now 3.2. So, this is -- the economy continues to be much more resilient than people have estimated. And that bodes well for him moving into his reelection.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, we have a huge week next week, we got the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, as you noted.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The China PMIs, that's the Purchasing Managers Index, this gives us a sense of manufacturing in China for the month of April. You've got inflation numbers, the PCE coming out next week, and then, of course, you got the jobs numbers at the end of the week, no doubt we're going to see wages probably either go up, or stay at a level of 3.2 percent year- over-year. So, this is all good news.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes. It's going to be -- it's going to be a very interesting week because like you talked about, we have all those indicators, we also have personal income and spending numbers, the broader numbers, and it'll be interesting to see what Powell says about that in the presser on the 1st. It's really -- this is the conundrum now, is good news good news or is good news bad news?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me just -- let me just give you a couple of highlights here because the first quarter consumer spending was up 1.2 percent --</p><p>POMBOY: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- versus fourth quarter 2-1/2 percent. You have business investment, up 2.7 percent, equipment up two tenths of a percent, intellectual property software in terms of business investment, 8.6 percent, Stephanie.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Business investment into intellectual property and software up 8.6 percent. That is a fantastic number.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So when people say capex has slowed down, I'm not buying it, OK? Capex into I.P. up 8-1/2 percent.</p><p>POMBOY: Yes, that's actually -- that number is stronger, the other ones are weaker than expected, although PCE was pretty much exactly as expected, the consumer spending number at 1-2, I think estimates were for 1-1, which, again, is less than half of what it was in the prior quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The first quarter PCE price index, up six tenths of a percent.</p><p>POMBOY: Uh-huh. So we'll see what Powell says about that. I mean I think that's a little heavier than he might necessarily want to see. All in all, this is going to be right now the Fed is scratching its head as to what they're going to do, and I would focus very heavily on the bond market over the next few weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. All right. We're going to --</p><p>POMBOY: I think that's really going to be the story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to be watching that. As we've been talking, we haven't even mentioned Chevron earnings, they're mixed. Let's get to Lauren Simonetti. She's looking at the Chevron quarter right now. Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, Maria. And investors are trying to figure out how to respond this. Initially the stock went up as opening bell. Chevron is a Dow Component, it has a three percent waiting on that average. It's still up, it did go down. Now it's up about not even a tenth of one percent, at 117.98. The number that was impressive was the bottom line number, EPS was $1.39 a share, as you noted, Maria. The expectation was $1.30, net income coming at $2.6 billion, that was better than expected. The problem is with revenue, $35.2 billion, the estimate was for $38.4 billion.</p><p>So I'm still going through this report, of course we need to listen to the conference call. we need to hear if anything, and I'm sure there will tons of questions from the CEO Mike Wirth, he's going to be quizzed about is Chevron going to up their bid for Anadarko after that occidental bid came in. Oil promises have been higher, so this is good for the -- for the oil companies, but you have to remember when a lot of them started lowering their estimates, that was when oil was much lower than it is right now. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren. Thank you so much. Joining us right now, PRICE Futures Group Energy Analyst, Phil Flynn. Phil, weight in here on the Chevron numbers, especially since occidental petroleum is going to be outbidding Chevron in its acquisition of Anadarko. It's offering $38 billion, which, of course, is topping the chevron bid, which was $33 billion. We got a fight going on for this company.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP ENERGY ANALYST: You sure do, and I think this is the first of many, Maria, down in the Permian Basin. All the big oil companies, ExxonMobil, Chevron, you name it, think the future is down in taxes, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Its energy in fact --</p><p>FLYNN: With the Shell oil right now in, and so this is what we're seeing right now at this time. So, if you look at what's really going on here, you know, with today's earning, it really shows you that Chevron looks like it's a much better-run company than ExxonMobil if you compare the two people. Chevron's been a leader, of course. They were first in the Permian, they've expanding first, ExxonMobil has been playing a lot of catchup right now, but if you compare the two earnings, Chevron looks like they're doing a much, much better job.</p><p>Now one of the problems we had with ExxonMobil, of course, high Canadian crude products that hurt them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Phil. Thank you so much. Phil Flynn joining us there on oil this morning. Final comments from you, Stephanie Pomboy. When you look at where energy is right now, does that have a potential to cutting to growth given the fact that oil prices are all the way up above 60 or --</p><p>POMBOY: Well, it's sort of perverse, because --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Close to 60 now.</p><p>POMBOY: -- the initial effect is to boost the headline numbers, you know. If you're a consumer, suddenly you've got to pay a lot more at the gas tank, you pay that, and then when you realize those prices aren't coming back down, you have to cut back somewhere else so ends up having a depressing affect later on.</p><p>But the initial impact is to inflate both the inflation and the spending numbers, which is another reason why I think the near-term numbers could continue to surprise on the upside (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We leave it there. Stephanie, great to get your analysis always.</p><p>POMBOY: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Stephanie Pomboy joining us there. The advance reading on first quarter GDP, it was 3.2 percent, that was much higher than expectations of two percent. Stuart Varney will weigh in on that coming up.</p><p>Then pain at the pump, we are taking you live to California this morning where gasoline prices are soaring to historic highs. There's the price of oil moving up. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The GDP number is just out. It beat expectations, up 3.2 percent on growth wildly better than anybody expected. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. How'd you like that number, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, I loved it. I wonder what the Democrats are going to think. I mean here they've gone full tilt to socialism, just as capitalism turns over the goodies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: 3.2 percent growth in the first quarter of the year, what's Joe Biden going to say? What's the first thing out of his mouth when someone says, \"Hey, three percent growth in the first quarter of the year, wasn't supposed to be like this. Is it still going to go for taxing increases? Is it still going to go for more red tape? What about Bernie? It's so unfair that we have to change the whole system, move away from capitalism, and go to socialism when you got three percent growth in the first quarter of the year? Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: This is just a prize that's landed in President Trump's lap. And he created this, make no mistake.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he's god deregulation. He did tax reform we know these kinds of policies work, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. And he's pro-business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You had four percent growth in the second quarter last year. You got 3-1/4 percent growth this corner.</p><p>VARNEY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Give me a break.</p><p>VARNEY: And you were --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where's this recession that everybody's going nuts about?</p><p>VARNEY: You were talking about these capex, capital investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big.</p><p>VARNEY: I mean in software eight percent, was it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: 8.6 percent, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Put the word out, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>VARNEY: This is prosperity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, I'm saying the today, Stu, that's for sure.</p><p>VARNEY: Love it. We'll see you in 10 times.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You will.</p><p>VARNEY: \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" top begins top of the hour 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA, but we are looking at some pain at the pump, we're taking you live to California gasoline. I mean are looking at, some pain at pump live. We're taking you live to California gasoline prices soaring. Two historic highs, you don't want that to cut into economic growth. We're all over it, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We had great GDP numbers out today, up 3.2 percent. But gasoline prices are up across the country. They are skyrocketing in California. Robert Gray is at a Chevron station in Los Angeles this morning with more on that. Robert, good morning to you.</p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, good morning, Maria. Well, if you drive higher gasoline prices at the pump, may not be breaking news, but what is as (INAUDIBLE) take a quick move. We literally just saw them raising the prices here at this station, not just a little bit, up 20 cents a gallon, and that's $3.00 for a typical fill up of your tank there, extra you're paying. Take a look at the prices nationally. Gasoline price is spiking to the highest since Halloween, almost three bucks a gallon here in California, even higher topping four bucks a gallon.</p><p>We have to go to august of 2014 to see how high it's -- though the highest hits then. It was then one, of course, taxes of the about a dollar a gallon here, extra in California. Governor Gavin Newsom just this week calling for an investigation to what he is suggesting maybe inappropriate industry practices, and the industry, and refinery shutting down for maintenance or other issues.</p><p>Now keep in mind, prices typically are jumping this time of year as we start ramping into Memorial Day, but that's still a month away and they'll have to stay higher given higher and experts say the jump is going to go even higher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG SHUPE, SPOKESPERSON, AAA: Of course we're used to paying higher prices being here in California. And on the West Coast. But the double- digit increases that we've seen over the last couple of weeks have really given a lot of drivers a sense of sticker shock.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAY: Yes, Maria. We're getting close to five bucks a gallon here for the most expensive gasoline. That is sticker shock even for those of us who live here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GRAY: Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think California lawmakers really need to take a look at what happened when the federal government cut taxes, and how it moved the needle on economic growth. We'll be watching that story, Robert. Thank you. Robert Gray this morning in L.A. Still ahead, the border crisis. I'm headed to the U.S.-Mexico border this weekend where I will be live for a special edition of \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" Join me live Sunday morning at 10 a.m. Eastern as I walk the border, and take a look at the activity in terms of apprehensions. We're talking about a million apprehensions this year, crossing into the United States, 70 percent of those people coming from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. We're back in two minutes' time. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It's a big week next week. Be sure to join us on Monday for my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 26.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  We're watching earnings.  ExxonMobil just hitting the tape right now.  Two Dow components in fact reporting this hour.  Oil giant, ExxonMobil is hitting the tape right now with $63.63 billion dollars in revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chevron is coming out later this hour.  As you can see, both stocks are fractionally better on the session.  ExxonMobil pretty much flat.  Chevron up two-thirds of a percent ahead of this.  ExxonMobil shares are trading down right now as we are looking at some disappointment on these numbers as they just right now hit the tape.  Revenue is $63.63 billion.  We want to find out what the company is saying about the road ahead.</p><p>The stock has now traded lower, going into these numbers as the numbers are hitting the tape, and as you can see, we are showing you revenue is light versus the estimate which was $64.8 billion in revenue.  And the actual numbers are 63.6 billion.  So we got a slight miss on revenue for ExxonMobil.  That's a Dow component that's going to impact markets this morning.  The stock down 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>We are also waiting on GDP.  This is the first reading of the first quarter.  The estimate there is growth of two percent although there is a lot higher numbers on the street.  J.P. Morgan is looking for 2.9 percent in GDP.  Others are around 2.3 percent but the estimates that we've got for GDP for the first quarter is two percent even.  Those numbers out in 30 minutes time.  As you can see, futures are lower this morning.</p><p>Dow futures indicating a decline of 75 points right out of the gate, about a quarter of a percent lower.  Exxon is going to be an issue here.  S&amp;P 500 down five points down five points right now and the NASDAQ down almost a point, fractional move.  Intel is set to cut 28 points off the Dow Industrials at the opening of trading.  So Intel is also an issue when you look at Intel and ExxonMobil looks like we're going to have a down opening this morning.</p><p>Yesterday markets were pretty active.  And take a look what happened at the close.  DowIndustrials were down 135 points at the close yesterday.  As you can see, one-half of one percent.  S&amp;P 500 down one point, the NASDAQ was up -- the NASDAQ was up 16 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>European indices right now looking like this and they are mostly lower.  FT-100 down20 points, CAC quarante in Paris is down one point and the DAX Index also slipping its negative territory right now down about a point as you can see.  And in Asia overnight, the markets there were focused on the Japanese industrial production.  It was down at the fastest pace in almost four years.  The Nikkei Average down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite was down 1-1/4 percent.  Xi Jinping made some comments that it is willing to make some real concessions to the United States including protecting I.P.  The President of China made some important comments overnight about the Chinese economy and what they're going to do.  We've got all of those comments coming up.  And then there's this.  The Uber IPO offering 180 million shares.</p><p>The company says it will price between $44 and $50 a share.  The company will start its road show today.  Border crisis.  At least 1300 immigrants staged a mass escape from a Mexican shelter.  What the Pentagon is looking to do about the growing problem of people crossing the border into the United States.  And then there's this.  2020 race, we're covering this morning.  Former Vice President Joe Biden said he asked former President Obama not to endorse him.</p><p>Yes.  He did not want the endorsement.  President Trump says, Sleepy Joe will not be able to do the job.  He calls him not the brightest light bulb in the group.  The President has started the attacks on what could did his competitor come next year's election, Joe Biden.  Breaking news right now.  Exxon is reporting its first quarter earnings.  We told you the numbers and it is a revenue missed Lauren Simonetti with more on the Exxon quarter.  Lauren, over to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Yes.  And Exxon, Maria, as you know is one of the two Dow stocks that our energy components reporting today at -- with the two, three percent decline in the stock to three percent decline that we're seeing right now.  This is set to shave about 13 points from the Dow Jones Industrial average.  But just so you know, if you add Exxon and Chevron together, this is just about five percent price weighting.</p><p>Let's get to these Exxon numbers because they are disappointing.  If you look at the bottom line, the EPS number, we got 55 cents a share, we were looking for 69 cents and we're seeing a miss on revenue as well.  It came in a $63.63 billion.  The street was looking for 64.82.  If you look deeper into this report, there is also a slight miss on the amount of oil that Exxon was hoping to pump per day.</p><p>They were looking at a number of four million barrels per day.  That came in slightly below that at 3.98 million.  Look ahead to this conference call.  It's rare but we will once again hear from the CEO Darren Woods on that call.  The focus on Wall Street we heard a few days ago that deeper into this report, there is also a slight miss on the amount of oil that Exxon was upping their dividend to 87 cents.</p><p>That was about a six percent increase.  Wall Street and analyst want to see more share buybacks, increasing of dividends and basically to get the debt down for these oil giants, Exxon being one of them.  So, unfortunately this looks like loser today.  It's coming back a little bit.  The stock right now but still down well over two percent, Maria.  Chevron is coming out in about a half hour time.</p><p>Let me just get you the preview for that company.  We're looking for $1.30 per share in earnings.  Revenue of $38.42 billion.  And of course with the Chevron story, we want to hear any and everything and if there will be a bidding war with Occidental who has a higher bid for Anadarko at this point.  So, that stock ahead of the earnings for Chevron is down just about half of one percent.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thanks so much.  The stock of Exxon, one of the issues for the Dow certainly day down almost three percent.  We are waiting on GDP.  We want lock the at Trump economy right now.  President Trump touted tax cuts and economic accomplishments in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.  We have gotten rid of the individual mandate.  We had the biggest cut in regulations which is one of the things creating all great jobs because we have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had.  Today we have most people working literally today just came out we have the most people working, than we've ever had in the history of our country almost 160 million people are working to have jobs.</p><p>And it is incredible the economy is setting records.  When foreign leaders come in to see me, Sean, they always say, thank you and it's great to meet you, sir, and congratulations on your economy.  It's the greatest economy anywhere in the world which it is, nobody is even close to us.  And that's because of the things we've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This as we are waiting on the first quarter GDP this morning.  It is due out in about 25 minutes.  Joining me right now is Harvard economics professor, former IMF Chief Economist, Ken Rogoff.  Ken, it is always good to see you.</p><p>KEN ROGOFF, HARVARD ECONOMICS PROFSSOR:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  How would you characterize the economy right now?</p><p>ROGOFF:  It is very strong.  I mean, the U.S. economy is on oasis of strength outside of China anywhere in the world, it's doing very well.  I mean, it's not growing at six percent, but we're probably growing at 2-1/2 percent and I think it is possible we could be growing at three percent in coming years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, we're getting the GDP out for the first quarter.  We had a government shutdown, we had worries about Europe, worries about China in the first quarter.  What would you say about things slowing down as a result of some of the outside forces that the U.S. is facing like Europe?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, it hasn't happened.  I think we talked about that when I came on last and we were wondering, you know, you were wondering if it would come here but it hasn't.  Europe has picked up a little China, it's definitely stabilized but it hasn't hit us.  Now, you can't read that much into one quarter's numbers and stuff like inventory accumulation.  People might over rushed imports ahead of something, there goes the shutdown.</p><p>I don't know what it's going to be.  I'd say between two and 2-1/2.  But it isn't anything like some of the predictions that we were hearing a month ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It can, everybody's hair was on fire six months, recession is coming and we just keep getting one number better than the next every day.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Yes.  The global economy is stable.  I think even compared to a couple weeks ago when I was at the IMF meetings, the global economy is looking more stable.  I mean, China is a declining trend.  Europe may look like Japan over the next 10 or 20 years.  But the United States seems to be rising above that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me ask you about the op-ed that you wrote.  You wrote an op-ed this morning on big tech going into 2020 and the presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, her plan to reign big tech.  Your write this, Warren is courageous because big tech is big money for most leading Democratic candidates.  Particularly progressives for whom California is a variable campaign financing ATM.</p><p>And although one can certainly object, Warren is not alone in thinking that tech giants have gained excessive market dominance.  In fact it is one of the few issue in Washington on which there is some semblance of agreement and you're right because you got Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both saying two different sides of the spectrum, both saying, get these companies to break up.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, I don't know what the solution is but it isn't just big tech, it's big everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Big pharma.  The rise in monopoly power or something that's really started to sees economist a little last couple years.  The Fed had its Jackson Hole big central bankers conference about that last year.  The antitrust has been asleep the last 40 years.  Forget about the last years.  And big tech is kind of the poster child of this but they're not the only one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you know what, it's not just bigness for the tech companies.  I mean, they've actually abused their power.  When you take a look at how they've given, you know, all the privacy breaches, just given our data away, selling it to the advertising industry.  So, do you think we're going to see a heavier hand in terms of regulation?  You know what Europe has done.  I don't think the U.S. is going to see -- do what Europe has done.</p><p>They're really come down hard on these companies but will we see some tweaking in terms of the regulatory burdens?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Oh, absolutely.  I have heard this phrase surveillance capitalism that we've moved into.  I think as people understand when you write, you know, an e-mail, if you may see an advertisement about it later.  If you do it on your Gmail, I mean, there are concerns like that that are coming out.  But the idea that some of the big tech companies would be able to buy up potential competitors I think is very problematic and they haven't been cautious on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I -- you know, it's interesting because you know, we know this is coming, it's got to come, right?  And yet, these stocks are trading at incredible valuations.  So, I wonder what they think.</p><p>ROGOFF:  So, one thing is that the United States is just ruling in tech.  I was recently in China and you think about, oh, the China is going to take over.  Well, they are competitors.  I think the thing I learned more and more is Europe is not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROGOFF:  United States --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- one innovation out that's come of Europe in the last 10 years.</p><p>ROGOFF:  I -- you're putting me on the spot --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGOFF:  The research was probably done in the United States.  I mean, they have a lot of patents but then you find out the research teams are here in the United States.  So the U.S. is really leading the world in a lot of things and that I think is one of our sources of strength.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there is worry that China is ahead of us on A.I.?</p><p>ROGOFF:  They are.  And it was interesting President Xi made some concessions about trade and all things they would do but I didn't hear anything about cyberspying or cybersecurity.  I don't -- I don't think they will invent anything in A.I. that we didn't invent first and they steal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see.  And by the way, President Xi Jinping on the tape this morning with comments he made yesterday that they're going to start protecting intellectual property.  They're going to buy more and they're going to -- from the U.S. and they're going to open up their markets.  So, obviously the President's, you know, pushing back on China is moving the needle in terms of what the Chinese are willing to do.</p><p>ROGOFF:  This was remarkable because, you know, everyone said the Chinese, they will move but they will not move because the U.S. is complaining.  You let us do it if you push us, we won't do anything.  And, you know, he didn't mention cyberspying but he talked about intellectual property.  They event went to a currency agreement which I frankly don't think is a good idea.  I think it's a bad concession but even to that, it was -- yes, really quite remarkable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Remarkable what Xi Jinping said last night, right?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Yes.  Absolutely, absolutely.  I mean, I don't know if he will do what he said he is going to do but that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the thing.  That's why they're fighting over an enforcement mechanism.</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, that is not going to happen in a good way.  But the fact he said it is already really surprising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I totally agree.  Now, you made comments recently on the Federal Reserve suggesting that the world may be facing an end to central bank independence.  What do you think?</p><p>ROGOFF:  Well, I mean, certainly you look around at smaller countries, you know, Turkey, Hungary, Venezuela, Argentina, there have been a lot of problems with central bank independents.  But I think the fundamental problem is a lot of people, you talk to people and they say, inflation, that's 20th century.  You can't have inflation in the 21st Century.  Why do we need an independent central bank on?  I think they've got that so wrong.  Unfortunately in some countries I hope not ours will find out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  You're to be my special guest this weekends, Ken, and I'm -- I appreciate you joining me this weekend on \"MARIA BARTIROMO'S WALL STREET\", THAT'S tonight AT 9:00 p.m. Eastern.  Join myself and Ken Rogoff for that.  We will see you little later.  Thank you, Ken.</p><p>Coming up, the advance reading on first quarter GDP is due out in about 15 minutes' time.  We are expecting two percent growth for the quarter.  This is the first reading for the first quarter.  We'll have that number when we come right back.  And then earnings in focus.  Disappointing results from oil giant ExxonMobil.  Stock is down 2-1/3 percent right now.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Dow component, ExxonMobil disappointing on earnings this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more details.  Gerri, good morning.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey Maria, good morning to you.  Yes.  We have a double disappointment, a miss on the bottom and top lines, 55 cents a share was earnings expectations of 69 cents a share on revenue.  $63.36 billion was the number expectations of 64.82 billion.</p><p>Crude prices strengthening during the quarter.  The company said but weaker in the fourth quarter.  We're watching for Chevron in moments. $1.30 a share is the expectation.  Will they up their offer for Anadarko, we'll be watching for that.  American Airlines beating APS estimates coming at 52 cents a share versus 51.  Missing estimates on revenue.  They say that their results affected by higher oil prices in the government shutdown.</p><p>Amazon last night, profit more than doubles but people didn't like the revenue growth slowing, sluggish on line retails blamed here.  One day free shipping for prime members, that's my good news story for you today.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  The advance reading on first quarter GDP due out in 10 minutes' time.  We're expecting growth of two percent for the quarter.  We'll have that number when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- 20 in focus, President Trump weighing in on the 2020 Democratic primary candidates last night on \"HANNITY.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that, you know, when you look at Joe, I've known Joe over the years.  He's not the brightest light bulb in the group, I don't think but he has a name that they know.  He is fading very fast.  I think he is fading very, very fast.  It looks like he is going to be a thing in the past pretty soon but he was -- he was a hot item for a little while.  Well, I don't -- I don't see either of them.</p><p>I think she is got a little bit of a nasty wit but that might be it.  And Mayor Pete is not going to make it.  I would hope he would.  I hope --I'm rooting for him but he's not going to make.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former House Speaker, Fox News Contributor, author of the new book, the political thriller, Collusion, just out by Newt Gingrich.  Newt, it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the new book.  First, let's talk about the President's assessment --</p><p>GINGRICH:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you agree with what he just said?</p><p>GINGRICH:  Oh pretty much.  So I think the problem that Vice President Biden has that he has a past.  My newsletter today talks about the Kate Smith statute being taken down in Philadelphia from the flyers arena.  Because out of 3,000 songs she recorded in her career, in 1931 recorded two songs that had what are seen as racist language and, therefore, she is no longer acceptable even though she introduced America to the song God Bless America and became a national icon.</p><p>Now, he is going to find himself in the Kate Smith statute problem.  Anita Hill repudiates his effort to apologize, he has yet to be encountered on the fact that he used to support amendments with Jesse Helms to stop bussing for desegregation purposes.  You go back ahead a long career.  And you deal with the modern left-wing Democrats, they have zero tolerance for anybody who is imperfect and he is by definition going to turn out pretty imperfect.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, we want to turn to the Russia investigation, Newt, we've got new techs messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.  They show that the two were discussing using post-election briefings to the Trump team to gain more information on the campaigns dealings with Russia.  Senate Homeland Security Committee members urged Attorney General Barr to investigate this matter.</p><p>Look, Mr. Speaker we know for the last two years you've heard it here first, that there was no collusion and this whole narrative was a complete lie.  Do you think there's going to be accountability here?</p><p>GINGRICH:  I hope so.  I have a lot of faith in the Attorney General Barr.  I think he believes in the rule of law.  We had an amazing level of corruption.  I think the President is right.  It was in effect and attempted coup to defeat the duly elected president of the United States on the part of the deep state.  And you had FBI bureaucrats who talking upon themselves to try to reverse the results of the election.</p><p>And I think that clearly had the fingerprints, just talking right back to Joe Biden by the way because you had the Attorney General doing things that he should not have been doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH:  You know, you have to presume that Vice President and President Obama knew it and then you ask the question, so did Joe Biden know any of this?  I mean, was he in the loop?  Was he aware of what's going on?  I don't think this is going to go away.  I think now it's going to get worse for the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  What did Biden know.  Tom, you've written about this obviously in RealClearPolitics and we want to know how high up the ladder this was in the Obama administration because the strategy to take Trump down was so -- I mean, it was just so wide ranging from informants to the dossier, to MediaLink strategy.  It's incredible.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, REALCLEARPOLITICS, COFOUNDER AND PRESIDENT:  It is.  And I do think we will get accountability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do?</p><p>BEVAN:  I do.  We may not get it as quickly as we want because -- but I do think there is going to be accountability.  We will find out exactly how this happened.  I think Republicans, Lindsey Graham in the Senate in particular will be able to drive the process to try to and uncover as much get -- and as much transparency.  We deserve this transparency.  The American people deserve it especially after what we just went through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it was two years, Newt, of this, you know, collusion delusion where the whole country is going on this goose chase because people like, you know, John -- people like Brennan and Clapper are using words like treason and collusion.</p><p>GINGRICH:  Right.  I mean, look -- I mean, look, I think there are so many people guilty trying of trying to undermine the U.S. constitution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH:  This has to be thoroughly looked at.  But let me also point out that Mueller at some point had to know there was no collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I wonder when he knew it that he let the midterm elections come and go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right?  He let the midterm elections come and go.</p><p>GINGRICH:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All about this in Newt's new book, Collusion.  Newt Gingrich, great to see you, sir. I want to get to a break because we got the GDP on the other side of this break.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, April 26th.  We're waiting on breaking news right now.  The advanced reading on first quarter GDP due out in about 10 seconds.  Economists are looking for growth of at least two percent.  The estimates go all the way up to 2.9 percent if you believe J.P. Morgan.  We're also waiting on earnings, Dow Component Chevron is 3.2.  3.2 percent is the number on GDP this morning.  That is a very strong number for the first quarter advanced.</p><p>Let's look at markets to see if we have any changes here because you're looking at oil stocks.  We're waiting on Chevron earnings but the market is coming back from the lows here with this GDP number out, up 3.2 percent, much better than the estimates which calls for growth of two percent, all the way to 2.9 percent.  This is a very strong number for the first quarter and of course remember we had a government shutdown, we had worries about slow growth, and coming off of a very volatile end of year last year with markets trading real volatile and down at the end last year.  First quarter GDP, bouncing back up 3.2 percent, is the number and that is moving markets this morning.  Take a look at futures now, all in positive territory across the board.  Dow Industrials up nine points, S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/4 and the NASDAQ up 33 points with this first quarter GDP number, which is above expectations.</p><p>Intel and Exxon are pressures on the Dow Industrials, however.  We are expecting Exxon and Intel to be lower on the heels of disappointments on earnings.  Joining us right now for reaction on the GDP number is MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy.  Stephanie, great to see you.  And the last time you were here, you said we're going to start seeing good shoots, green shoots.</p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Positive news in the economy.  Is this what you were referring to?</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, this first quarter number, though, is a real surprise.  I mean I was thinking that we would start to see stronger numbers as we got into the second quarter the fact that first quarter growth was so much stronger than expected is amazing.  I -- you know, I was prepared to talk about how inventories were going to be a contribution to the number and that would be part of what was driving it up, but I wasn't expecting a three handle on this number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  So it's going to be interesting to look at the details here, but again there was going to be a big contribution from inventories which obviously isn't a positive going forward because you have to unwind those inventories, and then another contributing factor was going to be trade, where we were actual going to see an increase in exports which would help drive, you know, narrow the trade deficit and lift GDP, and that's not going to continue cps the strength in the dollar is going to act as a headwind to that.</p><p>But I agree with you, Maria.  I mean I think this number looks stronger and I think moving through the next let's say four, six weeks, we should see some stronger consumer numbers which is going to be, you know, it'd be really interesting in what the consumer spending component was here, but I do think we'll see stronger some stronger prints there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean -- I mean the personal -- the personal consumption number is what we want to really focus on in the GDP.  Last week, when I interviewed Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, he basically said that the economy -- the consumer's balance sheet is the best that it's been in 30 years because of very low debt, and wages which are up better than three percent year-over-year.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean I guess the important thing with the consumer is that you're painting them with one brush and there really isn't an average consumer any more.  There is the high end and the low end.  But I do think we should see some stronger numbers on the consumer franchise because there they were so depressed for three months.  We, you know, we had retail sales, basically down for three months straight and consumer spending more broadly was weaker.</p><p>And part of that was a function of the meltdown in the fourth quarter in the markets that really depressed psychology, both on the consumer front and the corporate front.  But what I think is fascinating about this first quarter GDP print is now it sets up the dilemma that I talked about with you talking when I was talking about this risk of an upside bounce, upside risk, is that we have the fed meeting next week.</p><p>And, you know, what is Powell going to say about they backpedaled frantically here talking about even pausing the unwind of the balance sheet, the markets pricing in a rate cut, then we get this number?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  I mean I don't know if anyone was looking for three percent growth in any quarter this year --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  -- much less the first quarter which is the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the question now becomes, what does the fed say at that meeting on Wednesday?  Are they going to tilt toward, \"Well, we're out of the way, no rate hikes certainly?\"  People talk about a rate cut or are they going to say things are coming back, things are strong, maybe a rate hike is on the table for 2019?</p><p>POMBOY:  I mean, how manic depressive do they look?  I mean with apologies to your former employer, these guys start to look like the Jim Cramers of monetary policy.  You know, there -- you know, one day, they think the economy is hot, and the next day they think it's soft.  So, I think this is really going to set up the dilemma for the financial markets is that better news now, they don't know what to do with that, well, does the bond market selloff here?  And if it does, doesn't that have a dampening effect on the stock market?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  I mean I fear the return of the bond vigilantes, which is what I talked to you about the last time, is that stronger growth really sets up increased volatility in the financial markets which generally is not a friend to prices, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>POMBOY:  Uncertainty is going to be a major issue here around monetary policy.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, BREWER GROUP:  Does this help us take a ever harder stance against China right now with the trade negotiations?</p><p>POMBOY:  I guess that's a good point, yes.  You know, their data started to look a little better, but this number is definitely, like I said, you know, you didn't expect three percent in any quarter, much less the first quarter which is normally just really seasonally weak.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's what -- here's what Jamie Dimon told me, the head of the nation's largest bank, just last week about the consumer and the economy today.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE.  What we see in the U.S. is that the American consumer, their balance sheet, their incomes, are going -- are strong, not weak, more people going back to the workforce, which is a good thing, companies are in very good shape, profits are good, capital expenditures still going up, business and consumer confidence high levels, housings in short supply, so it's kind of a tailwind.  The -- and the fed is on pause, which I think they did the right thing, which means it's going to give people more time to adjust a little bit of slowdown.</p><p>But it's -- it seems it's just a little slowdown.  And just -- other than trade, I'm not sure what's going to stop it in the next year or two.  I'm prepared for it to get bad, but I'm not predicting it.  I'm saying, no, you can actually have a pretty good environment for a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't see a recession in the next couple of years?</p><p>DIMON:  I don't.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No recession.  So where did this come from, that we were going to see a recession in 2019 and 2020?</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, I think the one pushback I would have to him and the risk I view of the recession comes from the corporate sector.  You know, he makes a good point that the consumers' in better shape than they were, that's not the problem this time.  The problem is the leveraging up in the corporate sector, and we have a huge amount of debt rolling this year.  We have almost $800 billion in corporate debt that rolls this year, and another $900 billion next year.  Corporate borrowing costs have rallied back alongside with the stock market over the last few months, but they're still above where they were in September and they're well above where they were at the lows.</p><p>So, we're going to see corporations trying to, you know, refinance this massive amount of debt, and, you know, if my concerns about the return of the bond vigilantes bear any sort of fruit, that could create some real dislocations on the corporate side, which ultimately hits back to consumers because if companies are having struggles refinancing debt, they're certainly not going to rush out to increase wages and hire more people.  So, it all kind of feeds back together.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  All valid points, for sure, but at the same time, the bull market surpassing that 10-year mark, sort of giving investors' confidence that, you know, no, this wasn't just a seven to ten-year cycle after the great recession, but actually this may have legs to go a lot further.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  I mean what I come back to on the stock market front is it's all going to coming down to earnings, you know.  I think that the first quarter obviously, people have sort of kitchen sink that, we know the first quarter numbers are going to be weak, but the forecast look for an increase in earnings, in the out quarters and ultimately going back to double digits next year.  So this is really viewed as sort of a one queue phenomenon and everything will recover.</p><p>and, again, you know, my concerns about the corporate borrowing side have me less bullish on the earnings outlook, and I think that could be a risk, you know, that maybe if you look at guidance, for example, even as companies are sort of narrowly beating this incredibly depressed guidance in the -- expectations in the first quarter, guidance is really fairly negative, certainly very cautious in the out quarter.  So, we'll see what happens there, but I think that could be the real wrinkle in the whole picture, is what happens with this leveraging of the corporate balance sheets, not the consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first reading of the GDP for the first quarter, it is up 3.2 percent, the estimate calls for growth two percent, this is wildly better than expectations, some people were expecting up to 2.9 percent.  That was the estimate out of J.P. Morgan, but whatever way you look at it, this has smashed through estimates on the GDP number.  Tom, how do you see it?</p><p>BEVAN:  Well, again, I'm -- my wheelhouse is politics, right?  So, I look at all these numbers through the political lens.  I mean this is a huge win for President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>TOM:  You know, we were talking about the trade war with China, everyone's talking -- I mean just a few weeks ago, we had the fed saying .5 percent growth for first quarter?  We're now 3.2.  So, this is -- the economy continues to be much more resilient than people have estimated.  And that bodes well for him moving into his reelection.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  By the way, we have a huge week next week, we got the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, as you noted.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The China PMIs, that's the Purchasing Managers Index, this gives us a sense of manufacturing in China for the month of April.  You've got inflation numbers, the PCE coming out next week, and then, of course, you got the jobs numbers at the end of the week, no doubt we're going to see wages probably either go up, or stay at a level of 3.2 percent year-over-year.  So, this is all good news.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.  It's going to be -- it's going to be a very interesting week because like you talked about, we have all those indicators, we also have personal income and spending numbers, the broader numbers, and it'll be interesting to see what Powell says about that in the presser on the 1st.  It's really -- this is the conundrum now, is good news good news or is good news bad news?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me just -- let me just give you a couple of highlights here because the first quarter consumer spending was up 1.2 percent --</p><p>POMBOY:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- versus fourth quarter 2-1/2 percent.  You have business investment, up 2.7 percent, equipment up two tenths of a percent, intellectual property software in terms of business investment, 8.6 percent, Stephanie.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Business investment into intellectual property and software up 8.6 percent.  That is a fantastic number.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when people say capex has slowed down, I'm not buying it, OK?  Capex into I.P. up 8-1/2 percent.</p><p>POMBOY:  Yes, that's actually -- that number is stronger, the other ones are weaker than expected, although PCE was pretty much exactly as expected, the consumer spending number at 1-2, I think estimates were for 1-1, which, again, is less than half of what it was in the prior quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The first quarter PCE price index, up six tenths of a percent.</p><p>POMBOY:  Uh-huh.  So we'll see what Powell says about that.  I mean I think that's a little heavier than he might necessarily want to see.  All in all, this is going to be right now the Fed is scratching its head as to what they're going to do, and I would focus very heavily on the bond market over the next few weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  All right.  We're going to --</p><p>POMBOY:  I think that's really going to be the story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be watching that.  As we've been talking, we haven't even mentioned Chevron earnings, they're mixed.  Let's get to Lauren Simonetti.  She's looking at the Chevron quarter right now.  Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, Maria.  And investors are trying to figure out how to respond this.  Initially the stock went up as opening bell.  Chevron is a Dow Component, it has a three percent waiting on that average.  It's still up, it did go down.  Now it's up about not even a tenth of one percent, at 117.98.  The number that was impressive was the bottom line number, EPS was $1.39 a share, as you noted, Maria.  The expectation was $1.30, net income coming at $2.6 billion, that was better than expected.  The problem is with revenue, $35.2 billion, the estimate was for $38.4 billion.</p><p>So I'm still going through this report, of course we need to listen to the conference call.  we need to hear if anything, and I'm sure there will tons of questions from the CEO Mike Wirth, he's going to be quizzed about is Chevron going to up their bid for Anadarko after that occidental bid came in.  Oil promises have been higher, so this is good for the -- for the oil companies, but you have to remember when a lot of them started lowering their estimates, that was when oil was much lower than it is right now.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Joining us right now, PRICE Futures Group Energy Analyst, Phil Flynn.  Phil, weight in here on the Chevron numbers, especially since occidental petroleum is going to be outbidding Chevron in its acquisition of Anadarko.  It's offering $38 billion, which, of course, is topping the chevron bid, which was $33 billion.  We got a fight going on for this company.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP ENERGY ANALYST:  You sure do, and I think this is the first of many, Maria, down in the Permian Basin.  All the big oil companies, ExxonMobil, Chevron, you name it, think the future is down in taxes, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Its energy in fact --</p><p>FLYNN:  With the Shell oil right now in, and so this is what we're seeing right now at this time.  So, if you look at what's really going on here, you know, with today's earning, it really shows you that Chevron looks like it's a much better-run company than ExxonMobil if you compare the two people.  Chevron's been a leader, of course.  They were first in the Permian, they've expanding first, ExxonMobil has been playing a lot of catchup right now, but if you compare the two earnings, Chevron looks like they're doing a much, much better job.</p><p>Now one of the problems we had with ExxonMobil, of course, high Canadian crude products that hurt them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Phil.  Thank you so much.  Phil Flynn joining us there on oil this morning.  Final comments from you, Stephanie Pomboy.  When you look at where energy is right now, does that have a potential to cutting to growth given the fact that oil prices are all the way up above 60 or --</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, it's sort of perverse, because --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Close to 60 now.</p><p>POMBOY:  -- the initial effect is to boost the headline numbers, you know.  If you're a consumer, suddenly you've got to pay a lot more at the gas tank, you pay that, and then when you realize those prices aren't coming back down, you have to cut back somewhere else so ends up having a depressing affect later on.</p><p>But the initial impact is to inflate both the inflation and the spending numbers, which is another reason why I think the near-term numbers could continue to surprise on the upside (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We leave it there.  Stephanie, great to get your analysis always.</p><p>POMBOY:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Stephanie Pomboy joining us there.  The advance reading on first quarter GDP, it was 3.2 percent, that was much higher than expectations of two percent.  Stuart Varney will weigh in on that coming up.</p><p>Then pain at the pump, we are taking you live to California this morning where gasoline prices are soaring to historic highs.  There's the price of oil moving up.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The GDP number is just out.  It beat expectations, up 3.2 percent on growth wildly better than anybody expected.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  How'd you like that number, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, I loved it.  I wonder what the Democrats are going to think.  I mean here they've gone full tilt to socialism, just as capitalism turns over the goodies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  3.2 percent growth in the first quarter of the year, what's Joe Biden going to say?  What's the first thing out of his mouth when someone says, \"Hey, three percent growth in the first quarter of the year, wasn't supposed to be like this.  Is it still going to go for taxing increases?  Is it still going to go for more red tape?  What about Bernie?  It's so unfair that we have to change the whole system, move away from capitalism, and go to socialism when you got three percent growth in the first quarter of the year?  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is just a prize that's landed in President Trump's lap.  And he created this, make no mistake.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's god deregulation.  He did tax reform we know these kinds of policies work, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  And he's pro-business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You had four percent growth in the second quarter last year.  You got 3-1/4 percent growth this corner.</p><p>VARNEY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give me a break.</p><p>VARNEY:  And you were --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's this recession that everybody's going nuts about?</p><p>VARNEY:  You were talking about these capex, capital investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean in software eight percent, was it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  8.6 percent, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Put the word out, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  This is prosperity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, I'm saying the today, Stu, that's for sure.</p><p>VARNEY:  Love it.  We'll see you in 10 times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You will.</p><p>VARNEY:  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" top begins top of the hour 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA, but we are looking at some pain at the pump, we're taking you live to California gasoline.  I mean are looking at, some pain at pump live.  We're taking you live to California gasoline prices soaring.  Two historic highs, you don't want that to cut into economic growth.  We're all over it, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We had great GDP numbers out today, up 3.2 percent.  But gasoline prices are up across the country.  They are skyrocketing in California.  Robert Gray is at a Chevron station in Los Angeles this morning with more on that.  Robert, good morning to you.</p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Well, if you drive higher gasoline prices at the pump, may not be breaking news, but what is as (INAUDIBLE) take a quick move.  We literally just saw them raising the prices here at this station, not just a little bit, up 20 cents a gallon, and that's $3.00 for a typical fill up of your tank there, extra you're paying.  Take a look at the prices nationally.  Gasoline price is spiking to the highest since Halloween, almost three bucks a gallon here in California, even higher topping four bucks a gallon.</p><p>We have to go to august of 2014 to see how high it's -- though the highest hits then.  It was then one, of course, taxes of the about a dollar a gallon here, extra in California.  Governor Gavin Newsom just this week calling for an investigation to what he is suggesting maybe inappropriate industry practices, and the industry, and refinery shutting down for maintenance or other issues.</p><p>Now keep in mind, prices typically are jumping this time of year as we start ramping into Memorial Day, but that's still a month away and they'll have to stay higher given higher and experts say the jump is going to go even higher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG SHUPE, SPOKESPERSON, AAA:  Of course we're used to paying higher prices being here in California.  And on the West Coast.  But the double-digit increases that we've seen over the last couple of weeks have really given a lot of drivers a sense of sticker shock.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAY:  Yes, Maria.  We're getting close to five bucks a gallon here for the most expensive gasoline.  That is sticker shock even for those of us who live here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GRAY:  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think California lawmakers really need to take a look at what happened when the federal government cut taxes, and how it moved the needle on economic growth.  We'll be watching that story, Robert.  Thank you.  Robert Gray this morning in L.A.  Still ahead, the border crisis.  I'm headed to the U.S.-Mexico border this weekend where I will be live for a special edition of \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"  Join me live Sunday morning at 10 a.m. Eastern as I walk the border, and take a look at the activity in terms of apprehensions.  We're talking about a million apprehensions this year, crossing into the United States, 70 percent of those people coming from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  We're back in two minutes' time.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's a big week next week.  Be sure to join us on Monday for my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  He will be here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA 6:00 a.m. on Monday.  We will have a special edition of \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" this weekend as well.  I'll be live at the U.S. border with Mexico.  Join me live from the border on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" at 10:00 a.m. Eastern over on the FOX News Channel.</p><p>Big number on GDP, guys.</p><p>BREWER:  Impressive.</p><p>BEVAN:  Yes.  It's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're going to have to come up with something else to take down Trump.</p><p>BEVAN:  Were we talking about --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not going to be the economy.</p><p>BEVAN:  Yes.  We were talking about how the Democrats are going to counter.  That's a big number they're have to contend with.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Markets will -- Markets will like it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And if --so 8.6 percent in terms of I.P. spending.  Jackie DeAngelis, Jack Brewer, Tom Bevan, great to see you, everybody.  Have a great weekend, everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now.

Eli Wilson has established himself as one of the premier goaltending coaches in the world through his work with dozens of goaltenders in the National Hockey League (NHL) and Team Canada. The partnership will provide Eli Wilson Goaltending camps with the Binovi Touch neurovision sports training hardware, alongside screen-based resources for athletes to support their development on and off the ice. The Eli Wilson Goaltending partnership will ultimately expose 600 active goaltending camp participants, aged 10 to 19 years and a global network of over 50,000 aspiring goaltending athletes to Eyecarrot's Binovi Sport Vision Platform for off-ice training. As many nations continue to practice social distancing during COVID-19 and post pandemic, the Binovi Sports Vision Platform offers accessible turnkey athletic resources in step with subscription-based home fitness solutions Tonal, Peloton (PTON: NASDAQ) and Mirror. A subscription structure will support the company's global product scaling strategy and \"at-home\" consumer offerings.</p><p>\"I emphatically believe the best way to develop goaltenders is by teaching a system within a system. Quality drills, attention to detail, repetition and simplicity are major factors in building successful goaltenders. The goaltender must learn needed skills in a progressive manner in a controlled environment. With Binovi, we are gaining a sports vision training system to improve vision in that same controlled way, ensuring proper analysis and progress,\" commented Eli Wilson, Eli Wilson Goaltending Founder, CEO</p><p>Under his tutelage, Eli's camps --which see over 600 athletes annually-- have produced more than 50 NHL draft picks, over 60 Division I, Canadian University goaltenders, and more than 200 players drafted by Major Junior teams. His goaltenders have gone on to win numerous prestigious awards and championships, including the Stanley Cup, Conn Smythe Trophy, Vezina Trophy, World Junior Gold Medals, American Hockey League (AHL) championships, AHL Playoff MVPs, Western Hockey League (WHL) Goaltender of the Year awards, Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Goaltender of the Year awards, and Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Goaltender of the Year awards. In addition to standard camp programming, Eli has introduced a number of specialty camps, including the popular 24/7 camp, where goaltenders actually live and train with Eli over a three-day weekend. A main staple of Eli's year-round training is advanced video technology, whereby he and his staff can analyze video remotely to further goaltending development.</p><p>This strategic partnership will support Eyecarrot's aggressive positioning of its sports vision performance offerings in the sport of hockey through an increased presence in key hockey development programs including direct NHL team alignments. Hockey, a leading sport in Canada, will benefit from big-tech partnerships of this nature that are designed to enhance athlete performance at all development levels of the sport.</p><p>\"We're very excited to be working with an athletic training team that clearly has a very high drive for success, and such an incredible track record for turning out exceptional players. Our goal is to see Binovi boost the performance of athletes going through these camps and training regimens. After all, competition is what drives sport, and any edge players and their training teams can get to get that competitive edge over an opponent is key. We look forward to working alongside Eli and his team as we continue to develop Binovi for sports,\" stated Adam Cegielski, President and CEO.</p><p>Click here for more information on Binovi Sports Vision Training.</p><p>About Eli Wilson Goaltending</p><p>Eli Wilson has worked with over 30 NHL goalies (and counting) to sharpen all essential goaltending skills, including mental conditioning and off-ice training. Eli's programs help to hone an athlete's reflexes and improve agility in the net. The camp experience mirrors how Pro and NHL goaltenders' practice, train, think, and act, to get to the top of their game. In 2004, Eli was named to Hockey Canada's goaltending consultant group. He has consulted with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) Sports during their summer development camps for top young prospects in Los Angeles, California. Eli has also traveled to South Korea to work with the Kangwon Land Ice Hockey team and other young goaltenders in the country. From 2007 through 2010, Eli was the goaltending coach for the Ottawa Senators, where he was responsible for the Ottawa Senators goaltenders as well as for the goalies playing for their AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Senators. Established in 2010, the Eli Wilson Goaltending program sees over 600 athletes every year and helps give them the competitive edge to set themselves apart in a very challenging and exclusive club.</p><p>About the NHL</p><p>The National Hockey League (NHL(R)), founded in 1917, consists of 31 Member Clubs, each reflecting the League's international makeup with players from more than 20 countries represented on team rosters, vying for the most cherished and historic trophy in professional sports - the Stanley Cup(R).
