US Senator and Democrat Presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren[1], has laid down the gauntlet by declaring that she will go beyond simple antitrust fines and 'break up big tech' should she win the next election. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ecard_Tech-Company_Graphic-01.jpg\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ecard_Tech-Company_Graphic-01.jpg</url> This comes following announcements of a number of US investigations into the business practices of some of the largest tech firms in Silicon Valley, including Facebook[2], Google and Apple. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorney generals have all made moves to probe them over accusations of unfair competition.

Afterall, Big Tech has grown rapidly over the past decade right under the noses of the US government.Let's set the scene...On August 2 2018, Apple became the world's first $1 trillion company. Just fifteen years ago, Facebook barely even existed; today, it has 2.3 billion users and has built a social media[4] empire including Instagram and WhatsApp. Google, meanwhile, is often hailed as 'the most powerful company in the world', with an average of 2 trillion searches carried out on its platform every day. According to Warren and others calling for antitrust probes, this is too much. They think that this market dominance has too much control over the economy, the tech industry and us, the consumers. It is argued that they are purposely and unfairly stifling competition which restricts innovation, limits our choices and even monetises our private information.Have antitrust fines been working?Considering the rocket-speed rate of growth these companies have seen, it may seem surprising that so few antitrust questions have been asked by regulators in their own country. However, Big Tech has been coming into hot water with Europe a lot in recent years. Research compiled by eCard Shack[5] shows that in the last four years, some of the biggest antitrust fines levied by the EU and European Commission have been slapped on Big Tech. But, whether these fines make a difference is another matter. By comparing the amount of each fine with the annual turnover for the year, eCard Shack has revealed how most of the time, these financial penalties[6] are just a drop in the ocean. In fact, 6 out of 8 of the antitrust fines were less than 5% of the annual turnover from the same year - with one being as low as 0.1%.Antitrust fines as % of revenue: Key findings...As shown in the infographic below, this study analysed the two biggest fines against Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft. The results are as follows: Facebook2017 fine of $122M - 3% 2019 fine of $5B - estimated to be 5% Google2017 fine of $2.4B - 1% 2018 fine of $5B - 6% Apple2011 fine of $1.2M - 1% 2016 fine of $14.8B - 8% Microsoft2013 fine of $731M - 9% 2008 fine of $1.4B - 3% While some of these fines seem hefty, when you consider the charges they were in response to, and the huge figures of revenue[7] the company turns over every year, you could argue it's not enough. Take, for example, Facebook's record breaking $5 billion fine from the FTC this year. You're right to think that $5 billion is a lot of money - but, consider the fact that the company is set to make $66.5 billion revenue this year alone. Does it still seem a lot? And, what did they receive this fine for? This penalty came following the highly controversial Cambridge Analytica scandal[8]. This privacy violation affected over 50 million users and was even accused of helping influence election results. Some of these antitrust violations are really serious. However, are these fines anything more than a slap on the wrist? The second half of the infographic takes a look at whether these fines were reflected in any dip in revenue growth. For this, eCard Shack took an overview of each company's yearly revenue over a ten year period. In most cases, where a fine took place, revenue still continued to increase. Antitrust fines are surely an unwanted hit to the profit tech firms make. But, when their market dominance is so strong, you could question how much of a deterrent they actually are.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-Amended-Ecard_Tech-Company_1a-01.jpgAre\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-Amended-Ecard_Tech-Company_1a-01.jpgAre</url> antitrust fines going to continue?As eCard Shack's research shows, the value of antitrust fines rocketed in 2016, with fines exceeding $1 billion being enforced on an annual basis thereafter. However, it seems clear that fines alone aren't enough to 'break up' these giants, as Elizabeth Warren hopes to do. Which is likely why the Senator[9] is calling for new reforms to completely change the playing field, to give new entrepreneurs a fighting chance and consumers a real choice when it comes to data privacy. Similarly, the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, warned big tech companies that a fine might not be all they face for breaking antitrust regulations, in future. The question is, can they ever really be stopped?

New York AG Leticia James announced an investigation into Facebook over control of personal data and privacy concerns, while Texas AG Ken Paxton will look into Google's impact on digital advertising.</p><p>Associate Director of CEI's Center for Technology and Innovation Jessica Melugin said:</p><p>\"These state attorneys general are expanding the power of their office and stretching the limits of what constitutes an antitrust violation. This sort of high-profile activism may benefit state AGs' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy. The mere threat of legal penaltiesand the environment of over-caution it engendersalso has a chilling effect on entrepreneurs. Such opportunity costs are impossible to measure.</p><p>\"The only consistency among the various state, federal agency, and congressional antitrust investigations into big tech seems to be that none of them have much to do with the well-established test for antitrust law in the US; consumer harm. It will be just as difficult for state officials to prove that consumers have been harmed by the services, innovations, and conveniences of companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon as it will be for federal regulators to find evidence of customers suffering.\"</p><p>CEI President and CEO Kent Lassman said:</p><p>\"Both Facebook and Google have delivered value for consumers the world over, offer their respective primary services for free, and compete in a multichannel, highly competitive advertising market. A handful of attorneys general have identified a way to keep their names in the news for years to come. Abusive antitrust regulation often appears to be a winner for ambitious politicians. Everyone else including new market entrants and small players who get overlooked amid all the shouting loses.\"</p><p>CEI Research Fellow Patrick Hedger said:</p><p>\"The term 'monopolies' is an oxymoron. If it's plural, it's not a problem. It is astounding that multiple levels of government are pursuing antitrust investigations against several ferocious competitors in the technology space. These investigations rely on the thinking that Facebook is just social media and Google is just a search engine. Yet these companies compete in advertising, messaging services, artificial intelligence, and an endless list of other visible and invisible areas we take for granted. They also compete for the trust of the American consumer in how they handle issues such as privacy and provide consumers with different trade-offs. Ultimately the bottom line of these companies depends on where Americans choose to spend their time online. Are they watching videos on Google-owned YouTube and messaging their friends on Gmail, or are they scrolling through Facebook and chatting on Messenger? These companies hold each other infinitely more accountable than a handful of politicians could ever hope to.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123224606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5P-RCV1-JCBF-S524-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The pandemic has complicated the timelines of these probes, but hasn't knocked them off their tracks. Federal Trade Commission Where it stands: Facebook revealed last summer that the FTC was investigating it on antitrust grounds shortly after the company agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a separate privacy probe by the same agency. One aspect of the antitrust investigation[1] involves reviewing whether Facebook's past acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were meant to smother potential competitive threats. </p><p>The FTC cleared the deals when Facebook made them in the early 2010s.FTC Chairman Joe Simons, a Trump appointee, has indicated[2] he's willing to unwind major acquisitions by big tech platforms if the commission finds the deals were anticompetitive.Separately, the FTC last month announced a review [3]of a decade of small acquisitions by Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet/Google, citing concerns that deals not big enough to trigger federal antitrust review may have led to competitive harms. The pandemic factor: The coronavirus could delay the FTC's work. An FTC spokesperson noted the commission generally seeks documents and interviews during typical investigations, but companies' priorities right now have shifted.\"FTC staff is fully operational but the commission will not sacrifice the scope and thoroughness of its investigations due to current limitations and timing concerns,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are looking at each case individually and will seek to adjust timing as needed.\" The Justice Department Where it stands: Google is in the DOJ's sights, but the agency is also conducting a broader antitrust review[4] of tech companies \u2014 bumping up against[5] the FTC's efforts. Less is known about the broader effort than the Google probe, which involves reviewing Google's online advertising[6] practices. Lawmakers have also urged the agency to probe Google's search operation[7].The FTC already investigated Google's search practices, but closed the inquiry in 2013 without taking enforcement action[8].Makan Delrahim, the DOJ's antitrust division chief, recently recused himself from the Google investigation, citing previous work lobbying on a Google deal. Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr has moved to centralize[9] oversight of the tech antitrust review through his own appointees. The pandemic factor: A DOJ spokesman declined comment on how the tech probes are affected by the coronavirus. But more broadly, the antitrust division announced Tuesday that it will seek additional time to review mergers and will conduct all meetings by phone or video conference.Capitol Hill Where it stands: The House Judiciary Committee last year launched an investigation into competition in digital markets, recently hearing complaints[10] from small and medium-sized companies about the power of tech giants.The pandemic factor: Antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline said in a statement Thursday that the pandemic will delay the investigation's timeline, which originally aimed to produce a report by the end of the first quarter. \"The most important thing right now is ensuring that the American people have the resources they need to get through this outbreak,\" Cicilline said in a statement. \"The subcommittee will get this investigation done the right way, and if that means taking longer than we planned, that's what we'll do.'States Where it stands: Almost all U.S. state attorneys general have teamed on two separate probes of Google[11] and Facebook[12], respectively led by Texas and New York. Texas AG Ken Paxton has sparred [13]with Google over outside consultants' access to documents. The pandemic factor: The tech investigations continue and their priorities haven't changed due to the coronavirus, according to a spokesperson for the New York AG's office. Similarly, Paxton spokesperson Kayleigh Date said, \"Our investigation and the resources committed to it remain ongoing and unchanged... Staff is teleworking and operating at full capacity. We do not anticipate that this health event will affect our ability to pursue the investigation as planned.\"Still, neither specifically said whether the pandemic will extend the timeline for wrapping the investigations. What's next: Antitrust investigations, once launched, tend to develop lives of their own. But the coronavirus throws big new uncertainties into the mix. The pandemic's economic consequences could ultimately point antitrust enforcers in new directions toward bad actors that exploit the crisis to, for instance, rig bids on foreclosed assets. Companies like Amazon and Facebook, after serving as lifelines for getting goods out to Americans and keeping them connected during quarantines, might find themselves better positioned to defend their scale.\"This is one of the most fascinating tweaks in antitrust history,\" said Barak Orbach, a law professor at the University of Arizona who focuses on antitrust. \"The focus would go away from Big Tech \u2014 they are our saviors now.\" [ 1]: <url

People called it Silicon Valley, and out of it flowed knowledge, ideas and innovations that gave us almost unthinkable powers to learn, to communicate, to transform our lives into exactly what we wanted them to be. The region's denizens toiled happily at the cutting edge, and day by day, they were making the world a better place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But today, this beautiful land is under attack from within and without. The products and services it sends out into the world are being called addictive, divisive and even damaging, raising the cry that instead of making the world better, they are making it worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As technology plays a deeper and more pervasive role in nearly every aspect of our lives, the industry that has upended everything from shopping and travel to education and human relationships is facing a backlash the likes of which Silicon Valley has never seen.</p><p>Polarizing online content and Russian manipulation of social media platforms have fuelled calls from the right and the left for greater regulation of firms like Google, Facebook and Twitter. World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, leftist billionaire George Soros, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson have all joined the chorus demanding the government take action.</p><p>Critics argue that the big tech firms have become too economically dominant, intruded too far into our lives and have too much control over what gets seen and shared online. At the same time, critics contend, those same companies have failed to take responsibility for the misuse of their services by malevolent actors, for the spread of fake news and for the way their platforms and algorithms can be gamed.</p><p>Stanford computer science students are protesting Apple, demanding it make less addictive devices.</p><p>The #MeToo movement has amplified a debate over sexual harassment and diversity in Silicon Valley. And conservatives have attacked the whole region as a liberal echo chamber that stifles precisely the open debate it claims to embrace.</p><p>Thus the backlash.</p><p>\"What makes it categorically different now is that this is the first time I have seen that people are saying, 'Hmmm, maybe Silicon Valley needs to be taken down to size,' \" said Leslie Berlin, project historian for Stanford University's Silicon Valley Archives. \"This notion that what Silicon Valley represents actually threatens rather than embodies what makes the country great, that is new.\"</p><p>Berners-Lee in an open letter recently called the tech giants \"a new set of gatekeepers\" whose platforms can be \"weaponized\" to widen social rifts and interfere in elections. Benioff told CNBC in January that social media was \"addictive\" and should be regulated like cigarettes. Carlson wants Google treated like a public utility because it \"shuts down free speech for political reasons.\" Former president Barack Obama, at a February conference at MIT, said social media was Balkanizing public discourse, creating \"entirely different realities\" that contribute to \"gridlock and venom and polarization in politics.\" Even Facebook has jumped in with an unusual mea culpa, issuing a news release in February admitting it was \"far too slow to recognize how bad actors were abusing our platform.\"</p><p>Despite its critics, Silicon Valley remains hugely successful and influential, with 21 per cent of employed people working in tech, according to a 2017 Federal Reserve Bank report. Though the region's economy has shown some signs of slowing, job growth in Silicon Valley has been more than double the national rate since the beginning of the economic recovery in 2010. And the region remains home to the two most valuable public companies in the world, Apple and Google's parent firm Alphabet, as well as world-class universities. Every day, people around the world benefit from Silicon Valley-built tools that have transformed communication, opened access to information, and made life easier.</p><p>The notion that Silicon Valley's best days are over is far from new - people have been predicting its demise ever since the advent of the microprocessor, said Berlin.</p><p>\"It was going to be the oil shocks of the '70s that were going to take it down, and Japanese competition was going to take it down, India and China, the Dot Com bust, Y2K - it's just been one thing after another, the '08 crash,\" Berlin said. \"Time and again, Silicon Valley has bounced back from these perceived threats. Silicon Valley has always been sort of the golden child of the Golden State.\"</p><p>But this time, Berlin and others see something shifting.</p><p>\"It is unprecedented,\" UC Berkeley Haas School of Business professor Abhishek Nagaraj, said of the backlash. \"I think this is because of how deeply penetrated tech is in people's lives.\"</p><p>Nagaraj, who studies the tech industry, compared the demonization of Silicon Valley to the outcry against Wall Street after deceptive investment banking practices knocked the U.S. into the Great Recession.</p><p>\"It appears as if, basically, tech is the new finance,\" Nagaraj said.</p><p>Increasingly, the public views the tech industry as a force against which they are powerless, said San Jose State University anthropology professor Jan English-Lueck, who researches Silicon Valley's culture.</p><p>\"It's now on people's radar screen to be a place of the elite, where they're changing the world in a way that ordinary people don't have an influence on that change,\" English-Lueck said.</p><p>While the devices and social media platforms created by hugely successful Silicon Valley tech firms have given us new ways to connect, they've also thrown the worst of human nature into our faces, said English-Lueck.</p><p>\"You don't have to look in somebody's eyes when you're telling someone something ugly,\" English-Lueck said. \"That's really exaggerated people's ability to hate.\"</p><p>She believes the optimistic view of technology as the great liberator and connector helped keep major tech firms from building more safeguards into their platforms to prevent vicious online attacks, dissemination of fake news and nation-state intrusions.</p><p>\"Do we want free speech and free action that's amplified by the internet?\" she said. \"Sometimes we don't want that.\"</p><p>Stephen Milligan, CEO of pioneering San Jose data-storage firm Western Digital, doesn't think technology can solve everything.</p><p>But Milligan doesn't buy the notion that Silicon Valley has lost its bloom. The region's companies are still trying to solve \"real problems\" in the world and having a positive impact on people's lives.</p><p>\"It's still cool,\" Milligan said. \"I actually think it's more cool.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley boosters such as Peggy Burke, CEO of Palo Alto branding agency 1185, will tell you the technology industry can fix the problems it creates.</p><p>\"You have to weigh the good and the bad, and if the bad gets so bad that it outweighs the good, someone will solve for that,\" Burke said. \"If there's a problem - traffic, transportation, housing, stopping Russians, fake news - someone in the Valley right now is working on solving for that problem. I've been in the Valley for 30 years and I've seen it happen over and over.\"</p><p>A reckoning for the region is likely, but it won't be a fatal one, Berkeley's Nagaraj said. The problems arising from technology will exacerbate the ongoing decentralization of innovation, as boot camps bring entrepreneurial skills to new regions, and clusters of expertise - in \"deep learning\" artificial intelligence in Toronto, for example - lead to co-operative projects linking the Valley to other areas, he said.</p><p>\"It's going to be a much more collaborative process than one of replacement,\" he said. \"We are moving to a world where not all the big hits come from Silicon Valley.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2018032145382612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXM-FXV1-JDH3-G1T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Although the term's current use has been taken out of its original Greek context, it once referred to a trick in theater where actors who played Gods were brought, by mechanical cranes or rising platforms, onto the stage from above or below to pleasingly and quickly resolve the story for the audience. The mechanical technology of the time was a bridge between the heavens and the earth. Though a crowd favorite, it was also a \"trick\" by which a seemingly unresolvable story was unsatisfactorily resolved.</p><p>Today, thousands of years later, we continue to live in an age where gods and machines are conflated-one in which technological 'solutions' are seen as a means of resolving the problems of society, yet never quite seem to deliver convincingly.

We now are realizing that these myths have not come to be. Many \"innovative\" systems, from facial recognition to machine-learning algorithms applied to human-resources, insurance and bank loan systems, have been found, time and again, to discriminate against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/23/18194717/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ai-bias\">racial minorities</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/diversity/why-is-artificial-intelligence-biased-against-women/\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/diversity/why-is-artificial-intelligence-biased-against-women/\">women</url>, and the      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/08/rise-of-the-racist-robots-how-ai-is-learning-all-our-worst-impulses\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/08/rise-of-the-racist-robots-how-ai-is-learning-all-our-worst-impulses\">poor.</url></p><p>Our blind trust in digital technology has not only had a huge impact on economic and political realities, but also our beliefs and aspirations; from what we consider to be progress, to the stories we tell ourselves around who an innovator is. Perniciously, these stories even appear to be fodder for those hoping to escape a supposedly unredeemable society and unsaveable planet. Whether due to global pandemics, climate crises, nuclear proliferation, or gross economic and political inequalities, collapse seems always right around the corner, if not here already, and the wealthiest and most powerful in our world are planning for it and profiting from it while the rest of us are left to accept our fate.</p><p>Technology is an important lens we can use to see and understand uni-polar, unfettered global capitalism, while also a major driver and shaper of economies across the world. Unfortunately, the technology of today, especially of the digital variety, has done little to address our human and planetary risks. Rather, as we have recently seen, it has become associated with addiction, consumerism, planned obsolescence, labor and environmental exploitation. We have spent the last few decades molding military technology (as the Internet originally was) into a weapon that may compromise rather than support our ability to come together, societally and globally, to overcome the challenges we face.</p><p>Our aim in this essay is to understand how these technologies are presented to us as both inevitable, yet intentionally obscured. A lack of transparency or accountability around new technologies makes it hard to understand how and why they are created. It also strips us of the power we need to ensure it serves our peoples-based interests.. We will also discuss how technology is driving the frontiers of capitalism beyond its traditional domains into our minds, bodies and outer space. Troublingly, these transformations rest upon the presumption that people and the planet itself are inconvenient, messy and in decline, and instead of doing everything we can to heal our planet and uplift our species, we instead design technologies that reinforce doubt and pessimism.</p><p>Before we can understand the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">whats</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">wheres</emphasis> of today's and tomorrow's technology, we need to interrogate the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">whys</emphasis>. In other words, what is the thinking and even psychology behind the digital technologies that are funded and ultimately developed? This will help us understand why technology is not only conceived of and treated as morally neutral - \"scientific\", \"innovative\", and forward-focused - but also why it is so often accorded with great social, even pseudo-religious, respect and pomp. Rather than being viewed as socially, politically, or even narcissistically or delusionally constructed, we often view technology as \"natural\" and inexorable, even sublime and divine, ignoring its true origins and contribution towards particular ideological, political, or economic agendas.</p><p>Let's consider the term<url normalizedValue=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/523781\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/523781\">\"neural network\"</url>, wherein brain cells, and how they function, are mapped onto a computer learning model,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amacad.org/publication/how-do-neurons-know\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amacad.org/publication/how-do-neurons-know\">despite us neither knowing exactly how neurons function nor being able to express the ways these cells together help us \"learn\" in failsafe mathematical or scientific language</url>. Despite these problematic issues, we rarely see any interrogation of the implicit and unfounded assumptions behind how we treat or think about computer technology, such as: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the brain is a computer, we can model the computer after the brain, and therefore an artificial intelligence system is little more than a simulation of how our brains function, but with far greater computational horsepower.</emphasis></p><p>Of course neither a hard drive nor a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm is the same as the transcendent experiences of the mind, from synesthesia to consciousness. No AI, despite all the proclamations of its time having arrived, has ever passed the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2000/08/10/turing/\">Turing Test</url>, able to convince a human it is another person and not a machine.</p><p>Despite this, leading figures in the history of Artificial Intelligence, such as Marvin Minsky, have long treated body, mind and technology as interchangeable. Consider<url normalizedValue=\"https://amzn.to/3hOeqk7\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://amzn.to/3hOeqk7\">Minsky's famous text \"The Society of Mind\"</url>, which presumes that the mind can be computationally modeled, if not augmented, simply by feeding an \"intelligent\" computer system with a large enough set of common sense rules. Not only does such a framing ignore emotional, spiritual, and embodied forms of intelligence, it reduces our mind to a formal and limited set of rules. It ignores all the other ways we learn, know, and do, our diverse cultural and social ontologies. It overlooks the social, even environmental, production of intelligence, wherein our minds, in communion with those of others, or even in relation to things, places, plants, or animals, create meaning and knowledge.</p><p>Other foundational realms that have defined our approach to technology have emphasized extending biological and cognitive metaphors to naturalize technology as well. Consider the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cybernetic</emphasis>turn in the computer sciences that dates back to the late 1940s, which explores the architectural and structural features of communication systems. The foundational science behind Artificial Intelligence, cybernetics also blindly equated the network architectures of technology with the human mind, and continues to be viewed as gospel. But in so doing, all the sweeping assumptions underlying cybernetics are ignored, particularly the genesis of its development as a mathematical architecture of warfare and defense. Norbert Wiener, the founding father of cybernetics and a revered figure at MIT, defined the field as the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/06/15/the-human-use-of-human-beings-norbert-wiener/\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/06/15/the-human-use-of-human-beings-norbert-wiener/\">\"scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.\"</url> But when one turns to animal sciences, human biology, or neurosciences, we see very few conclusive answers to how control and communication occur. This reveals how cybernetics like so many other myths and metaphors associated with technology is an example of cultural and political projection, rather than purely objective \"science.\"</p><p>Moving forward to the present and near future, we must question today's obsession with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/05/13/the-singularity-is-not-near-the-intellectual-fraud-of-the-singularitarians/\">the Singularity</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/norbert-wiener-cybernetics-human-use-artificial-intelligence.html\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/norbert-wiener-cybernetics-human-use-artificial-intelligence.html\">the spiritual successor to cybernetics</url>. Many apostles of technology not only predict, but promise this transcendent moment when computer systems come to exist that are so self-aware and highly optimized that they overtake humans in both physical and cognitive abilities, leading to major changes in civilization and perhaps even the extinction of humans altogether. The Singularity, as both idea and prediction, comes about when we develop technology for its own sake without considering the consequences, uncritically assuming somehow that it is our saviour. Many, including those busy building some of the computer and digital technologies we discuss,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2210&amp;context=etd\">believe the Singularity is a foregone conclusion</url>.</p><p>The Singularity represents, perhaps better than any example, an embrace of technological inevitability, and shares much with some of the most influential political proclamations in recent history. In his highly influential book from 1992,<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man\">\"</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man\">The End of History and the Last Man</url>,\" Francis Fukuyama declares that capitalism and western liberal democracy's defeat of socialism with the culmination of the Cold War, represents an \"end of history.\" This is notable given that in many manners, this proclaimed end of history has been defined by continued plunder, within a pro-capitalist framework across the planet, that has posed existential threats to our and other species, essentially setting the stage for a final, tragic ending to this epoch of humanity. As we can see with the wave of protests for Black Lives across the world, certainly we are nowhere close to the \"end of history\" when it comes to questions of racial justice.</p><p>In the midst of these existential challenges, where have we taken technology? Not in a direction that directly combats what we face, be it inequality, climate change or the coronavirus pandemic, but instead in the service of speculative capital and infrastructural investment, whether via space and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/09/04/hurricane-tracking-technology-is-about-to-regress-30-years-thanks-to-5g-cell-networks/\">5G infrastructures</url>, or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/10/05/artificial-intelligence-isnt-very-intelligent-and-wont-be-any-time-soon_partner/\">Artificial Intelligence</url>, all the while clinging onto the Singularity as the inevitable, yet spectacularly ill-defined, end point for humanity.</p><p>Why does it seem that tech companies in the West are so blind to our true predicaments, inventing new escapist realities and possibilities while avoiding the massive challenges that face all of humanity? This is not dissimilar from many other major players such as those within the energy and health sectors; for example, oil companies that have been<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings\">aware of their impact on the climate crisis</url> for decades yet refuse to confront the damage they cause and stymy alternatives. Perhaps the difference is that digital technology companies have convinced us they are different, somehow more enlightened and smarter than the rest of us. We know the names of the CEOs of the Big Tech companies but not the head of Exxon, Aetna, Bayer or Pfizer. Why is this? Why are we so interested in these titans of the tech industry, elevating some such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/05/12/elon-musk-wants-his-workers-to-die-so-rich-people-can-buy-more-teslas/\">Elon Musk</url> as social icons, even while many of them seem so interested in a world beyond or without 99.9% of us?</p><p>The most prominent technology \"innovators\" tend to share a common aspiration: prospecting new frontiers that represent supposed safety (for some) in times of great anxiety, whether relative to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/04/27/covid-19-is-more-than-a-public-health-crisis--its-a-political-crisis-fueled-by-the-ruling-class/\">COVID-19 crisis</url> of today, or the spectacular march towards climate-induced extinction. No wonder then that the world's wealthiest man, Amazon's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/04/16/jeff-bezos-worlds-richest-man-post-24-billion-in-personal-profit-due-to-amazons-pandemic-surge_partner/\">Jeff Bezos</url>, has matter-of-factly stated that his personal, mission-driven purpose is focused on his for-profit space exploration company Blue Origin. Peel a little further and you see in Bezos, a supposed innovator bringing our world into the future, a man full of fatalism.</p><p>When asked about his<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-thinks-his-fortune-is-best-spent-in-space-2018-05-01\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-thinks-his-fortune-is-best-spent-in-space-2018-05-01\">goals for space exploration-and eventual colonization- Bezos explains, \"I'm pursuing [Blue Origin], because I believe if we don't we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing.\"</url> Bezos, the wealthiest man in the world, is dispirited by a future of civilizational stasis. This is not surprising as his brand of innovation requires quite a bit of disequilibrium. How could a stable system exist when an online bookstore becomes one of the most profitable companies in the world? Is a system stable when Amazon warehouse workers make $27,000 a year on average, more or less at the poverty line, while Bezos makes nearly 9 million dollars an hour, and      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-wealth-150-billion-since-pandemic-2020-6\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-wealth-150-billion-since-pandemic-2020-6\">is now over 30 billion dollars richer since the onset of the COVID pandemic</url>? One does not have to probe too deeply to see that Bezos' race for space cannot be understood separately from the perpetuation of the unequal conditions he exploits and sustains on Earth.</p><p>To be fair, Bezos is not representative of every tech oligarch. But the Amazon kingpin is not alone, either. Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and numerous other billionaires have put their rhetorical and financial weight into space infrastructures and AI.</p><p>From Elon Musk, for example, beneath a thin veneer of innovative do-anything spirit, we glean a cynical defeatism. In \"Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World\" (2016), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we6rMEIGp9s\">he tells filmmaker</url> Werner Herzog that he is intent on pursuing space because society, at any moment, could come apart at the seams, due to natural or man-made disasters. Musk posits that now is the time to ensure that human beings have the opportunity to become an interplanetary species before it's too late and we no longer have the energy or technology to get all the way to Mars. While we recognize Musk's investments into solar energy, his continued attention to space and AI raises several important questions: if Musk is such an innovative genius and humanitarian, why is his energy not primarily focused on solving the problems he sees on our planet? Why not focus all his efforts on developing technologies to empower our species and keep the planet livable instead of, for example, obsessing over how to terraform Mars for the benefit of a few hundred people? It's a fantastic achievement to see Musk's SpaceX initiatives in action,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.space.com/elon-musk-emotional-spacex-astronaut-launch.html\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.space.com/elon-musk-emotional-spacex-astronaut-launch.html\">including the recent launch that occurred at the end of May 2020</url>, but who exactly are they intended to benefit?</p><p>Musk has expressed concern about Artificial Intelligence systems overtaking humans; in terms of intelligence, decision-making, and ultimately usurpation of political and economic power. He has pointed out that AI must be \"optimized\" carefully, because, intentionally or not, it could have disastrous effects. In response, Musk has devoted some rhetorical and financial weight to Open AI, which he co-founded with millennial billionaire and YCombinator founder Sam Altman.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2019/elon-musk-openai-microsoft-team-up/\">Microsoft</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2019/elon-musk-openai-microsoft-team-up/\">also just contributed</url> $      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://openai.com/about/\">1 billion to the initiative as well. Open AI</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://openai.com/about/\">describes</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://openai.com/about/\">its mission as funding and supporting research devoted to \"discovering and enacting the path toward safe Artificial Intelligence.\"</url></p><p>But what is safe, and who defines it? Should we keep building toward an \"AI-runs-everything\" Singularity given such dramatic concerns? If we take Musk's stated intentions (and concerns) at face value, the result is puzzling. For example, why does he devote time and resources to warning us about AI, while also serving as one of its biggest backers, via his for-profit company Neuralink, (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/neuralink-elon-musk.html\">which has received over 150 million dollars of funding, much of it personally from Musk</url>) that engineers implantable brain-machine interfaces? Yes, we could imagine Neuralink helping people living with disabilities a great deal, for example in assisting their ability to walk without any working limbs. But there's much more to what Neuralink represents: an interface that can transform the man-machine relationship from tool to full cyborg. Would Musk not want to stop work in this area if he feels that we are headed toward a world governed by sociopathic AIs? Instead, he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8&amp;t=5439s\">repeatedly cites human frailty and deficiency in comparison to AI, advising us that we should just \"go along for the ride.\"</url> Is Open AI nothing but a finger placed in a dike about to burst from the flood he has helped create, a failed attempt that he himself recognizes, to have his cake and eat it too? Whose ride is he talking about?</p><p>We must ask some tough questions of those we have elevated onto the big stage as \"technology innovators\" and interrogate the underlying psychology of their motivations and aspirations. Innovation once meant introducing transformations to take our world toward tomorrow, ostensibly inspired by a spirit that these achievements could lift <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all of us</emphasis> up - our businesses, citizens, environments, and societies. Innovation is a term commonly associated with resourcefulness, doing more with less, creating within conditions of scarcity, creating life out of death. Innovation is a playful, creative process, one guided by humanism in creating technologies of all kinds that together we can celebrate and enjoy.</p><p>Where did that kind of innovation go? Can a cynical defeatist actually be considered an innovator? Let's look at Apple for example, which has long been admired within the gospel of tech innovation. Is this company actually innovative given that it designs its iPhones with a ticking \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/24/apple-samsung-fined-for-slowing-down-phones\">planned obsolescence</url>\" time bomb? Why don't we instead elevate people like Los Angeles-based social entrepreneur Eric Lundgren who has taken electronic waste, repaired it into working machines, hired dozens of workers, and created a multimillion-dollar business? Lundgren's creativity and resourcefulness has been instead rewarded by      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-copyright-20180426-story.html\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-copyright-20180426-story.html\">a felony conviction and prison sentence</url>, all because he was actually innovating - creating value out of trash; doing more with less.</p><p>As we uplift these myopic, opaque, and self-serving approaches to technology innovation into heroic feats, it is no wonder that so much money is going towards literal and figurative moonshots, ones that treat not only our planet but also our bodies, minds, and frankly the rest of the universe, as spaces to be occupied and submitted to the logic of speculative capital; throwing vast sums of money into far-out technologies to shape and reshape society as a whole and ensure outrageous returns on investment. Once enough key investors (we even call them \"Angels\" sometimes) see an opportunity and sink enough money into an idea, the rest of us are forced to go along for the ride, regardless of the social utility of the product or service.</p><p>Take ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft as examples.

This is what passes as innovation these days, and represents the darker side of the \"disruption\", another branding term being constantly bandied about.</p><p>Or consider that experts predict that<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greensill.com/whitepapers/financing-the-future-of-5g/\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greensill.com/whitepapers/financing-the-future-of-5g/\">$2.7 trillion dollars of investment are required</url> to bring about 5G networks around the world.

In response to both real and imagined health impacts from 5G networks, there has been a great deal of concern and organized action to halt 5G. What has generally been lost in these discussions are the far larger challenges 5G poses as a mechanism of massive and pervasive surveillance, threatening our economic and political lives and endangering work and workers of the future.</p><p>This approach to investment is not only unsustainable, it is essentially speculation for its own sake - moving money from one sector to another, without producing much of value to everyday people, all while putting our planet in further peril. It is striking how speculative capital is also focused on a pivot away from the Earth even as technology-fueled capitalism moves towards a 5G-enabled, workerless \"brave new world\" in order to overcome the first contradiction of capital: that of organized labor moderating capitals' excesses. The addition of non-planetary geographies and resources as viable areas for capitalist expansion make sense as the system is confronted with the second contradiction of capital, wherein the overexploitation of Earth's finite natural resources like water, air and minerals are \"<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/second_contradiction.htm\">not only threats to profits and accumulation, but also to the viability of the social and \"natural\" environment as a means of life</url>.\" In the short term, destroying the planet is a good business move, but not in the long term - that is unless you can find other places in which to      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://physicsworld.com/a/the-asteroid-trillionaires/\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://physicsworld.com/a/the-asteroid-trillionaires/\">extract primary resources</url> and      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@MichaelMcBride/did-karl-marx-predict-artificial-intelligence-170-years-ago-4fd7c23505ef\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@MichaelMcBride/did-karl-marx-predict-artificial-intelligence-170-years-ago-4fd7c23505ef\">surplus value,</url> and perhaps inhabit eventually: hence the technological tendency towards outer space and our minds.

Musk, at present, however, is the dominant player in this market with his companies SpaceX and its subsidiary, Starlink.</p><p>Despite rhetoric from tech companies regarding<url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0163443719861835\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0163443719861835\">\"connecting the unconnected</url>,\" or connecting the \"last billion\" - in other words getting the entire global population online - it seems evident that the initial users of new space-based and 5G networks will be commercial, and tightly aligned with supporting other infrastructures and services of global capital. Musk's Starlink, a low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, is targeting low-latency solutions like      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/marketintegrity/2019/06/25/fspacex-is-opening-up-the-next-frontier-for-hft/\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/marketintegrity/2019/06/25/fspacex-is-opening-up-the-next-frontier-for-hft/\">high-frequency trading</url>, providing connectivity for ships and airplanes, and supplemental backhaul for 4G and 5G base stations. It does make economic sense when considering that these projects must recoup massive R&amp;D investments including building and launching thousands of satellites or hundreds of thousands of new wireless base-stations in the case of 5G.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is striking and unfortunate that these efforts are unlikely to impact unconnected populations, despite major lip-service from both new entrants like Starlink and Kuiper, as well as traditional mobile networks operators. The caveat to this is the possibility, in the case of the LEO constellations, that once they have secured sufficient income from large commercial users and the military, they should have plenty of extra capacity to provide services to uncovered areas. What remains to be seen is if these new generations of non-terrestrial connectivity will actually be affordable for the poor and marginalized populations that comprise most of the \"unconnected\".</p><p>Two out of five of techno-capitalism's sacred GAFAM brotherhood (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft), Amazon and Facebook, have low-Earth orbit satellite ventures in the works. In addition, Google is trying to get above Earth with its Loon project, albeit at a much lower altitude and within the atmosphere, using High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) technology, floating 4G and WiFi-enabled balloons in the upper atmosphere, beaming connectivity down to earth.

That is a concern given that they want to now operate global, public-facing internet provision services as well, further consolidating their ability to monetize all of we, the public's, activities and movements, while their decisions, whether around surveillance, privacy, or acquisition of intimate data, are made behind closed doors. With these corporate actors controlling every layer of the \"stack,\" from infrastructures to networks to software platforms and algorithms, it will be nearly impossible to know what data they harvest, or how it is retained or acted upon, nevermind retaining any semblance of net-neutrality.</p><p>Space-based \"connectivity technologies\" present a host of other concerns. For one, they are literally \"top-down\" - not democratic or cooperative technologies, but controlled by a small capitalist elite. We can assume that for many there is something unnerving about having the globe encircled by thousands of satellites, balloons, and drones. Perhaps this is because, from a spatial perspective, there is no way to know what infrastructure you are actually connecting to, where it is or what it is doing.</p><p>Another issue is the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06170-1/\">overcrowding of and debris associated with space and the orbits around our planet,</url> which remain, at least legally, a publicly and collectively regulated commons overseen by the United Nations.

As we've explained, next generation space networks are being specced and built to provide capacity for military capabilities, something we have also seen with<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rhizomatica.org/a-post-western-wireless-ecosystem/\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rhizomatica.org/a-post-western-wireless-ecosystem/\">5G networks</url>. The original ARPAnet, what eventually became the Internet, was funded by US taxpayers with heavy military involvement, so there is certainly historic precedent for this kind of involvement, and while concerning, it should not be too surprising that the iconic technology of our times continues to loop back to its roots as a military network.</p><p>The uneven application of so-called technological progress was apparent at the dawn of the Space Age. Consider that the race for space has historically excluded 99.9% of the population; this fact is not lost on those left behind. 50 years ago, Gil Scott Heron's epic \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goh2x_G0ct4\">Whitey on the Moon</url>\" narrated the discontent of paying taxes to put \"whitey\" on the moon while black Americans suffered from racial injustice, the absence of civil rights, and dire poverty. Why, with such profound inequalities, would the government use so much of the country's wealth to travel to space?</p><p>Heron knew that this \"innovation\" was not for him, fellow black Americans, or really anyone but the uber-rich. We see this in clear action today with a massive, unseen wave of global protests in support of black lives and justice. Whether it is publicly funded space exploration (NASA), which Heron critiques, or even worse, the private-military expeditions we have discussed, it's hard to see any benefit for most people. Heron sums it up when he chants, \"a rat done bit my sister Nell with whitey on the moon. Her face and arms began to sweat and whitey's on the moon. I can't pay no doctor bills but whitey's on the moon. Ten years from now I'll be paying still while whitey's on the moon. The man just upped my rent last night cause whitey's on the moon.\"</p><p>Not much has changed in 50 years in terms of how the oppressed view the clamor for space. In 2016, pioneering Black American hip-hop artists A Tribe Called Quest released a song called \"The Space Program.'' It goes: :</p><p>it always seems the poorest persons are forsaken, dawg. . . they'd rather lead us to the grayest water poison, deadly smog mass un-blackening, it's happening you feel it y'all? Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars, Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars, They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing. There ain't a space program for n*****s, yeah, you stuck, stuck stuck.\"</p><p>The circular process of military and public funding working hand in hand with companies to privatize the profits and socialize the adverse effects and costs back onto the public is not unique to digital technology. But it feels particularly perverse within the well cultivated, myth-saturated backdrop that we live within: of creating technologies to \"liberate\" humanity when ultimately 99% of the power and profits end up with the tech companies that dominate our world. In the meantime, the question of how we, the human species, will live on Earth moving forward is not only shoved aside, but met with fatalism, indifference and even war posturing.</p><p>What is happening here? Not a focus on\"'better tech,\" or any clear examples of how all of this will benefit humanity and combat the existential challenges we face, from pandemics to the climate crisis to arms proliferation. Instead, it is survivalism in action. In 2018, technology writer Doug Rushkoff published an essay<url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1\">entitled \"Survival of the Richest: The wealthy are plotting to leave us behind,\"</url> in which he tells the story of being invited to deliver a well-compensated speech to a number of investment bankers on the future of technology. To his surprise, few of the questions he received were about that, let alone the topic of his writing: humanizing technology. He was instead peppered with questions about 'the (apocalyptic) event', a \"euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.\"</p><p>Rushkoff was asked about angry working-class mobs, which regions were likely to be more devastated by climate change, and how to compensate and trust security guards after the whole system collapses. And then he had an epiphany of why he was invited into the room: \"Taking their cue from<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.space.com/40112-elon-musk-mars-colony-world-war-3.html\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.space.com/40112-elon-musk-mars-colony-world-war-3.html\">Elon Musk colonizing Mars</url>, libertarian venture-capitalist Peter Thiel      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood\">pumping himself with young people's blood to reverse the aging process</url>, or Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/silicon-valley-billionaire-pays-company-thousands-to-kill-him-and-preserve-his-brain-forever-a3790871.html\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/silicon-valley-billionaire-pays-company-thousands-to-kill-him-and-preserve-his-brain-forever-a3790871.html\">uploading their minds into supercomputers</url>, [the oligarchs] were preparing for a digital future that had a whole lot less to do with making the world a better place than it did with transcending the human condition altogether and insulating themselves from a very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic, and resource depletion. For them, the future of technology is really about just one thing: escape.\"</p><p>In this moment of pandemic hysteria, buttressed by technology-fueled misinformation, we can hopefully gain clarity and drive Rushkoff's conclusions home: those holding economic and political instruments of power in our world disbelieve in not only their \"innovation\" project, but question our species' survival. Rushkoff, like us, is arguing for technology that serves the interests of all people, but his attempts to convince these hedge fund managers otherwise bore no fruit. And Rushkoff's great insight was this: the financiers who are behind speculative (often delusional) tech investments are, at their core, fatalists. They have no hope for the future of our planet - belying the marketing rhetoric of the tech companies they invest in.</p><p>How can we move past the bait and switch of those constantly telling us that technologies are beneficial, even aspirational, when, in many cases, they are the opposite? How do we get beyond the hijacking of language and words like \"innovation\" to stop being blinded and instead see the painful reality: those building and monetizing the technologies of today and tomorrow themselves seem to question the \"value\" those technologies hold to our planet and species? They even seem to recognize, if not endorse, a path toward collapse. The tech barons who have broken every record imaginable in terms of philanthropic giving are at the same time grossly benefiting from the rules, both laws and code, they write around how our economic, social, and political systems function.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/539747/winners-take-all-by-anand-giridharadas/\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/539747/winners-take-all-by-anand-giridharadas/\">In an era of great philanthropy, we see even greater greed, hoarding, and oligarchic transference of power than before, a time when \"winners take all.</url>\"</p><p>If the bankers, venture capital investors, hedge fund managers, and technology innovators are going to leave us behind, then it seems those of us with far less have an opportunity to move our focus back to the question of how technology can serve us all, and what ways we can get there. As Rushkoff puts it:<url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1\">\"those of us without the funding to disown our humanity. . . don't have to use technology in such antisocial, atomizing ways.\"</url></p><p>Perhaps a useful path moving forward would be to not ignore \"space\" but consider how it, like our planet and species, might be re-considered in relation to the collective precarity by which we live. We have explained how the super-wealthy look to the sky, stratosphere, and interplanetary realm as a place to escape collapse, not so different from their Dr. Strangelove-like bunkers and super yachts. Although space is being falsely proselytized as an alternative to the here and now, as a way out of the dangerous excesses of late capitalism by those who have most profited off of such a system, that's not how space has been treated by nearly anybody else throughout the millennia. Space in many traditional and indigenous cultures is relational to planetary living. Indigenous astronomy, from most every traditional culture in the world, sees space and the cosmos dialogically with our planet, our bodies, our minds, and beliefs. Our practices of living, our relationships to our land, are interconnected with outer space. One is not the delusional panacea to the other; they dialectically inspire and cohabitate.</p><p>From those obsessed with outer space and the aim to leave the damaged Earth behind, we see a similar, absurd attachment to the freeing of our minds from our fragile, weak bodies. Many of our technology thought leaders and innovators see our physical bodies as encumbrances, believing we can and should merge our consciousness with the computer in a sort of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cupio dissolvi</emphasis> (or the wish to be dissolved into a cyborg deity) for the digital age. But how can there be knowledge, much less ethics, without embodiment? Do our minds really exist outside our bodies? Are not our minds intimately tied to the peoples, places, and times we inhabit or interact with? How can a machine, unable to feel pain, be expected to act within a moral code that it cannot relate to?</p><p>As the curtain rises on what might be the final act of late capitalism, we remain in suspense, much as our Greek ancestors thousands of years before, waiting for a saviour, a deus ex machina, to be lowered onto the stage. But it's time to step out of the disabling ruse of inevitability, weakness, and helplessness we have fallen into and push aside the fear of the unknown that has allowed a few cynical \"innovators\" to create a future in which we have even less power, agency, or ways to keep them accountable. What if we instead looked at each and every new technology from a place of collective criticality, engaging in robust dialogue around what we are doing? What if we opened up the most interesting space of all: the one where we allow different communities across the world to direct their own digital destinies? Why don't we ask whether we should be creating certain technologies, and if so for whom and for whom not? Who builds and profits from these systems? What is their mindset and agenda? We must step away from delusional techno-inevitability and toward a path of collective power and imagination.</p><p>There are a few concrete ways we can do this.</p><p>At the end of the day we must consider who technology serves and who it objectifies, instrumentalizes or threatens. It is hard to imagine different outcomes without a major, sweeping change to the ways technology development is funded. We should rethink who makes design, engineering, social, and political decisions regarding the development and roll-out of technology, in ways that are win-win, rather than ones that elevates oligarchic gain over everyone else. Our current mode of speculative investment is incompatible with putting pro-people and pro-planet goals at the forefront. We must reorient our vision for technology away from the extraction of Earth's limited energy and mineral resources and demeaning, physical and virtual sweatshop labor to one that creates value for people and contributes to healing the planet. It's time to do away with the absurd myths of transcendence and speculative longshots when it comes to the technologies that so deeply impact our lives.</p><p>Another important shift is to close the distance-physically, socially and politically-between those that develop and roll out technology and those whose lives are subject to it. We must stop elevating and enriching tech \"innovators\" whose approaches toward such innovation is unsustainable and costly to almost anyone but themselves. We should be careful with whom we entrust the keys to our future. It is simply untenable for our society to continue to rely on the whims of cynics and misanthropes to helm our collective ship into the future.</p><p>There are people, communities, and organizations all over the world doing the kind of innovation that we would like to see. We mentioned<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-copyright-20180426-story.html\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-copyright-20180426-story.html\">Eric Lundgren</url> above in this piece, and he is but one of so many examples revealing how technologies can honor our planet, workers, and the spirit of resourcefulness. That example is about repurposing and reusing technology that has already been developed, sold and used, generating value for new users and keeping it out of landfills for as long as possible. At this very moment thousands upon thousands of 2G, 3G and 4G base-stations are being ripped down to make way for 5G. Much of that equipment can easily be reconfigured to work with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://osmocom.org/\">free and open source software</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tic-ac.org\">could be installed in unconnected communities</url>. Instead most of it will rust in an e-waste graveyard, likely somewhere in Africa, further threatening our planet and species. This type of \"recycle and repair\" creativity must be coupled with regulation that ensures people are not only able to fix and repair their devices, but that minerals and other primary resources are sourced and extracted responsibly, and that technology be designed to last as long as possible, removing planned obsolescence completely from the business model of technology.</p><p>Much of this piece has looked at infrastructures, so it is crucial that we question why, in most places on earth, it is difficult, expensive and illegal for communities and everyday people to build their own communication networks. As we have seen above, LEO satellite constellations and 5G networks are incredibly complex and expensive, meaning they can likely never be built or controlled by everyday people to ensure fair prices, or the protection of personal information. But with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/americans-need-a-digital-bill-of-rights-heres-why\">\"digital bill of rights\"</url> for the world, including more favorable regulation, people, through collectives, municipalities or even sets of small businesses or cooperatives, could get more involved. Imagine if the $2.7 trillion dollars supposedly needed for 5G was invested in participatory ways to support the build-out of networks where people want and need them and that included communities and the public in the governance of the network and their data.</p><p>We live in a time where proposals to combat the gross inequalities of our planet are more popular than ever. Universal Basic Income, as a means of re-directing the flows of profits and wealth away from plutocrats toward a more balanced society, is wildly popular, and has become a reality, at least temporarily, around the globe during the coronavirus pandemic.

We see billions upon billions of dollars poured into initiatives that further lock people into echo chambers of psychological and behavioral manipulation and constant 24-7-365 surveillance. We see the destruction of journalism as disinformation reigns supreme, elevating authoritarians and neo-fascists to positions of great power. We are witnessing the socializing of all the costs and pain, and the privatization of all the profits in the hands of those who have such little faith in the rest of us or the planet that birthed them. It's time for a digital future where all of us can thrive.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1593552168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6082-9VR1-DYTP-R1H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

Six months ago we, a labor leader and an Amazon vice president, would have been on opposite sides in discussing the future of work at Big Tech in general and Amazon in particular. Then on May 1, one of us, Tim, walked away from a senior role at Amazon Web Services, and potentially millions in compensation, in protest over the firing of workers who spoke out about conditions in the company\u2019s warehouses.    During the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen Big Tech share prices and revenue rocket, while some of Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers say they fear coming to work and catching the coronavirus. The company\u2019s decision to fire the activists who demanded safer jobs is unacceptable.    Both of us now agree: Amazon \u2014 and the rest of Big Tech \u2014 must change. And that includes allowing its workers to unionize.    We\u2019re not alone in wanting accountability from these companies: Jeff Bezos and the heads of Facebook, Google and Apple will appear before the House judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee today.    ALSO READ: How to fight against big tech's power, break out of the stranglehold    The coronavirus has killed over half a million people worldwide and pushed global unemployment to rates not seen since the Great Depression. Shared sacrifice is called for, yet the burden has been far from even. Since mid-March, when quarantined shoppers turned to Amazon\u2019s vast retail platform, its shareholder value increased by nearly $500 billion, to more than $1.4 trillion. Stock market shares are owned disproportionately by the richest people in society, and by Mr. Bezos in particular; his lead over the other richest people on earth has increased markedly.    This wealth is not shared with the workers who help create it. The temporary Covid-19-related hourly raise was rolled back in June, but the order flow remains high, making the already stressful work of those who sort, package and deliver Amazon goods even worse.    As this was unfolding, most of Big Tech, including Amazon, sent white-collar workers home to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and fight the pandemic. Tim saw company leadership go to great lengths to make sure this new system was working and actively seek feedback from the remote workers. Christy heard from a warehouse employee who said productivity targets made it difficult for workers to take a break even for hand washing without a mark on their record. Pay for warehouse workers starts at $15 an hour with minimal access to time off; in May Amazon ended the unpaid leave policy that for a few weeks allowed them to stay home if they had Covid-19 symptoms. The contrast in the treatment of knowledge and warehouse workers couldn\u2019t be starker. Equally clear is the cause: One group has power, the other doesn\u2019t.         ALSO READ: United in their ire, US lawmakers lash out at big tech cos leaders    Amazon\u2019s decision to fire the activists was easy to make in the United States, where Amazon workers have no union and are left to fend for themselves. With no right to paid sick leave or protection from unfair dismissal, American workers are among the most vulnerable in the world to pressure from any employer, not just Amazon.    Union-represented Amazon workers in Spain, Italy, France and Germany initially failed to resolve their concerns through negotiation, but with court action, regulatory intervention and strikes, they got their needs addressed.    Let\u2019s look at France: Unions there brought a civil case arguing that Amazon had taken inadequate steps to protect workers from infection risk and that it had sidestepped the unions\u2019 statutory role. The court ordered Amazon to limit its sales to only \u201cessential\u201d items, or face harsh penalties until it could reach a safety agreement with the unions. Rather than negotiate, Amazon closed its French operations and appealed. But the appellate court also sided with the workers, who ultimately negotiated a settlement including mandatory union consultation over safety measures, union hiring of external experts to assess the measures\u2019 effectiveness and a continued increase in workers\u2019 hourly pay. The news from Europe shows that Amazon can work with unions and get good results.    Both of us want Amazon to share the wealth with workers and stop putting the relentless pursuit of revenue growth ahead of all other concerns. One way or another, this requires putting more power in the hands of workers. Regulation and legislation are part of the solution. But there\u2019s no need to wait; power can be taken, not just given. That\u2019s what unions are for.    Amazon is a data-driven company. It should recognize the evidence showing that countries with more collective bargaining have a stronger social fabric and better growth, and are more able to weather economic ups and downs. Businesses with collective bargaining relationships, including Auchan Retail and Carrefour, navigated the Covid-19 crisis with less disruption to their businesses and emerged with their reputations intact and even enhanced.    ALSO READ: Pichai says 'Google cares', Bezos 'can't remember' in Congressional hearing    For its own future and the future of the global economy, Amazon should become more responsive to the women and men who\u2019ve enriched shareholders and be willing to recognize and bargain with their representatives. When it comes to the rights of its workers, it should be a leader, not a laggard.    It\u2019s not just Amazon: The need for more unionization is urgent across Big Tech. Amazon stands out because it combines the extraordinary profit margins of these companies with employing hundreds of thousands of front-line workers. There are fewer of these workers at the other iconic tech companies, but nevertheless their employees also deserve a voice over the issues that matter to them.    The question for Mr. Bezos and the billionaires of the world is: Are they ready to rise to the occasion? Will Big Tech listen to and work with its employees to help the world overcome the worst economic and social crisis in recent history?     (Tim Bray is a former vice president at Amazon. Christy Hoffman is the general secretary of UNI Global Union)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42718004452</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-4671-JCSC-J0W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Business Standard India</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

An on-board personal computer with dual Intel Corp. 750-megahertz Pentium III chips powers H7.  The robot connects to the lab's computer network via wireless signals.  In a demonstration video, a spokesman said, \"It is our hope that this research can contribute to the realization of a general-purpose humanoid robot\" for homes and offices.  The video shows H7 bending down and picking up something under a chair. The robot also walks across the room to bring a soft drink to one of the researchers.  The robot is 54 inches tall and weighs 121 pounds. It has dual 3D cameras that act as its \"eyes.\" It uses Linux operating software, and face recognition and motion planning software.  The development team plans to show H7 for the first time outside of Japan at a Linux trade show in Milan, Italy, this month.  James DeTar As A Cost-Cutter, Ostrich Flies Ostrich tamales are on the menu at a big tech company. Does that mean excess has returned to Silicon Valley? Not at all, says Mark Zammit, director of culinary support for Bon Appetit Management Co. It provides food service at firms like Cisco Systems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Corp.  Tech tastes, which once veered toward the extravagant and exotic, are now looking for value.  \"Our chefs are saying people want comfort foods,\" Zammit said.</p><p>Meatloaf and pot roast are big items nowadays. Seafood is also popular. But Zammit says catfish may be used in lieu of more expensive halibut.  Ostrich tamales, on the menu at AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Netscape unit, actually exemplify the food frugality. Ground ostrich costs no more than ground beef, and contains less fat.  Robert Hart, executive chef at computer maker Silicon Graphics Inc., introduced a \"Frugal Gourmet Bar.\" Instead of prime rib and Cornish game hens, diners now are going for grilled cheese, hamburgers and macaroni and cheese. The new menu means diners spend about $ 2 less for lunch.  \"People have been praising us for changing over the new menu,\" Hart said. Mike Angell Some Tech Firms Power On Power semiconductors, as the name says, regulate the juice flowing through computers. As bigger chips draw more power, power chips become a lot more important.  One leader in this area is Microsemi Corp. Its stock price rose from 23.05 on Sept. 6 to 35.39 in late-day Nov. 2 trading. That's a gain of 54% in less than two months.  Microsemi isn't the only pretty face in the crowd. Power control chipmakersO2Micro International Ltd., Cayman Islands, and Power Integrations Inc. of San Jose, Calif., are doing well.  In a Nov. 2 report on O2Micro, Needham &amp; Co. analyst Dan Scovel wrote, \"We believe it is well positioned for significant growth.\" O2Micro's stock outperformed 90% of all stocks in the past 12 months.  Power Integrations' stock has performed nearly as well. It outperformed 89% of all stocks this past year. It rose 47.5% in seven weeks, from 16.27 on Sept. 19 to 24 on Nov. 2.  Howard Earhart, Power Integrations' chairman and chief executive, says the company's adding products. He expects new products will grow from 16% of revenue in 2000 to account for 40% this year.

This week, it became the latest country to announce plans to tax revenue earned by tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon. The current system, according to prime minister Jacinda Ardern, is \"not fair\" and \"not sustainable\".</p><p>This story is familiar. Digital behemoths are making an estimated NZ$2.7 billion (EUR 1.6 billion) from Kiwi consumers but pay very little tax on that business in New Zealand itself. At just shy of EUR 50 million, the upper end of the range of estimates for what could be gleaned from a possible digital sales tax would be modest in the scheme of those companies' revenues, but make a real difference to public finances.</p><p>The UK, where yesterday a parliamentary committee accused Facebook of being \"digital gangsters\", is also keener than most on a tech tax, and has floated the idea of a 2 per cent levy on digital sales for companies above a certain size. </p><p>Australia, too, is mulling a digital sales tax, while India already has an effective tech tax called the equalisation levy, which it will soon be following up with another law targeting companies with a \"significant economic presence\".</p><p>The EU, for its part, has published a draft plan to impose a 3 per cent tax on the tech giants' advertising sales.</p><p>Ireland, Sweden, Denmark and Finland objected to an earlier plan for a levy on total revenues and the advertising-only compromise might not be enough to get the new proposal over the line.</p><p>Even Germany has edged into wait-and-see mode, talking up the merits of doing nothing much until the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is set to deliver a report on the issue sometime in 2020.</p><h>Quarterly performance In the meantime, those industries disrupted by what they regard as a slanted playing field on tax and regulation will continue to object, with their weakest links wilting to financial failure while they wait.</h><p>A year is a long time in technology, but right now the companies that would be caught by an online advertising sales tax are still powering ahead, with their recent spate of fourth-quarter earnings updates revealing few immediate causes for concern.</p><p>Facebook may have been beset by multiple data privacy, security, online abuse and misinformation scandals, but major revenue wobbles are, so far, conspicuous by their absence. </p><p>Google's parent Alphabet Inc has seen a slowdown in the pace at which its ad revenues are growing, but the necessary context here is that they are still expanding by 20 per cent. Analysts at eMarketer, who stress that Google's ad slowdown is to be expected because of its well-established gargantuan status, forecast it will collect $102 billion in digital ad revenues in 2019 (with YouTube accounting for about 11 per cent of this figure). </p><p>This will give Google a 31.3 per cent share of the worldwide digital ad market, while the share enjoyed by Facebook and its increasingly vital sister brand Instagram is expected to reach 20.5 per cent, or $67 billion. </p><h>Advertising prowess Both Alphabet and Facebook beat Wall Street's expectations on revenue and profit in the fourth quarter of 2018. For now, the biggest threat to their ongoing ability to clean up is neither taxation nor regulation, but the fast-strengthening advertising prowess of e</h><p>commerce kings Amazon.</p><p>Jeff Bezos's ubiquitous company is on track to earn $9 billion in digital ad revenue this year. </p><p>Although this would only be a market share of 2.8 per cent, eMarketer forecasts that it will eventually challenge Facebook for the number two spot, taking advertising dollars off both it and Google. </p><p>As these giants fight it out among themselves, a second tier of tech companies will share in the digital ad nibbles, leaving scraps for the likes of news publishers. </p><p>It is little wonder, then, that those media companies with no revenue sources other than digital advertising tend to be either loss-leader services for wider business empires or in painful, layoff-scarred retreat. </p><p>What's that? The sound of silence from Kildare Street? Yes, Ireland remains the grateful outpost of Silicon Valley. Elsewhere, however, the debate about the taxation and regulation of Big Tech has now moved on from whether it should happen to how.</p><p>Luckily, the survivalists are unlikely to start digging up the Silicon Docks to install bomb-proof shelters the next time they're passing through. </p><p>Thanks to Ireland's likely exposure to the nuclear blast winds, New Zealand still has the edge when it comes to entrepreneurs' post-apocalyptic retirements.</p><p>Of course, they will have to make it to their private escape jets first.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3798544</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFV-XTF1-DYS1-00R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Last year, Walmart contracted to deploy 360 in-store autonomous floor cleaners ' or robot janitors ' using Brain Corp.'s operating system.</p><p> Then in April, the nation's largest retailer added an additional 1,500 stores, bringing the total deployment of BrainOS powered scrubbers to 1,860.</p><p> In addition to Walmart, the company also has BrainOS-powered floor cleaners running in airports, shopping malls and other locations. The company also has unveiled an operating system to power delivery robots, allowing them to move an object from one point to another.</p><p> Most of the company's current business is based in North America, though in 2017 it opened a satellite office in Japan.</p><p> In its new European location, Brain Corp. will primarily focus on providing support to regional partners, but the facility also will have software development and research and development functions.</p><p> UK investigates Amazon deal with food delivery firm</p><p> The U.K. competition watchdog this month launched an investigation into Amazon's purchase of a big stake in food delivery service Deliveroo, a move that suggests authorities are taking a harder line on the expansion of Big Tech.</p><p> While the deal had not been billed as a takeover by Amazon, the Competition and Markets Authority said it has \"reasonable grounds for suspecting\" that the agreement could \"result in Amazon and Deliveroo ceasing to be distinct.\"</p><p> The investigation will put on hold any plans to merge its operations with Deliveroo, whose delivery bikes and scooters are ubiquitous in many major cities. Besides Britain, it also operates in several countries in Europe and Asia, including Germany, France, Italy and Australia.</p><p> The investigation comes as the regulator is taking a more activist role in seeking to protect consumers in an evolving marketplace.</p><p> It also comes as American authorities likewise are taking steps to reign in the growing power of large tech firms. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices. The House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe, promising \"a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.\"</p><p> British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes.</p><p> Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged to work closely with regulators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ROANOK-ROA0029596732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABB6A27FE3B1 ROANOK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJV-1XH1-JBCN-435B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144578</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"484\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times-World, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Roanoke Times (Virginia)</publicationName><edition>Metro Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 14, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They tended to raise a variety of issues, including: The First Amendment's bar on the government regulating private speech such as the fact-check label Twitter added to clarify[2] a false claim Trump recently tweeted.The president's lack of authority to overrule an act of Congress, in this case by blunting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the longstanding immunity shield Trump is asking federal regulators to reinterpret.The fact that the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission are independent agencies of the federal government not meant to take direction from the White House.The threat posed by misinformation generally, and election interference specifically; Twitter added the fact-check label, which infuriated Trump[3] and immediately preceded the executive order, to address election-related misinformation from the president.The possibility that the order is in fact an attempt to distract from the president's coronavirus response. </p><p>Yes, but: There were a few Republicans who spoke up in favor of the order, including FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).What they're saying:Politicans and officials: Sen. Marsha Blackburn: \"Social media has a history of subjectively manipulating algorithms to censor free speech. ... It takes a leader like President Donald Trump to bring much needed action on Big Tech abuses.\"U.S. Reps Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.), Mike Doyle (D-Penn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.): \"We will be watching the FTC and FCC, both independent agencies created by Congress, as well as social media platforms to ensure they are acting in the American people's best interest and not simply appeasing a self-aggrandizing bully.\"Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.): \"As the co-author of Section 230, let me make this clear: there is nothing in the law about political neutrality. It does not say companies like Twitter are forced to carry misinformation about voting, especially from the president.\"FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel: \"Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the President's speech police is not the answer. It's time for those in Washington to speak up for the First Amendment. History won't be kind to silence.'FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr: \"I welcome today's executive order and its call for guidance on the scope of the unique and conditional set of legal privileges that Congress conferred on social media companies but no other set of speakers in Section 230.\"A spokesperson for the FTC: \"The FTC is committed to robust enforcement of consumer protection and competition laws, including with respect to social media platforms, and consistent with our jurisdictional authority and constitutional limitations.\" Companies: Twitter: \"This EO is a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law. #Section230 protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values. Attempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms.\"Google: \"Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences. Undermining Section 230 in this way would hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.\"Facebook: \"We believe in protecting freedom of expression on our services, while protecting our community from harmful content including content designed to stop voters from exercising their right to vote.\" Nonprofits and trade groups: Ashkhen Kazaryan, director of civil liberties at TechFreedom: \"This is pure political theatre \u2014 and an affront to the Constitution. The Order is a hodgepodge of outdated and inapplicable precedents combined with flagrant misinterpretations of both the First Amendment and Section 230.\"Americans for Prosperity senior tech policy analyst Billy Easley: 'This executive ordermisreadsthe law andmistakesthe role of government.Censorship comes from government trying to police speech \u2014 not private companies.... If lawmakers are truly concerned with ideological bias limiting free expression online, they should recognize that Section 230 is the very tool that enables companies to counter that trend.'Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy, for Consumer Reports: 'This executive order is a half-baked effort that will have few legal effects, but it could chill free expression online and threaten the open internet. A fact check by Twitter is an editorial decision protected by the First Amendment.Software &amp;#38; Information Industry Association CEO Jeff Joseph: 'The freedom to express one's views without government interference is not only the bedrock principle of the First Amendment, but the goose that laid America's technology golden egg. Our free marketplace of ideas created a world-leading internet industry. Section 230 is part and parcel of that success.\"CCIA President Matt Schruers: 'Claims of systemic bias by social media companies are a fiction intended to pressure companies into making content moderation decisions more favorable to the Administration. Setting regulators upon the private sector to achieve that end is a grave misuse of government resources in a time of national crisis.'U.S. Chamber of Commerce: \"We believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system. Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.\"Rachel Bovard, senior adviser for the Internet Accountability Project: \"The social media platforms, regardless of whether or not they are bound by the First Amendment, should be held accountable to their end users. There are many lawmakers looking to recalibrate the law in order to foster the accountability and transparency that achieves that goal. President Trump's Executive Order seeks those same ends.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-protections-8a53f1c6-3c05-4844-98a3-071373b497a8.html\">https://www.axios.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-protections-8a53f1c6-3c05-4844-98a3-071373b497a8.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-twitter-fact-check-mail-voting-f37a0845-57f6-4990-bee6-da7c00b0f0c6.html\">https://www.axios.com/trump-twitter-fact-check-mail-voting-f37a0845-57f6-4990-bee6-da7c00b0f0c6.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-accuses-twitter-2020-election-interference-bb980ee5-7f36-4db3-a3f5-4bb9de71f0ae.html\">https://www.axios.com/trump-accuses-twitter-2020-election-interference-bb980ee5-7f36-4db3-a3f5-4bb9de71f0ae.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544159071644285025876100131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-B8Y1-F03R-N3JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1197\"/><timeReceived>1:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Background: The tech industry's last real experience of financial adversity was a generation ago, when the dotcom bust leveled the tech sector. The recession of 2001 hit Silicon Valley extra hard, while the Great Recession of 2007-2009 left it relatively unscathed.\"RIP Good Times,\"[1] an infamous presentation by Sequoia Capital in 2008, tried to warn tech of a coming downturn that barely materialized \u2014 and the following decade turned into a unicorn-breeding, billionaire-minting, IPO-launching Gilded Age for the industry.Today, most startups and many well-established firms are led and staffed by people who have no first-hand experience of the brutal logic of industry shrinkage. </p><p>Veterans of the dotcom collapse 20 years ago recall how it played out then.Winners: ROI (return on investment) and cash revenue: Companies that don't rely on borrowed money or equity financing are in a much better position to keep the lights on.B2B (business-to-business): services and products with other businesses as their customers tend to fare better than companies that serve consumer markets. M...mergers and acquisitions): The lawyers and financiers who help growing companies buy out their competitors also make out like bandits in a downturn, when failing companies need to consolidate. Losers: Advertising and media: Marketing budgets are easy to cut fast, and media outfits dependent on those budgets feel the pain the fastest.Employee activism: Layoffs spread fear among workers, job mobility and openings evaporate, companies feel less need to keep their employees happy \u2014 leaving workers without the security they need to speak out.Diversity and inclusion efforts: While experts say a diverse workforce is good for the bottom line, recruiting and retention efforts require investments that often get pinched in lean times.Idealistic mission statements: \"Changing the world\" gets swapped out very quickly for \"Staying alive.\" A coronavirus-triggered recession could affect tech in unexpected ways. The industry is highly dependent on international collaboration, cross-border supply chains and global consumer demand, all of which are threatened by the prospect of a pandemic. But a shelter-in-place mentality could prove a boon to videoconferencing[2], e-commerce, and other tech-driven trends that let lives go on with less direct human contact. A market retreat could also reshape the inside-the-Beltway critique of Big Tech. Arguments for tough new regulations based on the industry's power might look different in a world where tech giants' stock had been battered and their spending cut, on everything from lobbying to acquisitions.20 years ago, a new wave of companies (including Google, founded 1998, Salesforce, founded 1999, and Facebook, founded 2004) germinated while the giants of the era froze in place or withered.The big question today is whether a downturn would clear space for a new generation of startups to blossom, or just leave today's giants more deeply entrenched. Yes, but: Two days of 3-percent-plus losses in the market don't constitute a downturn, or even, in technical terms, a market \"correction\" (which is defined as a 10 percent drop). Markets took a dive in late 2018 on recession fears, only to come roaring back.Today's financial world is still awash in cash, which could provide a calming buffer. The venture capital world is still looking to invest huge amounts: Per Pitchbook, funds raised a record $88.3 billion and $75.5 billion in 2018 and 2019, respectively.In some cases, smaller companies started laying people off [3]even before this market drop, so they might be able to weather it more easily. The bottom line: This week's precipitous drops remind everyone in tech that graph-lines don't alway move up as they move to the right. The alarm might wake the Valley \u2014 but the industry could also just hit \"snooze.\" Go deeper: How the Great Recession teed off tech's long boom[4]Work goes remote in the face of the coronavirus[5] [ 1]: <url

Zuckerberg said: \"We started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable. As I understand our laws, companies aren't bad just because they are big. Many large companies that fail to compete cease to exist.\" </p><p>                     Tech issues affect tech CEOs too                   </p><p>If you've ever felt embarrassed for your wi-fi connection messing up during an important work presentation, don't worry. If the CEOs of the biggest tech companies in the world can't get it right during a major congressional hearing, then you're off the hook. </p><p>The hearing was beset with poor audio and flat-screen televisions switching off - at one point, Bezos escaped questioning for about an hour because of a tech issue, <url normalizedValue=\"https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech-congress/u-s-lawmakers-accuse-big-tech-of-crushing-rivals-to-boost-profits-idINKCN24U1FI\">according to Reuters</url>, and he reached for what looked like a snack during the hearings. Defending your company's practices before lawmakers is hungry work. </p><p>                     Stealing ideas                    </p><p>One of the big accusations levelled at the tech four was the idea of stealing content and ideas from smaller rivals in order to retain their dominance. For instance, Democrat David Cicilline asked Google: \"Why does Google steal content from honest businesses?,\" following allegations that the tech giant stole reviews from Yelp and threatened to delist Yelp from search results if there were objections. </p><p>Pichai responded by saying: \"We conduct ourselves to the highest standards.\"</p><p>                     Essentially, app developers with subscription models on the Apple App Store, such as Spotify, have to pay Apple a 30 per cent of the subscriptions taken through the store, something which also applies to ebooks. There are concerns that Apple has used these policies to favour its own products and services. </p><p>Apple was accused that there was nothing to stop the company from raising commissions for the App Store. Cook disagreed with this notion. </p><p>\"The competition for developers -they can write their apps for Android or Windows or Xbox or PlayStation. We have fierce competition at the developer side and the customer side, which is essentially so competitive I would describe it as a street fight.\"</p><p>                     Why does this matter?                   </p><p>Antitrust investigations all go back to the idea of, is this particular company or monopoly partaking in practices that <url normalizedValue=\"https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech-congress/u-s-lawmakers-accuse-big-tech-of-crushing-rivals-to-boost-profits-idINKCN24U1FI\">prevent fair competition in business</url>, such as price-fixing conspiracies, corporate mergers that will cut off other companies in the market and doing anything to gain or hold monopoly power. </p><p>Whether its Apple's App Store policy, Facebook gobbling up other companies, or Google and Amazon using its data to create its own products which will dominate third-parties, these could all be seen as antitrust practices, and it's against US law to do so. The overall opinion, whether it's from Congress to other tech companies, is that something needs to be done to take back control of the web </p><p>\"Large internet companies have been enablers of community, transparency and positive change, but also of abuse, hate speech, bullying, misinformation, data breaches, government manipulation and more. These powerful corporations have built empires by exchanging free services for users' data and hiding their practices behind difficult-to-understand terms of service and privacy policies, said Dries Buytaert, CTO of the digital experience platform <url normalizedValue=\"https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech-congress/u-s-lawmakers-accuse-big-tech-of-crushing-rivals-to-boost-profits-idINKCN24U1FI\">Acquia</url> and founder of content management platform Drupal.</p><p>\"Open web and privacy advocates have seen these problems coming for a long time. I'm glad more and more people are waking up to this, and I'm hopeful that increased regulation may fix some of the web's current problems and ensure that we keep building an open, safe and decentralised web for decades and generations to come.\"</p><p>Cicilline's closing statement summed it up nicely: \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\" </p><p>                     What happens next?                    </p><p>The committee is set to release a report on the antitrust allegations against the tech companies and how to control their market power by early autumn.</p><p>It could be that Congress will introduce legislation that reins in the power of the companies and limits their ability to create monopolies, but we'll have to see the results of the report first. <url normalizedValue=\"https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech-congress/u-s-lawmakers-accuse-big-tech-of-crushing-rivals-to-boost-profits-idINKCN24U1FI\">The Guardian</url> says Congress is considering rewriting antitrust laws but no new legislation is expected soon. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-64827820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-RS31-F021-60H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><timeReceived>9:58 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.</p><p>The CEOs testified remotely to lawmakers, most of whom sat, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired long-standing grievances that the tech companies censor conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLPD-1003511024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLPD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-YW11-DY37-3005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so?</p><p>\"One possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?\" a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. \"For me, that's more worrying. Maybe I'm missing something?\"</p><p>When Mr. Harari toured the Bay Area this fall to promote his latest book, the reception was incongruously joyful. Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, threw him a dinner party. The leaders of X, Alphabet's secretive research division, invited Mr. Harari over. Bill Gates reviewed the book (\"Fascinating\" and \"such a stimulating writer\") in The New York Times.</p><p>\"I'm interested in how Silicon Valley can be so infatuated with Yuval, which they are - it's insane he's so popular, they're all inviting him to campus - yet what Yuval is saying undermines the premise of the advertising- and engagement-based model of their products,\" said Tristan Harris, Google's former in-house design ethicist and the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>Part of the reason might be that Silicon Valley, at a certain level, is not optimistic on the future of democracy. The more of a mess Washington becomes, the more interested the tech world is in creating something else, and it might not look like elected representation. Rank-and-file coders have long been wary of regulation and curious about alternative forms of government. A separatist streak runs through the place: Venture capitalists periodically call for California to secede or shatter, or for the creation of corporate nation-states. And this summer, Mark Zuckerberg, who has recommended Mr. Harari to his book club, acknowledged a fixation with the autocrat Caesar Augustus. \"Basically,\" Mr. Zuckerberg told The New Yorker, \"through a really harsh approach, he established 200 years of world peace.\"</p><p>Mr. Harari, thinking about all this, puts it this way: \"Utopia and dystopia depends on your values.\"</p><p>Mr. Harari, who has a Ph.D. from Oxford, is a 42-year-old Israeli philosopher and a history professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The story of his current fame begins in 2011, when he published a book of notable ambition: to survey the whole of human existence. \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,\" first released in Hebrew, did not break new ground in terms of historical research. Nor did its premise - that humans are animals and our dominance is an accident - seem a likely commercial hit. But the casual tone and smooth way Mr. Harari tied together existing knowledge across fields made it a deeply pleasing read, even as the tome ended on the notion that the process of human evolution might be over. Translated into English in 2014, the book went on to sell more than eight million copies and made Mr. Harari a celebrity intellectual.</p><p>He followed up with \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,\" which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari's future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.</p><p>Now, he has written a book about the present and how it could lead to that future: \"21 Lessons for the 21st Century.\" It is meant to be read as a series of warnings. His recent TED Talk was called \"Why fascism is so tempting - and how your data could power it.\"</p><p>His prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals' strange delight. \"If you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,\" he told me, sounding weary, \"some of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.\"</p><p>'Brave New World' as Aspirational Reading</p><p>Mr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X's offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look - like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get.</p><p>At the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.</p><p>Some workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail. Mr. Harari told them to think more starkly: If there isn't a major policy intervention, most humans probably will not adapt at all.</p><p>It made him sad, he told me, to see people build things that destroy their own societies, but he works every day to maintain an academic distance and remind himself that humans are just animals. \"Part of it is really coming from seeing humans as apes, that this is how they behave,\" he said, adding, \"They're chimpanzees. They're sapiens. This is what they do.\"</p><p>He was slouching a little. Socializing exhausts him.</p><p>As we boarded the black gull-wing Tesla Mr. Harari had rented for his visit, he brought up Aldous Huxley. Generations have been horrified by his novel \"Brave New World,\" which depicts a regime of emotion control and painless consumption. Readers who encounter the book today, Mr. Harari said, often think it sounds great. \"Everything is so nice, and in that way it is an intellectually disturbing book because you're really hard-pressed to explain what's wrong with it,\" he said. \"And you do get today a vision coming out of some people in Silicon Valley which goes in that direction.\"</p><p>An Alphabet media relations manager later reached out to Mr. Harari's team to tell him to tell me that the visit to X was not allowed to be part of this story. The request confused and then amused Mr. Harari. It is interesting, he said, that unlike politicians, tech companies do not need a free press, since they already control the means of message distribution.</p><p>He said he had resigned himself to tech executives' global reign, pointing out how much worse the politicians are. \"I've met a number of these high-tech giants, and generally they're good people,\" he said. \"They're not Attila the Hun. In the lottery of human leaders, you could get far worse.\"</p><p>Some of his tech fans, he thinks, come to him out of anxiety. \"Some may be very frightened of the impact of what they are doing,\" Mr. Harari said.</p><p>Still, their enthusiastic embrace of his work makes him uncomfortable. \"It's just a rule of thumb in history that if you are so much coddled by the elites it must mean that you don't want to frighten them,\" Mr. Harari said. \"They can absorb you. You can become the intellectual entertainment.\"</p><p>Dinner, With a Side of Medically Engineered Immortality</p><p>C.E.O. testimonials to Mr. Harari's acumen are indeed not hard to come by. \"I'm drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,\" Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.</p><p>And Mr. Hastings wrote: \"Yuval's the anti-Silicon Valley persona - he doesn't carry a phone and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid. We see in him who we wish we were.\" He added, \"His thinking on A.I. and biotech in his new book pushes our understanding of the dramas to unfold.\"</p><p>At the dinner Mr. Hastings co-hosted, academics and industry leaders debated the dangers of data collection, and to what degree longevity therapies will extend the human life span. (Mr. Harari has written that the ruling class will vastly outlive the useless.) \"That evening was small, but could be magnified to symbolize his impact in the heart of Silicon Valley,\" said Dr. Fei-Fei Li, an artificial intelligence expert who pushed internally at Google to keep secret the company's efforts to process military drone footage for the Pentagon. \"His book has that ability to bring these people together at a table, and that is his contribution.\"</p><p>A few nights earlier, Mr. Harari spoke to a sold-out theater of 3,500 in San Francisco. One ticket-holder walking in, an older man, told me it was brave and honest for Mr. Harari to use the term \"useless class.\"</p><p>The author was paired for discussion with the prolific intellectual Sam Harris, who strode onstage in a gray suit and well-starched white button-down. Mr. Harari was less at ease, in a loose suit that crumpled around him, his hands clasped in his lap as he sat deep in his chair. But as he spoke about meditation - Mr. Harari spends two hours each day and two months each year in silence - he became commanding. In a region where self-optimization is paramount and meditation is a competitive sport, Mr. Harari's devotion confers hero status.</p><p>He told the audience that free will is an illusion, and that human rights are just a story we tell ourselves. Political parties, he said, might not make sense anymore. He went on to argue that the liberal world order has relied on fictions like \"the customer is always right\" and \"follow your heart,\" and that these ideas no longer work in the age of artificial intelligence, when hearts can be manipulated at scale.</p><p>Everyone in Silicon Valley is focused on building the future, Mr. Harari continued, while most of the world's people are not even needed enough to be exploited. \"Now you increasingly feel that there are all these elites that just don't need me,\" he said. \"And it's much worse to be irrelevant than to be exploited.\"</p><p>The useless class he describes is uniquely vulnerable. \"If a century ago you mounted a revolution against exploitation, you knew that when bad comes to worse, they can't shoot all of us because they need us,\" he said, citing army service and factory work.</p><p>Now it is becoming less clear why the ruling elite would not just kill the new useless class. \"You're totally expendable,\" he told the audience.</p><p>This, Mr. Harari told me later, is why Silicon Valley is so excited about the concept of universal basic income, or stipends paid to people regardless of whether they work. The message is: \"We don't need you. But we are nice, so we'll take care of you.\"</p><p>On Sept. 14, he published an essay in The Guardian assailing another old trope - that \"the voter knows best.\"</p><p>\"If humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don't reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?\" he wrote. \"How do you live when you realize ... that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.\"</p><p>'O.K., So Maybe Humankind Is Going to Disappear'</p><p>Mr. Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, who is also his manager, rented a small house in Mountain View for their visit, and one morning I found them there making oatmeal. Mr. Harari observed that as his celebrity in Silicon Valley has risen, tech fans have focused on his lifestyle.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley was already kind of a hotbed for meditation and yoga and all these things,\" he said. \"And one of the things that made me kind of more popular and palatable is that I also have this bedrock.\" He was wearing an old sweatshirt and denim track pants. His voice was quiet, but he gestured widely, waving his hands, hitting a jar of spatulas.</p><p>Mr. Harari grew up in Kiryat Ata, near Haifa, and his father worked in the arms industry. His mother, who worked in office administration, now volunteers for her son handling his mail; he gets about 1,000 messages a week. Mr. Yahav's mother is their accountant.</p><p>Most days, Mr. Harari doesn't use an alarm clock, and wakes up between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m., then meditates and has a cup of tea. He works until 4 or 5 p.m., then does another hour of meditation, followed by an hourlong walk, maybe a swim, and then TV with Mr. Yahav.</p><p>The two met 16 years ago through the dating site Check Me Out. \"We are not big believers in falling in love,\" Mr. Harari said. \"It was more a rational choice.\"</p><p>\"We met each other and we thought, 'O.K., we're - O.K., let's move in with each other,'\" Mr. Yahav said.</p><p>Mr. Yahav became Mr. Harari's manager. During the period when English-language publishers were cool on the commercial viability of \"Sapiens\" - thinking it too serious for the average reader and not serious enough for the scholars - Mr. Yahav persisted, eventually landing the Jerusalem-based agent Deborah Harris. One day when Mr. Harari was away meditating, Mr. Yahav and Ms. Harris finally sold it at auction to Random House in London.</p><p>Today, they have a team of eight based in Tel Aviv working on Mr. Harari's projects. The director Ridley Scott and documentarian Asif Kapadia are adapting \"Sapiens\" into a TV show, and Mr. Harari is working on children's books to reach a broader audience.</p><p>Mr. Yahav used to meditate, but has recently stopped. \"It was too hectic,\" he said while folding laundry. \"I couldn't get this kind of huge success and a regular practice.\" Mr. Harari remains dedicated.</p><p>\"If it were only up to him, he would be a monk in a cave, writing things and never getting his hair cut,\" Mr. Yahav said, looking at his husband. \"Can I tell that story?\"</p><p>Mr. Harari said no.</p><p>\"On our first meeting,\" Mr. Yahav said, \"he had cut his hair by himself. And it was a very bad job.\"</p><p>The couple are vegan, and Mr. Harari is particularly sensitive to animals. He identified the sweatshirt he was wearing as one he got just before one of his dogs died. Mr. Yahav cut in to ask if he could tell another story; Mr. Harari seemed to know exactly what he meant, and said absolutely not.</p><p>\"In the middle of the night,\" Mr. Yahav said, \"when there is a mosquito, he will catch him and take him out.\"</p><p>Being gay, Mr. Harari said, has helped his work - it set him apart to study culture more clearly because it made him question the dominant stories of his own conservative Jewish society. \"If society got this thing wrong, who guarantees it didn't get everything else wrong as well?\" he said.</p><p>\"If I was a superhuman, my superpower would be detachment,\" Mr. Harari added. \"O.K., so maybe humankind is going to disappear - O.K., let's just observe.\"</p><p>For fun, the couple watches TV. It is their primary hobby and topic of conversation, and Mr. Yahav said it was the only thing from which Mr. Harari is not detached.</p><p>They just finished \"Dear White People,\" and they loved the Australian series \"Please Like Me.\" That night, they had plans to either meet Facebook executives at company headquarters or watch the YouTube show \"Cobra Kai.\"</p><p>Mr. Harari left Silicon Valley the next weekend. Soon, in December, he will enter an ashram outside Mumbai for another 60 days of silence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006203098</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR8-HX81-DYR7-C0MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so?</p><p>\u201cOne possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?\u201d a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s more worrying. Maybe I\u2019m missing something?\u201d</p><p>When Mr. Harari toured the Bay Area this fall to promote his latest book, the reception was incongruously joyful. Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, threw him a dinner party. The leaders of X, Alphabet\u2019s secretive research division, invited Mr. Harari over. Bill Gates reviewed the book (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/books/review/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century-yuval-noah-harari.html\">\u201cFascinating\u201d and \u201csuch a stimulating writer\u201d</url>) in The New York Times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in how Silicon Valley can be so infatuated with Yuval, which they are \u2014 it\u2019s insane he\u2019s so popular, they\u2019re all inviting him to campus \u2014 yet what Yuval is saying undermines the premise of the advertising- and engagement-based model of their products,\u201d said Tristan Harris, Google\u2019s former in-house design ethicist and the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>Part of the reason might be that Silicon Valley, at a certain level, is not optimistic on the future of democracy. The more of a mess Washington becomes, the more interested the tech world is in creating something else, and it might not look like elected representation. Rank-and-file coders have long been wary of regulation and<url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1007144/the-neo-fascist-philosophy-that-underpins-both-the-alt-right-and-silicon-valley-technophiles/\">curious about alternative forms of government</url>. A separatist streak runs through the place: Venture capitalists periodically call for California to      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/09/trump-win-california-secede-calexit-silicon-valley\">secede</url> or      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sixcalifornias.com/\">shatter</url>, or for      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.seasteading.org/\">the creation of corporate nation-states</url>. And this summer, Mark Zuckerberg, who has recommended Mr. Harari to his book club, acknowledged a fixation with the autocrat Caesar Augustus. \u201cBasically,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told The New Yorker, \u201cthrough a really harsh approach, he established 200 years of world peace.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Harari, thinking about all this, puts it this way: \u201cUtopia and dystopia depends on your values.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Harari, who has a Ph.D. from Oxford, is a 42-year-old Israeli philosopher and a history professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The story of his current fame begins in 2011, when he published a book of notable ambition: to survey the whole of human existence. \u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,\u201d first released in Hebrew, did not break new ground in terms of historical research. Nor did its premise \u2014 that humans are animals and our dominance is an accident \u2014 seem a likely commercial hit. But the casual tone and smooth way Mr. Harari tied together existing knowledge across fields made it a deeply pleasing read, even as the tome ended on the notion that the process of human evolution might be over. Translated into English in 2014, the book went on to sell <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ynharari.com/about/\">more than eight million copies</url> and made Mr. Harari a celebrity intellectual.</p><p>He followed up with \u201cHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,\u201d which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari\u2019s future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.</p><p>Now, he has written a book about the present and how it could lead to that future: \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century.\u201d It is meant to be read as a series of warnings. His recent TED Talk was called \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/yuval_noah_harari_why_fascism_is_so_tempting_and_how_your_data_could_power_it?language=en\">Why fascism is so tempting \u2014 and how your data could power it.</url>\u201d</p><p>His prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals\u2019 strange delight. \u201cIf you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,\u201d he told me, sounding weary, \u201csome of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Brave New World\u2019 as Aspirational Reading</p><p>Mr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X\u2019s offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look \u2014\u00a0like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get. </p><p>At the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.</p><p>Some workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail. Mr. Harari told them to think more starkly: If there isn\u2019t a major policy intervention, most humans probably will not adapt at all.</p><p>It made him sad, he told me, to see people build things that destroy their own societies, but he works every day to maintain an academic distance and remind himself that humans are just animals. \u201cPart of it is really coming from seeing humans as apes, that this is how they behave,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re chimpanzees. They\u2019re sapiens. This is what they do.\u201d</p><p>He was slouching a little. Socializing exhausts him. </p><p>As we boarded the black gull-wing Tesla Mr. Harari had rented for his visit, he brought up Aldous Huxley. Generations have been horrified by his novel \u201cBrave New World,\u201d which depicts a regime of emotion control and painless consumption. Readers who encounter the book today, Mr. Harari said, often think it sounds great. \u201cEverything is so nice, and in that way it is an intellectually disturbing book because you\u2019re really hard-pressed to explain what\u2019s wrong with it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you do get today a vision coming out of some people in Silicon Valley which goes in that direction.\u201d</p><p>An Alphabet media relations manager later reached out to Mr. Harari\u2019s team to tell him to tell me that the visit to X was not allowed to be part of this story. The request confused and then amused Mr. Harari. It is interesting, he said, that unlike politicians, tech companies do not need a free press, since they already control the means of message distribution. </p><p>He said he had resigned himself to tech executives\u2019 global reign, pointing out how much worse the politicians are. \u201cI\u2019ve met a number of these high-tech giants, and generally they\u2019re good people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not Attila the Hun. In the lottery of human leaders, you could get far worse.\u201d</p><p>Some of his tech fans, he thinks, come to him out of anxiety. \u201cSome may be very frightened of the impact of what they are doing,\u201d Mr. Harari said. </p><p>Still, their enthusiastic embrace of his work makes him uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rule of thumb in history that if you are so much coddled by the elites it must mean that you don\u2019t want to frighten them,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cThey can absorb you. You can become the intellectual entertainment.\u201d</p><p>Dinner, With a Side of Medically Engineered Immortality</p><p>C.E.O. testimonials to Mr. Harari\u2019s acumen are indeed not hard to come by. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.</p><p>And Mr. Hastings wrote: \u201cYuval\u2019s the anti-Silicon Valley persona \u2014 he doesn\u2019t carry a phone and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid. We see in him who we wish we were.\u201d He added, \u201cHis thinking on A.I. and biotech in his new book pushes our understanding of the dramas to unfold.\u201d</p><p>At the dinner Mr. Hastings co-hosted, academics and industry leaders debated the dangers of data collection, and to what degree longevity therapies will extend the human life span. (Mr. Harari has written that the ruling class will vastly outlive the useless.) \u201cThat evening was small, but could be magnified to symbolize his impact in the heart of Silicon Valley,\u201d said Dr. Fei-Fei Li, an artificial intelligence expert who pushed internally at Google to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/technology/google-project-maven-pentagon.html\">keep secret</url> the company\u2019s efforts to process military drone footage for the Pentagon. \u201cHis book has that ability to bring these people together at a table, and that is his contribution.\u201d</p><p>A few nights earlier, Mr. Harari spoke to a sold-out theater of 3,500 in San Francisco. One ticket-holder walking in, an older man, told me it was brave and honest for Mr. Harari to use the term \u201cuseless class.\u201d</p><p>The author was paired for discussion with the prolific intellectual Sam Harris, who strode onstage in a gray suit and well-starched white button-down. Mr. Harari was less at ease, in a loose suit that crumpled around him, his hands clasped in his lap as he sat deep in his chair. But as he spoke about meditation \u2014 Mr. Harari spends two hours each day and two months each year in silence \u2014 he became commanding. In a region where self-optimization is paramount and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/06/meditation-mindfulness-silicon-valley/\">meditation is a competitive sport</url>, Mr. Harari\u2019s devotion confers hero status.</p><p>He told the audience that free will is an illusion, and that human rights are just a story we tell ourselves. Political parties, he said, might not make sense anymore. He went on to argue that the liberal world order has relied on fictions like \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d and \u201cfollow your heart,\u201d and that these ideas no longer work in the age of artificial intelligence, when hearts can be manipulated at scale.</p><p>Everyone in Silicon Valley is focused on building the future, Mr. Harari continued, while most of the world\u2019s people are not even needed enough to be exploited. \u201cNow you increasingly feel that there are all these elites that just don\u2019t need me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much worse to be irrelevant than to be exploited.\u201d</p><p>The useless class he describes is uniquely vulnerable. \u201cIf a century ago you mounted a revolution against exploitation, you knew that when bad comes to worse, they can\u2019t shoot all of us because they need us,\u201d he said, citing army service and factory work.</p><p>Now it is becoming less clear why the ruling elite would not just kill the new useless class. \u201cYou\u2019re totally expendable,\u201d he told the audience.</p><p>This, Mr. Harari told me later, is why Silicon Valley is so excited about the concept of universal basic income, or stipends paid to people regardless of whether they work. The message is: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. But we are nice, so we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>On Sept. 14, he published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/14/yuval-noah-harari-the-new-threat-to-liberal-democracy\">an essay in The Guardian</url> assailing another old trope \u2014 that \u201cthe voter knows best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don\u2019t reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?\u201d he wrote. \u201cHow do you live when you realize \u2026 that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.\u201d</p><p>\u2018O.K., So Maybe Humankind Is Going to Disappear\u2019</p><p>Mr. Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, who is also his manager, rented a small house in Mountain View for their visit, and one morning I found them there making oatmeal. Mr. Harari observed that as his celebrity in Silicon Valley has risen, tech fans have focused on his lifestyle.</p><p>\u201cSilicon Valley was already kind of a hotbed for meditation and yoga and all these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the things that made me kind of more popular and palatable is that I also have this bedrock.\u201d He was wearing an old sweatshirt and denim track pants. His voice was quiet, but he gestured widely, waving his hands, hitting a jar of spatulas.</p><p>Mr. Harari grew up in Kiryat Ata, near Haifa, and his father worked in the arms industry. His mother, who worked in office administration, now volunteers for her son handling his mail; he gets about 1,000 messages a week. Mr. Yahav\u2019s mother is their accountant.</p><p>Most days, Mr. Harari doesn\u2019t use an alarm clock, and wakes up between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m., then meditates and has a cup of tea. He works until 4 or 5 p.m., then does another hour of meditation, followed by an hourlong walk, maybe a swim, and then TV with Mr. Yahav.</p><p>The two met 16 years ago through the dating site Check Me Out. \u201cWe are not big believers in falling in love,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cIt was more a rational choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met each other and we thought, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s move in with each other,\u2019\u201d Mr. Yahav said.</p><p>Mr. Yahav became Mr. Harari\u2019s manager. During the period when English-language publishers were cool on the commercial viability of \u201cSapiens\u201d \u2014 thinking it too serious for the average reader and not serious enough for the scholars \u2014 Mr. Yahav persisted, eventually landing the Jerusalem-based agent Deborah Harris. One day when Mr. Harari was away meditating, Mr. Yahav and Ms. Harris finally sold it at auction to Random House in London.</p><p>Today, they have a team of eight based in Tel Aviv working on Mr. Harari\u2019s projects. The director Ridley Scott and documentarian Asif Kapadia are<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bookmark/ridley-scott-asif-kapadia-adapt-fiction-bestseller-sapiens-1126224\">adapting \u201cSapiens\u201d into a TV show</url>, and Mr. Harari is working on children\u2019s books to reach a broader audience.</p><p>Mr. Yahav used to meditate, but has recently stopped. \u201cIt was too hectic,\u201d he said while folding laundry. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get this kind of huge success and a regular practice.\u201d Mr. Harari remains dedicated.</p><p>\u201cIf it were only up to him, he would be a monk in a cave, writing things and never getting his hair cut,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, looking at his husband. \u201cCan I tell that story?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Harari said no.</p><p>\u201cOn our first meeting,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201che had cut his hair by himself. And it was a very bad job.\u201d</p><p>The couple are vegan, and Mr. Harari is particularly sensitive to animals. He identified the sweatshirt he was wearing as one he got just before one of his dogs died. Mr. Yahav cut in to ask if he could tell another story; Mr. Harari seemed to know exactly what he meant, and said absolutely not.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201cwhen there is a mosquito, he will catch him and take him out.\u201d</p><p>Being gay, Mr. Harari said, has helped his work \u2014 it set him apart to study culture more clearly because it made him question the dominant stories of his own conservative Jewish society. \u201cIf society got this thing wrong, who guarantees it didn\u2019t get everything else wrong as well?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf I was a superhuman, my superpower would be detachment,\u201d Mr. Harari added. \u201cO.K., so maybe humankind is going to disappear \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s just observe.\u201d</p><p>For fun, the couple watches TV. It is their primary hobby and topic of conversation, and Mr. Yahav said it was the only thing from which Mr. Harari is not detached.</p><p>They just finished \u201cDear White People,\u201d and they loved the Australian series \u201cPlease Like Me.\u201d That night, they had plans to either meet Facebook executives at company headquarters or watch the YouTube show \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Harari left Silicon Valley the next weekend. Soon, in December, he will enter an ashram outside Mumbai for another 60 days of silence.</p><p>PHOTO: Yuval Noah Harari in Beverly Hills in September.

On the eve of a momentous and highly charged election, it is imperative that this committee of jurisdiction and the American people receive a full accounting from the heads of these companies about their content-moderation practices. </p><p>On the other side will be Senate Democrats, who at the last minute abandoned their objection that the subpoenas were a nakedly political ploy after Republicans agreed to add data privacy and big tech s impact on the news industry to the agenda. Flipping the GOP s argument on its head, Democrats are preparing to threaten the CEOs with action on Section 230 unless they remove disinformation, calls to violence, and some other types of speech related to the upcoming election.</p><p> I support moving forward with the hearing,  Sen. Gary Peters said,  because we have seen an explosion of disinformation about the integrity of our election, especially when it comes to voting by mail. This disinformation is coming from both domestic and foreign actors, and it could undermine the faith in our elections as well as hurt voter participation. </p><p> These companies need to speak to how and when they label and remove harmful disinformation, and explain why; all too often, they do not,  Peters said.  We cannot repeat 2016. </p><p>Following a two-year period in which Section 230 went from an obscure federal statute to the center of the tech-policy world, it now seems clear that the provision which prevents tech platforms from facing lawsuits caused by user-posted content is also a crucial election issue. But not in the way you might think.</p><p>Kyle Kondik, an election and campaigns expert at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said he s seen little evidence that candidates from either party are running on Section 230 reform. Neither the specific provision, nor the moderation policies of the platforms more generally, have appeared in any TV advertisements or debates that he s viewed this cycle.</p><p>But, Kondik added, the escalating attacks on big tech s moderation policies particularly from the right probably aren t meant to sway voters. Instead, they re meant to strike fear in the hearts of the platforms  leadership.</p><p> I think it s basically just a new iteration of working the refs, the way that politicians often do with the media,  said Kondik.</p><p>Even before Thursday s subpoena vote, Republicans in both chambers had dramatically escalated their rhetoric against Silicon Valley s alleged anti-conservative bias. Much of that appears to have been driven by President Trump himself, who just last week urged his Justice Department and state attorneys general to crack down on the platforms for removing conservative content. On Thursday, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Politico</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/10/01/republicans-launch-anti-tech-blitz-424254?__twitter_impression=true\"> reported </url> that the White House recently pressed Wicker and other Senate Republicans to hold hearings with big tech executives ahead of the election. </p><p>A Wicker spokesperson told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> that they  hope to hold the [subpoena] hearing prior to the election. </p><p>Now Democrats are getting in on the game. This week, the Biden campaign<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1310968049953107970\"> sent </url> a letter to Facebook demanding the company remove content promoting disinformation about the election and voter fraud, including some false posts created by President Trump and his family.

Brian Schatz and two powerful House Democrats, in which the lawmakers accused the company of  propelling right-wing voices, including those peddling misinformation.  They suggested that the liability protections afforded to Facebook under Section 230 are at risk if they don t change course.</p><p>On Thursday, Schatz said he was fearful the upcoming Senate hearing will be  an attempt to work the refs five weeks out from the election.  But Schatz ultimately didn t object to the subpoena, and even hinted that he plans to pressure big tech from the other side.</p><p> These social-media platforms should not publicize election-related misinformation regardless of whether [Sens.] Ted Cruz or Rick Scott, or anyone else in the Republican universe, considers that to be  biased,   Schatz said.  Because there are some principles that go beyond our partisan objectives. </p><p>Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, said it s clear that both Republicans and Democrats are  trying to affect the types of on-the-margin speech that is permitted on social media in the run-up to the election. </p><p> It s both sides trying to game the outcome,  Olsen said.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the platforms will be moved to change their moderation policies by politicians putting their thumbs on the scale.</p><p> It's common wisdom that the very threat of regulation will push companies to self-regulate, that is, to moderate content in a way they think will get regulators off their backs,  Riana Pfefferkorn, the associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said in an email.  There may be some truth to that, but in this particular area, I am not sure that it is accurate to lump all platforms together.  </p><p>Pfefferkorn contrasted Facebook s ongoing  pro-Republican bias with respect to content moderation and disinformation takedowns  with platforms like Twitter, which has at times policed Trump s account for spreading disinformation.</p><p>But the platforms  divergent responses to political pressure may simply indicate their hopeless situation. Olsen suggested Republicans and Democrats are each overstating the potential impact of social media on the election. But as long as they continue to do so, it ll be impossible for the tech platforms to please them both.</p><p> I think both sides are exaggerating what s going on, and the tech companies are caught in the middle,  Olsen said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-710277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YY-V021-JBNW-3016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Four of the nation's most powerful CEOs are beaming into a Capitol Hil...</p><p>Lawmakers investigating a litany of antitrust complaints confront the chief executives of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon at a time of maximum legal peril for the big tech companies.    Four of the nation's most powerful CEOs are beaming into a Capitol Hill hearing at noon Wednesday to face one major question: Are their companies too big and powerful for America's good?    The virtual testimony marks the first joint congressional appearance by Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet. It comes at a time of rising legal jeopardy for the major tech companies, who are the subject of antitrust and consumer-protection probes in Washington, multiple U.S. states and Europe \u2014 but also amid questions about whether Congress can provide a counterweight to the wealth and power of Silicon Valley.      More than a year of investigation by the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee has yielded a host of documents about a litany of criticisms, any of which could come up during Wednesday's hours of questioning. Those include Google's and Facebook's dominance over the online ad market, Apple's efforts to compete with rivals on its own App Store, and questions about whether Amazon misled Congress about how it uses data it compiles from its third-party sellers.     Lawmakers will no doubt raise other issues as well. Republicans in particular have pushed for answers on what they call a pattern of anti-conservative bias on social media, a charge Democrats dismiss as a baseless distraction. The executives, meanwhile, are touting their companies as examples of American-style innovation and openness, and a bulwark against Chinese-owned competitors like TikTok.    Check back for live video and updates from today's hearing.   Required reading:   \u2014 The Tech CEOs' opening statements  \u2014 How to watch the CEOs' collision with Congress  \u2014 Congress has a lot to prove  \u2014 Republicans tear into panel's Democrats on eve of major tech hearing  \u2014 Why Amazon may have the most to lose  \u2014 Zuckerberg: Facebook has \u2018more to do\u2019 on fighting disinformation  \u2014 Bezos: The world needs giant companies too   10:13 A.M.  TikTok CEO slams Zuckerberg\u2019s China comments just before hearing   TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer slammed Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday ahead of Wednesday\u2019s high-stakes congressional hearing, where the tech mogul is expected to picture Chinese tech corporations as a threat.    \u201cLet\u2019s focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor \u2014 namely Facebook \u2014 disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.,\u201d Mayer said in a statement.    Zuckerberg depicted Facebook in his prepared statement for the hearing as a \u201cproudly American company.\u201d    U.S. officials have recently floated a ban on TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance. If the company were to leave the U.S. market, American advertisers would be left with less choice, Mayer argued.    The newly appointed CEO, who comes from Disney, also said tech companies should disclose their algorithms, moderation policies and data flows to regulators. \u201cWe will not wait for regulation to come, but instead TikTok has taken the first step by launching a Transparency and Accountability Center for moderation and data practices,\u201d he explained.    \u201cTikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,\u201d Mayer said.  \u2014 Laura Kayali   How to watch the tech CEOs' collision with Congress   Two global power centers are set to clash Wednesday as the CEOs of tech giants Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook testify before House lawmakers on allegations their companies are harming consumers by unfairly stifling the competition.    The hearing marks the first time the four tech moguls \u2014 whose companies are roughly worth a combined $5 trillion \u2014 have jointly testified before Congress, and it\u2019s the first congressional outing ever for Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person. The session also arrives as scrutiny of the behemoths is surging across the globe, including an expected Justice Department antitrust case against Google and the recent launch of two European probes of potential anticompetitive behavior by Apple.    But whether Wednesday\u2019s showdown lives up to its historic billing may depend on a host of factors: The lawmakers could veer far from the antitrust script, into Democrats\u2019 concerns about online hate speech or GOP accusations of anti-conservative bias. Some Republicans have already accused Democrats of harboring \u201cpreconceived conclusions\u201d in favor of breaking up the tech giants, adding to the dangers of a partisan food fight breaking out.    Even the format of the questioning \u2014 four elite CEOs, all appearing by videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 could make it harder for the members to land a glove on the companies\u2019 varied issues, ranging from Google's and Facebook\u2019s command of digital ad revenue to Apple's control of its App Store and questions about whether Amazon misled Congress.    Here\u2019s what to expect as Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai testify before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee \u2014 and the potential surprises that may await:    For Bezos: Did Amazon lie to Congress last year?    House lawmakers are expected to grill Bezos about whether a company lawyer misled the Judiciary Committee last summer by testifying that Amazon doesn\u2019t use the data it collects from third-party vendors to launch competing products on its platform.    The Wall Street Journal subsequently reported that Amazon employees did in fact use the sellers\u2019 data to inform the company\u2019s own products. The revelation prompted Judiciary leaders to raise the specter of referring Amazon to prosecutors for perjury charges, while Amazon disputed the accuracy of the Journal's account and said it did not offer \"intentionally misleading\" testimony. Amazon also promised to conduct an internal investigation but hasn\u2019t offered any public updates on its progress.    Now that Bezos is appearing before them, some lawmakers  say they plan to push him to account for the discrepancy.    \u201cI do have concerns about testimony that was given to me under oath that I will be following up on from the last hearing,\u201d said subcommittee member Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who questioned Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton about the practice at a hearing last July.    Meanwhile, the Journal last week raised similar questions about Amazon\u2019s treatment of tech startups that had sought investments from the company\u2019s venture capital fund.    For Zuckerberg: Facebook's thirst for growth    Facebook's past acquisitions of former rivals WhatsApp and Instagram have drawn significant attention on Capitol Hill in recent years. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) told POLITICO last year that \"there ought to have been more review\" of the deals, which had won approval from regulators during the Obama administration. Others, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have called for regulators to break up Facebook and have singled out those mergers as targets for rolling back.    The committee has also demanded answers from Facebook on whether it devotes resources to identifying and tracking promising startups. Lawmakers have expressed concern that Facebook and the other giants are uniquely positioned to duplicate, acquire or otherwise drive out up-and-coming rivals.    The company's massive trove of user data is also set to draw scrutiny. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), vice chair of the antitrust subcommittee, said he hopes to press the company about whether the massive amounts of personal information it collects from more than 2 billion users makes it too difficult for competitors to keep up.    \"There's a real fear that no other competitor could ever successfully launch a social media platform because it could never match Facebook's troves of data, which, given their record, it's a serious threat to users,\" he told POLITICO.    For Pichai: Google's dominance of digital ads and search    Google is the world\u2019s No. 1 player in the $162.3 billion market for online display ads, in part because it runs the most dominant search engine. Now it\u2019s facing rising scrutiny from state and federal regulators on both issues, which could become the subject of the DOJ\u2019s expected antitrust suit.    Critics of the company have long accused it of favoring its own services in search, to the detriment of its competitors and consumers looking for maps, videos or other services that Google also provides. Cicilline has separately voiced concern that the company's ability to hoover up online ad revenue has harmed smaller businesses, including news outlets. (Google and Facebook together account for a majority of the online ad revenue in the U.S.)    The committee has also accused the company of being less than forthright in its past testimony, including on questions such as what percentage of searches on the company's engine lead to website referrals not on Google.    Google has separately been a frequent target of Republican allegations of anti-conservative bias on its video sharing platform YouTube, a topic that is expected to come up again at Monday's hearing. Google and other major tech platforms deny those charges. Democrats, meanwhile, have taken issue with the company's handling of hate speech and misinformation on YouTube.    For Cook: Apple\u2019s App Store under the microscope    Apple, which to date hasn't drawn the same level of congressional scrutiny as the other companies testifying, is now facing a fresh investigation in Europe over whether its popular App Store violates the EU\u2019s competition rules. Competitors, publishers and app-makers have taken issue with Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of app sales and subscriptions in the App Store.    State and federal regulators in the U.S. have also begun taking initial steps toward an antitrust investigation into those practices, POLITICO reported last month .    And key lawmakers have torn into Apple for its handling of the App Store.    \u201cBecause of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents \u2014 highway robbery, basically \u2014 bullying people to pay 30 percent or denying access to their market,\u201d Cicilline told The Verge in June . \u201cIt\u2019s crushing small developers who simply can\u2019t survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d    For the House members: Can they avoid a free-for-all?    Democratic lawmakers, committee aides and advocacy groups say they expect the hearing to stay on track more than other past high-profile hearings with big tech CEOs  have done.    When Zuckerberg testified before Congress for the first time in 2018 at the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, for example, he fielded questions on everything from misinformation to competition, hate speech, privacy and allegations of anti-conservative bias on social media .    This time, Wednesday\u2019s hearing is not a one-off event \u2014 it\u2019s the subcommittee\u2019s sixth hearing as part of its more-than-yearlong investigation into Silicon Valley\u2019s antitrust problems. That means lawmakers have had an unusual amount of preparation, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that advocates against market concentration.    \u201cThe subcommittee members have been deeply involved in this investigation and many of them have a fine-grained understanding of the business models of these corporations,\u201d said Mitchell, a prominent big tech critic who testified before the committee last year. \u201cIt prevents things from veering off into all kinds of different directions.\u201d    But others expect that the lawmakers will once again wander off topic.    \u201cThe discussion will go well beyond antitrust,\u201d said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of tech trade group NetChoice, which counts Facebook, Google and Amazon as members. \u201cIt will go into issues of election interference, or conservative bias, or any of the other issues de jour on which we like to saddle tech,\u201d he said.    Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), one of the lawmakers who will be questioning the CEOs, told POLITICO he's expecting \"a free for all\" in question topics.    What about partisan squabbles?    The Democratic-led panel's investigation into tech and antitrust has mainly boasted bipartisan buy-in from the get-go , as Republican lawmakers have acknowledged.    \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with the bipartisan and cooperative nature of the process that we are going through,\" Buck said during an interview last week.    But partisan divides have erupted too. In February, for example, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee accused Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) of harboring \u201cpre-conceived conclusions that America\u2019s large tech companies are inherently bad,\u201d and added: \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders should not punish tech companies simply because those companies have succeeded.\"    And more recent disputes have emerged between Democrats and Republicans on how to handle Wednesday\u2019s hearing.    Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who took over as the top Republican on House Judiciary well into the committee\u2019s investigation , has criticized Democrats for not opening the hearing up to the full committee, which he said would allow questions on a wider range of members\u2019 tech concerns. Jordan has also raised the possibility that Republicans will delve into alleged political bias \u2014 even demanding that the hearing include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whose company has tangled with President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign over fact-checking but hasn\u2019t posed any major antitrust concerns.    The virtual format could shape the outcome    All four tech CEOs will testify together through an online videoconference, while Judiciary lawmakers will attend both virtually and in-person as part of a \u201chybrid\u201d format, senior Judiciary aides told reporters on Thursday.    Groups critical of the tech giants had pushed for the subcommittee to make the four CEOs testify individually instead of as a single group, expressing concern that Wednesday\u2019s format will make it harder to lawmakers to ask detailed questions and make it easier for the executives to dodge.    Having the CEOs testify jointly instead of on separate panels could cut down on the session\u2019s length. But even so, if past big tech hearings are any indication, the CEOs should be ready for a protracted siege.    The hearing also marks one of the highest profile virtual sessions of the coronavirus era, which has forced Congress to shift much of its regular business online. The virtual hearing is likely to test the limits of its format, with the possibility of technical snafus, cross talk, unmuted microphones and other glitches that could dilute the substance.  \u2014 Cristiano Lima</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42713646027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-1151-F07F-84KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2528\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

They \"feel free to crush anyone on their platform that's offering  very good competition against them. This has happened again and again,\" Eleanor Fox, a law professor at New York University who specializes  in antitrust and competition policy, told CBS News this week , summarizing the case against  Big Tech. \"They get huge amounts of data from the businesses on the  platform, they take more data than they need to conduct business, and  they use that to find out what is the new best thing and then they  appropriate that thing. They use it to suppress innovative competition  of the businesses using the platform.\"   Amazon's Bezos \u2014 the world's richest person and head of an ecommerce empire as well as ventures in cloud computing, personal \"smart\" tech, groceries and beyond \u2014 initially declined to testify before the House panel unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used sensitive, confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.   Lawmakers from both political parties have suggested Amazon's earlier statements could be misleading and might even constitute perjury. But Bezos has said, \"We don't use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\" Amazon has pushed back against the Journal's allegations, but has started an internal investigation.   Facebook's Zuckerberg is more experienced on Capitol Hill. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee to discuss hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook's widely criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized big tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.   Following George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook's handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after the company's refusal to take action on inflammatory posts by Mr. Trump that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it raises the imminent risk of specific harms or damage.   Pichai faced his own congressional interrogation in 2018 over online privacy and data protection, the danger of digital monopolies, alleged bias against conservative viewpoints and censorship by China. The Goolgle chief acknowledged some points, but avoided the yes or no answers that lawmakers demanded. EU regulators already have concluded that Alphabet-owned Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the ecommerce market and fined Google a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42716772140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-45X1-JCSC-J0T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CBS News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

David Cicilline D-Rhode Island, who characterized all four companies as guilty of \"killing the small business, manufacturing and the overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy.\"</p><p>\"Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects,\" Cicilline said. \"They discourage entrepreneurship, hike costs and degrade quality.</p><p>\"Simply put, they have too much power.\"</p><p>Lawmakers were armed with a trove of information gathered in an investigation that's been in progress for over a year and, according to committee chairman Cicilline, included millions of pages of documents, hundreds of hours of interviews and a slew of earlier hearings and roundtable discussions.</p><p>Witnesses included Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>Cicilline said the importance of the investigation went beyond just establishing whether the companies had been engaging in anti-competitive practices.</p><p>\"Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies,\" Cicilline said. \"Concentrated markets and concentrated politics are incompatible with Democratic ideals.\"</p><p>The 15 members of the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law were each given five-minute windows in multiple rounds of questioning, mostly focused on competitive practices.</p><p>All four executives tried to deliver interstitial messages about the highly competitive realms in which they operate, but the time-limited congressional members mostly stomped on those attempts as they worked to get responses to specific incidents.</p><p>Bezos, making his first appearance before federal lawmakers, was pummeled repeatedly for how Amazon uses, and possibly misuses, data on third-party resellers, a segment of the company's online retail business that accounts for some 60% of sales.</p><p>Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, countered Bezos' description of its third-party sellers as \"partners and customers,\" citing evidence gathered by the committee that told a \"completely different story\" by resellers who used words like \"bullying, fear and panic\" to describe their relationships with the company.</p><p>And, when the Amazon chief was braced with a question about an April Wall Street Journal report that purported to have uncovered direct evidence that Amazon used data on a particular third-party reseller to develop a competing product - a practice the company has repeatedly denied - Bezos stated that \"I can't guarantee you that this policy has never been violated\" and the matter was \"under investigation.\"</p><p>So too, Zuckerberg was called on to defend an oft repeated criticism that Facebook has unfairly wielded its power to simply acquire any emerging social media startups that have an inkling of usurping the market share of the world's largest social media site.</p><p>Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, said documents gathered in the investigation reflected that Facebook saw the upstart photo sharing service Instagram as a powerful threat that could siphon business away, so the company bought it.</p><p>\"And that's exactly what antitrust law was made to prevent,\" Nadler said.</p><p>Zuckerberg also fielded similar questions about another acquisition, instant messaging service WhatsApp, and, in a tale of the one that got away, similar internal communications about Snapchat, which successfully avoided becoming part of Facebook's portfolio.</p><p>The manner in which Google combines its search and online advertising dominance was parsed in a few different lines of questioning, including whether the company skews search query results to favor sites it controls or from which it derives profit. According to eMarketer, Google led all companies in digital advertising revenues in 2019, pulling in over $100 billion, with Facebook a distant second at just over $67 billion.</p><p>Pichai said the company's commercial concerns do not impact the ranking of search results.</p><p>The Google executive also countered issues raised about how his company put user data to work, acknowledging the company did leverage users' browsing information to match and place ads, but said it achieves a balance by providing tools for consumers to control that process.</p><p>\"We, today, make it very easy for users to be in control of their data,\" Pichai said, noting that users can easily \"turn ad personalization on or off.\"</p><p>Cook, perhaps, had the easiest response path with lawmakers mostly focused on how Apple curates and controls its App Store, a marketplace that now includes some 1.7 million applications developed for the iPhone. Cook said Apple only makes money on about 16% of the apps and the rest are distributed for free with proceeds going entirely to developers.</p><p>Rep. Henry C. Johnson, D-Georgia, noted Apple wields \"immense power over small businesses to prosper and grow\" and asked Cook about evidence that showed the rules governing acceptance into the App Store were \"arbitrarily enforced\" and \"subject to change whenever Apple sees fit.\"</p><p>Cook said the managers of the App Store \"treat every developer the same\" and the process runs by a set of \"open and transparent rules.\"</p><p>\"We do look at every app before it goes on,\" Cook said. \"But, those rules apply evenly to everyone.\"</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, paired up in focusing many of their questions on perceived biases against conservative voices and commentary on big tech platforms.</p><p>Jordan cited a list of instances he said represented the censoring of conservative commentary on social media sites and also squared off with Pichai, claiming Google was complicit in working against the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 and asking if Google was planning on tweaking its platform to help the 2020 presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>\"We engage with campaigns according to the law,\" Pichai said. \"We won't do any work to politically tilt things one way or another.\"</p><p>What potential legislative moves the antitrust subcommittee may be considering remains to be seen, but Cicilline may have offered a clue in his powerful closing statement.</p><p>\"Today we had the opportunity to hear from the decision-makers of four of the most powerful companies in the world,\" Cicilline said. \"This hearing has made one fact clear to me - these companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.</p><p>\"We need to ensure the antitrust laws first written more than a century ago work in the digital age. When these laws were written the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie. Their control of the marketplace allowed them to do whatever it took to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. The names have changed but the story is the same.\"</p><p>University of Utah S.J. Quinney School of Law professor and antitrust specialist Jorge Contreras said he expects there will be some repercussions for at least some of the big tech companies, noting the numerous ongoing investigations, but voiced skepticism about whether meaningful legislative changes would be forthcoming.</p><p>\"Some of these investigations will lead to some liabilities against some of these companies,\" Contreras said. \"And the companies will pay whatever the fines are and probably reform whatever the behavior was that they got slapped on the wrist for.</p><p>\"But structural changes to statute? These are the last big industries that the U.S. has, the companies that have replaced steel and oil and the railroads. Is Congress going to kill this last, big American industry? I doubt it.\"</p><p>email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-51882963</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-CG21-DY6J-M1XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1436\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.</p><p>The CEOs testified remotely to lawmakers, most of whom sat, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, R.I. and Pewaukee, Wisc., in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies censor conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p>Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.</p><p>Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, though he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.</p><p>Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \"these giants stand to profit\" and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.</p><p>The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs.

Specifically, the recently reported[1] letter states that consumers should have rights over their data and that companies need a consistent, comprehensive set of data privacy laws to follow. Those same laws should consistently hold companies accountable when they are breached. </p><p>A framework[2] \u2014 laid out in a PDF and released to Amazon's Web Services cloud alongside the letter \u2014 defines personal data as any identifiable or identifying dat held by organizations. The definition would exclude any de-identified data or data in the public domain. That's basically data shared publicly or publicly provided by third parties. There are some key exceptions to the latter part too. In some cases, public domain data is already still considered to be personal data. For instance, the companies' definition likely includes situations where data is shared without permission or is considered 'sensitive'. Regardless of the definition, the framework lays down regulatory guidelines that aren't entirely unlike to those already in place in the EU. Those are the same GDPR laws Google found itself at odds with and paid historic fines for breaching[3] back in January. Like Europe's laws, the group hopes to achieve a kind of global interoperability, where the regulations apply both abroad and at home. The CEOs similarly hope to foster regulations that apply to all 50 U.S. states and any outlying territories. The regulatory guideline also points to the discussions needed to ensure that the rules wouldn't stifle competition and innovation. Instead, the signatories say they should promote accountability through suitable obligations. Consequences would need to be in place for breaches in the collection, sharing, and use of personal consumer data.Which tech execs are signing on for the creation of new data protection laws?Nearly a tenth of those companies that have signed have ties to or are technology[4] businesses. That includes some of the biggest names in the U.S. Executives for Qualcomm, Comcast, IBM, Amazon, Dell, and AT#38;T. Less well-known company CEOs have signed off in favor of protections for consumer data and privacy. Bigger names among those include the U.S. data and telecoms equipment provider Motorola Solutions and cloud-based software company Salesforce.com, Inc.Samsung subsidiary and audio expertise company Harman International has signed too. Rounding out the big-tech list, Boston-based global wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company American Tower Corporation and automation technology conglomerate Rockwell Automation, Inc. have each signed on as well.Noteworthy ommissions from the letter's signatoriesAmong the signatures included in the letter, there are still at least a few companies that appear conspicuously absent. It isn't immediately clear whether Google, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, and others were deliberately left out of the roundtable. But none of those companies or their subsidiaries are included. Now, each of those companies' CEOs has called for wider data protection regulations and laws in the past. Google, for example, put forward its own framework for protecting privacy at the beginning of this year. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg called for regulations to be put in place last year while testifying before Congress about privacy. Both companies have gone on to make some considerable privacy mistakes in the interim. Conversely, a couple of names on the list including Amazon and AT...ould arguably be noted as conspicuously suspicious. Amazon, in particular, has been the subject of numerous reports involving AI and effectively spying on the populous for authorities. The global shipping and tech leader has been the subject of data collection scares associated with its Amazon Alexa products. Among other things, the company has been caught out giving collected recordings to human reviewers in a bid to better the AI. Regardless, the call to action nearly mirrors proposals and laws in Europe that protect user data. It also comes at a time when regulation is being called for on both sides of the aisle and when state authorities[5] are taking notice of possible rights violations. So the letter from these CEOs should add weight to the discussion about policies regarding protections for consumer data.

Training. Affordable housing. Occupational licensing reform. Streamlining of regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A trio of young tech CEOS who kicked off the first general session of NCSL's 44th Legislative Summit all agreed that those rather low-tech concepts were critical to nurturing entrepreneurs in the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Automation, AI and various other technologies are changing the way we live,\" said Brynne Kennedy, CEO of Topia, which describes itself as a cloud-based platform for global mobility</p><p>She noted that by one estimate 42 percent of current jobs will be automated by 2030 and challenged lawmakers in the audience on \"what can you do as policymakers to prepare for this future.\"</p><p>Marco Zappacosta, CEO of Thumbtack, an online service that matches customers with local professionals, said it's important to remember that most people are not going to become tech entrepreneurs or work in tech in any capacity.</p><p>\"I think it's a travesty that entrepreneurship has been tagged as the Silicon Valley model. Plumbers, cake makers ... are all entrepreneurs,\" he said. \"They set out by themselves to create a better future for themselves and their families. We need to broaden our focus beyond big tech companies.\"</p><p>Asked a specific area where policymakers could make a big difference for people trying to make a business work, Zappacosta pointed out that reforms to \"occupational licensing and the burden it imposes on entrepreneurs\" is one of the few things that President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama and others on the right and left can agree on.</p><p>Tim Chen, CEO of Nerdwallet, a personal finance website that helps people make and manage financial decisions, said nuts and bolts issues like sky-high housing costs, the expense of higher education and whipsawing policy decisions are all serious impediments to running a successful business.</p><p>Given the \"the unsustainability of housing the Bay Area it does not seem feasible to continue to expand there in the next 10 years,\" he said.</p><p>And higher education \"is getting so expensive that even the increased earning ability is not offset by the cost of a college education.\"</p><p>Amplifying that point, Zappacosta said the real issue is not so much pushing people into STEM professions, but how to create opportunities for the two-thirds of people who do not go to college. \"We've missed the chance to promote ... vocational jobs. They are well-paid and they are not going away.\"</p><p>So what was their advice for policymakers? Their suggestions included:</p><p>Immigration reform so there is access to a global talent pool</p><p>Making health insurance and other benefits traditionally tied to employment more portable.</p><p>Changing regulation and tax policy to make it easier for people to move across states and even countries as they do their jobs.</p><p>Consistency in how laws are applied across the states.</p><p>Despite the obstacles entrepreneurs may face, all three of these young people were bullish on the opportunity in the U.S.</p><p>Kennedy, who spent a dozen years in school and working overseas, said returning the U.S. was an eye-opener.</p><p>\"I founded the company in London and then moved ack to the U.S. One incredible thing about the U.S. is access to capital and big ideas.\"</p><p>In Europe, she said, everyone told me how hard it would be to make her company successful. When she returned home, everyone encouraged her to make the next leap in her business.</p><p>\"This country embraces the entrepreneurial spirit. It is unique to America.\"</p><p>Ed Smith is the director of content for NCSL.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122260741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXK-T7T1-JCBF-S2H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 30, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.</p><p> The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.</p><p> Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p> Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products.</p><p> Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p> \"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep.

Critics, customers and regulators globally will be watching.</p><p>\"This is a deposition for the whole world,\" said William Kovacic, a former Federal Trade Commission member and now a law professor at George Washington University.</p><p>Asking the questions will be the 15 members of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, lawmakers from both political parties, who have spent the past year looking into antitrust and competition concerns with each firm.</p><p>The report on their probe is expected at the end of the summer, but the lawmakers' questions will likely reveal what they have learned and some of their thinking about what they may do next, legal experts say.</p><p>A first for Amazon's Bezos</p><p>The hearing, in many ways, is unprecedented. Never before have these CEOs appeared together in front of a congressional hearing, albeit over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>It will be the first time Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon and the richest person in the world, will testify before Congress.</p><p>\"This is an important accountability exercise,\" Kovacic said. \"It does demonstrate that the branches of government responsible for high-level policymaking have the capacity to hold these powerful executives and their extraordinary companies to account. So that's important. To remind them who does set larger policy.\"</p><p>Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the hearing is an opportunity for the tech leaders to show they understand concerns about the power they have over people's lives.</p><p>\"That's what I'm hoping to hear, these CEOs saying, 'We hear you, we hear the concerns that are being expressed, and here is the way we come to the table to be part of the solution,'\" Crane said.</p><p>Changed tone in Washington</p><p>The hearing also shines a spotlight on U.S. regulators and lawmakers, whose job it is to set policies and enforce laws that stop firms from using their market dominance to kill competition. They have been under increasing criticism from some antitrust experts that the government's oversight of these giants has been weak, especially compared to stronger enforcement in Europe.</p><p>In recent years, the tone has changed in Washington from one of caution about taking on Big Tech to one of resolve that something has to be done, Kovacic said.</p><p>\"U.S. agencies are also weary of watching the Europeans do everything and realizing that policy in a variety of areas -- privacy, competition -- is being set in Europe. And if the U.S. doesn't play, it will continue to be set in Europe,\" he said.</p><p>Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, a competition think tank, said she will watch the hearing for signs that lawmakers want to pursue \"robust enforcement.\"</p><p>On her anti-monopoly wish list is \"structural breakups\" of the tech giants and blocking companies from buying smaller companies seen as threats.</p><p>\"These problems are really deep and really widespread, and we need to really use the whole anti-monopoly tool kit to address them,\" said Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general for antitrust enforcement in the New York attorney general's office.</p><p>Lawmakers' challenge</p><p>Lawmakers can't charge the tech companies with antitrust violations or attempt to break them into smaller entities.</p><p>But what they can do is change the laws and put pressure on regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice to do more to enforce existing regulations.</p><p>The Justice Department is reportedly likely to bring antitrust lawsuits against Google. State regulators may join the Justice Department or pursue their own cases, according to reports (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-state-attorneys-general-likely-to-bring-antitrust-lawsuits-against-google-11589573622\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-state-attorneys-general-likely-to-bring-antitrust-lawsuits-against-google-11589573622</url>).</p><p>Part of the challenge lawmakers face at the hearing will be that while Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon are the Who's Who of internet firms, in fact their businesses are not really the same.</p><p>Still, the policies set by lawmakers in the months and years ahead will likely affect Big Tech for years to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VOAMNS-VAV7290B5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-R0T1-JCCP-02HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468347</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Voice of America News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Together, thecompanies'combined annual sales are roughly the same as the gross domestic product of Saudi Arabia, as Axios notes[1].Now the CEOs of four top U.S. technology companies-- Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google - are set to answer questionsWednesdayin front of the House Judiciarysubcommittee[2] onantitrustabout how they wield their considerable market power.Deposition for the worldThe hearing comes as federal and state regulators are looking into whether the tech giants, through their dominance in some markets,stifle competition. The joint appearance of Tim Cookof Apple, Mark Zuckerbergof Facebook, Sundar Pichaiof Googleand Jeff Bezosof Amazonis a sign of how high the stakes are for the future of their businesses, legal observers say. </p><p>Critics, customers and regulators globally will be watching. 'This is a deposition for the whole world,' said William Kovacic, a former Federal Trade Commission member and now a law professor at George Washington University. Asking the questions will be the 15 members of the House Judiciaryantitrust subcommittee, lawmakersfromboth political parties, who have spent the past year looking into antitrust and competition concerns with each firm. The reporton their probeis expected at the end of the summer,butthe lawmakers' questions will likely reveal what they have learned and some of their thinking about what they may do next,legal expertssay. A first for Amazon's BezosThe hearing, in many ways, is unprecedented.Never beforehave these CEOs appeared together in front of a congressional hearing, albeit over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will be the first time Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon and the richest person in the world, will testify before Congress. 'Thisis an important accountability exercise,' Kovacicsaid. 'It does demonstrate that the branches of government responsible for high-level policymaking have the capacity to hold these powerful executives and their extraordinary companies to account. So that's important. To remind them who does set larger policy.' Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the hearing is an opportunity for the tech leaders to show they understand concerns about the power they have over people's lives. 'That's what I'm hoping to hear, these CEOs saying, 'We hear you, we hear the concerns that are being expressed, and here is the way we come to the table to be part of the solution,'' Crane said. Changedtonein Washington The hearing also shines a spotlight on U.S. regulators and lawmakers, whose job it is to set policies and enforce laws that stop firms from using their market dominance to kill competition. They have been under increasing criticism from some antitrust experts that the government's oversight of these giants has been weak, especially compared to stronger enforcement in Europe. In recent years, the tone has changed in Washington from one of caution about taking on Big Tech to one of resolve that somethinghas tobe done, Kovacicsaid. 'U.S.agencies are also weary of watching the Europeans do everything and realizing that policy in a variety of areas--privacy, competition --is being set in Europe. And if the U.S. doesn't play, it will continue to be set in Europe,' he said. Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, a competition think tank,said shewill watch the hearing for signs that lawmakers want to pursue 'robust enforcement.'On her anti-monopoly wish list is'structural breakups' of the tech giants and blocking companies from buying smallercompanies seen as threats. 'These problems are really deep and reallywidespread,and we need to really use the wholeanti-monopolytool kit to address them,'saidHubbard, a former assistant attorney general for antitrust enforcement in the New York attorney general's office. Lawmakers' challenge Lawmakers can't chargethe tech companieswith antitrust violations or attempt to break them into smaller entities. But what they can do is change the laws and put pressure on regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice to do more to enforce existing regulations. The Justice Department is reportedly likelyto bring antitrust lawsuits against Google. State regulators may join the Justice Department or pursue their own cases, according to reports[3].Part ofthe challenge lawmakers faceat the hearing will be that while Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon are the Who's Who of internet firms, in fact their businesses are not really the same. Still, the policies set by lawmakers in the months and years ahead will likely affect Big Tech for years to come.

They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scrutiny of Big Tech could lead to new restrictions, though forced breakups appear unlikely.</p><p>The four CEOs were testifying remotely at a hearing of the House judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, while most lawmakers sat, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they use their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage. Bezos said that he couldn't guarantee that Amazon had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to momand-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them from defecting to a rival service such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Facebook, in turn, faced renewed focus on its gobbling up of competitors. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg that documents obtained from the company \"tell a very disturbing story\" of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \"meaningfully hurt\" Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \"complement\" to Facebook's services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photosharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its Whats-App messaging service.</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, U.S. President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they, too, have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p>Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>The four tech CEOs command corporations millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourthranked billionaire.</p><p>Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort.</p><p>Of the four tech leaders, Apple CEO Tim Cook faced the lightest scrutiny - a likely reflection of the difficulty of making an antitrust case against the company whose iPhone is the thirdlargest seller in the world. \"Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook told lawmakers.</p><p>But Apple faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VICTE-407094392VITC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VICTTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-2FR1-JBKR-9486-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">249804</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Colonist All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Swapping his usual grey T-shirt for a sober suit and tidy blue tie, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg spent five hours giving evidence to the US Congress about the data scandal that has hit his business. Even for a billionaire it was an intimidating event. But as he spoke, his company's share price climbed and that more than anything else revealed the final score. Senators tried to put him under pressure. Some of their questions were good ones; others were not. It would be easy to mock the senator who asked how Facebook made money - apparently unaware of its vast revenues from advertising and data.</p><p>But mockery would be the wrong response. Governments, courts and parliaments all over the world are struggling to respond to the vast and rapid changes to politics, society and economics being brought by businesses such as Facebook. Would British MPs have asked better questions than the senators? No. Do they have the knowledge and the tools to respond to the power of social media? No. Do our regulators or our courts? No. Digital technology is no longer just one industry among many others: it is a fundamental dynamic in almost every part of modern life and its power is only going to become greater. The established ways of business, politics and Government can no longer deal with this adequately - as everything from the influence of fake social media in the US presidential election to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, to the epidemic of gang violence on London's streets shows.</p><p>So the big question we should all be asking is: what needs to change? And how do we make it happen? The wrong response would be to fear technology or to try to contain its impact.

There are now about 600 tech firms in this corner of the capital, up from 200 this time last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"One year ago we made a major commitment to helping the tech cluster in East London grow. The successful growth we see today is thanks to the talented, creative entrepreneurs who have decided to set up there,\" said Cameron.</p><p>\"As a government, we are determined to continue doing everything we can to help support and accelerate this growth.\"</p><p>Cameron last visited the area, sometimes mockingly called \"Silicon Roundabout\", a year ago. Before last week's visit, some companies felt that he was attempting to lay claim to a movement that had nothing to do with his government.</p><p>This summer, Chris Downs, co-founder of data analytics start-up Level Business, said: \"It was happening without the government, and I can't see any material impact that it has made.\"</p><p>However, Mike Butcher, co-founder of Tech Hub, an organisation that provides working space for entrepreneurs and start-ups in the zone, said that the government was always engaged, just not always with the right people.</p><p>\"There has been a series of virtually monthly meetings over the last year at Number 10 and in the East End, to bring together large corporates, start-ups, venture capitalists and banks,\" Butcher said.</p><p>\"Since they'd never done this before, Number 10 invited a lot of the big tech companies almost exclusively at first, but that's now changing so we've got many more start-ups invited.\"</p><p>Today, most start-ups appear to be extremely positive about the government's involvement.</p><p>\"We absolutely welcome the government's involvement,\" said Eileen Burbidge, co-founder at White Bear Yard, a firm that advises and helps to fund other start-ups.</p><p>\"The government's focus on Tech City helps with the PR and media coverage for involved companies, which in turn helps with customer acquisition and advertising.</p><p>\"It also helps materially with recruitment, and attracting much-needed talent that might otherwise only consider the financial or other established corporate sectors for employment.\"</p><p>James Dobree, co-founder of Level Business, said that government's financial help has also been appreciated.</p><p>\"There are tax incentives, like the EMI [Enterprise Management Incentives] scheme, which is fantastic.\"</p><p>But there is still a long way to go. If Cameron truly wants the area to become Europe's answer to Silicon Valley, with the enormous boost to the struggling UK economy this would provide, then the firms in the zone will need to see more action.</p><p>Jeff Lynn is CEO and co-founder of Seedrs, a firm that helps to finance other start-ups, and also chairman of The Coalition for a Digital Economy (COADEC), a body that advocates on behalf of digital start-ups and SMEs on legislative and regulatory issues.</p><p>Although he appreciates the PR assistance provided by the government, he wants to see more. \"We want the government to implement the reforms set out in the Hargreaves review on intellectual property (IP). We're all very keen to see these wind up on the statute books sooner rather than later,\" he said.</p><p>The Hargreaves review sets out how UK IP laws need to be modernised to better support innovation and economic growth in the digital age.</p><p>Lynn added that funding is another area in which the government could help start-ups.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily about opening up Treasury money to be thrown at these companies. That wasn't effective when the last government did it. But the government could partner with and support private sources of capital in creative and innovative ways,\" he said.</p><p>One controversial government strategy for Tech City has been its enticement of larger enterprises such as Google into the area, with some initially fearing that they will hoover up the talent, leaving the start-ups scrapping for the leftovers; or alternatively simply push up the property rental prices.</p><p>However, Burbidge feels that the presence of larger companies actually increases the local talent pool, as more potential employees seek jobs in the area.</p><p>\"The presence of larger companies helps to legitimise the area, and increases the density of talented people within the zone.\"</p><p>Lynn drew parallels with Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"In Silicon Valley a coder will cut his teeth working at Google, where he'll get great training and work with other brilliant people. Then he'll jump ship to Facebook which is a little more innovative, then go start his own company.\"</p><p>Butcher added candidly: \"In Silicon Valley you don't get told off for joining Google or Facebook or Twitter so why should we do that in London?\"</p><p>It appears, then, that the government is getting its strategy for the area just about right - for now, at least. \"I hope the focus does not wane leading up to London 2012. It would be great to keep the momentum going,\" said Burbidge.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMPTG-3428989</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMPTG2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54C5-PK31-DYWJ-F00R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172297</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Computing</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>November 17, 2011</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009TR5</classCode><className>CUSTOMER ACQUISITION STRATEGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001679</classCode><className>TAX INCENTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DN7Y</classCode><className>DATA ANALYTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009TR5</classCode><className>CUSTOMER ACQUISITION STRATEGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009WI7</classCode><className>DAVID CAMERON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

As China stumbles, Silicon Valley has smelled blood. </p><p>The competition between US and Chinese tech giants for the Indian market is intense, with access to a market of 1.4bn people spurring multibillion-dollar bets. Whichever companies \u2014 whether foreign, foreign-backed or local \u2014 eventually seize commanding positions in the Indian market is likely to have a big influence on the future shape of the global technology industry.</p><p>This rivalry is also taking place amid a broader <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1162b53a-d574-4588-b013-f7e3aa0dc2e1\"> geopolitical contest between the US and China</url>, one where India is becoming an increasingly important factor and where technology is a central battleground. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in India represents the first time the two major tech superpowers are going head to head not just in a battle but also in a tech war,\u201d says William Bao Bean, a Shanghai-based partner at global venture capital company SOSV.</p><p>The recent tensions, he adds, are pushing India \u201ctowards the American ecosystem\u201d.</p><p>Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has given indications of a similar shift, lauding the \u201cUS- India friendship\u201d on Twitter in July. This was not long after a sombre Mr Modi appeared on national television declaring India was \u201churt and angry\u201d with China following the Himalayas incident. </p><p>Enraged opposition leaders and former military generals went even further, condemning \u201cChinese aggression\u201d. With crowds destroying Chinese-made electronics in street protests in several cities, New Delhi <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08e15c26-48e0-4540-a040-1a8782e84f2e\"> banned 59 Chinese mobile apps</url> on the grounds that they were a threat to the country\u2019s security. </p><p>Friction between the two nuclear-armed rivals is nothing new, including the two fighting a border war in the 1960s. Indeed, fractures in the uneasy Sino-Indian relationship were already apparent before the incident in the Himalayas. Rising anti-Beijing sentiment during the coronavirus crisis prompted New Delhi in April to tighten restrictions on foreign direct investment \u2014 designed to block opportunistic Chinese takeovers. </p><p>But experts say this is a watershed moment. </p><p>\u201cThere was a lot of work put into India-China relations in the past 30 years; most of that has been reset,\u201d says Anand Prasanna, managing partner at Indian venture capital fund Iron Pillar. \u201cThis is a turning point for Chinese investment in India tech.\u201d</p><p>Chinese deals drying up</p><p>The boom in Chinese interest in Indian tech is a relatively recent phenomenon. As recently as five years ago, Chinese tech investment in the vast Indian subcontinent was negligible. This then exploded in 2017 and 2018, led by Alibaba and Tencent. Chinese venture capital investments in India totalled $4.3bn between the start of 2017 and June this year. </p><p>The sense that China\u2019s tech leaders have seen India as a second home market is borne out by the profile of their investments. Among India\u2019s top 10 tech unicorns \u2014 start-up companies valued at more than $1bn \u2014 seven are backed by a Chinese strategic investor, against only one that is backed by a US equivalent. </p><p>Chinese backing also extends well beyond the top 10. Research by Gateway House, a Mumbai-based think-tank, shows that out of India\u2019s 30 existing unicorns, 18 are funded either by China\u2019s big technology companies or by Chinese venture capital funds. </p><p>\u201cThey are trying to recreate in India what they have already done in China,\u201d says Amit Bhandari, a fellow at Gateway House.</p><p>Alibaba and Tencent, in particular, have shown a clear intent to build networks of portfolio companies that have the potential to mutually reinforce each others\u2019 operations in India. </p><p>As in China \u2014 where Alibaba bolsters its ecommerce brands such as Taobao and Tmall with a digital payments business, Alipay, social media via Weibo, digital entertainment through Youku, and logistics through Cainiao \u2014 the group is building stakes in a collection of Indian and south-east Asian start-ups.</p><p>In India, Alibaba Group companies have invested in Snapdeal, one of the country\u2019s biggest ecommerce sites, BigBasket, an online supermarket, Paytm, a leading payments app, Dailyhunt, a news site that serves content in 14 local languages, Xpressbees, a parcel service, Zomato for food delivery, and several others. </p><p>Tencent shows the same approach, having invested in ecommerce, online education, food delivery, fantasy sports, a B2B commerce site and several other start-ups in India. To a lesser extent, other Chinese companies, including Meituan Dianping, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c42dc7c-b927-477a-90b7-a202bbe4bc50\"> ByteDance</url>, Xiaomi and Didi Chuxing, are following similar strategies. </p><p>At the same time, dozens of China\u2019s biggest mobile phone apps have flourished in India. According to Sensor Tower, a US company that tracks apps, the three most popular Chinese apps from India\u2019s Apple and Google Play stores \u2014 UC Browser, TikTok and SHAREit \u2014 have had more than 1bn downloads since 2014. </p><p>Zomato, founded in 2008, has received proposed funding of $560m \u2014 more than half of what it has raised to date \u2014 from Ant Financial, the payments affiliate of Alibaba, to fuel its blistering growth. </p><p>Gaurav Gupta, co-founder and chief operating officer at Zomato, says there is no doubt over the role played by Ant Financial in his company\u2019s development. Not only did the Chinese company come with deep pockets, it also transferred knowledge on how to \u201cscale fast\u201d and \u201cpenetrate deep\u201d, Mr Gupta says.</p><p>But the fallout from the political tensions between New Delhi and Beijing has already delayed funding for young companies such as Zomato, closely tied to China. At least $100m of that money from Ant Financial has been delayed due to the uncertainty over how the new foreign direct investment rules will impact on previously announced investments. Zomato is no isolated case. There are already signs this record flow of money is slowing down.</p><p>The number of fundraising deals involving one or more Chinese investors fell from six in January this year to zero in June, according to Refinitiv, a data provider. By comparison, there were nine venture capital deals involving a US investor in June. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely led to some reduction in competition in deals,\u201d says Madhur Singhal, managing director at consultancy Praxis Global Alliance.</p><p>Chinese mobile apps, which have proliferated across India, are another casualty. New Delhi\u2019s ban on some of China\u2019s biggest apps in late June, was a particular blow for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93aec618-8bb8-4997-9ed8-89c69e62d5b5\"> video streaming app TikTok</url>, which is owned by Chinese technology group ByteDance and has more than 200m users in India, counting it as its biggest overseas market. </p><p>Long-simmering public discontent is even articulated by companies that have benefited from Chinese money. </p><p>Yashish Dahiya, chief executive of PolicyBazaar, a $1.65bn insurance aggregator in India, of which Tencent holds a 10 per cent stake, is blunt.</p><p>\u201cI think for the last 30 years\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the Chinese government has not played by the rules. They like to play by the rules when it is to their advantage, but they don\u2019t provide the same rules to outsiders in their country.\u201d </p><p>Buying the \u2018India story\u2019</p><p>It is in this febrile climate that Silicon Valley has seized its golden moment. Mr Modi\u2019s warm words that the US and India were \u201cnatural partners\u201d came hot on the heels of a number of deals by US Big Tech. </p><p>In July Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/431e50fb-eedc-44f7-9c36-d85dd9cc2f32\"> pledged $10bn of investment in India</url> as part of a vague but nonetheless impressive sounding \u201cIndia digitisation fund\u201d. That same week the search company announced it would invest <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c12a67b-4cdf-4c98-bc50-5434d2140d25\"> $4.5bn in Jio Platforms</url>, the fast-growing digital business owned by India\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, that spans everything from telecoms to ecommerce to video streaming. The Google deal followed a $5.7bn investment by Facebook in Jio in April.</p><p>Although much of this recent dealmaking has been focused on a single company, Jio, it builds on earlier investments and attempts to appeal to India\u2019s young and digitally-savvy market. </p><p>Google Pay has become the biggest digital payments provider in India after its launch in the country in 2017. According to a May 2020 report by Bernstein, Google Pay led the payments market in India, followed by PhonePe, the digital payments unit of Walmart-owned Flipkart, Amazon Pay and lastly Paytm, the $16bn market darling which is backed by Alibaba. India is also Facebook\u2019s biggest market in terms of users and the company is set to launch its own WhatsApp Pay service imminently. </p><p>The approach of US investors \u2014 aside from payments \u2014 had until now been quite different to their Chinese rivals. </p><p>\u201cUS investors [were] mostly funds while Chinese investors are the internet giants seeking to recreate the ecosystems they have at home,\u201d says Mr Bhandari of Gateway House. </p><p>The main exception had been Flipkart, India\u2019s leading ecommerce site, which was bought for $16bn by Walmart in May 2018 after the US retailer bought the stakes of several investors, including Tencent, Naspers, eBay and Microsoft. </p><p>But now, says Karthik Reddy, co-founder of Blume Ventures, an investor in start-ups, the anti-China sentiment and takeover fears which led to the FDI rule change have already tilted the playing field towards US investors. </p><p>\u201cJio is a fundamental example of that,\u201d he says, referring to the wave of US investors that have followed Facebook and Google into the platform, including private equity groups Silver Lake and KKR. \u201cThe Americans are buying more and more into the Indian story.\u201d </p><p>Warning signs for US investors </p><p>The harsh turn in sentiment against China underscores the capricious nature of investing in emerging markets, even one as dynamic as India. For any foreign investor, including those from the US, the risk of being hit with new regulations remains high. India has repeatedly used such tactics to assert local control over successful international businesses.</p><p>Europe\u2019s Cairn Energy has been bogged down by a battle over $1.6bn in retroactive tax demands. Vodafone\u2019s Indian joint venture has also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15af5d8c-1811-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385\"> warned it may \u201cshut shop\u201d</url> after being slapped with retroactive levies.</p><p>Walmart invested in Flipkart only to have the ecommerce rules changed in favour of domestic rivals after its entry to the market. When Amazon founder <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/249027f2-377c-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\"> Jeff Bezos came to India</url> in January, commerce minister Piyush Goyal declared that the tycoon\u2019s investment was no big \u201cfavour\u201d to India.</p><p>UberEats\u2019 fate in the food delivery sector serves as another cautionary tale. On a well-publicised visit in 2016, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s erstwhile boss, met Indian cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar and discussed movies with Bollywood star Salman Khan. He told local media that his company \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited to serve India\u201d. </p><p>UberEats began business in Mumbai in 2017 in an initiative that senior executives described as a \u201cmajor step in our global expansion\u201d. But by the end of 2019 it was in retreat.</p><p>It could not withstand the \u201cburn rate\u201d required to compete against the superior financial firepower of Zomato and its rival, Swiggy, which is backed by Tencent and Meituan Dianping, China\u2019s biggest food delivery platform. In January 2020, Uber agreed to sell its food delivery business in India to Zomato in exchange for taking a minority stake. </p><p>Indeed there are fears that investor enthusiasm for the country may have run far ahead of reality. The losses racked up by Zomato, Swiggy and UberEats in India\u2019s food delivery sector are by no means unusual. </p><p>There is also some scepticism over the frenzy of dealmaking into four-year-old Jio Platforms which has raised $20bn from global investors in the past three months alone. Mr Ambani now says he has eliminated $20bn in net debt. </p><p>\u201cCompanies have effectively given Jio $20bn to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009sponsor its debt,\u201d says one Asia-based fund manager, referring to how Mr Ambani has long wanted to make Reliance Industries debt-free.</p><p>The mentality in the tech industry, however, is that it is better to spend big and build a dominant position rather than lose out on the most lucrative growth market for foreign companies. In spite of the losses, investors are piling into the evermore competitive landscape.</p><p>Experts think China is down but not out. Chinese companies have not been totally frozen out of India by the FDI rules, says Mr Singhal. Even Ant Financial and Zomato are \u201cconfident\u201d the $100m in limbo will eventually go through, burnt company shirts and all. </p><p>Mr Bao Bean says it is too soon to declare the US the winner, though the China side was definitely \u201ccaught off guard\u201d by the events of the past few months. \u201cChinese tech and money are still very strong in India,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is just one win for the American internet leaders.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-b1df5dfd36c449e6bc56506bf3ca3444</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HB-G991-DXP9-9154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2249\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hosted in the Las Vegas Convention Center, CES is an ongoing gathering of the biggest, brightest things the technology field has to offer. It calls itself the global stage for innovation, and as CES 2016 has shown, this is no exaggeration. From January 6 to 9, over 3,000 companies from around the world set out their biggest toys in a power play for consumer dollars and media attention. After four days of nonstop hardware and software demos, one theme stands out above the rest: the smart device.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a clich\u00e9 to say that we are now living in the future, but everything showcased at CES 2016 proves there is worth to this statement. From drones that can carry adult human beings to room-cleaning, WiFi-powered robots, our world resembles that of speculative fiction.</p><p>Our homes, cars, phones-all our devices, really-are getting upgraded so that they can move according to our wants and needs, sometimes before we realize it. In a matter of time, the new modern home will look a lot more \"Star Trek,\" and that is pretty darn cool. We already have hoverboards, video conferences, and phones strapped to our wrists, so why not boldly go forward with what our everyday devices can really do?</p><p>Which is not to say this brave new world of bendable 4k screens and smart homes is without its risks. As a recent article on Network World's website points out, security is a major issue with a lot of these devices. When all your household appliances and wearable tech are constantly telling the cloud your personal activities and habits, a lot on insecure networks with little to no oversight from regulatory groups, it is hard to feel safe while connected.</p><p>Granted, that is often one of the major issues with new technology-see every Apple iOS update ever-but the ideal smart tech user for this market will be updating all of their items to be interconnected, which increases the risk factors behind a system-\u00acwide hack or program going awry. Consumers should demand safer tech, more secure data systems, and multiple fail-safes to protect themselves from the inevitable system shutdowns that will threaten their entire digital and real lives. Luckily, consumers still have voices and will put them-along with their wallets-behind companies who embrace safe and smart devices that sparkle in the showroom.</p><p>There is no reason to approach the marvels coming out of CES 2016 with fear and loathing. A lot of the items are quite exciting, although sometimes superfluous for the average user. Even so, how often do you get to see a toilet seat that lights up and opens when it senses its next user? Or an alarm clock that can wake you up with your favorite morning scents? Then there are more useful items, like Halo, the smart smoke alarm that provides real-time weather alerts, both in the home and to the user's mobile phone. The wide selection of drones demoed at the convention suggests that the technology has moved well beyond being a novelty for photographers, hobbyists, and Amazon. And, while I am not the biggest fan of 4k video, it is becoming the clear contender to replace Blu\u00acRay and HD as the preferred format for media.</p><p>I wanted to be a curmudgeon about CES 2016-I usually am about big tech shows-but this year has me feeling excited for what will come out of the innovations previewed in Las Vegas.

For starters, tech companies have long seen themselves as bastions of free expression.</p><p>But the Charlottesville rally seemed to have a sobering effect. It showed how easily technology can be used to organize and finance such events, and how extreme views online can translate into violence offline.</p><p>\"There is a difference between freedom of speech and what happened in Charlottesville,\" said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, an online racial justice group. The battle of ideas is \"different than people who show up with guns to terrorize communities.\"</p><p>Slow reaction</p><p>Tech companies are in a bind. On one hand, they want to be open to as many people as possible so they can show them ads or provide rides, apartments or financial services. On the other hand, some of these users turn out to be white supremacists, terrorists or child molesters.</p><p>Keegan Hankes, analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence project, said his group has been trying for more than a year to get Facebook and PayPal to shut down these accounts. Even now, he said, the two companies are taking action only in the most extreme cases.</p><p>\"They have policies against violence, racism, harassment,\" said Hankes, whose center monitors hate groups and extremism. \"The problem is that there has been no enforcement.\"</p><p>Case in point: The neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer has been around since 2013. But it wasn't effectively kicked off the Internet until it mocked the woman killed while protesting the white nationalists in Charlottesville.</p><p>Shifting line</p><p>PayPal said groups that advocate racist views have no place on its service, but added that there is a \"fine line\" when it comes to balancing freedom of expression with taking a stand against violent extremism.</p><p>Other companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google struggle with the same balancing act. The fine line is constantly moving and being tested.</p><p>Ahead of the rally, Airbnb barred housing rentals to people it believed were traveling to participate. Before and after Charlottesville, PayPal cut off payments to groups that promote hate and violence. GoDaddy and Google yanked the domain name for Daily Stormer following the rally. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are removing known hate groups from their services, and the music streaming service Spotify dropped what it considers hate bands.</p><p>\"Companies are trying to figure out what the right thing is to do and how to do it,\" said Steve Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who focuses on communication technology. What happens from here is \"partly going to depend on the individual leadership at these companies and company culture - and probably resources, too.\"</p><p>Cat and mouse</p><p>While traditional brands such as Tiki had no way of knowing that their torches were being bought for the rally, tech companies have tools to identify and ban people with extremist views.</p><p>That's thanks to the troves of data they store on people and to their ability to easily switch off access to users. Airbnb users can link to social media profiles, and the company said it used its existing background checks and \"input from the community\" to identify users who didn't align with its standards.</p><p>Yet these services also allow for anonymity, which makes their jobs more difficult. Banned people can sign up again with a different email address, something they can easily obtain anonymously.</p><p>Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhraja said hate groups also know the site's policies and try to keep things just benign enough to ensure they are not in violation.</p><p>For instance, the event page for the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville looked fairly innocuous. Budhraja said there was nothing on the page that would suggest it was created by a hate organization. It has since been removed.</p><p>Facebook's technology is designed to automatically flag posts that are on the absolute extreme and clearly violate the company's policies. They are sometimes removed before users can even see them. What Facebook can't leave to automation are posts, events and groups in that ever-growing gray area.</p><p>Broadest reach</p><p>The First Amendment offers hate groups a lot of speech protection, but it applies only to government and public settings. A private company is typically free to set its own standards.</p><p>Christopher Cantwell, a self-described white nationalist who has been labeled an extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center, said he was banned from Facebook, Instagram and PayPal because the companies are trying to silence him for his views.</p><p>\"Everybody is going through extraordinary lengths to make sure we are not heard,\" Cantwell told the Associated Press .</p><p>Even Cloudflare, a security company that prides itself on providing services regardless of their content, terminated Daily Stormer on Wednesday. This appears to be the site's final blow.</p><p>Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin said in an email to the AP that these private companies are \"de facto monopolies and oligopolies\" and should be regulated as \"critical infrastructure.\"</p><p>The Daily Stormer and other banned groups could move to darker corners of the web, where extreme views are welcome. But this won't help with recruitment and won't allow them to disseminate their views as broadly as they could on Facebook or Twitter.</p><p>\"These are the platforms everyone is using,\" Hankes said. \"They don't want to be pushed to the margins because they want influence.\"</p><p>Because of that, the industry's efforts might just be a game of whack-a-mole, with extremist views returning, perhaps in different guises, once public outrage dies down.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC599618eb7115eimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>It took a deadly rally to get some of the nation's biggest tech companies to take a firmer stand against accounts used to promote hate and violence.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>AP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTCUR-f4e1cf6381ed5858bf833956859e3adf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTCUR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P8M-M4G1-JCB8-W1NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Post and Courier All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Post &amp;

This event lets firms showcase their top managers and hot products before hundreds of analysts, investors and media members.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's Finisar, whose $281 million in 2005 sales is a sliver of the big boys' sum. The maker of components and testing gear for optical networks has five stock analysts covering it, attracts scant media coverage and trades near 5. But last month, it held its first analyst day ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Finisar is one of many small tech firms trying to boost its profile on Wall Street through analyst days or other means.</p><p>The small companies are doing so as tech rebounds but as tough new financial laws make it tougher to attract analyst coverage. Investor relations professionals say getting analyst interest is a necessary step in order to get the attention of big, professional investors.</p><p>\"When you have good news, you open the window and shout it out to the world,\" said Gene Marbach, vice president of Markovsky &amp; Co., which provides investor relations services for firms. \"A lot more companies have good news now.\"</p><p>Besides holding analyst days, more smaller tech firms are taking other steps to get out their goods news.</p><p>One way is to speak at investment conferences hosted by Wall Street firms, where top executives of many companies speak for a short time in front of investors and analysts. Investment firms held 1,488 such conferences last year, up 27% from 2004, says Greg Parks of Wall Street Calendar, which tracks such events.</p><p>Road Shows Also In Gear</p><p>Then, there are roadshows. More tech companies are asking investor relations firms for help in setting up roadshows, where executives visit directly with potential analysts and investors, says Gordon McCoun, an executive at Financial Dynamics.</p><p>It, too, handles investor relations for companies.</p><p>Using all these methods, smaller tech companies are being more aggressive in getting their stories out to investors and analysts.</p><p>JDS Uniphase is one of them. The maker of fiber-optic gear fell hard during the tech downturn and skipped holding an analyst day in 2002 and 2003. It held one in 2004, though. Last year, it opted to have executives speak at more investor conferences, says Enzo Signore, a JDSU marketing executive. Those executives spoke at seven such events, up from four in 2004.</p><p>Finisar linked its analyst day with that of another tech company, storage hardware firm Brocade Communications. Finisar Chief Executive Jerry Rawls says his company took two hours after Brocade did the same in the same location. The firms make complementary products, so many of the same analysts and investors are interested in both.</p><p>Rawls used the event to highlight Finisar's first quarterly profit in four years. He calls it a success, with 60 attendees.</p><p>\"A lot of people are still skeptical about optical telecom,\" Rawls said. \"But we felt we had a good story to tell.\"</p><p>McCoun says an analyst day is the best way for companies to present their executives and speak about a broad range of topics. Roadshows are fine, but they give only one or two executives a chance to speak. He says even companies trading under 10 can interest big Wall Street investors and analysts.</p><p>Gauging Credibility</p><p>Professional investors and analysts use these events to help gauge the credibility of management, McCoun says. He says executives who were forthright about prospects during the tech bust have more cachet on Wall Street than those who glossed over potential problems.</p><p>\"Credibility is executive specific, not company specific,\" McCoun said. \"It can be a broken business, but if management has strong credibility, then it will get a hearing.\"</p><p>In 2001, Ascential Software, a spinoff from a failed merger of two software firms, had two analysts covering it and a stock price near 6. David Roy, its head of investor relations, wanted to drum up business, so he held its first analyst day and was happy to get 50 attendees.</p><p>By 2005, the company had 16 analysts covering it and attracted 100 people to its analyst day. IBM bought the company last year for $18.50 a share.</p><p>Though many smaller tech companies are doing better nowadays, they face one new, big hurdle in seeking to attract attention from analysts and big investors, says Roy. That hurdle is tough new financial laws, including Sarbanes-Oxley. Wall Street firms now must pay for research and analysis from brokerage fees, not from their investment banking operations, as regulators toughened up in separating the two functions.</p><p>Companies with lower trading volume generate lower brokerage fees, says Roy, who now does investor relations for software firm Iona Technologies. Smaller fees mean there's less incentive for an investment bank to pick up analyst coverage of a smaller company.</p><p>\"Small caps have a tough time getting coverage,\" Roy said, \"since there's so little volume.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-1559439</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4JKC-HGM0-TX4P-W1VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Our right to freely engage in public discourse through speech is under sustained attack, necessitating a vigorous defense against the major social media and internet platforms. From 'shadowbans' on Facebook[2] and Twitter[3], to demonetization of YouTube videos[4], to pulled[5] ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list of violations against the online practices and speech of conservatives[6] is long.I certainly had my suspicions confirmed when Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, 'accidentally' censored [7]a post I made regarding the Jussie Smollett hoax, which consequently led to me hearing from hundreds of my followers about how they've been having problems seeing, liking or being able to interact with my posts. </p><p>Many of them even claimed that they've had to repeatedly refollow me, as Instagram keeps unfollowing me on their accounts.While nothing about Big Tech's censorship of conservatives truly surprises me anymore, it's still chilling to see the proof for yourself. If it can happen to me, the son of the president, with millions of followers on social media, just think about how bad it must be for conservatives with smaller followings and those who don't have the soapbox or media reach to push back when they're being targeted?Thanks to a brave Facebook whistleblower who approached[8] James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, we now know that Mark Zuckerberg[9]'s social media giant developed algorithms to 'deboost' certain content, limiting its distribution and appearance in news feeds. As you probably guessed, this stealth censorship was specifically aimed at conservatives.Facebook appears to have deliberately tailored[10] its algorithm to recognize the syntax and style popular among conservatives in order to 'deboost' that content. 'Mainstream media,' 'SJW\" (Social Justice Warrior) and 'red pill' \u2014 all terms that conservatives often use to express themselves \u2014 were listed as red flags, according to the former Facebook insider.Facebook engineers even cited BlazeTV host Lauren Chen's video criticizing the social justice movement as an example of the kind of 'red pills' that users just aren't allowed to drop anymore. Mainstream conservative content was strangled[11] in real time, yet fringe leftists such as the Young Turks enjoy free rein on the social media platform.Despite the occasional brave gesture[12], politicians have been far too sluggish in recognizing the extent of the problem. But the Republican Party and the conservative movement are becoming more vigilant against the suppression of our speech, as we saw at last weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)[13]. Silicon Valley lobbyists have splashed millions of dollars[14] all over the Washington swamp to play on conservatives' innate faith in the free-market system and respect for private property. Even as Big Tech companies work to exclude us from the town square of the 21st century, they've been able to rely on misguided conservatives to carry water[15] for them with irrelevant pedantry about whether the First Amendment applies[16] in cases of social media censorship. ...There is more.I am familiar withthe term used by conservativesalthough I do not use them very often. I am particularlyoffended by the term \"socialjustice.\" Justice is a word that needs no modifiers in front of it. It usually is just an excuse for pushing liberalism.

For centuries, we were left to our own devices to figure out a treatment for our illness. This often meant using natural plants and methods to create a concoction. </p><p>But with the advent of modern medicine, healthcare has become the biggest global business; it's entrenched in every country's infrastructure, and humans rely on it to be stable, effective, and affordable. Peter Diamandis is the co-founder of X-Prize, Singularity University, and San Diego[1]-based Health Longevity Inc. Diamandis says healthcare is fundamentally broken. In his new book, titled The Future Is Faster Than You Think, Diamandis introduces the notion that the big tech giants will be running the healthcare industry by 2030. 'Do I think Apple and Google and Amazon can do a better job?' he posits. 'A thousandfold.'The Not-So-Far Future2030 isn't far from 2020. Before we know it, we'll be ringing in a new decade again and will have many new innovations to look forward to. One of these innovations will use the data from a ubiquitous device of this decade to create better healthcare solutions: smart assistants. Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant, and Apple's HomePod have been generating data from us for years, and they're going to be invaluable in leading the charge for data-driven healthcare. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2019/12/p-1-amazon-and-apple-will-be-our-doctors-in-the-future-says-peter-diamandis.jpg\">https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2019/12/p-1-amazon-and-apple-will-be-our-doctors-in-the-future-says-peter-diamandis.jpg</url> Out of the three tech giants, Amazon's the frontrunner due to its large investment in healthcare. In the UK, Amazon and the National Health service have partnered up to make Alexa a resource-rich hub of medical information. Amazon has worked hard to make Alexa HIPAA-compliant, and it's signed contracts with insurance companies and healthcare providers to help patients send information through Alexa. Google's Assistant has a Mayo Clinic-developed feature named First Aid. It helps patients treat minor issues and injuries. Apple's suite of products (Watch, iPhone, and the HomePod) connects to its HealthKit product.Data-Driven HealthcareAccording to Diamandis, these devices can lower costs and burden for the patient[2] by directing them away from a costly hospital visit. Because the tech giants have become masters of predicting user behavior using the user's personal data, Diamandis is confident this technique can be applied to healthcare, risk calculation, and diagnosis prediction.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5bda2d856c206635ce04893c/master/pass/181112_r33197.jpg\">https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5bda2d856c206635ce04893c/master/pass/181112_r33197.jpg</url> Artificial intelligence (AI) works best when it's trained on multidimensional data. This can be achieved from our current (and constantly improving) state of wearables. The idea is that AI can point out when a patient is at high risk for an illness or disease so that he or she can take the recommended steps to fix it before it becomes a real problem. Preventative medicine takes more effort over time, but 'it is literally hundreds if not thousands of times cheaper,' says Diamandis. His prediction says that the tech giants will take money from patients to provide them with ways to stay healthy, rather than treat them or cover the cost of the illness. Henrik Vogt is a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Oslo, studying Medical Ethics. Vogt says that although these devices and medical applications[3] open more insights into the patient's body and habits, they also create more noise in the data. Vogt is also worried that we may invest too much time and money into big data and completely forego focusing on other factors that can improve the healthcare experience, like institutional or social change.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bad-datasets-v6.gif?w=1400...ip=all...lity=75Trusting\">https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bad-datasets-v6.gif?w=1400...ip=all...lity=75Trusting</url> the Tech GiantsAmazon and Apple both employ a substantial number of doctors to help direct development, test devices on patients, and even help their employees get on-site healthcare. Amazon's also working on a secret project, called Haven Healthcare, with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway. Apple and Google are working to integrate their innovations within traditional healthcare infrastructure and workflows. They're more focused on improving the field for providers and patients. All of these ideas and predictions sound great at a glance until you remember that Google, Amazon, and Apple are guarding tons of sensitive data because it's profitable. Let's not forget that, when Google acquired Fitbit in 2019, it had to issue an official statement saying it wouldn't use Fitbit user data for its own advertising gain. All of this to say that the tech giants aren't trustworthy and are always laser-focused on impressing their shareholders.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://article.images.consumerreports.org/f_auto/prod/content/dam/CRO%20Images%202018/Health/May/CR-Health-Inlinehero-online-doctor-0518\">https://article.images.consumerreports.org/f_auto/prod/content/dam/CRO%20Images%202018/Health/May/CR-Health-Inlinehero-online-doctor-0518</url> If you're already skeptical of the tech giants, chances are you're going to want to employ some other company or method in managing your health. But if Diamandis's prediction comes true, we may be stuck with only a few options in the future. And these options also know everything about your search history, product interest, shopping habits, and more. For big data and AI to improve healthcare, we must think critically about who we give the power of prediction and knowledge to manage our bodies and health. There must be rules, regulations, and standards for what is acceptable, what isn't allowed, and what the bare minimum entails.A New Way Forward?As we've seen with the current landscape of medicine, AI works best when it's collaborating with doctors: this combination yields the highest accuracy. For that reason, in the future, we're still going to want to have a human doctor advocating for us as the patient, while working alongside an AI program from one of the tech giants. And Diamandis agrees with this sentiment. What do you think about his belief that the tech titans of today will become the medical providers of tomorrow? Do you think this will pave the way towards a brighter future for healthcare? As always, let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

The shock of what happened in Charlottesville over the weekend is  ringing in the air like a gunshot.  People in every side recognized it was  awful because it was awful.  Absolutely and completely.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The only thing that could make what happened in Charlottesville worse would  be if we allow a small number of people in power to make America less  tolerant and less free in its aftermath.  Let's be honest, we've seen that  before.  It happened after 9/11.  Almost nobody wanted to say so at the  time for fear of seeming sympathetic to terrorists but it did.  Secret  lists, massive government spying on citizens.  The Feds rooting around in  people's bank accounts for no good reason.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We allowed all of that to happen because we were upset and afraid.  Well,  this morning there were signs it could be happening again.  The Wall Street  Journal reported that big tech companies are using their power to silence  certain political views.  Both Google and web hosting service Go Daddy  stopped providing hosting support for Daily Stormer.  That is a white  supremacist website.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the hotel website Airbnb announced it will permanently ban white  supremacists from using its service to book rooms.  PayPal says, it won't  let white supremacists group used its payment platform.  Nobody on the show  was weeping for the Daily Stormer, even mentioning their name probably got  us written up by the Southern Poverty Law Center as dangerous alt-right  subversive or something.  We don't care.  </p><p>There's a principle at stake here and it is worth defending regardless.  We  should be very concerned by the prospect of big companies using their power  to enforce ideological conformity even when it seems only to affect people  we don't like as it does right now.  Especially now we should be concerned  because support for free expression appears to be fading on the left and  especially among young people.  </p><p>But 2015 Pew Poll found that 40 percent of millennials already believe in  restricting speech that they believe is offensive.  Those are the people  who are going to be running this world very soon.  You think they'll think  twice before banning websites they don't like?  They won't.  The Daily  Stormer today is fine.  But who is it going to be next week or next year,  the national right to life, FOXNews.com, Catholic charities?  Why wouldn't  it be?  And why wouldn't Airbnb ban public supporters of Trump from getting  rooms.  </p><p>They support terrorism.  Why wouldn't Facebook eliminate all references to,  I don't know, pro-life positions.  Today's political opponents could very  easily become tomorrow's designated Nazis or terrorists.  Definitions  change.  Principles do not change.  And that is way it's crucial to keep  fighting for them, keep fighting for an open society even if people call  you names when you do it.  </p><p>Now, the First Amendment is America's most famous freedom, the strongest  sign that our country is dedicated to the personal liberty of every person  here.  The fact that this right applies to the most hated members of  society isn't a weakness, it's the whole point.  It's proof of how robust  that right is.  Tech companies aren't the government and they're not bound  by the same rules as a consequence of that.  But that doesn't mean we  shouldn't push back and do it loudly.  </p><p>The biggest tech firms are more powerful than any monopolies in the gilded  age and they're far less restrained and far less trustworthy.  In some  ways, they're more dangerous even than overreaching government, because  they're less accountable.  They could make this country a place you would  not want to live.  And they could probably do it quickly and they probably  will do it unless they're brought to heel.  </p><p>Mark Steyn is an author, columnist and an all-around defender of freedom  and a good guy who is nice to sit in for this show last week.  He joins us  now.  </p><p>Mark, I'm positive that this segment is going to get us both written up by  the Southern Poverty Law Center.  I'm not defending any of these creepy  groups, this nationalist group or anything like that.  I'm not a part of  them and don't like them.  </p><p>MARK STEYN, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  But I think that your poll is worth defending, it's essential.   </p><p>STEYN:  Absolutely.  Freedom of speech enables you to argue for other  freedoms.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p>STEYN:  And that is the point of it.  If you don't have freedom of speech,  all can you do is, as they do in un-free societies, is blow things up and  shoot people.  And it is interesting to me, that the less freedom of speech  we have, the more we have what we saw over the weekend.  We have guys  rampaging through the street.  It doesn't really matter what side they're  on.  </p><p>The minute you say that you can't book a conference room and hold a debate,  you can't have a \"You Tube\" channel, you can't go on Facebook, then the  logic of that tends towards smashing stuff in the street, whether it's  toppling statues like the left did, or whether it's camping about with tiki  torches like the right did and rambling on about Jews and all the rest of  it.  That is why I'm --</p><p>CARLSON:  That is exactly right.   </p><p>STEYN:  This took place in conference centers.  And the other point you  made, Tucker, which is absolutely needs underlining, is that it always  starts off with the Daily Stormer.  But it goes further than that.  PayPal  for example kicked off V-Day.com.  V-Day.com has something to do with what  happened in Charlottesville, it is a website that is an immigration  restrictionist website.  </p><p>It thinks post 1965 immigration has been largely disastrous for the United  States.  And you can say that that is a wrong position to hold.  But you  are doing something very dangerous when you say you cannot hold that  position and use the main credit card processing service on the internet.   V-Day.com publishes Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin, who are no strangers  to this channel.  And so, there is something actually very disturbing when  PayPal boots them off what is essentially a monopoly provider.  </p><p>CARLSON:  I had no idea.  And that kind of is the point, it's a monopoly  provider as is Facebook, as is Google.  </p><p>STEYN:  Right.</p><p>CARLSON:  These are companies in American history and world history.  And  so, as a free market conservative for all of my life, I'm now beginning to  think, well, wait a second, do they have too much power?  Are they stifling  speech?  </p><p>STEYN:  I think what you said last night, Tucker, is absolutely right.  I  don't see why, if the United States government thinks in 1918 -- not 1918,  I think it's about ten years before that, 1909, whenever it was.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>STEYN:  Standard oil had gotten too big.  If standard oil was too big in  1909, yes, what is Google now?  And there's a difference.  The oil  companies, or MGM when they both made movies and owned cinemas, they're  basically in the movie business.  Standard oil is in the oil business.   Google is in the fourth business.  When you have someone who is actually in  control of ideas who knows the data of just about all seven billion people  on the planet, and it is enforcing an ideological straitjacket, that is far  more disturbing than if a standard oil or MGM are enforcing ideological  straitjackets.  </p><p>So, I actually think we're moving into a very dark era where \"You Tube\" and  Facebook and Twitter will bounce more and more people off their monopolies.   And that will lead to more violence in the street.  </p><p>CARLSON:  I'm afraid you're right.  If there were real liberals still stand  as there were in the progressive era, they would understand this.  But  liberals today so-called are on the side of the moguls, on the side of the  Facebook people, on the side of Jeff Bezos, have you noticed this? </p><p>STEYN:  Yes.  As recently as 10, 15 years ago they at least would pay lip  service to that apocryphal Voltaire quote that they didn't agree with what  you said, but they would defend to the death the right to say it.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>STEYN:  Now they will be out in the streets defending to the death, they're  right not to have to listen to it.  Nobody is asking them.  I don't want  anybody to defend me to the death or Daily Stormer to the death or V- Day.com to the death or any of them.  I don't even want to mildly  supportive tweet or Facebook post.  All I'm saying and you're saying is  that when we have monopoly providers, the idea that they can ideologically  constrain that content is very, very dangerous.  </p><p>CARLSON:  No, it's terrifying.  Thank you, Mark, for explaining that so  well.  I appreciate it.   </p><p>STEYN:  Thanks a lot, Tucker.  </p><p>CARLSON:  A group of Trump supporters is suing the city of San Jose,  California.  They're saying the city failed to keep them safe during a  Donald Trump rally in 2016.  Cops let the situation got out of control  letting protesters rob and assault Trump supporters outside the rally.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a country of about 350,000.  It has now  almost completely eliminated down syndrome birth since the test began in  the early 2000.  There are similar trends across Europe.  A stark contrast  --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, that was the wrong sound bite.  But we'll take you back to  the rally, at which one woman found herself pelted with eggs.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One young woman tried to take them on proudly showing  off her Trump shirt.  Then it is so scary, she's hit in the face with  watermelon and raw eggs.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh my God! </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She finds herself all alone in the corner.  The crowd  screaming obscenities and no one came to her aid.  Not even the cops.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Harmeet Dhillon is a lawyer and a committee woman for the  California RNC.  She is also representing some of the attendees at that  rally who say, they were jeopardized by the police absence.  She joins us  tonight.  </p><p>Harmeet, thanks a lot for coming on.  </p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, give us the account from the point of view of the Trump  supporters at this rally.  The police didn't protect them? </p><p>DHILLON:  Yes.  So, I was actually there, Tucker, I did the pledge of  allegiance at the Savannah, it was a great event in June last year.  And  then the police actually directed us there.  About 250 of them wearing riot  gear, to leave the event.  And they directed us directly into a full- fledged riot that was taking place outside the event.  And did not let  people go in a safer route or another route.  And so, what happened was, we  saw an assault on numerous individuals.  We have 17 named plaintiffs in the  case including Rachel Casey you saw there on the video.  </p><p>And the police made one arrest, and the one arrest was when one of these  criminals picked up a barricade and threw it at police.  They otherwise did  nothing to arrest anybody from teenagers who are our clients all the way to  people on their 70s.  It was an absolute travesty.  And so, we filed this  civil rights lawsuit against the city of Berkeley and the police there for  failing to honor the civil rights of the Trump attendees.  </p><p>And the civil rights include being able to attend a conservative event and  leave without being assaulted and subject to a riot.  And so, so far a case  is going on.  We survived a motion to dismiss.  The judge said that there  was not qualified immunity at this stage for the city.  And so, the city  has appealed that to the Ninth Circuit.  That's where we are in that case.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, what you're saying is something, anyone is paying attention,  recognizes.  There's a theme here.  And it seems like, correct me if I'm  being a conspiracy nut, that in certain places local politicians decide  they don't want to protect people they disagree with and so they don't.  Is  that what is happening? </p><p>DHILLON:  It's not a conspiracy, absolutely.  So, right after this event  where the whole country, like, the video you saw, saw criminals attacking  lawful citizens, the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, tweeted out that it  was Donald Trump's fault.  And we saw the exact same pattern in Berkeley  where I have also filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of  California, Berkeley, where Berkeley police have basically standing orders  to not protect people in a riot unless there is imminent death.  </p><p>And those are the actual orders of the Police Department and the mayor  there who is also a liberal and who is a supporter of black, you know, by  all means necessary and sympathizer of Black Lives Matter and other groups  like that.  And you know, what we saw in Charlottesville as well.  So, it  is a combination of a lack of will or an absolute hostility by the  political authorities in these cities coupled by fear of lawsuits.  </p><p>I mean, the Berkeley case, what happened was the occupy people filed a  lawsuit after being arrested in 2014.  And the city caved in and agreed  with them in a settlement agreement, that in the future they're not going  to get into it if you're having a liberal protest there, they're going to  let you do what you do.  And they're only going to intervene in case  somebody is about to be killed.  </p><p>So, I don't think citizens know that.  I don't think your average citizen  going about their business, an anti-fa gang  comes and starts throwing  things and starts swinging bats and poles and breaking into buildings that  the police are just going to stand there and watch you and do nothing.  But  we've seen that time and time again in the last year.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Well, when you politicize law enforcement, that's really the end  of civilization.  Thanks for fighting back against that.  Harmeet Dhillon,  thank you.</p><p>So, members of Congress are seizing on the events of last weekend to demand  a rollback of freedoms in this country.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  not surprisingly is at the forefront of that, just calling on the National  Park service to block a scheduled patriot prayer rally in San Francisco.   She calls it a white supremacist event that would promote violence.  </p><p>Joey Gibson would know because he is the rally's organizer and he joins us  tonight.  So, let's be totally honest with one another, Joey, I'm sure  you're going to be denounced as a white supremacist.  Everybody seems to be  now.  Are you a white supremacist and is this rally a white supremacist  rally? </p><p>JOEY GIBSON, PATRIOT PRAYER:  Absolutely not.  I'm not white.  We have  about eight speakers and only one speaker is white.  You know, we have a  couple of black speakers, Hispanic, we have a transsexual speaker, we have  a woman speaker, it's very diverse.  You know, it's really just about what  is on the inside.  You know, what you believe.  You know, your heart, your  soul has nothing to do with skin color.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, you're not only not white supremacists, you are not even  white.  I find hilarious.  I'm sorry to laugh because it's so lunatic that  the former speaker of the house is calling you and the people you're  speaking with white supremacists.  Again, when you aren't even white.  Why  do think she's saying that? </p><p>GIBSON:  Well, I think she's trying to capitalize.  You know?  And everyone  is picking up the rhetoric right now.  I went to Seattle, a city council  member said that I was a white supremacist.  You know?  And so, I think  it's frustrating because right now we have these politicians, they believe  it's okay to lie.  You know, we let them get away with it.  She's going to  make such a ridiculous lie.  </p><p>Like even the fact that I'm brown and she's going to say, I'm a white  supremacist.  And it's really frustrating, you know?  And you know what  she'd doing, she's making it more dangerous for San Francisco.  What she's  trying to do is she is trying to rile up the -- her citizens so that  they'll come down there and try to chase us out.  You know?  And she's  using that rhetoric.  And it is just going to cause more violence and it is  going to put people in danger.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Well, that's actually a really good point, and she's announced  publicly that your event is a white supremacist event.  And I'm sure that  there are a lot of organized lunatics who would go no matter what.  But  probably some people who are legitimately upset by that, they weren't  lunatics who saw what happened in Charlottesville, and they're going to  come down, too.  I mean, this does raise the chance that something awful  will happen.  Have you complained directly to her, to Nancy Pelosi about  this? </p><p>GIBSON:  We're working on it.  The thing is, she doesn't understand that  this rhetoric, like, it's just -- she's quadrupled the size of the rally.   You know, she's given us publicity but now she's going to quadruple the  size of the protesters.  And so, I don't know what she's thinking.  Like, I  don't understand her logic.  Because obviously they won't be able to pull  it.  But I really think that she's just trying to further her own agenda.  </p><p>You know, she feels like it's okay to lie and to be deceptive.  I mean, she  has a long history of lying.  And I just -- I don't get why San Francisco  puts up with that.  And the fact that really, she's not caring about her  citizens or San Francisco.  I mean, look at San Francisco.  Look how dirty,  look at the trash, look at the garbage.  Like she doesn't even take care of  her own people.  And now she is trying to make this more violent and more  dangerous.  </p><p>So, I don't know what she's thinking.  I don't know if she's trying to  provoke or she is trying to bring in racists or what.  But I'll tell you  this much.  I can give you my word that we're not going to allow any white  supremacists in.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p>GIBSON:  We're not going to allow any Nazis in.  In fact, our speakers will  be very upset, because they're all of color, if we have any Nazis or any  white supremacists in there.  I mean, how disappointed would you be if  you're a white supremacist and you go to a rally and there's only one white  person speaking.  </p><p>CARLSON:  It's unbelievable.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Good luck, Joey, great to see you.  </p><p>GIBSON:  Thank you.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Baltimore hastily tore down four confederate statues -- violence  and distraction in Charlottesville and Durham.  </p><p>Up next, we'll talk to a pastor who says all remaining confederate  memorials must be torn down.  </p><p>Also, Bill Kristol went after this show last night.  He declined to come on  to explain it but we'll tell what you he said.  Stay tuned.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Last night the top of the show, we addressed the removal of civil  war monuments from public places around the country.  We made the point  that the sudden outrage over confederate icons isn't entirely about slavery  horrifying as slavery is.  It's also part of a larger effort on the left to  discredit the founders of this country and the beliefs they enshrined in  law.  Once you believe that any figure in history who once owned slaves is  inherently illegitimate and should be erased, it's hard to take our  founding documents very seriously.  </p><p>How can you accept the bill of rights when it was written by slave owners?   Well, you can't.  Which is why so many on the left don't.  And ignore the  first and second amendments among many others.  That was the point we were  trying to make.  You may disagree with it but it didn't seem crazy or mean  spirited.  Here's the tweet that Bill Kristol, the former Weekly Standard  editor and contributor sent minutes later referring to our segment last  night.  </p><p>Quote, \"They started by rationalizing Trump.  They ended by rationalizing  slavery.\"  Rationalizing slavery?  That is not even close to what we were  saying by any interpretation.  What an outrageous thing to say.  But it got  worse.  Just minutes later, Kristol suggested, somehow we were anti-Semitic  too.  Here's a second tweet.  Quote, \"Next, Luther, Voltaire and Marx were  anti-Jewish.  So, why is it a big deal that the marchers were chanting  \"Jews will not replace us,\" end quote.  </p><p>Okay.  That is libel but it is also really stupid.  And yet, Bill Kristol  isn't stupid.  I know that because I worked for Bill Kristol for more than  five years in the 1990s, I knew him well.  He was a genuinely smart guy.   He's a good boss, too.  He was humane and fair-minded.  He was the kind of  person I never would imagine would write something that nasty and dishonest  about an enemy much less an old friend.  What happened?  </p><p>Well, Kristol refused to explain himself today.  We can only guess at that.   Part of the explanation has to be the moment that we're living in right now  where hysteria has supplanted rational debate.  Well, the purpose of  political argument is no longer to explain your beliefs but to highlight  what a morally upstanding person you are, a virtuous guy you are, using by  contrast of your opponent who is by definition evil.  It's childish,  obviously.  </p><p>But for many people, it's pretty tempting.  Even 64-year-old men with  Harvard degrees fall for it, apparently.  But part of the problem is also  the medium.  Twenty years ago when Bill Kristol had something to say, he  had a magazine to say it in.  He talked through ideas with his friends,  then he spent hours writing a piece that expressed its ideas precisely.   There was thinking involved in the process.  </p><p>Now, he just goes on Twitter and stays on Twitter all day every day.   Dashing off little thoughts and impressions, scoring tiny little points  against strangers in cyberspace, keeping obsessive track of his likes and  re-tweets.  At an age when he could be playing with his grandchildren,  Krystal is glued to social media like a slot machine junkie in Reno.  And  after a while, of course that distorts you.  </p><p>When disagree with someone, it doesn't occur to you to pick up the phone  and hash it out.  You tweet it hoping for re-tweets.  It's depressing as  hell.  Kristol isn't the only one who does this obviously.  Washington is  littered with formerly impressive people who now to shout and preen on  social media.  But I hate to see it with him.  I liked Bill Kristol once  and I thought he liked me.  What a shame.  </p><p>Well, after the weekend, violence in Charlottesville, several cities have  decided that they, too, are going to take down their monuments to the civil  war.  Baltimore hastily carried away four confederate monuments Wednesday  morning.  Lexington, Kentucky is hoping to do the same.  </p><p>The Reverend Jacques Degraff is a FOX News contributor.  He is a social  justice champion, he says.  And he supports removing all confederate  monuments.  Reverend Degraff joins us now.  Jacques, good to see you.   </p><p>REV. JACQUES DEGRAFF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you, Tucker.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, let me just say at the outset that I'm kind of sympathetic to  your point of view.  I mean, I wouldn't want to see something that offended  me every day, if there was an Al Sharpton monument in my street, Marion  Berry monument, I wouldn't like it.  So, I don't, you know, if you are  offended by these monuments, I totally get that.  But here's my question. </p><p>DEGRAFF:  It's not that I'm offended, it's an offense to the United States  of America to honor war criminals.  To honor those who were traitors.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, that's the standard.  I just want to know what the -- well,  they certainly were traitors of our country, they started their own  country.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  So, the combination, there's no country on the planet no,  society, that would honor those.  People with credentials like that.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Except ours, because it was a civil war.  And I agree with your  definition.  I mean, they were traitors to America.  But then they came  back into America.  They reintegrated into America.  That was the point.   The country broke.  And then it came back, absolutely and thank God they  did.  But it was a civil war, it wasn't like we were invaded.  And so, it's  a little bit more complicated than that.  But here is my question.  Does  your view of this apply to all slave holders or just civil war figures? </p><p>DEGRAFF:  It's not just civil war figures.  But civil war confederate  heroes and leaders are not to be honored in any shape, manner or form as a  societal imperative.  And the fact that we're coming to our senses with the  statues and with the stars and bars, the American swastika, they all must  fall.  We thought we had resolved this in Charlotte a couple of years ago.   It's still not resolved.  And so, we're moving expeditiously in every form  and fashion to complete the task over eradicating these symbols of hatred  and division.  Now, as to slave holders, to say the issue of slave holders.  </p><p>CARLSON:  One thing, just so you know, let me just inform you one thing.   And I'm not even arguing with you, I am just saying, one of the reasons  this hasn't been resolved is because the public is not for doing this.   Only a small minority, only about a quarter of people polled yesterday in  the United States thought that these monuments should come down.  Over 60  percent said, they should remain as historical remnants of an earlier age.   So like, you need to get the public onboard before you do this.  Would you  agree?</p><p>DEGRAFF:  Well, the height of the civil rights movement, there were a lot  of people that said, you need to go slow, you need to take your time, and  now the people who they were saying that to are American heroes.  So,  sometimes heroes, just like the people in the Boston Tea Party if you had  polled Boston, there would have been people who would say, why are you  throwing our tea in the harbor?  So, sometimes people --  </p><p>CARLSON:  Well, because it wasn't a democracy then.  Hold on.  It was not a  democracy.  Hold on!  No, no, no, no.  So you've given up on the idea of  representative government? </p><p>DEGRAFF:  No, I haven't given up on anything.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, you have.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  What I'm saying is --  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.</p><p>DEGRAFF:  I understand that some people who champion social justice get it  before the main society gets it.  Just as some people in the Republican  Party were slow to get their president as dysfunctional.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Let's get back to the question of slave holders,  though.  Because I think this isn't meaningful.  I think you make a more  defensible point on the civil war question.  But what bothers me about the  idea that all slave holders need to be erased from American history.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  I think the issue is not being erased from history.  It's being - -  </p><p>CARLSON:  What is the issue? </p><p>DEGRAFF: -- not celebrated.  If you put your name on a building you're  being celebrated.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.  Well, the city I live in is named after the founder of the  country, the first president, whose plantation which was populated by  slaves is right down the road at Mount Vernon.  So, I mean, this is not a  rhetorical question, it's a real question, should we change the name of the  capital of the country?  What should we do about George Washington? </p><p>George Washington is not like a confederate general.  George Washington is  the founder of a country and put his life on the line in order to do so.   He was a flawed human being but he created a great thing.  He was part of  the great creation that is self-perpetuating and self-correcting.  That's  what the process is about.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p>DEGRAFF:  And so, the fact is, that right now, we can get to George  Washington and Washington, D.C.  But right now we need to take care of  these confederate statues.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.  Let me just say, I don't want to get to Washington or  Washington, D.C.  I don't want to rewrite the history of this country.  I  like where you left off the first time, he redeemed himself by his good  deeds which he did.  </p><p>Reverend, thanks a lot for joining us.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Oregon has passed a law to give free abortions to everybody  including illegal aliens.  That's not insane or anything.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood wants to teach your five-year-old about  transgenderism.  Live Action Founder Lila Rose will be here to discuss  both.  We're not making that up, by the way.  So, stay tuned.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, the culture of death is on the march across American in the  world in case you haven't noticed.  In the state of Oregon, the Governor  just signed a bill ordering all insurance companies to provide free  abortions.  Also allocating state funds to ensure illegal aliens can get  abortions as well.  Because that will make the country better.  Meanwhile,  a new report from CBS News celebrates Iceland's near elimination of Down  Syndrome.  How did they pull off that miracle? </p><p>By killing any baby who had it through abortion.  And a new Planned  Parenthood pamphlet argues that children as young as four ought to be told  that men can get abortions too because, quote, \"your genitals don't make  you a boy or a girl.\"  Lila Rose constructed this staff for a living.  He  is the author and founder of Live Action for life group and she joins us  tonight.  </p><p>So, the Oregon abortion law, you know, no subject is more dishonestly  covered by the press than abortion, because 100 percent of people in the  press corps support it.  So, it's hard to get to know what is in a bill  like this.  Tell us what this bill says.  </p><p>LILA ROSE, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, LIVE ACTION:  Sure.  So, Tucker, this is  the most extreme state law on abortion that our country has seen.   Basically a completely Democratic-held government in Oregon has said that  abortions through all nine months, even sex selection abortions, no limit  whatsoever are now going to be paid for by taxpayers in Oregon.  And  insurance companies are going to be forced to fund it.  So, this could cost  over 3,000 lives, extra lives killed, children killed every year in Oregon  because of this extreme pro-abortion agenda held by the government in  Oregon.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, let me, because I'm a simple man, let me ask you a simple  question.  Sex selection abortions almost always reduce the number of  daughters born.  </p><p>ROSE:  Of girls.  </p><p>CARLSON:  They're performed in order to get a son.  Always.  How can  feminists be for that?  How can a feminist, you know, sworn to defend  women, support a sex selective abortion? </p><p>ROSE:  It's the height of hypocrisy, and it just shows that how out of  touch the so-called champions of many women are in this country.  In  reality, you have 100 million missing girls worldwide because of sex  selection abortions.  Search and destroy mission against girls in the womb.   And Oregon is now funding it.  Forcing taxpayers and insurance companies to  fund it, saying for whatever reason, you can have an abortion, through all  nine months, Tucker.  </p><p>Whether you're first trimester baby or your baby about to be born, you can  be killed in Oregon.  This is because our country has lost sight of what  science and reason tells us, which is that life in the womb has human  rights just like you or I do.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, CBS is pretty excited about this great medical advance in  Iceland where they somehow eliminated Down Syndrome?  Like how did they do  that? </p><p>ROSE:  It was not a medical breakthrough.  Iceland has championed the end  of Down Syndrome and Australia is talking about this as well, other  European countries.  They're not actually treating Down Syndrome, Tucker.   They are not actually helping people with disabilities.  They're killing  people with disabilities.  They're killing them off.  This is genocide.   And what message are we telling people with disabilities.  </p><p>What message does this send to those that have disabilities in our  communities?  It sends the message that we wish in Iceland or in Australia  or even in the United States, Down Syndrome children are targeted for  abortion.  It sends a message to them that your life doesn't matter, you  are not valuable.  It is exactly the wrong message to send.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  And there's no evidence at all that Down Syndrome causes  suffering for the person who's born with it.  I mean, right?  There's no --  Down Syndrome, people are people.  Happy people, actually.  </p><p>ROSE:  Well, I mean, exactly, Tucker.  You know, it's kind of besides the  point.  Because even if you have a disability and you have suffering, your  life still has meaning and you still have the right to life.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>ROSE:  So, suffering or no suffering, you're still worth protecting and  cherishing.  And looking to alleviate suffering instead of looking to kill.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  Lila Rose, thanks for joining us.  I appreciate it.   </p><p>ROSE:  Thank you, Tucker.  </p><p>CARLSON:  A documentary filmmaker says, John Kelly getting the chief-of- staff job at the White House could drive militarization on the U.S. border  and put the U.S. in a de facto war with Mexico.  That filmmaker got back  from the border, he join us next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  President Trump recently elevated Homeland Security Secretary  John Kelly to the post of chief-of-staff in the White House.  Critics of  border security say that's not a good thing.  </p><p>John Carlos Frey, the documentary filmmaker whose works include life and  death at the border.  In a recent interview with Democracy Now, he warned  that Kelly, a former general would help turn the border into a war zone and  exacerbate a, quote, \"culture of cruelty\" in American border enforcement.  </p><p>John Carlos Frey joins us tonight.  John Frey, thanks a lot for coming on.   So, what do you mean by this.  How will Kelly, as White House chief-of- staff, make the border patrol more militaristic?   </p><p>JOHN CARLOS FREY, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, MARSHALL PROJECT:  Well, I'm not  sure that I said that Kelly would make such things happen.  But what I did  say is that, having a militaristic approach at the border is what we've  been doing probably since 9/11 and that doesn't seem to be the most  effective strategy at least for my reporting.  We have unmanned drones that  fly over the U.S. Mexico border.  Today, we have over 700 miles of border  fencing.  </p><p>We have border patrol agents in the amount of over 20,000, and it seems to  be on the increase.  So, you know, we're talking about an issue of  migration.  We're talking about poverty, we're talking about people who are  suffering from violence south of the border.  A militaristic approach  doesn't seem at least from my reporting to be the most effective strategy.   Border security is important.  But it seems like that's all we're doing.   To put a general in charge of the U.S.-Mexico border might have a heavy- handed approach.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, I don't know that he's in charge of that necessarily as  chief of staff.  But a part of what you said, I agree --  </p><p>FREY:  Well, he was in charge at the Department of Homeland Security.   Right.  I mean, he was in charge of the Department of Homeland Security.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Now, he's not.  Right.  So, but I guess my question is, if what  we're doing isn't working and demonstrably it's not, and we have 11 or 12  million people here illegally who got over the border, what would work? </p><p>FREY:  Right.  Well, one of the things that we're not taking a look at is  the visa system.  Almost half of all the people who come to the United  States without papers come with an expired visa, overstay their visa, or  come into the United States and don't even cross that border.  So, you can  go ahead and build a border wall from sea to shining sea and build it 20  feet tall.  But people who come into the country legally, won't even cross  that barrier.  </p><p>So, we're not even taking a look at revamping the border system.  We're  also importing workers in the United States.  What about all of the  employers here in the United States?  Agriculture, and hospitality,  restaurants, I'm sure if you go to dinner tonight in Manhattan, there will  be undocumented people working in the kitchens.  So, what about the  employers who don't seem to be going after that?</p><p>CARLSON:  So, let me ask you a question though.  You're right.  Sure.  But  when, I think that is a fair point.  We are not going after them.  But when  did liberals become so sympathetic to employers in search of cheap labor?   I don't remember that as a teacher of American liberalism when I was a kid.   Like I interview these people all the time who say, you know, you can't be  against illegal immigration, because illegals made your dinner tonight.   And they never say, well, wait a second, maybe they made my dinner because  employers want to pay their workers less.  And this isn't an easy group of  people to exploit.  I would think liberals would be very against illegal  immigration.  </p><p>FREY:  I'm at least for my reporting, I'm not necessarily, you know, this  isn't for me, this isn't the Republican, Democrat, or liberal or  conservative issue here.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>FREY:  We're talking about a country that borders the United States, that  is poor for the most part, where governments are corrupt, if you go to  Central America.  And people are looking for a better life.  That's  migration.  That's what we have.  So, if all we do is we throw arms and  border walls and unmanned drones at this issue, we're not dealing with the  root cause which is the disparity between the two countries.  My reporting  is pretty clear in taking a look at why people come here.  And those are  the root causes that sort of bombastic rhetoric doesn't even seem to  address.  We're not going to solve the problem with the border wall.</p><p>CARLSON:  No, I think you're right.  No, but we're fixing that.  We're  fixing that.  Because thanks to immigration, parts of California are every  bit as poor as parts of Mexico now.  And so there's less of a disparity.  I  mean, parts of California really are like Mexico.  So, that will help solve  it, don't you think? </p><p>FREY:  Well, go a little further, Tucker.  I mean, California provides  about 80 percent of all of the produce for the rest of the nation.  And who  is harvesting that? </p><p>CARLSON:  That is right.  </p><p>FREY:  So, we're all benefitting from the benefits of illegal immigration.   Yes, what we're doing is building a border wall.  All you're going to do is  make it harder for people to come --  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARLSON:  I knew you were going to --  </p><p>FREY:  What? </p><p>CARLSON:  I knew you were going to defend employers exploiting cheap labor  at that point.  </p><p>FREY:  No, no, no.  I'm not defending employers at all.  I mean --</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, you are.  </p><p>FREY:  Agri-business is benefitting.  No, no, sir.  I mean, why doesn't the  administration take a look at the employers themselves?  Why don't we go  and take a look at the agri-business?  </p><p>CARLSON:  I agree, amen, now we're on the same page.   </p><p>FREY:  All right.  But where is that rhetoric, right? </p><p>CARLSON:  No, I agree.  I mean, look, John, we're out of time but I am  affirming you on that point, I agree with you 100 percent.  </p><p>FREY:  All right.  </p><p>CARLSON:  We should do that immediately.  </p><p>Thanks for coming on tonight, I appreciate it.  How much power does Google  have and how often are they abusing it?  </p><p>Up next, we'll talk to men who literally wrote the book on the question,  his conclusion you cannot trust Google.  And they say, don't be evil.  Huh!   You should laugh.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Welcome back.  We talked a lot about Google this week.  We  pointed out the danger of powerful tech companies.  And our basic freedoms  as exemplified by the fired Google engineer James Damore.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES DAMORE, FIRED GOOGLE ENGINEER:  There are current dogmas that you  really can't defend against at Google.  And one of them being that there's  any difference between people.  They just, the entire time, either just  called me names, shamed me, or just made broad generalizations saying that  what I was saying was pseudo-Science.  When, really, this is scientific  consensus.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Our next guest is an expert on the dangers of Google.  Scott  Cleland is the author of \"Search and Destroy: You Can't Trust Google Inc.\"   Probably not a more straightforward book title ever.  He runs the Watchdog  site Google Monitor which you can still find via Google for now anyway.   Scott joins us tonight.  </p><p>So, you can't trust Google.  This is something you've been on to for a  while.  The rest of us kind of stupidly believed the don't be evil  propaganda.  To what extent is Google driven by political ideology.   </p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, PUBLISHER OF GOOGLE MONITOR:  They're an exceptionally  political company.  And it just pervades everything they do.  And you know,  I think they're Utopians.  You know, tech Utopians who believe that, you  know, it would be best if we had all information and all power centralized  with a philosopher king as we know in history, where you know, one person  or group of people, the elites, know what's best.  And they subscribe to  that kind of tech Utopian political outlook.  And they have led their  business in that direction.  And succeeded in creating unimaginable  information power.  </p><p>CARLSON:  They're not liberals in the traditional sense in that they don't  believe that you should be able to talk, too.  I mean, there's an  authoritarian streak obviously.  We saw it in the firing of their software  engineer.  Do they enforce conformity in their business? </p><p>CLELAND:  Well, a lot of people don't join that don't fit to begin with.   So, what you're talking about, is a mono culture.  That is very much a tech  mono culture, which leans libertarian on some sides but very liberal on the  other.  But, you know, it is very, very political.  Where if you do not  agree, you don't fit in.  Now, that's true of coding and the coding class,  and of tech people, you know, that group tends to, I don't want to  generalize too much, but it tends to be very black and white.  It's binary,  like coding.  </p><p>It's a one or a zero.  And so, one of the reasons why you see the problem  with Mr. Damore and others, is that they don't see gray, they leap to  either a one or a zero.  Because that's what they do each day.  What they  do each day is very binary in the digital world.  </p><p>CARLSON:  People like that should not be in charge of all known information  in the English language.  They have so much power that I wonder, quickly,  if you think this can continue.  I mean, how long before they become a  rival to the U.S. government and they are broken up or nationalized or  regulated like a utility? </p><p>CLELAND:  It's great that you ask that question.  Because information is  power.  We know, you know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts  absolutely.  You know, I think it's Burke and Lord Acton told us that.  We  are probably on the scale of information is power of one being, you know,  power and 10 being information power, we're over seven, well on the way to  eight with Google.  And it's extraordinary.  </p><p>People can't imagine it, because these numbers are so big.  But they  literally have organized all the digital accessible information in the  world.  And I would say, like, you know, 80 or 90 percent of the stuff that  can be found, they found it.  Nobody else has the other stuff.  And so, it  is all on their servers.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  It's terrifying.  It's terrifying.  Scott, thank you for  that glimpse into it.  I'm going to buy your book.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>We will back in a minute with an update to a story brought to you earlier  this hour, the facts have changed on the ground already.  That is next.   Stay tuned.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Teleprompter.  We want to bring you an update on the San  Francisco rally that Nancy Pelosi said she wanted canceled because it was  white supremacist even though it turns out most of the speakers aren't  white.  Well, since the show started the Bay Area Park Services reacted to  our interview, we'll take credit of course for this.  </p><p>Their statement is this, from the head of the Park Service, they take very  seriously the concerns expressed by the public and elected officials  regarding the rally but they must be guided they say, by quote, \"the  constitution, the law, and long-standing court precedent.\"  The final  decision will be made in the next seven days, hopefully Nancy Pelosi will  not be able to bully them out of their right to assemble.  </p><p>That's it for us tonight, \"THE FIVE\" starts right now.  We'll see you  tomorrow.    </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The shock of what happened in Charlottesville over the weekend is  ringing in the air like a gunshot.  People in every side recognized it was  awful because it was awful.  Absolutely and completely.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The only thing that could make what happened in Charlottesville worse would  be if we allow a small number of people in power to make America less  tolerant and less free in its aftermath.  Let's be honest, we've seen that  before.  It happened after 9/11.  Almost nobody wanted to say so at the  time for fear of seeming sympathetic to terrorists but it did.  Secret  lists, massive government spying on citizens.  The Feds rooting around in  people's bank accounts for no good reason.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We allowed all of that to happen because we were upset and afraid.  Well,  this morning there were signs it could be happening again.  The Wall Street  Journal reported that big tech companies are using their power to silence  certain political views.  Both Google and web hosting service Go Daddy  stopped providing hosting support for Daily Stormer.  That is a white  supremacist website.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the hotel website Airbnb announced it will permanently ban white  supremacists from using its service to book rooms.  PayPal says, it won't  let white supremacists group used its payment platform.  Nobody on the show  was weeping for the Daily Stormer, even mentioning their name probably got  us written up by the Southern Poverty Law Center as dangerous alt-right  subversive or something.  We don't care.  </p><p>There's a principle at stake here and it is worth defending regardless.  We  should be very concerned by the prospect of big companies using their power  to enforce ideological conformity even when it seems only to affect people  we don't like as it does right now.  Especially now we should be concerned  because support for free expression appears to be fading on the left and  especially among young people.  </p><p>But 2015 Pew Poll found that 40 percent of millennials already believe in  restricting speech that they believe is offensive.  Those are the people  who are going to be running this world very soon.  You think they'll think  twice before banning websites they don't like?  They won't.  The Daily  Stormer today is fine.  But who is it going to be next week or next year,  the national right to life, FOXNews.com, Catholic charities?  Why wouldn't  it be?  And why wouldn't Airbnb ban public supporters of Trump from getting  rooms.  </p><p>They support terrorism.  Why wouldn't Facebook eliminate all references to,  I don't know, pro-life positions.  Today's political opponents could very  easily become tomorrow's designated Nazis or terrorists.  Definitions  change.  Principles do not change.  And that is way it's crucial to keep  fighting for them, keep fighting for an open society even if people call  you names when you do it.  </p><p>Now, the First Amendment is America's most famous freedom, the strongest  sign that our country is dedicated to the personal liberty of every person  here.  The fact that this right applies to the most hated members of  society isn't a weakness, it's the whole point.  It's proof of how robust  that right is.  Tech companies aren't the government and they're not bound  by the same rules as a consequence of that.  But that doesn't mean we  shouldn't push back and do it loudly.  </p><p>The biggest tech firms are more powerful than any monopolies in the gilded  age and they're far less restrained and far less trustworthy.  In some  ways, they're more dangerous even than overreaching government, because  they're less accountable.  They could make this country a place you would  not want to live.  And they could probably do it quickly and they probably  will do it unless they're brought to heel.  </p><p>Mark Steyn is an author, columnist and an all-around defender of freedom  and a good guy who is nice to sit in for this show last week.  He joins us  now.  </p><p>Mark, I'm positive that this segment is going to get us both written up by  the Southern Poverty Law Center.  I'm not defending any of these creepy  groups, this nationalist group or anything like that.  I'm not a part of  them and don't like them.  </p><p>MARK STEYN, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  But I think that your poll is worth defending, it's essential.   </p><p>STEYN:  Absolutely.  Freedom of speech enables you to argue for other  freedoms.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p>STEYN:  And that is the point of it.  If you don't have freedom of speech,  all can you do is, as they do in un-free societies, is blow things up and  shoot people.  And it is interesting to me, that the less freedom of speech  we have, the more we have what we saw over the weekend.  We have guys  rampaging through the street.  It doesn't really matter what side they're  on.  </p><p>The minute you say that you can't book a conference room and hold a debate,  you can't have a \"You Tube\" channel, you can't go on Facebook, then the  logic of that tends towards smashing stuff in the street, whether it's  toppling statues like the left did, or whether it's camping about with tiki  torches like the right did and rambling on about Jews and all the rest of  it.  That is why I'm --</p><p>CARLSON:  That is exactly right.   </p><p>STEYN:  This took place in conference centers.  And the other point you  made, Tucker, which is absolutely needs underlining, is that it always  starts off with the Daily Stormer.  But it goes further than that.  PayPal  for example kicked off V-Day.com.  V-Day.com has something to do with what  happened in Charlottesville, it is a website that is an immigration  restrictionist website.  </p><p>It thinks post 1965 immigration has been largely disastrous for the United  States.  And you can say that that is a wrong position to hold.  But you  are doing something very dangerous when you say you cannot hold that  position and use the main credit card processing service on the internet.   V-Day.com publishes Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin, who are no strangers  to this channel.  And so, there is something actually very disturbing when  PayPal boots them off what is essentially a monopoly provider.  </p><p>CARLSON:  I had no idea.  And that kind of is the point, it's a monopoly  provider as is Facebook, as is Google.  </p><p>STEYN:  Right.</p><p>CARLSON:  These are companies in American history and world history.  And  so, as a free market conservative for all of my life, I'm now beginning to  think, well, wait a second, do they have too much power?  Are they stifling  speech?  </p><p>STEYN:  I think what you said last night, Tucker, is absolutely right.  I  don't see why, if the United States government thinks in 1918 -- not 1918,  I think it's about ten years before that, 1909, whenever it was.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>STEYN:  Standard oil had gotten too big.  If standard oil was too big in  1909, yes, what is Google now?  And there's a difference.  The oil  companies, or MGM when they both made movies and owned cinemas, they're  basically in the movie business.  Standard oil is in the oil business.   Google is in the fourth business.  When you have someone who is actually in  control of ideas who knows the data of just about all seven billion people  on the planet, and it is enforcing an ideological straitjacket, that is far  more disturbing than if a standard oil or MGM are enforcing ideological  straitjackets.  </p><p>So, I actually think we're moving into a very dark era where \"You Tube\" and  Facebook and Twitter will bounce more and more people off their monopolies.   And that will lead to more violence in the street.  </p><p>CARLSON:  I'm afraid you're right.  If there were real liberals still stand  as there were in the progressive era, they would understand this.  But  liberals today so-called are on the side of the moguls, on the side of the  Facebook people, on the side of Jeff Bezos, have you noticed this? </p><p>STEYN:  Yes.  As recently as 10, 15 years ago they at least would pay lip  service to that apocryphal Voltaire quote that they didn't agree with what  you said, but they would defend to the death the right to say it.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>STEYN:  Now they will be out in the streets defending to the death, they're  right not to have to listen to it.  Nobody is asking them.  I don't want  anybody to defend me to the death or Daily Stormer to the death or V- Day.com to the death or any of them.  I don't even want to mildly  supportive tweet or Facebook post.  All I'm saying and you're saying is  that when we have monopoly providers, the idea that they can ideologically  constrain that content is very, very dangerous.  </p><p>CARLSON:  No, it's terrifying.  Thank you, Mark, for explaining that so  well.  I appreciate it.   </p><p>STEYN:  Thanks a lot, Tucker.  </p><p>CARLSON:  A group of Trump supporters is suing the city of San Jose,  California.  They're saying the city failed to keep them safe during a  Donald Trump rally in 2016.  Cops let the situation got out of control  letting protesters rob and assault Trump supporters outside the rally.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a country of about 350,000.  It has now  almost completely eliminated down syndrome birth since the test began in  the early 2000.  There are similar trends across Europe.  A stark contrast  --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, that was the wrong sound bite.  But we'll take you back to  the rally, at which one woman found herself pelted with eggs.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One young woman tried to take them on proudly showing  off her Trump shirt.  Then it is so scary, she's hit in the face with  watermelon and raw eggs.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh my God! </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She finds herself all alone in the corner.  The crowd  screaming obscenities and no one came to her aid.  Not even the cops.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Harmeet Dhillon is a lawyer and a committee woman for the  California RNC.  She is also representing some of the attendees at that  rally who say, they were jeopardized by the police absence.  She joins us  tonight.  </p><p>Harmeet, thanks a lot for coming on.  </p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, give us the account from the point of view of the Trump  supporters at this rally.  The police didn't protect them? </p><p>DHILLON:  Yes.  So, I was actually there, Tucker, I did the pledge of  allegiance at the Savannah, it was a great event in June last year.  And  then the police actually directed us there.  About 250 of them wearing riot  gear, to leave the event.  And they directed us directly into a full- fledged riot that was taking place outside the event.  And did not let  people go in a safer route or another route.  And so, what happened was, we  saw an assault on numerous individuals.  We have 17 named plaintiffs in the  case including Rachel Casey you saw there on the video.  </p><p>And the police made one arrest, and the one arrest was when one of these  criminals picked up a barricade and threw it at police.  They otherwise did  nothing to arrest anybody from teenagers who are our clients all the way to  people on their 70s.  It was an absolute travesty.  And so, we filed this  civil rights lawsuit against the city of Berkeley and the police there for  failing to honor the civil rights of the Trump attendees.  </p><p>And the civil rights include being able to attend a conservative event and  leave without being assaulted and subject to a riot.  And so, so far a case  is going on.  We survived a motion to dismiss.  The judge said that there  was not qualified immunity at this stage for the city.  And so, the city  has appealed that to the Ninth Circuit.  That's where we are in that case.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, what you're saying is something, anyone is paying attention,  recognizes.  There's a theme here.  And it seems like, correct me if I'm  being a conspiracy nut, that in certain places local politicians decide  they don't want to protect people they disagree with and so they don't.  Is  that what is happening? </p><p>DHILLON:  It's not a conspiracy, absolutely.  So, right after this event  where the whole country, like, the video you saw, saw criminals attacking  lawful citizens, the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, tweeted out that it  was Donald Trump's fault.  And we saw the exact same pattern in Berkeley  where I have also filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of  California, Berkeley, where Berkeley police have basically standing orders  to not protect people in a riot unless there is imminent death.  </p><p>And those are the actual orders of the Police Department and the mayor  there who is also a liberal and who is a supporter of black, you know, by  all means necessary and sympathizer of Black Lives Matter and other groups  like that.  And you know, what we saw in Charlottesville as well.  So, it  is a combination of a lack of will or an absolute hostility by the  political authorities in these cities coupled by fear of lawsuits.  </p><p>I mean, the Berkeley case, what happened was the occupy people filed a  lawsuit after being arrested in 2014.  And the city caved in and agreed  with them in a settlement agreement, that in the future they're not going  to get into it if you're having a liberal protest there, they're going to  let you do what you do.  And they're only going to intervene in case  somebody is about to be killed.  </p><p>So, I don't think citizens know that.  I don't think your average citizen  going about their business, an anti-fa gang  comes and starts throwing  things and starts swinging bats and poles and breaking into buildings that  the police are just going to stand there and watch you and do nothing.  But  we've seen that time and time again in the last year.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Well, when you politicize law enforcement, that's really the end  of civilization.  Thanks for fighting back against that.  Harmeet Dhillon,  thank you.</p><p>So, members of Congress are seizing on the events of last weekend to demand  a rollback of freedoms in this country.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  not surprisingly is at the forefront of that, just calling on the National  Park service to block a scheduled patriot prayer rally in San Francisco.   She calls it a white supremacist event that would promote violence.  </p><p>Joey Gibson would know because he is the rally's organizer and he joins us  tonight.  So, let's be totally honest with one another, Joey, I'm sure  you're going to be denounced as a white supremacist.  Everybody seems to be  now.  Are you a white supremacist and is this rally a white supremacist  rally? </p><p>JOEY GIBSON, PATRIOT PRAYER:  Absolutely not.  I'm not white.  We have  about eight speakers and only one speaker is white.  You know, we have a  couple of black speakers, Hispanic, we have a transsexual speaker, we have  a woman speaker, it's very diverse.  You know, it's really just about what  is on the inside.  You know, what you believe.  You know, your heart, your  soul has nothing to do with skin color.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, you're not only not white supremacists, you are not even  white.  I find hilarious.  I'm sorry to laugh because it's so lunatic that  the former speaker of the house is calling you and the people you're  speaking with white supremacists.  Again, when you aren't even white.  Why  do think she's saying that? </p><p>GIBSON:  Well, I think she's trying to capitalize.  You know?  And everyone  is picking up the rhetoric right now.  I went to Seattle, a city council  member said that I was a white supremacist.  You know?  And so, I think  it's frustrating because right now we have these politicians, they believe  it's okay to lie.  You know, we let them get away with it.  She's going to  make such a ridiculous lie.  </p><p>Like even the fact that I'm brown and she's going to say, I'm a white  supremacist.  And it's really frustrating, you know?  And you know what  she'd doing, she's making it more dangerous for San Francisco.  What she's  trying to do is she is trying to rile up the -- her citizens so that  they'll come down there and try to chase us out.  You know?  And she's  using that rhetoric.  And it is just going to cause more violence and it is  going to put people in danger.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Well, that's actually a really good point, and she's announced  publicly that your event is a white supremacist event.  And I'm sure that  there are a lot of organized lunatics who would go no matter what.  But  probably some people who are legitimately upset by that, they weren't  lunatics who saw what happened in Charlottesville, and they're going to  come down, too.  I mean, this does raise the chance that something awful  will happen.  Have you complained directly to her, to Nancy Pelosi about  this? </p><p>GIBSON:  We're working on it.  The thing is, she doesn't understand that  this rhetoric, like, it's just -- she's quadrupled the size of the rally.   You know, she's given us publicity but now she's going to quadruple the  size of the protesters.  And so, I don't know what she's thinking.  Like, I  don't understand her logic.  Because obviously they won't be able to pull  it.  But I really think that she's just trying to further her own agenda.  </p><p>You know, she feels like it's okay to lie and to be deceptive.  I mean, she  has a long history of lying.  And I just -- I don't get why San Francisco  puts up with that.  And the fact that really, she's not caring about her  citizens or San Francisco.  I mean, look at San Francisco.  Look how dirty,  look at the trash, look at the garbage.  Like she doesn't even take care of  her own people.  And now she is trying to make this more violent and more  dangerous.  </p><p>So, I don't know what she's thinking.  I don't know if she's trying to  provoke or she is trying to bring in racists or what.  But I'll tell you  this much.  I can give you my word that we're not going to allow any white  supremacists in.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p>GIBSON:  We're not going to allow any Nazis in.  In fact, our speakers will  be very upset, because they're all of color, if we have any Nazis or any  white supremacists in there.  I mean, how disappointed would you be if  you're a white supremacist and you go to a rally and there's only one white  person speaking.  </p><p>CARLSON:  It's unbelievable.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Good luck, Joey, great to see you.  </p><p>GIBSON:  Thank you.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Baltimore hastily tore down four confederate statues -- violence  and distraction in Charlottesville and Durham.  </p><p>Up next, we'll talk to a pastor who says all remaining confederate  memorials must be torn down.  </p><p>Also, Bill Kristol went after this show last night.  He declined to come on  to explain it but we'll tell what you he said.  Stay tuned.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Last night the top of the show, we addressed the removal of civil  war monuments from public places around the country.  We made the point  that the sudden outrage over confederate icons isn't entirely about slavery  horrifying as slavery is.  It's also part of a larger effort on the left to  discredit the founders of this country and the beliefs they enshrined in  law.  Once you believe that any figure in history who once owned slaves is  inherently illegitimate and should be erased, it's hard to take our  founding documents very seriously.  </p><p>How can you accept the bill of rights when it was written by slave owners?   Well, you can't.  Which is why so many on the left don't.  And ignore the  first and second amendments among many others.  That was the point we were  trying to make.  You may disagree with it but it didn't seem crazy or mean  spirited.  Here's the tweet that Bill Kristol, the former Weekly Standard  editor and contributor sent minutes later referring to our segment last  night.  </p><p>Quote, \"They started by rationalizing Trump.  They ended by rationalizing  slavery.\"  Rationalizing slavery?  That is not even close to what we were  saying by any interpretation.  What an outrageous thing to say.  But it got  worse.  Just minutes later, Kristol suggested, somehow we were anti-Semitic  too.  Here's a second tweet.  Quote, \"Next, Luther, Voltaire and Marx were  anti-Jewish.  So, why is it a big deal that the marchers were chanting  \"Jews will not replace us,\" end quote.  </p><p>Okay.  That is libel but it is also really stupid.  And yet, Bill Kristol  isn't stupid.  I know that because I worked for Bill Kristol for more than  five years in the 1990s, I knew him well.  He was a genuinely smart guy.   He's a good boss, too.  He was humane and fair-minded.  He was the kind of  person I never would imagine would write something that nasty and dishonest  about an enemy much less an old friend.  What happened?  </p><p>Well, Kristol refused to explain himself today.  We can only guess at that.   Part of the explanation has to be the moment that we're living in right now  where hysteria has supplanted rational debate.  Well, the purpose of  political argument is no longer to explain your beliefs but to highlight  what a morally upstanding person you are, a virtuous guy you are, using by  contrast of your opponent who is by definition evil.  It's childish,  obviously.  </p><p>But for many people, it's pretty tempting.  Even 64-year-old men with  Harvard degrees fall for it, apparently.  But part of the problem is also  the medium.  Twenty years ago when Bill Kristol had something to say, he  had a magazine to say it in.  He talked through ideas with his friends,  then he spent hours writing a piece that expressed its ideas precisely.   There was thinking involved in the process.  </p><p>Now, he just goes on Twitter and stays on Twitter all day every day.   Dashing off little thoughts and impressions, scoring tiny little points  against strangers in cyberspace, keeping obsessive track of his likes and  re-tweets.  At an age when he could be playing with his grandchildren,  Krystal is glued to social media like a slot machine junkie in Reno.  And  after a while, of course that distorts you.  </p><p>When disagree with someone, it doesn't occur to you to pick up the phone  and hash it out.  You tweet it hoping for re-tweets.  It's depressing as  hell.  Kristol isn't the only one who does this obviously.  Washington is  littered with formerly impressive people who now to shout and preen on  social media.  But I hate to see it with him.  I liked Bill Kristol once  and I thought he liked me.  What a shame.  </p><p>Well, after the weekend, violence in Charlottesville, several cities have  decided that they, too, are going to take down their monuments to the civil  war.  Baltimore hastily carried away four confederate monuments Wednesday  morning.  Lexington, Kentucky is hoping to do the same.  </p><p>The Reverend Jacques Degraff is a FOX News contributor.  He is a social  justice champion, he says.  And he supports removing all confederate  monuments.  Reverend Degraff joins us now.  Jacques, good to see you.   </p><p>REV. JACQUES DEGRAFF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you, Tucker.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, let me just say at the outset that I'm kind of sympathetic to  your point of view.  I mean, I wouldn't want to see something that offended  me every day, if there was an Al Sharpton monument in my street, Marion  Berry monument, I wouldn't like it.  So, I don't, you know, if you are  offended by these monuments, I totally get that.  But here's my question. </p><p>DEGRAFF:  It's not that I'm offended, it's an offense to the United States  of America to honor war criminals.  To honor those who were traitors.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, that's the standard.  I just want to know what the -- well,  they certainly were traitors of our country, they started their own  country.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  So, the combination, there's no country on the planet no,  society, that would honor those.  People with credentials like that.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Except ours, because it was a civil war.  And I agree with your  definition.  I mean, they were traitors to America.  But then they came  back into America.  They reintegrated into America.  That was the point.   The country broke.  And then it came back, absolutely and thank God they  did.  But it was a civil war, it wasn't like we were invaded.  And so, it's  a little bit more complicated than that.  But here is my question.  Does  your view of this apply to all slave holders or just civil war figures? </p><p>DEGRAFF:  It's not just civil war figures.  But civil war confederate  heroes and leaders are not to be honored in any shape, manner or form as a  societal imperative.  And the fact that we're coming to our senses with the  statues and with the stars and bars, the American swastika, they all must  fall.  We thought we had resolved this in Charlotte a couple of years ago.   It's still not resolved.  And so, we're moving expeditiously in every form  and fashion to complete the task over eradicating these symbols of hatred  and division.  Now, as to slave holders, to say the issue of slave holders.  </p><p>CARLSON:  One thing, just so you know, let me just inform you one thing.   And I'm not even arguing with you, I am just saying, one of the reasons  this hasn't been resolved is because the public is not for doing this.   Only a small minority, only about a quarter of people polled yesterday in  the United States thought that these monuments should come down.  Over 60  percent said, they should remain as historical remnants of an earlier age.   So like, you need to get the public onboard before you do this.  Would you  agree?</p><p>DEGRAFF:  Well, the height of the civil rights movement, there were a lot  of people that said, you need to go slow, you need to take your time, and  now the people who they were saying that to are American heroes.  So,  sometimes heroes, just like the people in the Boston Tea Party if you had  polled Boston, there would have been people who would say, why are you  throwing our tea in the harbor?  So, sometimes people --  </p><p>CARLSON:  Well, because it wasn't a democracy then.  Hold on.  It was not a  democracy.  Hold on!  No, no, no, no.  So you've given up on the idea of  representative government? </p><p>DEGRAFF:  No, I haven't given up on anything.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, you have.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  What I'm saying is --  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.</p><p>DEGRAFF:  I understand that some people who champion social justice get it  before the main society gets it.  Just as some people in the Republican  Party were slow to get their president as dysfunctional.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Let's get back to the question of slave holders,  though.  Because I think this isn't meaningful.  I think you make a more  defensible point on the civil war question.  But what bothers me about the  idea that all slave holders need to be erased from American history.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  I think the issue is not being erased from history.  It's being - -  </p><p>CARLSON:  What is the issue? </p><p>DEGRAFF: -- not celebrated.  If you put your name on a building you're  being celebrated.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.  Well, the city I live in is named after the founder of the  country, the first president, whose plantation which was populated by  slaves is right down the road at Mount Vernon.  So, I mean, this is not a  rhetorical question, it's a real question, should we change the name of the  capital of the country?  What should we do about George Washington? </p><p>George Washington is not like a confederate general.  George Washington is  the founder of a country and put his life on the line in order to do so.   He was a flawed human being but he created a great thing.  He was part of  the great creation that is self-perpetuating and self-correcting.  That's  what the process is about.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p>DEGRAFF:  And so, the fact is, that right now, we can get to George  Washington and Washington, D.C.  But right now we need to take care of  these confederate statues.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Okay.  Let me just say, I don't want to get to Washington or  Washington, D.C.  I don't want to rewrite the history of this country.  I  like where you left off the first time, he redeemed himself by his good  deeds which he did.  </p><p>Reverend, thanks a lot for joining us.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>DEGRAFF:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Oregon has passed a law to give free abortions to everybody  including illegal aliens.  That's not insane or anything.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood wants to teach your five-year-old about  transgenderism.  Live Action Founder Lila Rose will be here to discuss  both.  We're not making that up, by the way.  So, stay tuned.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, the culture of death is on the march across American in the  world in case you haven't noticed.  In the state of Oregon, the Governor  just signed a bill ordering all insurance companies to provide free  abortions.  Also allocating state funds to ensure illegal aliens can get  abortions as well.  Because that will make the country better.  Meanwhile,  a new report from CBS News celebrates Iceland's near elimination of Down  Syndrome.  How did they pull off that miracle? </p><p>By killing any baby who had it through abortion.  And a new Planned  Parenthood pamphlet argues that children as young as four ought to be told  that men can get abortions too because, quote, \"your genitals don't make  you a boy or a girl.\"  Lila Rose constructed this staff for a living.  He  is the author and founder of Live Action for life group and she joins us  tonight.  </p><p>So, the Oregon abortion law, you know, no subject is more dishonestly  covered by the press than abortion, because 100 percent of people in the  press corps support it.  So, it's hard to get to know what is in a bill  like this.  Tell us what this bill says.  </p><p>LILA ROSE, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, LIVE ACTION:  Sure.  So, Tucker, this is  the most extreme state law on abortion that our country has seen.   Basically a completely Democratic-held government in Oregon has said that  abortions through all nine months, even sex selection abortions, no limit  whatsoever are now going to be paid for by taxpayers in Oregon.  And  insurance companies are going to be forced to fund it.  So, this could cost  over 3,000 lives, extra lives killed, children killed every year in Oregon  because of this extreme pro-abortion agenda held by the government in  Oregon.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, let me, because I'm a simple man, let me ask you a simple  question.  Sex selection abortions almost always reduce the number of  daughters born.  </p><p>ROSE:  Of girls.  </p><p>CARLSON:  They're performed in order to get a son.  Always.  How can  feminists be for that?  How can a feminist, you know, sworn to defend  women, support a sex selective abortion? </p><p>ROSE:  It's the height of hypocrisy, and it just shows that how out of  touch the so-called champions of many women are in this country.  In  reality, you have 100 million missing girls worldwide because of sex  selection abortions.  Search and destroy mission against girls in the womb.   And Oregon is now funding it.  Forcing taxpayers and insurance companies to  fund it, saying for whatever reason, you can have an abortion, through all  nine months, Tucker.  </p><p>Whether you're first trimester baby or your baby about to be born, you can  be killed in Oregon.  This is because our country has lost sight of what  science and reason tells us, which is that life in the womb has human  rights just like you or I do.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, CBS is pretty excited about this great medical advance in  Iceland where they somehow eliminated Down Syndrome?  Like how did they do  that? </p><p>ROSE:  It was not a medical breakthrough.  Iceland has championed the end  of Down Syndrome and Australia is talking about this as well, other  European countries.  They're not actually treating Down Syndrome, Tucker.   They are not actually helping people with disabilities.  They're killing  people with disabilities.  They're killing them off.  This is genocide.   And what message are we telling people with disabilities.  </p><p>What message does this send to those that have disabilities in our  communities?  It sends the message that we wish in Iceland or in Australia  or even in the United States, Down Syndrome children are targeted for  abortion.  It sends a message to them that your life doesn't matter, you  are not valuable.  It is exactly the wrong message to send.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  And there's no evidence at all that Down Syndrome causes  suffering for the person who's born with it.  I mean, right?  There's no --  Down Syndrome, people are people.  Happy people, actually.  </p><p>ROSE:  Well, I mean, exactly, Tucker.  You know, it's kind of besides the  point.  Because even if you have a disability and you have suffering, your  life still has meaning and you still have the right to life.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>ROSE:  So, suffering or no suffering, you're still worth protecting and  cherishing.  And looking to alleviate suffering instead of looking to kill.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  Lila Rose, thanks for joining us.  I appreciate it.   </p><p>ROSE:  Thank you, Tucker.  </p><p>CARLSON:  A documentary filmmaker says, John Kelly getting the chief-of- staff job at the White House could drive militarization on the U.S. border  and put the U.S. in a de facto war with Mexico.  That filmmaker got back  from the border, he join us next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  President Trump recently elevated Homeland Security Secretary  John Kelly to the post of chief-of-staff in the White House.  Critics of  border security say that's not a good thing.  </p><p>John Carlos Frey, the documentary filmmaker whose works include life and  death at the border.  In a recent interview with Democracy Now, he warned  that Kelly, a former general would help turn the border into a war zone and  exacerbate a, quote, \"culture of cruelty\" in American border enforcement.  </p><p>John Carlos Frey joins us tonight.  John Frey, thanks a lot for coming on.   So, what do you mean by this.  How will Kelly, as White House chief-of- staff, make the border patrol more militaristic?   </p><p>JOHN CARLOS FREY, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, MARSHALL PROJECT:  Well, I'm not  sure that I said that Kelly would make such things happen.  But what I did  say is that, having a militaristic approach at the border is what we've  been doing probably since 9/11 and that doesn't seem to be the most  effective strategy at least for my reporting.  We have unmanned drones that  fly over the U.S. Mexico border.  Today, we have over 700 miles of border  fencing.  </p><p>We have border patrol agents in the amount of over 20,000, and it seems to  be on the increase.  So, you know, we're talking about an issue of  migration.  We're talking about poverty, we're talking about people who are  suffering from violence south of the border.  A militaristic approach  doesn't seem at least from my reporting to be the most effective strategy.   Border security is important.  But it seems like that's all we're doing.   To put a general in charge of the U.S.-Mexico border might have a heavy- handed approach.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, I don't know that he's in charge of that necessarily as  chief of staff.  But a part of what you said, I agree --  </p><p>FREY:  Well, he was in charge at the Department of Homeland Security.   Right.  I mean, he was in charge of the Department of Homeland Security.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Now, he's not.  Right.  So, but I guess my question is, if what  we're doing isn't working and demonstrably it's not, and we have 11 or 12  million people here illegally who got over the border, what would work? </p><p>FREY:  Right.  Well, one of the things that we're not taking a look at is  the visa system.  Almost half of all the people who come to the United  States without papers come with an expired visa, overstay their visa, or  come into the United States and don't even cross that border.  So, you can  go ahead and build a border wall from sea to shining sea and build it 20  feet tall.  But people who come into the country legally, won't even cross  that barrier.  </p><p>So, we're not even taking a look at revamping the border system.  We're  also importing workers in the United States.  What about all of the  employers here in the United States?  Agriculture, and hospitality,  restaurants, I'm sure if you go to dinner tonight in Manhattan, there will  be undocumented people working in the kitchens.  So, what about the  employers who don't seem to be going after that?</p><p>CARLSON:  So, let me ask you a question though.  You're right.  Sure.  But  when, I think that is a fair point.  We are not going after them.  But when  did liberals become so sympathetic to employers in search of cheap labor?   I don't remember that as a teacher of American liberalism when I was a kid.   Like I interview these people all the time who say, you know, you can't be  against illegal immigration, because illegals made your dinner tonight.   And they never say, well, wait a second, maybe they made my dinner because  employers want to pay their workers less.  And this isn't an easy group of  people to exploit.  I would think liberals would be very against illegal  immigration.  </p><p>FREY:  I'm at least for my reporting, I'm not necessarily, you know, this  isn't for me, this isn't the Republican, Democrat, or liberal or  conservative issue here.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>FREY:  We're talking about a country that borders the United States, that  is poor for the most part, where governments are corrupt, if you go to  Central America.  And people are looking for a better life.  That's  migration.  That's what we have.  So, if all we do is we throw arms and  border walls and unmanned drones at this issue, we're not dealing with the  root cause which is the disparity between the two countries.  My reporting  is pretty clear in taking a look at why people come here.  And those are  the root causes that sort of bombastic rhetoric doesn't even seem to  address.  We're not going to solve the problem with the border wall.</p><p>CARLSON:  No, I think you're right.  No, but we're fixing that.  We're  fixing that.  Because thanks to immigration, parts of California are every  bit as poor as parts of Mexico now.  And so there's less of a disparity.  I  mean, parts of California really are like Mexico.  So, that will help solve  it, don't you think? </p><p>FREY:  Well, go a little further, Tucker.  I mean, California provides  about 80 percent of all of the produce for the rest of the nation.  And who  is harvesting that? </p><p>CARLSON:  That is right.  </p><p>FREY:  So, we're all benefitting from the benefits of illegal immigration.   Yes, what we're doing is building a border wall.  All you're going to do is  make it harder for people to come --  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARLSON:  I knew you were going to --  </p><p>FREY:  What? </p><p>CARLSON:  I knew you were going to defend employers exploiting cheap labor  at that point.  </p><p>FREY:  No, no, no.  I'm not defending employers at all.  I mean --</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, you are.  </p><p>FREY:  Agri-business is benefitting.  No, no, sir.  I mean, why doesn't the  administration take a look at the employers themselves?  Why don't we go  and take a look at the agri-business?  </p><p>CARLSON:  I agree, amen, now we're on the same page.   </p><p>FREY:  All right.  But where is that rhetoric, right? </p><p>CARLSON:  No, I agree.  I mean, look, John, we're out of time but I am  affirming you on that point, I agree with you 100 percent.  </p><p>FREY:  All right.  </p><p>CARLSON:  We should do that immediately.  </p><p>Thanks for coming on tonight, I appreciate it.  How much power does Google  have and how often are they abusing it?  </p><p>Up next, we'll talk to men who literally wrote the book on the question,  his conclusion you cannot trust Google.  And they say, don't be evil.  Huh!   You should laugh.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Welcome back.  We talked a lot about Google this week.  We  pointed out the danger of powerful tech companies.  And our basic freedoms  as exemplified by the fired Google engineer James Damore.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES DAMORE, FIRED GOOGLE ENGINEER:  There are current dogmas that you  really can't defend against at Google.  And one of them being that there's  any difference between people.  They just, the entire time, either just  called me names, shamed me, or just made broad generalizations saying that  what I was saying was pseudo-Science.  When, really, this is scientific  consensus.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Our next guest is an expert on the dangers of Google.  Scott  Cleland is the author of \"Search and Destroy: You Can't Trust Google Inc.\"   Probably not a more straightforward book title ever.  He runs the Watchdog  site Google Monitor which you can still find via Google for now anyway.   Scott joins us tonight.  </p><p>So, you can't trust Google.  This is something you've been on to for a  while.  The rest of us kind of stupidly believed the don't be evil  propaganda.  To what extent is Google driven by political ideology.   </p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, PUBLISHER OF GOOGLE MONITOR:  They're an exceptionally  political company.  And it just pervades everything they do.  And you know,  I think they're Utopians.  You know, tech Utopians who believe that, you  know, it would be best if we had all information and all power centralized  with a philosopher king as we know in history, where you know, one person  or group of people, the elites, know what's best.  And they subscribe to  that kind of tech Utopian political outlook.  And they have led their  business in that direction.  And succeeded in creating unimaginable  information power.  </p><p>CARLSON:  They're not liberals in the traditional sense in that they don't  believe that you should be able to talk, too.  I mean, there's an  authoritarian streak obviously.  We saw it in the firing of their software  engineer.  Do they enforce conformity in their business? </p><p>CLELAND:  Well, a lot of people don't join that don't fit to begin with.   So, what you're talking about, is a mono culture.  That is very much a tech  mono culture, which leans libertarian on some sides but very liberal on the  other.  But, you know, it is very, very political.  Where if you do not  agree, you don't fit in.  Now, that's true of coding and the coding class,  and of tech people, you know, that group tends to, I don't want to  generalize too much, but it tends to be very black and white.  It's binary,  like coding.  </p><p>It's a one or a zero.  And so, one of the reasons why you see the problem  with Mr. Damore and others, is that they don't see gray, they leap to  either a one or a zero.  Because that's what they do each day.  What they  do each day is very binary in the digital world.  </p><p>CARLSON:  People like that should not be in charge of all known information  in the English language.  They have so much power that I wonder, quickly,  if you think this can continue.  I mean, how long before they become a  rival to the U.S. government and they are broken up or nationalized or  regulated like a utility? </p><p>CLELAND:  It's great that you ask that question.  Because information is  power.  We know, you know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts  absolutely.  You know, I think it's Burke and Lord Acton told us that.  We  are probably on the scale of information is power of one being, you know,  power and 10 being information power, we're over seven, well on the way to  eight with Google.  And it's extraordinary.  </p><p>People can't imagine it, because these numbers are so big.  But they  literally have organized all the digital accessible information in the  world.  And I would say, like, you know, 80 or 90 percent of the stuff that  can be found, they found it.  Nobody else has the other stuff.  And so, it  is all on their servers.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  It's terrifying.  It's terrifying.  Scott, thank you for  that glimpse into it.  I'm going to buy your book.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>We will back in a minute with an update to a story brought to you earlier  this hour, the facts have changed on the ground already.  That is next.   Stay tuned.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Teleprompter.  We want to bring you an update on the San  Francisco rally that Nancy Pelosi said she wanted canceled because it was  white supremacist even though it turns out most of the speakers aren't  white.  Well, since the show started the Bay Area Park Services reacted to  our interview, we'll take credit of course for this.  </p><p>Their statement is this, from the head of the Park Service, they take very  seriously the concerns expressed by the public and elected officials  regarding the rally but they must be guided they say, by quote, \"the  constitution, the law, and long-standing court precedent.\"  The final  decision will be made in the next seven days, hopefully Nancy Pelosi will  not be able to bully them out of their right to assemble.  </p><p>That's it for us tonight, \"THE FIVE\" starts right now.  We'll see you  tomorrow.    </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The shock of what happened in Charlottesville over the weekend is ringing in the air like a gunshot. People in every side recognized it was awful because it was awful. Absolutely and completely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The only thing that could make what happened in Charlottesville worse would be if we allow a small number of people in power to make America less tolerant and less free in its aftermath. Let's be honest, we've seen that before. It happened after 9/11. Almost nobody wanted to say so at the time for fear of seeming sympathetic to terrorists but it did. Secret lists, massive government spying on citizens. The Feds rooting around in people's bank accounts for no good reason.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We allowed all of that to happen because we were upset and afraid. Well, this morning there were signs it could be happening again. The Wall Street Journal reported that big tech companies are using their power to silence certain political views. Both Google and web hosting service Go Daddy stopped providing hosting support for Daily Stormer. That is a white supremacist website.</p><p>Meanwhile, the hotel website Airbnb announced it will permanently ban white supremacists from using its service to book rooms. PayPal says, it won't let white supremacists group used its payment platform. Nobody on the show was weeping for the Daily Stormer, even mentioning their name probably got us written up by the Southern Poverty Law Center as dangerous alt-right subversive or something. We don't care.</p><p>There's a principle at stake here and it is worth defending regardless. We should be very concerned by the prospect of big companies using their power to enforce ideological conformity even when it seems only to affect people we don't like as it does right now. Especially now we should be concerned because support for free expression appears to be fading on the left and especially among young people.</p><p>But 2015 Pew Poll found that 40 percent of millennials already believe in restricting speech that they believe is offensive. Those are the people who are going to be running this world very soon. You think they'll think twice before banning websites they don't like? They won't. The Daily Stormer today is fine. But who is it going to be next week or next year, the national right to life, FOXNews.com, Catholic charities? Why wouldn't it be? And why wouldn't Airbnb ban public supporters of Trump from getting rooms.</p><p>They support terrorism. Why wouldn't Facebook eliminate all references to, I don't know, pro-life positions. Today's political opponents could very easily become tomorrow's designated Nazis or terrorists. Definitions change. Principles do not change. And that is way it's crucial to keep fighting for them, keep fighting for an open society even if people call you names when you do it.</p><p>Now, the First Amendment is America's most famous freedom, the strongest sign that our country is dedicated to the personal liberty of every person here. The fact that this right applies to the most hated members of society isn't a weakness, it's the whole point. It's proof of how robust that right is. Tech companies aren't the government and they're not bound by the same rules as a consequence of that. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't push back and do it loudly.</p><p>The biggest tech firms are more powerful than any monopolies in the gilded age and they're far less restrained and far less trustworthy. In some ways, they're more dangerous even than overreaching government, because they're less accountable. They could make this country a place you would not want to live. And they could probably do it quickly and they probably will do it unless they're brought to heel.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an author, columnist and an all-around defender of freedom and a good guy who is nice to sit in for this show last week. He joins us now.</p><p>Mark, I'm positive that this segment is going to get us both written up by the Southern Poverty Law Center. I'm not defending any of these creepy groups, this nationalist group or anything like that. I'm not a part of them and don't like them.</p><p>MARK STEYN, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But I think that your poll is worth defending, it's essential.</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely. Freedom of speech enables you to argue for other freedoms.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: And that is the point of it. If you don't have freedom of speech, all can you do is, as they do in un-free societies, is blow things up and shoot people. And it is interesting to me, that the less freedom of speech we have, the more we have what we saw over the weekend. We have guys rampaging through the street. It doesn't really matter what side they're on.</p><p>The minute you say that you can't book a conference room and hold a debate, you can't have a \"You Tube\" channel, you can't go on Facebook, then the logic of that tends towards smashing stuff in the street, whether it's toppling statues like the left did, or whether it's camping about with tiki torches like the right did and rambling on about Jews and all the rest of it. That is why I'm --</p><p>CARLSON: That is exactly right.</p><p>STEYN: This took place in conference centers. And the other point you made, Tucker, which is absolutely needs underlining, is that it always starts off with the Daily Stormer. But it goes further than that. PayPal for example kicked off V-Day.com. V-Day.com has something to do with what happened in Charlottesville, it is a website that is an immigration restrictionist website.</p><p>It thinks post 1965 immigration has been largely disastrous for the United States. And you can say that that is a wrong position to hold. But you are doing something very dangerous when you say you cannot hold that position and use the main credit card processing service on the internet. V-Day.com publishes Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin, who are no strangers to this channel. And so, there is something actually very disturbing when PayPal boots them off what is essentially a monopoly provider.</p><p>CARLSON: I had no idea. And that kind of is the point, it's a monopoly provider as is Facebook, as is Google.</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: These are companies in American history and world history. And so, as a free market conservative for all of my life, I'm now beginning to think, well, wait a second, do they have too much power? Are they stifling speech?</p><p>STEYN: I think what you said last night, Tucker, is absolutely right. I don't see why, if the United States government thinks in 1918 -- not 1918, I think it's about ten years before that, 1909, whenever it was.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: Standard oil had gotten too big. If standard oil was too big in 1909, yes, what is Google now? And there's a difference. The oil companies, or MGM when they both made movies and owned cinemas, they're basically in the movie business. Standard oil is in the oil business. Google is in the fourth business. When you have someone who is actually in control of ideas who knows the data of just about all seven billion people on the planet, and it is enforcing an ideological straitjacket, that is far more disturbing than if a standard oil or MGM are enforcing ideological straitjackets.</p><p>So, I actually think we're moving into a very dark era where \"You Tube\" and Facebook and Twitter will bounce more and more people off their monopolies. And that will lead to more violence in the street.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm afraid you're right. If there were real liberals still stand as there were in the progressive era, they would understand this. But liberals today so-called are on the side of the moguls, on the side of the Facebook people, on the side of Jeff Bezos, have you noticed this?</p><p>STEYN: Yes. As recently as 10, 15 years ago they at least would pay lip service to that apocryphal Voltaire quote that they didn't agree with what you said, but they would defend to the death the right to say it.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: Now they will be out in the streets defending to the death, they're right not to have to listen to it. Nobody is asking them. I don't want anybody to defend me to the death or Daily Stormer to the death or V- Day.com to the death or any of them. I don't even want to mildly supportive tweet or Facebook post. All I'm saying and you're saying is that when we have monopoly providers, the idea that they can ideologically constrain that content is very, very dangerous.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's terrifying. Thank you, Mark, for explaining that so well. I appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: A group of Trump supporters is suing the city of San Jose, California. They're saying the city failed to keep them safe during a <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>rally in 2016. Cops let the situation got out of control letting protesters rob and assault Trump supporters outside the rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a country of about 350,000. It has now almost completely eliminated down syndrome birth since the test began in the early 2000. There are similar trends across Europe. A stark contrast --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that was the wrong sound bite. But we'll take you back to the rally, at which one woman found herself pelted with eggs. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One young woman tried to take them on proudly showing off her Trump shirt. Then it is so scary, she's hit in the face with watermelon and raw eggs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my God!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She finds herself all alone in the corner. The crowd screaming obscenities and no one came to her aid. Not even the cops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon is a lawyer and a committee woman for the California RNC. She is also representing some of the attendees at that rally who say, they were jeopardized by the police absence. She joins us tonight.</p><p>Harmeet, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, give us the account from the point of view of the Trump supporters at this rally. The police didn't protect them?</p><p>DHILLON: Yes. So, I was actually there, Tucker, I did the pledge of allegiance at the Savannah, it was a great event in June last year. And then the police actually directed us there. About 250 of them wearing riot gear, to leave the event. And they directed us directly into a full- fledged riot that was taking place outside the event. And did not let people go in a safer route or another route. And so, what happened was, we saw an assault on numerous individuals. We have 17 named plaintiffs in the case including Rachel Casey you saw there on the video.</p><p>And the police made one arrest, and the one arrest was when one of these criminals picked up a barricade and threw it at police. They otherwise did nothing to arrest anybody from teenagers who are our clients all the way to people on their 70s. It was an absolute travesty. And so, we filed this civil rights lawsuit against the city of Berkeley and the police there for failing to honor the civil rights of the Trump attendees.</p><p>And the civil rights include being able to attend a conservative event and leave without being assaulted and subject to a riot. And so, so far a case is going on. We survived a motion to dismiss. The judge said that there was not qualified immunity at this stage for the city. And so, the city has appealed that to the Ninth Circuit. That's where we are in that case.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what you're saying is something, anyone is paying attention, recognizes. There's a theme here. And it seems like, correct me if I'm being a conspiracy nut, that in certain places local politicians decide they don't want to protect people they disagree with and so they don't. Is that what is happening?</p><p>DHILLON: It's not a conspiracy, absolutely. So, right after this event where the whole country, like, the video you saw, saw criminals attacking lawful citizens, the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, tweeted out that it was <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>fault. And we saw the exact same pattern in Berkeley where I have also filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of California, Berkeley, where Berkeley police have basically standing orders to not protect people in a riot unless there is imminent death.</p><p>And those are the actual orders of the Police Department and the mayor there who is also a liberal and who is a supporter of black, you know, by all means necessary and sympathizer of Black Lives Matter and other groups like that. And you know, what we saw in Charlottesville as well. So, it is a combination of a lack of will or an absolute hostility by the political authorities in these cities coupled by fear of lawsuits.</p><p>I mean, the Berkeley case, what happened was the occupy people filed a lawsuit after being arrested in 2014. And the city caved in and agreed with them in a settlement agreement, that in the future they're not going to get into it if you're having a liberal protest there, they're going to let you do what you do. And they're only going to intervene in case somebody is about to be killed.</p><p>So, I don't think citizens know that. I don't think your average citizen going about their business, an anti-fa gang comes and starts throwing things and starts swinging bats and poles and breaking into buildings that the police are just going to stand there and watch you and do nothing. But we've seen that time and time again in the last year.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, when you politicize law enforcement, that's really the end of civilization. Thanks for fighting back against that. Harmeet Dhillon, thank you.</p><p>So, members of Congress are seizing on the events of last weekend to demand a rollback of freedoms in this country. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi not surprisingly is at the forefront of that, just calling on the National Park service to block a scheduled patriot prayer rally in San Francisco. She calls it a white supremacist event that would promote violence.</p><p>Joey Gibson would know because he is the rally's organizer and he joins us tonight. So, let's be totally honest with one another, Joey, I'm sure you're going to be denounced as a white supremacist. Everybody seems to be now. Are you a white supremacist and is this rally a white supremacist rally?</p><p>JOEY GIBSON, PATRIOT PRAYER: Absolutely not. I'm not white. We have about eight speakers and only one speaker is white. You know, we have a couple of black speakers, Hispanic, we have a transsexual speaker, we have a woman speaker, it's very diverse. You know, it's really just about what is on the inside. You know, what you believe. You know, your heart, your soul has nothing to do with skin color.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you're not only not white supremacists, you are not even white. I find hilarious. I'm sorry to laugh because it's so lunatic that the former speaker of the house is calling you and the people you're speaking with white supremacists. Again, when you aren't even white. Why do think she's saying that?</p><p>GIBSON: Well, I think she's trying to capitalize. You know? And everyone is picking up the rhetoric right now. I went to Seattle, a city council member said that I was a white supremacist. You know? And so, I think it's frustrating because right now we have these politicians, they believe it's okay to lie. You know, we let them get away with it. She's going to make such a ridiculous lie.</p><p>Like even the fact that I'm brown and she's going to say, I'm a white supremacist. And it's really frustrating, you know? And you know what she'd doing, she's making it more dangerous for San Francisco. What she's trying to do is she is trying to rile up the -- her citizens so that they'll come down there and try to chase us out. You know? And she's using that rhetoric. And it is just going to cause more violence and it is going to put people in danger.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's actually a really good point, and she's announced publicly that your event is a white supremacist event. And I'm sure that there are a lot of organized lunatics who would go no matter what. But probably some people who are legitimately upset by that, they weren't lunatics who saw what happened in Charlottesville, and they're going to come down, too. I mean, this does raise the chance that something awful will happen. Have you complained directly to her, to Nancy Pelosi about this?</p><p>GIBSON: We're working on it. The thing is, she doesn't understand that this rhetoric, like, it's just -- she's quadrupled the size of the rally. You know, she's given us publicity but now she's going to quadruple the size of the protesters. And so, I don't know what she's thinking. Like, I don't understand her logic. Because obviously they won't be able to pull it. But I really think that she's just trying to further her own agenda.</p><p>You know, she feels like it's okay to lie and to be deceptive. I mean, she has a long history of lying. And I just -- I don't get why San Francisco puts up with that. And the fact that really, she's not caring about her citizens or San Francisco. I mean, look at San Francisco. Look how dirty, look at the trash, look at the garbage. Like she doesn't even take care of her own people. And now she is trying to make this more violent and more dangerous.</p><p>So, I don't know what she's thinking. I don't know if she's trying to provoke or she is trying to bring in racists or what. But I'll tell you this much. I can give you my word that we're not going to allow any white supremacists in.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GIBSON: We're not going to allow any Nazis in. In fact, our speakers will be very upset, because they're all of color, if we have any Nazis or any white supremacists in there. I mean, how disappointed would you be if you're a white supremacist and you go to a rally and there's only one white person speaking.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Good luck, Joey, great to see you.</p><p>GIBSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Baltimore hastily tore down four confederate statues -- violence and distraction in Charlottesville and Durham.</p><p>Up next, we'll talk to a pastor who says all remaining confederate memorials must be torn down.</p><p>Also, Bill Kristol went after this show last night. He declined to come on to explain it but we'll tell what you he said. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Last night the top of the show, we addressed the removal of civil war monuments from public places around the country. We made the point that the sudden outrage over confederate icons isn't entirely about slavery horrifying as slavery is. It's also part of a larger effort on the left to discredit the founders of this country and the beliefs they enshrined in law. Once you believe that any figure in history who once owned slaves is inherently illegitimate and should be erased, it's hard to take our founding documents very seriously.</p><p>How can you accept the bill of rights when it was written by slave owners? Well, you can't. Which is why so many on the left don't. And ignore the first and second amendments among many others. That was the point we were trying to make. You may disagree with it but it didn't seem crazy or mean spirited. Here's the tweet that Bill Kristol, the former Weekly Standard editor and contributor sent minutes later referring to our segment last night.</p><p>Quote, \"They started by rationalizing Trump. They ended by rationalizing slavery.\" Rationalizing slavery? That is not even close to what we were saying by any interpretation. What an outrageous thing to say. But it got worse. Just minutes later, Kristol suggested, somehow we were anti-Semitic too. Here's a second tweet. Quote, \"Next, Luther, Voltaire and Marx were anti-Jewish. So, why is it a big deal that the marchers were chanting \"Jews will not replace us,\" end quote.</p><p>Okay. That is libel but it is also really stupid. And yet, Bill Kristol isn't stupid. I know that because I worked for Bill Kristol for more than five years in the 1990s, I knew him well. He was a genuinely smart guy. He's a good boss, too. He was humane and fair-minded. He was the kind of person I never would imagine would write something that nasty and dishonest about an enemy much less an old friend. What happened?</p><p>Well, Kristol refused to explain himself today. We can only guess at that. Part of the explanation has to be the moment that we're living in right now where hysteria has supplanted rational debate. Well, the purpose of political argument is no longer to explain your beliefs but to highlight what a morally upstanding person you are, a virtuous guy you are, using by contrast of your opponent who is by definition evil. It's childish, obviously.</p><p>But for many people, it's pretty tempting. Even 64-year-old men with Harvard degrees fall for it, apparently. But part of the problem is also the medium. Twenty years ago when Bill Kristol had something to say, he had a magazine to say it in. He talked through ideas with his friends, then he spent hours writing a piece that expressed its ideas precisely. There was thinking involved in the process.</p><p>Now, he just goes on Twitter and stays on Twitter all day every day. Dashing off little thoughts and impressions, scoring tiny little points against strangers in cyberspace, keeping obsessive track of his likes and re-tweets. At an age when he could be playing with his grandchildren, Krystal is glued to social media like a slot machine junkie in Reno. And after a while, of course that distorts you.</p><p>When disagree with someone, it doesn't occur to you to pick up the phone and hash it out. You tweet it hoping for re-tweets. It's depressing as hell. Kristol isn't the only one who does this obviously. Washington is littered with formerly impressive people who now to shout and preen on social media. But I hate to see it with him. I liked Bill Kristol once and I thought he liked me. What a shame.</p><p>Well, after the weekend, violence in Charlottesville, several cities have decided that they, too, are going to take down their monuments to the civil war. Baltimore hastily carried away four confederate monuments Wednesday morning. Lexington, Kentucky is hoping to do the same.</p><p>The Reverend Jacques Degraff is a <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>contributor. He is a social justice champion, he says. And he supports removing all confederate monuments. Reverend Degraff joins us now. Jacques, good to see you.</p><p>REV. JACQUES DEGRAFF, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, let me just say at the outset that I'm kind of sympathetic to your point of view. I mean, I wouldn't want to see something that offended me every day, if there was an Al Sharpton monument in my street, Marion Berry monument, I wouldn't like it. So, I don't, you know, if you are offended by these monuments, I totally get that. But here's my question.</p><p>DEGRAFF: It's not that I'm offended, it's an offense to the United States of America to honor war criminals. To honor those who were traitors.</p><p>CARLSON: So, that's the standard. I just want to know what the -- well, they certainly were traitors of our country, they started their own country.</p><p>DEGRAFF: So, the combination, there's no country on the planet no, society, that would honor those. People with credentials like that.</p><p>CARLSON: Except ours, because it was a civil war. And I agree with your definition. I mean, they were traitors to America. But then they came back into America. They reintegrated into America. That was the point. The country broke. And then it came back, absolutely and thank God they did. But it was a civil war, it wasn't like we were invaded. And so, it's a little bit more complicated than that. But here is my question. Does your view of this apply to all slave holders or just civil war figures?</p><p>DEGRAFF: It's not just civil war figures. But civil war confederate heroes and leaders are not to be honored in any shape, manner or form as a societal imperative. And the fact that we're coming to our senses with the statues and with the stars and bars, the American swastika, they all must fall. We thought we had resolved this in Charlotte a couple of years ago. It's still not resolved. And so, we're moving expeditiously in every form and fashion to complete the task over eradicating these symbols of hatred and division. Now, as to slave holders, to say the issue of slave holders.</p><p>CARLSON: One thing, just so you know, let me just inform you one thing. And I'm not even arguing with you, I am just saying, one of the reasons this hasn't been resolved is because the public is not for doing this. Only a small minority, only about a quarter of people polled yesterday in the United States thought that these monuments should come down. Over 60 percent said, they should remain as historical remnants of an earlier age. So like, you need to get the public onboard before you do this. Would you agree?</p><p>DEGRAFF: Well, the height of the civil rights movement, there were a lot of people that said, you need to go slow, you need to take your time, and now the people who they were saying that to are American heroes. So, sometimes heroes, just like the people in the Boston Tea Party if you had polled Boston, there would have been people who would say, why are you throwing our tea in the harbor? So, sometimes people --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, because it wasn't a democracy then. Hold on. It was not a democracy. Hold on! No, no, no, no. So you've given up on the idea of representative government?</p><p>DEGRAFF: No, I haven't given up on anything.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, you have.</p><p>DEGRAFF: What I'm saying is --</p><p>CARLSON: Okay.</p><p>DEGRAFF: I understand that some people who champion social justice get it before the main society gets it. Just as some people in the Republican Party were slow to get their president as dysfunctional.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. Yes. Let's get back to the question of slave holders, though. Because I think this isn't meaningful. I think you make a more defensible point on the civil war question. But what bothers me about the idea that all slave holders need to be erased from American history.</p><p>DEGRAFF: I think the issue is not being erased from history. It's being - -</p><p>CARLSON: What is the issue?</p><p>DEGRAFF: -- not celebrated. If you put your name on a building you're being celebrated.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. Well, the city I live in is named after the founder of the country, the first president, whose plantation which was populated by slaves is right down the road at Mount Vernon. So, I mean, this is not a rhetorical question, it's a real question, should we change the name of the capital of the country? What should we do about George Washington?</p><p>George Washington is not like a confederate general. George Washington is the founder of a country and put his life on the line in order to do so. He was a flawed human being but he created a great thing. He was part of the great creation that is self-perpetuating and self-correcting. That's what the process is about.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DEGRAFF: And so, the fact is, that right now, we can get to George Washington and Washington, D.C. But right now we need to take care of these confederate statues.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. Let me just say, I don't want to get to Washington or Washington, D.C. I don't want to rewrite the history of this country. I like where you left off the first time, he redeemed himself by his good deeds which he did.</p><p>Reverend, thanks a lot for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>DEGRAFF: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Oregon has passed a law to give free abortions to everybody including illegal aliens. That's not insane or anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood wants to teach your five-year-old about transgenderism. Live Action Founder Lila Rose will be here to discuss both. We're not making that up, by the way. So, stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the culture of death is on the march across American in the world in case you haven't noticed. In the state of Oregon, the Governor just signed a bill ordering all insurance companies to provide free abortions. Also allocating state funds to ensure illegal aliens can get abortions as well. Because that will make the country better. Meanwhile, a new report from CBS News celebrates Iceland's near elimination of Down Syndrome. How did they pull off that miracle?</p><p>By killing any baby who had it through abortion. And a new Planned Parenthood pamphlet argues that children as young as four ought to be told that men can get abortions too because, quote, \"your genitals don't make you a boy or a girl.\" Lila Rose constructed this staff for a living. He is the author and founder of Live Action for life group and she joins us tonight.</p><p>So, the Oregon abortion law, you know, no subject is more dishonestly covered by the press than abortion, because 100 percent of people in the press corps support it. So, it's hard to get to know what is in a bill like this. Tell us what this bill says.</p><p>LILA ROSE, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, LIVE ACTION: Sure. So, Tucker, this is the most extreme state law on abortion that our country has seen. Basically a completely Democratic-held government in Oregon has said that abortions through all nine months, even sex selection abortions, no limit whatsoever are now going to be paid for by taxpayers in Oregon. And insurance companies are going to be forced to fund it. So, this could cost over 3,000 lives, extra lives killed, children killed every year in Oregon because of this extreme pro-abortion agenda held by the government in Oregon.</p><p>CARLSON: So, let me, because I'm a simple man, let me ask you a simple question. Sex selection abortions almost always reduce the number of daughters born.</p><p>ROSE: Of girls.</p><p>CARLSON: They're performed in order to get a son. Always. How can feminists be for that? How can a feminist, you know, sworn to defend women, support a sex selective abortion?</p><p>ROSE: It's the height of hypocrisy, and it just shows that how out of touch the so-called champions of many women are in this country. In reality, you have 100 million missing girls worldwide because of sex selection abortions. Search and destroy mission against girls in the womb. And Oregon is now funding it. Forcing taxpayers and insurance companies to fund it, saying for whatever reason, you can have an abortion, through all nine months, Tucker.</p><p>Whether you're first trimester baby or your baby about to be born, you can be killed in Oregon. This is because our country has lost sight of what science and reason tells us, which is that life in the womb has human rights just like you or I do.</p><p>CARLSON: So, CBS is pretty excited about this great medical advance in Iceland where they somehow eliminated Down Syndrome? Like how did they do that?</p><p>ROSE: It was not a medical breakthrough. Iceland has championed the end of Down Syndrome and Australia is talking about this as well, other European countries. They're not actually treating Down Syndrome, Tucker. They are not actually helping people with disabilities. They're killing people with disabilities. They're killing them off. This is genocide. And what message are we telling people with disabilities.</p><p>What message does this send to those that have disabilities in our communities? It sends the message that we wish in Iceland or in Australia or even in the United States, Down Syndrome children are targeted for abortion. It sends a message to them that your life doesn't matter, you are not valuable. It is exactly the wrong message to send.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. And there's no evidence at all that Down Syndrome causes suffering for the person who's born with it. I mean, right? There's no -- Down Syndrome, people are people. Happy people, actually.</p><p>ROSE: Well, I mean, exactly, Tucker. You know, it's kind of besides the point. Because even if you have a disability and you have suffering, your life still has meaning and you still have the right to life.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ROSE: So, suffering or no suffering, you're still worth protecting and cherishing. And looking to alleviate suffering instead of looking to kill.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Lila Rose, thanks for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>ROSE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: A documentary filmmaker says, John Kelly getting the chief-of- staff job at the White House could drive militarization on the U.S. border and put the U.S. in a de facto war with Mexico. That filmmaker got back from the border, he join us next.</p><p>CARLSON: President Trump recently elevated Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to the post of chief-of-staff in the White House. Critics of border security say that's not a good thing.</p><p>John Carlos Frey, the documentary filmmaker whose works include life and death at the border. In a recent interview with Democracy Now, he warned that Kelly, a former general would help turn the border into a war zone and exacerbate a, quote, \"culture of cruelty\" in American border enforcement.</p><p>John Carlos Frey joins us tonight. John Frey, thanks a lot for coming on. So, what do you mean by this. How will Kelly, as White House chief-of- staff, make the border patrol more militaristic?</p><p>JOHN CARLOS FREY, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, MARSHALL PROJECT: Well, I'm not sure that I said that Kelly would make such things happen. But what I did say is that, having a militaristic approach at the border is what we've been doing probably since 9/11 and that doesn't seem to be the most effective strategy at least for my reporting. We have unmanned drones that fly over the U.S.Mexico border. Today, we have over 700 miles of border fencing.</p><p>We have border patrol agents in the amount of over 20,000, and it seems to be on the increase. So, you know, we're talking about an issue of migration. We're talking about poverty, we're talking about people who are suffering from violence south of the border. A militaristic approach doesn't seem at least from my reporting to be the most effective strategy. Border security is important. But it seems like that's all we're doing. To put a general in charge of the U.S.-Mexico border might have a heavy- handed approach.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I don't know that he's in charge of that necessarily as chief of staff. But a part of what you said, I agree --</p><p>FREY: Well, he was in charge at the Department of Homeland Security. Right. I mean, he was in charge of the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>CARLSON: Now, he's not. Right. So, but I guess my question is, if what we're doing isn't working and demonstrably it's not, and we have 11 or 12 million people here illegally who got over the border, what would work?</p><p>FREY: Right. Well, one of the things that we're not taking a look at is the visa system. Almost half of all the people who come to the United States without papers come with an expired visa, overstay their visa, or come into the United States and don't even cross that border. So, you can go ahead and build a border wall from sea to shining sea and build it 20 feet tall. But people who come into the country legally, won't even cross that barrier.</p><p>So, we're not even taking a look at revamping the border system. We're also importing workers in the United States. What about all of the employers here in the United States? Agriculture, and hospitality, restaurants, I'm sure if you go to dinner tonight in Manhattan, there will be undocumented people working in the kitchens. So, what about the employers who don't seem to be going after that?</p><p>CARLSON: So, let me ask you a question though. You're right. Sure. But when, I think that is a fair point. We are not going after them. But when did liberals become so sympathetic to employers in search of cheap labor? I don't remember that as a teacher of American liberalism when I was a kid. Like I interview these people all the time who say, you know, you can't be against illegal immigration, because illegals made your dinner tonight. And they never say, well, wait a second, maybe they made my dinner because employers want to pay their workers less. And this isn't an easy group of people to exploit. I would think liberals would be very against illegal immigration.</p><p>FREY: I'm at least for my reporting, I'm not necessarily, you know, this isn't for me, this isn't the Republican, Democrat, or liberal or conservative issue here.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>FREY: We're talking about a country that borders the United States, that is poor for the most part, where governments are corrupt, if you go to Central America. And people are looking for a better life. That's migration. That's what we have. So, if all we do is we throw arms and border walls and unmanned drones at this issue, we're not dealing with the root cause which is the disparity between the two countries. My reporting is pretty clear in taking a look at why people come here. And those are the root causes that sort of bombastic rhetoric doesn't even seem to address. We're not going to solve the problem with the border wall.</p><p>CARLSON: No, I think you're right. No, but we're fixing that. We're fixing that. Because thanks to immigration, parts of California are every bit as poor as parts of Mexico now. And so there's less of a disparity. I mean, parts of California really are like Mexico. So, that will help solve it, don't you think?</p><p>FREY: Well, go a little further, Tucker. I mean, California provides about 80 percent of all of the produce for the rest of the nation. And who is harvesting that?</p><p>CARLSON: That is right.</p><p>FREY: So, we're all benefitting from the benefits of illegal immigration. Yes, what we're doing is building a border wall. All you're going to do is make it harder for people to come --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARLSON: I knew you were going to --</p><p>FREY: What?</p><p>CARLSON: I knew you were going to defend employers exploiting cheap labor at that point.</p><p>FREY: No, no, no. I'm not defending employers at all. I mean --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, you are.</p><p>FREY: Agri-business is benefitting. No, no, sir. I mean, why doesn't the administration take a look at the employers themselves? Why don't we go and take a look at the agri-business?</p><p>CARLSON: I agree, amen, now we're on the same page.</p><p>FREY: All right. But where is that rhetoric, right?</p><p>CARLSON: No, I agree. I mean, look, John, we're out of time but I am affirming you on that point, I agree with you 100 percent.</p><p>FREY: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: We should do that immediately.</p><p>Thanks for coming on tonight, I appreciate it. How much power does Google have and how often are they abusing it?</p><p>Up next, we'll talk to men who literally wrote the book on the question, his conclusion you cannot trust Google. And they say, don't be evil. Huh! You should laugh. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back. We talked a lot about Google this week. We pointed out the danger of powerful tech companies. And our basic freedoms as exemplified by the fired Google engineer James Damore.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES DAMORE, FIRED GOOGLE ENGINEER: There are current dogmas that you really can't defend against at Google. And one of them being that there's any difference between people. They just, the entire time, either just called me names, shamed me, or just made broad generalizations saying that what I was saying was pseudo-Science. When, really, this is scientific consensus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Our next guest is an expert on the dangers of Google. Scott Cleland is the author of \"Search and Destroy: You Can't Trust Google Inc.\" Probably not a more straightforward book title ever. He runs the Watchdog site Google Monitor which you can still find via Google for now anyway. Scott joins us tonight.</p><p>So, you can't trust Google. This is something you've been on to for a while. The rest of us kind of stupidly believed the don't be evil propaganda. To what extent is Google driven by political ideology.</p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, PUBLISHER OF GOOGLE MONITOR: They're an exceptionally political company. And it just pervades everything they do. And you know, I think they're Utopians. You know, tech Utopians who believe that, you know, it would be best if we had all information and all power centralized with a philosopher king as we know in history, where you know, one person or group of people, the elites, know what's best. And they subscribe to that kind of tech Utopian political outlook. And they have led their business in that direction. And succeeded in creating unimaginable information power.</p><p>CARLSON: They're not liberals in the traditional sense in that they don't believe that you should be able to talk, too. I mean, there's an authoritarian streak obviously. We saw it in the firing of their software engineer. Do they enforce conformity in their business?</p><p>CLELAND: Well, a lot of people don't join that don't fit to begin with. So, what you're talking about, is a mono culture. That is very much a tech mono culture, which leans libertarian on some sides but very liberal on the other. But, you know, it is very, very political. Where if you do not agree, you don't fit in. Now, that's true of coding and the coding class, and of tech people, you know, that group tends to, I don't want to generalize too much, but it tends to be very black and white. It's binary, like coding.</p><p>It's a one or a zero. And so, one of the reasons why you see the problem with Mr. Damore and others, is that they don't see gray, they leap to either a one or a zero. Because that's what they do each day. What they do each day is very binary in the digital world.</p><p>CARLSON: People like that should not be in charge of all known information in the English language. They have so much power that I wonder, quickly, if you think this can continue. I mean, how long before they become a rival to the U.S. government and they are broken up or nationalized or regulated like a utility?</p><p>CLELAND: It's great that you ask that question. Because information is power. We know, you know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. You know, I think it's Burke and Lord Acton told us that. We are probably on the scale of information is power of one being, you know, power and 10 being information power, we're over seven, well on the way to eight with Google. And it's extraordinary.</p><p>People can't imagine it, because these numbers are so big. But they literally have organized all the digital accessible information in the world. And I would say, like, you know, 80 or 90 percent of the stuff that can be found, they found it. Nobody else has the other stuff. And so, it is all on their servers.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. It's terrifying. It's terrifying. Scott, thank you for that glimpse into it. I'm going to buy your book. I appreciate it.</p><p>We will back in a minute with an update to a story brought to you earlier this hour, the facts have changed on the ground already. That is next. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Teleprompter. We want to bring you an update on the San Francisco rally that Nancy Pelosi said she wanted canceled because it was white supremacist even though it turns out most of the speakers aren't white. Well, since the show started the Bay Area Park Services reacted to our interview, we'll take credit of course for this.</p><p>Their statement is this, from the head of the Park Service, they take very seriously the concerns expressed by the public and elected officials regarding the rally but they must be guided they say, by quote, \"the constitution, the law, and long-standing court precedent.\" The final decision will be made in the next seven days, hopefully Nancy Pelosi will not be able to bully them out of their right to assemble.</p><p>That's it for us tonight, \"THE FIVE\" starts right now. We'll see you tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2017081601cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P8C-0DF1-JB20-G3PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 16, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009LLQ</classCode><className>GO DADDY GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GDDY (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Oregon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Laws</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Abortion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Women</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The 'Big Tech' enters by 15% more in full increase in regulatory pressure.<br/>Three of the big U.S. tech makers, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, have seen their net profit fall in the third quarter, thus slightly reducing the aggregate profitability of American Big Tech, a group that also includes Microsoft and Facebook. These five companies, the largest North American technology by capitalization, total quarterly profits of $39,657 million (35,544 million euros), a 1% less year-on-year. Its aggregate sales amount to $225.227 billion, up 15 percent.</p><p><br/>These disparate results come at a time marked by increased regulatory pressure in the United States on these digital giants, especially Google and Facebook, investigated for their possible anti-competitive practices.<br/>Both Amazon and Alphabet have defended the increase in spending as a weapon to ensure long-term growth before investors, even if they have to pay the price for a quarterly profit reduction. The e-commerce giant has seen its profits fall for the first time nearly two years - it fell by 26%, to $2.13 billion - after its operating expenses to 25 percent of its operating expenses to $41.302 billion. A rate above 23% growth in revenue, which was $70 billion.<br/>Free deliveries<br/>This increase is largely explained by the deployment in the United States of free deliveries in 24 hours for its subscribers, a program costing $2.3 billion in the second half. Amazon is confident that this aggressive ultra-fast delivery policy will raise average spending per customer. In the third quarter, online sales increased by 22%, while total revenue grew by 24%, to $70 billion.<br/>In the case of Alphabet, Google's parent company, the growth in operating expenses - 25% more year-on-year to a record historic $31.3 billion - is attributed, above all, to a greater investment in the data centers it requires to operate the business.<br/>Expenses have also been impacted by increased research staffing, rising content production costs, and the payment of delayed taxes in France. In addition to skyrocketing operating expenses, the $1.53 billion devaluation of its investments in other companies has contributed to a 23% quarterly net profit decline to just over $7 billion. Turnover was boosted by 20%, to $40.5 billion.<br/>Apple Diversifies<br/>Among the companies that have reduced profit also includes Apple, whose quarterly net profits fell by 3% to $13,686 million. However, investors were more concerned about whether the company was progressing in its diversification strategy to rely less on the iPhone, which continues to fall in sales, specifically 9% in the quarter, to $33.362 billion. The growth of 18% of services and 54% of wearables and accessories has allowed Apple to close in positive stake despite the iPhone. Technology increased revenue s just under 2 percent to $64.04 billion, and offered good forecasts for this quarter, to Wall Street relief.<br/>In a quarter of lights and shadows, Facebook continues to demonstrate its growth capacity and profitability, despite its many open fronts, including the increased regulatory pressure that also affects Google. The social network raised 29% of its revenue, to 17,650million dollars, while its net profit increased by 19%, to $6.1 billion. Its results reflect its solid growth in users. The company has 1.6290 million active users, up 9%.<br/>Microsoft and the Cloud<br/>Microsoft, the largest capitalization company, captures the fruits of its commitment to cloud computing, whose business has almost doubled in the last two years. Precisely, the company just won a $10 billion megacontract with the Pentagon this month.<br/>In the quarter ended September, revenue from Microsoft's cloud business soared 36% year-on-year, to $11.6 billion. Your Azure public cloud drive grew by 59% - it doesn't reveal a billing figure - denoting a slowdown when compared to the 76% increase in the same period a year ago and 64% from the previous quarter. Subscriptions to your Office 365 productivity suite, Microsoft's other big cloud business, rose 25%.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9282744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDP-RSG1-DY1R-B4P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the people in charge of the privacy at those three tech giants gathered onstage during a panel at the\u00a0South By Southwest[4] Interactive conference in Austin, Texas on Saturday morning the question that, in many ways, dominated the discussion was how to manage users' understandings and expectations about privacy when everything is connected to the Internet\u2014not just computers and smartphones.The panel, which was entitled 'How the Big Tech Firms Protect Consumer Privacy' and hosted by International Association of Privacy Professionals President Trevor Hughes, brought together Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan, Google Legal Privacy Director Keith Enright, and Microsoft Chief Privacy Counsel Mike Hintze for a conversation about how the trio of firms deal with privacy issues both in terms of government regulations and in maintaining the trust of their users.'One of the things that makes privacy interesting is that the law is evolving and the technology is evolving, so they questions are constantly evolving,' said Hintze. As a result, when tech companies look at the privacy implications of a new product or feature, the question is often less about whether or not it runs afoul of the current patchwork of government regulations than it is about the perceptions of the consumers using the product. </p><p>'Would people be surprised about the data being collected by a product?' Hintze asked. 'Would they be unhappy by not being able to turn it off?'The panel agreed that the best way to accomplish this is by thinking about privacy from the very earliest stages the development cycle. For example, Egan recounted how Facebook brought in privacy experts from academia and the nonprofit sector for looking at the privacy implications of a feature the social network implemented last year that alerts when their friends are nearby.\u00a0The company was understandably concerned about backlash from users having their locations reported to people they know on Facebook without their explicit consent. The experts advised Facebook represent the geolocation feature picture of a phone in a pocket as a visual companion to the text notification. 'Consent is a core aspect of privacy.' Egan insisted. 'Consent can be really good too, if it's in context. The question is what does it mean and how do we present it in a way so people understand it?However, getting user consent on how information is used has issues of its own. The nuts and bots of how Facebok uses the data of its over one billion users is tucked away in the depths of its lengthy agreement. The company has implemented a simple interface where users can do privacy check-ups to manage what information they share and with whom, but those efforts haven't seemed to engender a significant level of faith among the public at large. According the recent survey[5] of nearly 2,000 registered voters conducted by Morning Consult, only 32 percent respondents had 'total' confidence in Facebook's ability to keep their personal information and data secure. Facebook isn't exactly alone in having a user trust problem. The survey found that much of the tech industry is facing a crisis of confidence when it comes to the responsible use and storage of user data. The segment of users that place trust in each company stands at 50 percent for Google and 54 percent for\u00a0Apple[6]. For Uber, the figure was an abysmally low 18 percent. Not a single organization the pollsters asked about cracked 60 percent. What's interesting here is that a lack of confidence in data security isn't stopping people from using these services. Uber, which was the least trusted of all the companies queried about, still delivers\u00a0over two million rides per day[7]. Nevertheless, likely as a result of uncertainly, people are worried about what companies are doing with their data, which is precisely why the panelists emphasized that informing the public what happens to their information is so crucial. 'To a degree that we're engaging with a user on a screen, even if its a small screen on a phone, we're getting better and better on giving people ways to meaningfully give consent,' noted Enright, adding one major caveat.'In some respects we're solving yesterday's problems,' he continued. 'All of that work doesn't necessarily move the ball forward on solving tomorrow's problem when we're living in a world of connected cars and thermostats. It's going to have to be more of a focus on user education ... We are necessarily going to be moving away from the paradigm we have now with keyboards and screens.'As much of the technology on display at the conference indicates, the industry is rapidly moving into a world where the only window into the Internet is through a laptop or smartphone screen. The number of connected devices that comprise the so-called\u00a0Internet of Things[8] is expected to grow to\u00a038 billion individual units by 2020[9] generating an unimaginably vast and precise amount of data about every aspect of our lives. Informing users exactly where their privacy ends and how their data is used is going to become even more difficult.Take, for example, an Internet of Things light switch installed in a person's house. What's the responsible way to inform people about how the data from that light switch is used? If it's deep in a user manual that comes with the device, the odds anyone will thoroughly read and understand it is essentially zero. It could be put on the device itself, but what if that light switch doesn't come with a display panel or that panel isn't set up to easily display a lot of text?In that case, the issue of consent isn't just dictated by whether the manufacturer places a bold privacy alert on its website, but also by the very nature of the device itself.Hintze suggested a solution of drawing a line between what is being done with the data as to determine if a privacy notification is necessary. 'If the data is anonymous and aggregated, the privacy issue maybe isn't that big an issue,' he said. 'But if the data is connected to an individual, that could be a problem.'He added that, in the latter instance, there's likely to be a sign-up process that does involve a traditional screen. At that point, the user can, at least in theory, be presented with information about, or even given agency to pro-actively change, precisely what information they share. But what happens when there is no screen anywhere in the process? Is it better to just assume that consumers will value the convenience and utility offered by their products over any concerns about privacy and bury data use policies somewhere in the dark recesses of their corporate website? Or is it the obligation of companies to build privacy notification and accessibility into the very design of the product?'I think that ethics is the next big issue in the privacy space,' said Hintze. 'It's\u00a0not just what can you do. It's what should you do...We need philosophers on staff these days.'Illustration by Max Fleishman Related stories from The Daily DotTech companies don't have a clear answer when it comes to data privacy for the Internet of Things[10] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.daiydot.com/tags/google\">http://www.daiydot.com/tags/google</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/tags/facebook\">http://www.dailydot.com/tags/facebook</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/tags/microsoft\">http://www.dailydot.com/tags/microsoft</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/tags/south-by-southwest\">http://www.dailydot.com/tags/south-by-southwest</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/apple-tim-cook-fbi-iphone-unlock-encryption-morning-consult-poll/\">http://www.dailydot.com/politics/apple-tim-cook-fbi-iphone-unlock-encryption-morning-consult-poll/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/tags/apple\">http://www.dailydot.com/tags/apple</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3050784/elasticity/uber-is-even-bigger-than-you-realize\">https://www.fastcompany.com/3050784/elasticity/uber-is-even-bigger-than-you-realize</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/tags/internet-of-things\">http://www.dailydot.com/tags/internet-of-things</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/iot-connected-devices-to-triple-to-38-bn-by-2020\">http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/iot-connected-devices-to-triple-to-38-bn-by-2020</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/sxsw-privacy-officers-panel/\">http://www.dailydot.com/politics/sxsw-privacy-officers-panel/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TDOT1251471457882984724251762100021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TDOT-125147</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J94-PJP1-F03R-N4SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1363\"/><timeReceived>3:29 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Dot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>March 13, 2016 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Big tech has grown by monetizing data. By offering a checking account, credit card or other financial product, these companies can gather specific and detailed information about your income, spending, cash flow and other financial habits.</p><p>Q: Are the tech firms really becoming banks?</p><p>A: For now, they are wading into specific parts of financial services and generally partnering with existing financial institutions. For example, Google will soon offer checking accounts in partnership with Citigroup and Stanford Federal Credit Union. Often, the tech company will be the brand that the customer sees while the bank takes on regulatory issues and other behind-the-scenes tasks. In time, some tech companies may move further into financial services but will likely stop short of crossing lines that require them to deal with regulatory complexity and compliance.</p><p>Q: What are the potential benefits for consumers?</p><p>A: Tech companies will likely offer lower fees and higher interest rates than traditional banks. Some may offer cash incentives or other perks to encourage customers to make the switch. Many are also focused on offering a better customer experience by offering apps that are easy to use, making it easier to find the information you need within an app, and figuring out the right way and time to connect with you to be useful but not annoying.</p><p>As these companies get to know customers better, they'll start giving them personalized offers. For example, if they know how much you're paying on a mortgage, they may infer the rate and offer you a refinance option with a lower rate through a partner.</p><p>Q: What are the trade-offs?</p><p>A: You are giving the tech company your financial data. They'll see how much money you have in your account, what bills you're paying and more, and they'll use that information to try to sell you stuff and market financial products. Customers who are concerned about their privacy may want to use a diverse portfolio of service providers -- keeping social accounts in one bucket, banking in another and investments in a third -- to avoid giving a single company a full view of their affairs.</p><p>Q: Will people make the switch?</p><p>A: Inertia is the most powerful force in consumer finance. Getting people to change, unless there's a big shock, is tough. If you want to give the new accounts a try, consider opening one as a secondary account. Over time, you might receive offers that would save you money and you might not mind how your data is being used. ct20 0004 200203 N S 0000000000 00003796</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHTRIB-200202423460872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHTRIB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y49-YCC1-JBG7-40GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8119</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Chicago Tribune Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00035TS</classCode><className>STANFORD FEDERAL CREDIT UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Big tech has grown by monetizing data. By offering a checking account, credit card or other financial product, these companies can gather specific and detailed information about your income, spending, cash flowand other financial habits.</p><p>  Q: Are the tech firms really becoming  banks?</p><p>  A: For now, they arewading into specific  parts of financial services and generally  partnering with existing financial institutions. For example, Google will soon offer checking accounts in partnership  with Citigroup and Stanford Federal CreditUnion. Often, the tech company will be the brand that the customer sees while the bank takes on regulatory issues and other behind-the-scenes tasks. In time, some tech companies maymove further into financial services but will likely stop short of crossing lines that require them to deal with regulatory complexity and compliance.</p><p>  Q: What are the potential benefits for consumers?</p><p>  A: Tech companies will likely offer lower fees and higher interest rates than traditional banks. Some may offer cash incentives or other perks to encourage customers to make the switch. Many are also focused on offering a better customer  experience by offering apps that are easy to use, making it easier to find the information you need within an app, and figuring out the rightway and time to connect with you to be useful but not annoying.</p><p>   As these companies get to knowcustomers  better, they'll start giving them personalized offers. For example, if they knowhowmuch you're paying on a mortgage, they may infer the rate and offer you a refinance option with a lower rate through a partner.</p><p> Q: What are the trade-offs?</p><p>  A: You are giving the tech company your financial data. They\u2019ll see how much money you have in your account, what bills you\u2019re paying and more, and they\u2019ll use that information to try to sell you stuff and market financial products. Customerswho are concerned about their privacy maywant to use a diverse portfolio of service providers keeping social accounts in one bucket, banking in another and investments in a third to avoid giving a single company a full view of their affairs. There are also a lot of boring but important functions that traditional banks dowell, such as maintaining  branch locations and call centers, that aren\u2019t always a strong suit for technology companies.</p><p>  Q: Will people make the switch?</p><p>   A: Inertia is the most powerful force in consumer finance. Getting people to change, unless there\u2019s a big shock, is tough. If youwant to give the new accounts  a try, you might consider opening one as a secondary account. If over time you receive offers thatwould save you money and you don\u2019t mind howyour data is being used, you might consider making it your primary account.

Big tech has grown by monetizing data. By offering a checking account, credit card or other financial product, these companies can gather specific and detailed information about your income, spending, cash flow and other financial habits.</p><p>Q: Are the tech firms really becoming banks?</p><p>A: For now, they are wading into specific parts of financial services and generally partnering with existing financial institutions. For example, Google will soon offer checking accounts in partnership with Citigroup and Stanford Federal Credit Union. Often, the tech company will be the brand that the customer sees while the bank takes on regulatory issues and other behind-the-scenes tasks. In time, some tech companies may move further into financial services but will likely stop short of crossing lines that require them to deal with regulatory complexity and compliance.</p><p>Q: What are the potential benefits for consumers?</p><p>A: Tech companies will likely offer lower fees and higher interest rates than traditional banks. Some may offer cash incentives or other perks to encourage customers to make the switch. Many are also focused on offering a better customer experience by offering apps that are easy to use, making it easier to find the information you need within an app, and figuring out the right way and time to connect with you to be useful but not annoying.</p><p>As these companies get to know customers better, they'll start giving them personalized offers. For example, if they know how much you're paying on a mortgage, they may infer the rate and offer you a refinance option with a lower rate through a partner.</p><p>Q: What are the trade-offs?</p><p>A: You are giving the tech company your financial data. They'll see how much money you have in your account, what bills you're paying and more, and they'll use that information to try to sell you stuff and market financial products. Customers who are concerned about their privacy may want to use a diverse portfolio of service providers - keeping social accounts in one bucket, banking in another and investments in a third - to avoid giving a single company a full view of their affairs. There are also a lot of boring but important functions that traditional banks do well, such as maintaining branch locations and call centers, that aren't always a strong suit for technology companies.</p><p>Q: Will people make the switch?</p><p>A: Inertia is the most powerful force in consumer finance. Getting people to change, unless there's a big shock, is tough. If you want to give the new accounts a try, you might consider opening one as a secondary account. If over time you receive offers that would save you money and you don't mind how your data is being used, you might consider making it your primary account.</p><p>Kaitlin Pitsker is an associate editor at Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine.

Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, said the measures would \u201ctoughen control of abusive practices for big market-dominating digital companies\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThere is no other jurisdiction that has proposed such a far-reaching tool for taming the digital giants,\u201d said Rupprecht Podszun, head of the Institute for Competition Law at the Heinrich Heine University in D\u00fcsseldorf. </p><p>Germany\u2019s bill is part of a broader \u201ctechlash\u201d as governments consider ways to limit the economic and social power of the tech giants and public disquiet grows about the potential threats they pose to competition, privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>The bill would make it easier for the cartel office to establish whether companies dominate a particular market. The agency would then be able to prohibit such platforms from \u201cself-preferencing\u201d \u2014 that is, giving preferential treatment to their own products or services to the detriment of those provided by rivals. </p><p>Platforms would also be banned from impeding \u201cdata portability\u201d, the ability of users to transfer personal information collected by digital companies to other online services. </p><p>The bill, which could still be changed before it is passed into law, also stipulates that a platform can be found to have engaged in \u201cabusive\u201d behaviour if it denies other companies access to the data it has collected on them.</p><p>Mr Podszun said this part of the bill \u201cis completely new, and you might say, revolutionary\u201d. He said its practical impact might not be great, \u201cbut the signalling effect is huge\u201d. He added: \u201cYou could see France and Italy following suit, and the net gradually tightening.\u201d</p><p>Daniela Seeliger, a partner at Linklaters who specialises in competition law, said: \u201cGermany is taking a first step and putting into concrete proposals what other countries are thinking about in more abstract terms.\u201d She said the EU could go down the same route.</p><p>The German bill comes as Brussels also considers moves to toughen regulation. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager recently called for the burden of proof in antitrust cases to be placed on the big tech companies themselves.</p><p>Meanwhile the UK government is making plans for a\u00a0 regulator to police the technology sector. The idea reflects the findings of\u00a0a review led by Jason Furman,\u00a0chief economic adviser to former US president Barack Obama, which looked into the \u201cemergence of powerful new companies\u201d in the tech sector and recommended a dedicated regulator.</p><p>Andreas Mundt, head of the German cartel office, told the FT late last year that the proposed digital bill was part of a broader trend that also included the Furman report and recent moves to clamp down on big tech companies in Australia. </p><p>\u201cWhat is happening in Germany is very much embedded in my understanding of the international context, based on many studies around the world that go in the same direction,\u201d he said.</p><p>His agency has already earned a reputation for its robust stance towards Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. A year ago it blocked Facebook from pooling data collected from Instagram, its other subsidiaries and third-party websites without user consent. The decision was later overturned by a court in D\u00fcsseldorf, although the cartel office has since appealed.</p><p>The draft digital law has drawn a sceptical response from German business. Iris Pl\u00f6ger of the BDI, the main German business lobby, said it \u201cwould make it difficult to create internationally competitive digital companies\u201d. She said it would also widen the gap between German and European law.</p><p>Rebekka Weiss, of the digital lobby group Bitkom, said the bill was \u201cso unclear in some of its formulations that it could have negative consequences for new emerging business models that the law is expressly designed to support\u201d.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-39559796469811eaaee29ddbdc86190d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4H-YH81-DXP9-91XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0008DC5</classCode><className>LINKLATERS LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
