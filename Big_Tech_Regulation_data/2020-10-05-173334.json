Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  We want to welcome Catherine Bessant,  she's Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch Chief Operations and Technology  Officer.  This is important.  Miss Bessant has just been named the most  powerful women in banking by the American banker and that's the second year  in a row.  So, I want to ask about threepeats (ph), Cathy, but thanks for  being here.  It's good to have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CATHERINE BESSANT, BANK OF AMERICAMERRILL LYNCH CTO:  We're always going  upward, David.  Thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WESTIN:  So we've a lot of things to talk about Bank of America, about  women in the workplace.  But let's start with this Bloomberg story this  morning, about this hardware hack as it were that really infiltrated some  U.S. companies according to Bloomberg reporting.</p><p>I know that cybersecurity is right at the top of your list of priorities as  Brian Moynihan's.  What was your initial reaction when you read this?   First of all, how do you know Bank of America doesn't have this problem?</p><p>BESSANT:  Well, let's start with cybersecurity has to be at the top of  every corporation's list.  It's a ubiquitous risk and it's potentially  systemic.  So it's real.  When I saw the news this morning my first  reaction was, well, third party and fourth party risk is in fact I think  the greatest source of risk to any supply chain for any company has.  It's  not just the companies that work with, but the companies they work with.</p><p>So, understanding the risk of the lineage of the hardware and software that  actually goes to market, understanding where people are working with what  vendors.  People tell us all the time we're tough to do business with.   I've actually become very proud of that on behalf of our customers and  clients.  I actually don't think it should be easy to put technology into  the marketplace.</p><p>One thing I don't think has gotten enough conversation this morning,  though, is we're talking about the chip and its detection.  There are other  mechanisms for prevention of risk that comes with that.  We look at how  data moves in our company.  So, if somebody is a resident in our own  hardware, could they actually get anything that was important to us?  If  the data moves, would we know?</p><p>And so, all of the emerging excellence in cybersecurity is really multiple  layers of defense coupled with great tech investment which you know we do a  lot of it and great talent.  So, it's a multilayer defense strategy.</p><p>WESTIN:  So has a hardware hack possibility been in your radar screen?   Because we just haven't been covering stories like this.  It's always been  software, it's always been data access, it hasn't been actually something  physically implanted in your machine.</p><p>BESSANT:  I think that's really important part of the discussion.  What  this story reminds people or tells people for the first time his hardware  risk is real.  I think the risk is always been there but real  manifestations of it that go beyond the hype or the fear that gets  generated, those manifestations are very important.  And this will spark a  new dialogue.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So how you look at it in terms of  protection?  Because I was on a panel where I talked to three CFOs, three  totally different companies, utilities, big tech and trucking.  And then  they're like, we literally can't spend all of our money on cybersecurity.   We could but we can't.  So you have to pick and choose what sponsor most  vulnerable.  How do you determine that?</p><p>BESSANT:  Well, what's good thing and challenge is our company gives us  unlimited budget in terms of tech investment and people investment.</p><p>STEEL:  I see.</p><p>BESSANT:  I always say the most important thing in cyber defense is caliber  of talent, the team you actually put on the wall to prevent intrusion, to  detect it, and then if or when that detected mitigated brilliantly.  So, a  lot of the success, in fact, I would -- to be all of this success we've had  in this space in protecting our customers and teams to the talent we've  got.</p><p>WESTIN:  What's the role of government in this and particularly your  relations with government?  When you hear that the FBI has been  investigating this particular chip for some time, certainly it wasn't made  publicly known, it may have been communicated to individual companies, but  from your experience, you have a great relationship?  Do they call you up?   Do they say, boy, we think we have a problem here or vice versa?  Do you  share information with them?</p><p>BESSANT:  it's a two direction and multilateral sharing.  I would say the  most important role the government has is to cause and mandate that sharing  to occur.  There is no competitive advantage to secrets in this space  especially regarding risks and sharing is the key to prevention and  detection.</p><p>People ask about regulation.  I'm not sure regulation is the answer.  I do  know that government has a huge role to play in how we share data with each  other.</p><p>STEEL:  Throughout the last hour and half we've been talking in different  ways of sort of the next cold war say in technology for example.  In your  experience and expertise, how vulnerable are U.S. companies versus other  companies in the world versus other countries in the world?</p><p>BESSANT:  Well, I think any company, regardless of where it's (INAUDIBLE)  their headquarter that has a global presence and sources globally is more  at risks than a company that's insulare (ph) and stays at home.  So, I  would say the risk of amped up for global firms in a lot of ways that scale  that causes of global firm to be in existence is important to defense.   Defense does take money and people and it takes really sustain investment  over time.  We've had a dedicated information security team centralized  team with enforcement authority in the company since 2008.</p><p>WESTIN:  How is Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch position particularly when it  comes to trade problems, international problems?  Because you have very  substantial domestic U.S. deposit taking base that you offer now.  You have  international operations to be sure.  I know you had a China operation I  think you actually shut it down at some point.  Are you more or less  exposed?  And in fact we do end up substantial, can I say, globalization?</p><p>BESSANT:  Well our customers, no matter what jurisdiction or regulations or  country by country regulation exist, our customers are global.  And so  we'll do whatever it takes in terms of innovation or business model to make  sure we can serve their needs.</p><p>STEEL: Well, let's turn into your fabulous award you won.  It's aw way to  talk about gender diversity because it's not just sort of the buzzword, ESG  (ph) thing, right?  I mean look at California they're now requiring women  on board.  What do you think about that?  Like that kind of requirement  like Norway has which apparently hasn't really well for diversity.</p><p>BESSANT:  Well, I'm not sure requirements are the answer.  I don't think  prescriptions about where talent should be used or how talent should be  applied.  And as a woman, I would never ever want to think (INAUDIBLE) to  the strong women I know want to think they got the job because of a law or  a mandate.</p><p>What I do think is this, 50% of the people in the workforce are women.  50%  of the people to join our company are women.  As long as you get to higher  levels of management, 50% of our people are women.  When 50% of our CEO's  aren't women we have a measure of progress we have got to make.</p><p>WESTIN:  We have to make but how do we make it?  I mean you have this  experience in the boardroom, in the C-suite.  I mean how do we get there?   Because we talked about it a lot.  We don't seem to be getting there.</p><p>BESSANT:  I'm very fortunately because its front and center in the  conversations at the firm, 40% of our board is diverse, 40% women, 40% of  our management team is women, 40% of our top 1000.  So, I'm lucky and that  it's an active conversation</p><p>I will say this, I don't think that the talk and action and dedicated smart  people that have been working on gender diversity for decades, I don't  think we're seeing the progress that all of that thought should produce.   I've been thinking a lot about what should I be working on over the next  year.  I'm starting to have emerging theories about our women in power  alley jobs.  Jobs that take them to CEO roles.  I don't know I know the  answer to the next five years.  I know that what we've been doing in the  past hasn't been getting us where we want to go.</p><p>STEEL:  All right.  Just one other question like what's the problem?   Because now it's like CEOs are talking about it.  There's a mandate in  California.  Like it's on there.  It's up there.  Shareholders want it.   What's the biggest holdup that you see?</p><p>BESSANT:  Well, I actually don't know the answer to that.</p><p>STEEL:  Fair point.</p><p>BESSANT:  I wish I knew.  If I knew, more than one of my direct reports  would be to a woman.  I do know this.  Three years ago, three of my direct  reports where women, two hired way by other firms.  We aren't doing  ourselves as corporate industry and industry being, you know, helping  create new pipelines of talent where approaching each others talent, for a  lot of -- in some cases really good reasons.  When I do think the focus --  our focus as a firm is ensuring that the pipeline is strong enough to  produce the kind of results that take -- that get us to that 40% of our  senior workforce being women.</p><p>Tech disciplines if you don't mind by saying that.</p><p>STEEL:  Yes.</p><p>BESSANT:  Tech disciplines are really hard, right?  We can say 50% of the  entering workforce in general is women in U.S. colleges and universities  this year.  About 17% of the STEM, the engineering technology math  graduates, 17% of them will be women.  So, from the start in the tech  disciplines we under index.  And again, fortunate to work for a firm how's  all over this.</p><p>STEEL:  So, to brought now here and it's great to get you here to get your  focus on to the next year.  As you look at 2018, what's the biggest risk?   What will keep you up most at night?</p><p>BESSANT:  Well, the cyber reports to me, I focused every single day on  cyber.  And if the board was asking me, I would say third-party risks in  cyber.  So you've given us a great platform to talk about that today.  I  also think the pace of change, regardless of whether its cyber or  technology in general, one thing I spent a lot of time thinking about is  has the pace of change exceed in enterprise's ability to keep up with it.   So, and I believe there are lots of solutions to that.  That will be a huge  focus for the firm as we move in to next year in my spaces.</p><p>STEEL: Cathy, so great to catch up with you.  Thank you so much.  Catherine  Bessant of Bank of America, Chief Operations and Technology Officer.   Great, great to see you.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: We want to welcome Catherine Bessant, she's Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch Chief Operations and Technology Officer. This is important. Miss Bessant has just been named the most powerful women in banking by the American banker and that's the second year in a row. So, I want to ask about threepeats (ph), Cathy, but thanks for being here. It's good to have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CATHERINE BESSANT, BANK OF AMERICAMERRILL LYNCH CTO: We're always going upward, David. Thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WESTIN: So we've a lot of things to talk about Bank of America, about women in the workplace. But let's start with this Bloomberg story this morning, about this hardware hack as it were that really infiltrated some U.S. companies according to Bloomberg reporting.</p><p>I know that cybersecurity is right at the top of your list of priorities as Brian Moynihan's. What was your initial reaction when you read this? First of all, how do you know Bank of America doesn't have this problem?</p><p>BESSANT: Well, let's start with cybersecurity has to be at the top of every corporation's list. It's a ubiquitous risk and it's potentially systemic. So it's real. When I saw the news this morning my first reaction was, well, third party and fourth party risk is in fact I think the greatest source of risk to any supply chain for any company has. It's not just the companies that work with, but the companies they work with.</p><p>So, understanding the risk of the lineage of the hardware and software that actually goes to market, understanding where people are working with what vendors. People tell us all the time we're tough to do business with. I've actually become very proud of that on behalf of our customers and clients. I actually don't think it should be easy to put technology into the marketplace.</p><p>One thing I don't think has gotten enough conversation this morning, though, is we're talking about the chip and its detection. There are other mechanisms for prevention of risk that comes with that. We look at how data moves in our company. So, if somebody is a resident in our own hardware, could they actually get anything that was important to us? If the data moves, would we know?</p><p>And so, all of the emerging excellence in cybersecurity is really multiple layers of defense coupled with great tech investment which you know we do a lot of it and great talent. So, it's a multilayer defense strategy.</p><p>WESTIN: So has a hardware hack possibility been in your radar screen? Because we just haven't been covering stories like this. It's always been software, it's always been data access, it hasn't been actually something physically implanted in your machine.</p><p>BESSANT: I think that's really important part of the discussion. What this story reminds people or tells people for the first time his hardware risk is real. I think the risk is always been there but real manifestations of it that go beyond the hype or the fear that gets generated, those manifestations are very important. And this will spark a new dialogue.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: So how you look at it in terms of protection? Because I was on a panel where I talked to three CFOs, three totally different companies, utilities, big tech and trucking. And then they're like, we literally can't spend all of our money on cybersecurity. We could but we can't. So you have to pick and choose what sponsor most vulnerable. How do you determine that?</p><p>BESSANT: Well, what's good thing and challenge is our company gives us unlimited budget in terms of tech investment and people investment.</p><p>STEEL: I see.</p><p>BESSANT: I always say the most important thing in cyber defense is caliber of talent, the team you actually put on the wall to prevent intrusion, to detect it, and then if or when that detected mitigated brilliantly. So, a lot of the success, in fact, I would -- to be all of this success we've had in this space in protecting our customers and teams to the talent we've got.</p><p>WESTIN: What's the role of government in this and particularly your relations with government? When you hear that the FBI has been investigating this particular chip for some time, certainly it wasn't made publicly known, it may have been communicated to individual companies, but from your experience, you have a great relationship? Do they call you up? Do they say, boy, we think we have a problem here or vice versa? Do you share information with them?</p><p>BESSANT: it's a two direction and multilateral sharing. I would say the most important role the government has is to cause and mandate that sharing to occur. There is no competitive advantage to secrets in this space especially regarding risks and sharing is the key to prevention and detection.</p><p>People ask about regulation. I'm not sure regulation is the answer. I do know that government has a huge role to play in how we share data with each other.</p><p>STEEL: Throughout the last hour and half we've been talking in different ways of sort of the next cold war say in technology for example. In your experience and expertise, how vulnerable are U.S. companies versus other companies in the world versus other countries in the world?</p><p>BESSANT: Well, I think any company, regardless of where it's (INAUDIBLE) their headquarter that has a global presence and sources globally is more at risks than a company that's insulare (ph) and stays at home. So, I would say the risk of amped up for global firms in a lot of ways that scale that causes of global firm to be in existence is important to defense. Defense does take money and people and it takes really sustain investment over time. We've had a dedicated information security team centralized team with enforcement authority in the company since 2008.</p><p>WESTIN: How is Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch position particularly when it comes to trade problems, international problems? Because you have very substantial domestic U.S. deposit taking base that you offer now. You have international operations to be sure. I know you had a China operation I think you actually shut it down at some point. Are you more or less exposed? And in fact we do end up substantial, can I say, globalization?</p><p>BESSANT: Well our customers, no matter what jurisdiction or regulations or country by country regulation exist, our customers are global. And so we'll do whatever it takes in terms of innovation or business model to make sure we can serve their needs.</p><p>STEEL: Well, let's turn into your fabulous award you won. It's aw way to talk about gender diversity because it's not just sort of the buzzword, ESG (ph) thing, right? I mean look at California they're now requiring women on board. What do you think about that? Like that kind of requirement like Norway has which apparently hasn't really well for diversity.</p><p>BESSANT: Well, I'm not sure requirements are the answer. I don't think prescriptions about where talent should be used or how talent should be applied. And as a woman, I would never ever want to think (INAUDIBLE) to the strong women I know want to think they got the job because of a law or a mandate.</p><p>What I do think is this, 50% of the people in the workforce are women. 50% of the people to join our company are women. As long as you get to higher levels of management, 50% of our people are women. When 50% of our CEO's aren't women we have a measure of progress we have got to make.</p><p>WESTIN: We have to make but how do we make it? I mean you have this experience in the boardroom, in the C-suite. I mean how do we get there? Because we talked about it a lot. We don't seem to be getting there.</p><p>BESSANT: I'm very fortunately because its front and center in the conversations at the firm, 40% of our board is diverse, 40% women, 40% of our management team is women, 40% of our top 1000. So, I'm lucky and that it's an active conversation</p><p>I will say this, I don't think that the talk and action and dedicated smart people that have been working on gender diversity for decades, I don't think we're seeing the progress that all of that thought should produce. I've been thinking a lot about what should I be working on over the next year. I'm starting to have emerging theories about our women in power alley jobs. Jobs that take them to CEO roles. I don't know I know the answer to the next five years. I know that what we've been doing in the past hasn't been getting us where we want to go.</p><p>STEEL: All right. Just one other question like what's the problem? Because now it's like CEOs are talking about it. There's a mandate in California. Like it's on there. It's up there. Shareholders want it. What's the biggest holdup that you see?</p><p>BESSANT: Well, I actually don't know the answer to that.</p><p>STEEL: Fair point.</p><p>BESSANT: I wish I knew. If I knew, more than one of my direct reports would be to a woman. I do know this. Three years ago, three of my direct reports where women, two hired way by other firms. We aren't doing ourselves as corporate industry and industry being, you know, helping create new pipelines of talent where approaching each others talent, for a lot of -- in some cases really good reasons. When I do think the focus -- our focus as a firm is ensuring that the pipeline is strong enough to produce the kind of results that take -- that get us to that 40% of our senior workforce being women.</p><p>Tech disciplines if you don't mind by saying that.</p><p>STEEL: Yes.</p><p>BESSANT: Tech disciplines are really hard, right? We can say 50% of the entering workforce in general is women in U.S. colleges and universities this year. About 17% of the STEM, the engineering technology math graduates, 17% of them will be women. So, from the start in the tech disciplines we under index. And again, fortunate to work for a firm how's all over this.</p><p>STEEL: So, to brought now here and it's great to get you here to get your focus on to the next year. As you look at 2018, what's the biggest risk? What will keep you up most at night?</p><p>BESSANT: Well, the cyber reports to me, I focused every single day on cyber. And if the board was asking me, I would say third-party risks in cyber. So you've given us a great platform to talk about that today. I also think the pace of change, regardless of whether its cyber or technology in general, one thing I spent a lot of time thinking about is has the pace of change exceed in enterprise's ability to keep up with it. So, and I believe there are lots of solutions to that. That will be a huge focus for the firm as we move in to next year in my spaces.</p><p>STEEL: Cathy, so great to catch up with you. Thank you so much. Catherine Bessant of Bank of America, Chief Operations and Technology Officer. Great, great to see you.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

It has been less good, however, at connecting us as a polity. It's time we started imagining what an internet optimized for the citizen would look like.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm a plus-sized woman, and when I was pregnant with my first son in 1999, finding maternity clothes was a pain. The maternity shops didn't have my size, and the plus-size shops didn't sell maternity clothes. By the time I was pregnant with my third son in 2008, the internet offered all I needed \u2014 very cheaply and with quick delivery.</p><p> We've made a trade. In exchange for commercial surveillance and data collection, we have the world's best at-home mall. And just as my friends and I used to socialize at the mall when we were teenagers, nowadays we socialize online in commercial spaces like Facebook and Twitter. The stores around us, informed by our digital profiles, magically transform to meet our needs and desires. We have the tailored internet experience.</p><p> This happy story has exceptions. Predatory industries use the same profiling technology to locate folks desperately in need of money or vulnerable to gambling pitches and sell them things they shouldn't buy. But in large part, we're in consumer nirvana.</p><p> The dark side of this revolution is that data collected for one use can be repurposed for another. Our marketing silos are information silos, too. Thanks to our tailored experiences, we barely share a common reality with people who disagree with us. They see different products, different political news, even different facts.</p><p> It crept up on us slowly, while we were playing with our new toys. But now the internet giants have enormous power. Facebook and Google together collect 77 percent of U.S. digital ad revenues. They account for a growing portion of political ads and offer us news environments that they control and edit. They capture so many hours of our attention every day, it's hard to see how we wouldn't be influenced.</p><p> This influence isn't benign. Just last month, the New America Foundation shut down its Open Markets initiative after a big donor \u2014 Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet Inc. \u2014 reportedly objected to its position on European antitrust regulation. The tech giants are spending increasing amounts on lobbying, lest we think of their market power and access to data as anything other than inevitable.</p><p> Consider the implications for society. The way Google presents search results can influence voter opinions and possibly help radicalize vulnerable people (remember Dylann Roof?). Facebook's experiments with its \"I voted\" button suggest that it could shift election outcomes. Imagine the possibilities if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ran for president (not an unthinkable scenario). He would be completely within his rights to direct his engineers to skew the Facebook newsfeed toward positive coverage of his campaign.</p><p> We caught a glimpse of what that might look like in the last presidential campaign. Donald Trump's team, for example, reportedly planted Facebook posts as part of an operation to suppress the African-American vote. And now we know that fake accounts, likely operated out of Russia, spent about $100,000 on Facebook ads ahead of the 2016 election \u2014 ads that might have reached tens of millions of people. Yet researchers can't get a more precise sense of what happened, because Facebook hasn't released the data needed to do so.</p><p> Facebook gives us a lot. It's a place to connect with friends and family. It's also the most efficient propaganda machine ever built by man. How can we decouple those two things and promote one while limiting the other? More generally, if we decide that we've made a bad trade with big tech, what can we do about it?</p><p> The authority of the inscrutable makes it hard for any individual to take on the tech giants \u2014 nobody who isn't a data scientist specializing in machine learning can even understand the algorithms. That leaves government, which has so far focused on antitrust matters related to consumers, not to the state of our democracy. And the classic antitrust approach of splitting up companies to increase competition probably wouldn't do the trick: Who can compete against Google without the data, the engineering teams, the infrastructure and the code?</p><p> We'll have to try something else. It might involve setting a legal standard for transparency, so that people will know how their data is being sold, for how much and to whom. Or it might require finding ways to limit the use of targeted advertising, so there would be less incentive to collect quite so much data about us.</p><p> Maybe what we need is a sort of internet-age analog to the ideal of public broadcasting \u2014 a new and parallel internet optimized for the citizen rather than for the consumer. Picture a space that isn't polluted with ads, that allows people to search for, say, information about health from sources that have nothing to sell them. We would go there to learn, listen and engage, and go back to the commercial internet only when we wanted to buy something. It might start locally, at the city or neighborhood level, curated and informed by local standards and customs. The people who created content could be compensated by their communities.</p><p> There's probably no single or perfect solution, but we have to start somewhere. Extrapolate 50 years into the future, when the big data of today will look puny and the algorithms inaccurate and modest. What kind of information economy will support a healthy democracy?</p><p> This isn't a technological challenge. It's a political imperative. We can't give away our democracy to a tiny group of profit-seeking corporations in return for a better shopping experience. At a minimum, we should demand that Facebook and Google make public all the data on their political ads, including who bought them and how they were targeted.</p><p> At least then we would have a better idea of what we're up against.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMN-38e727207b1bcb0f051c1799bf1f2c0e64ca0a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C91444CEB14 NWBKMN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGS-FC71-DXVP-V4R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409145</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 winonadailynews.com<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted how such information can be used, prompting calls for legislation and regulation. We also have concerns about big tech that go beyond social media. Google and Amazon also collect vast amounts of revealing information.  </p><p>One of my favorite quotes about social media is a quote from now former Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, who in 2010 said, \"With your permission you give us more information about you, about your friends. We don't need you to type it all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We more or less, know what you're thinking about.\" But are the risks associated with all of this data sharing and collection overblown? If not, what steps can lawmakers and private companies take to mitigate them?  </p><p>So our first panel will--the first panel and flash talk will discuss these and other questions. The second panel will consider whether big tech companies are too big. The Trump Administration and some Democratic lawmakers are interested in investigating alleged big tech antitrust violations. While there is by partisan concerned about monopoly, there are also worried that such anti-trust enforcement would be inappropriate and could stifle innovation.  </p><p>Alas, flash talk and panel will tackle online speech, their efforts to further regulate online ads, which raise a host of free speech concerns, allegations of anti-conservative bias in the largest social media sites have prompted discussions about content moderation, and the role of companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in our liberal democracy. Should these companies use the First Amendment as their guide? What are the risks associated with government intervention in online speech? </p><p>So the guests on the stage today, of course, not the only ones with views on these questions, and I urge all of you to take part in today's conversations by using the #CATOtechnology. I want to remind everyone this event is being live-streamed and recorded. No food or drink is allowed in this auditorium. If you have to enter during a presentation please use the second entrance down the hall so as to minimize disturbances. And with that, I want to turn over to my colleague Julian Sanchez, who will get started on the first panel, which is Big Brother in Big Tech. </p><p>SANCHEZ: Thanks for that introduction, Matthew. I am, indeed, Julian Sanchez. I'm a Senior Fellow here at the CATO Institute, focused on issues of privacy and digital civil liberties, among others. To my left is Ashkhen Kazaryan, who is the Director of Civil Liberties at Tech Freedom. To her left, Alec Stapp, who is a freshly minted fellow at the International Center on Law and Economics. And his left, yet again, your far right, Lindsey Barrett, who is a staff attorney and Teaching Fellow at the Georgetown University Law Center's Institute for Public Representation Communications and Technology Clinic. I will forego the extensive recitation of our panelists impressive curriculum vitae, since in this wonderful connected world you are able to Google details--extensive personal information about all these people. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So I--I want to begin by picking up where Matthew left off. It seems like a more or less weekly occurrence that we read some news story about how online platforms or in some cases, device makers, are using or providing access to individuals private data in ways that provoke unpopular backlash. And yet at the same time, we find user behavior not exacting, you know, a toll, apparently, on those companies as people continue to give up large amounts of personal information, perhaps in part because they are not fully aware of how their information is being collected and used. And perhaps, in part, because it's simply difficult to understand what companies are doing with that data, buried as it often is behind impenetrable legalese in terms of service. </p><p>We've seen growing calls, including from, in many cases, legislators who are normally fairly averse to regulatory interventions. I think, perhaps, as we've all become used to this ritual of story backlash, companies saying, \"Well, we take your privacy very seriously. We'll do better in the future.\" And just the--the pattern follows the--the old Smith's lyric, you know, \"They'll never, never do it again.\" Of course, they won't, not until the next time. </p><p>So, you know, as these calls for, it's often called baseline privacy regulation grow, we want to explore, one, the extent to which there is a problem that might justify regulatory intervention, what proposals to try and more robustly protect user privacy or advanced, and what some of the wrinkles and potential trade-offs involved in those proposals are.  </p><p>So I want to start by just throwing to the panel a question of how do we think about this problem? We know people like me, who are privacy advocates, tend to have a--a fairly high personal value they place on their--on their private information, but people's behavior in terms of, you know, what they're willing to give to sites in exchange for free service doesn't appear to track, you know, the--the answers, they often give pollsters about how much they care.  </p><p>So one question to--set up here is, what are the--what are the--the harms that we should be worried about in terms of the collection of personal data? And how should we interpret the fact that despite the sort of drumbeat of scandals, it doesn't appear to be altering user behavior? Is there a problem that needs solving? </p><p>BARRETT: So I think, and you touched on this point before, when we take behavior as the only kind of indication of what people want and, you know, how--how we should understand the need for privacy legislation, I think we're going to go pretty far astride. Because, of course, you know, we're dealing with so many privacy policy of each day, you know, there's no way, even were we able to sort through the, what is it, eight or nine privacy policies that the average person encounters each day, you know, they're impossible to read, the company can't necessary or, you know, whoever the entity is doing the privacy policy, they can't always disclose the risks because they don't know themselves. And then oh, by the way, people are bad at evaluating risks. So when we talk about kind of the link between behavior and what people want in privacy, I think we--we really have to understand the role that resignation plays, and just the fact that we're all swamped in an ecosystem that we can't really do much--we can't really do much to act on whatever preferences we have.  </p><p>SANCHEZ: Right.  </p><p>STAPP: I think that's an important thing to always be aware of the privacy paradox. And I agree that we have to look at both revealed preferences and--and user behavior and stated preferences on these surveys. But I think some surveys you don't get to hear a lot about the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within the Commerce Department. They survey these things on an ongoing basis. And the major concerns related to privacy and security risks have been decreasing slightly, but it's not increasing. It's relatively flat. People avoiding online activity due to security concerns also decreasing at a slight rate.  </p><p>And then ITIF surveyed people and said, \"In this trade off context of if you get benefits for giving your data away would you be willing to give, you know, a piece of sensitive data away? Would you be willing to share biometric data, medical data, or location data, in exchange for say, better targeted medical--medical services, or just better services in general, or discounts?\" And 60 percent of people said they'd be willing to share at least one piece of sensitive information. So I think when you recognize that you get benefits in exchange for this information you see the survey numbers change a lot. And then, of course, in revealed preference behavior we have things like DuckDuckGo if you want to use a private search engine that protects your privacy more than Google does and you also have browsers to do the same and frame Oh, sorry, </p><p>BARRETT: And frame-- Oh, sorry, Ashkhen.  </p><p>KAZARYAN: Oh, that's okay. You can-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Oh, no, I was just going to say the framing of these questions is important, too. Because if you say, \"Well, hey, wouldn't you like this nice, lovely benefit if you give away your health information?\" then most people will say, yes. But then you evaluate, okay, you know, what are--what are the kind of the amorphous hopes of what we can do with medical information versus how we know it can be misused? That framing is somewhat different. </p><p>STAPP: Yeah, and I think we definitely want to discuss the proper framing here. And I think that gets closer to the reality on the ground because when you do give away your data you do get free services in return. So it's--it's pretty concrete in the present, as well, as--as you see in practice. </p><p>KAZARYAN: And let me just jump in and not disagree with either or you but say that, first of all, when we look at these surveys it's a good thing that agencies do them because they're the closest to real life situations, and seeing where there's harm and where there's no harm and how consumers are being affected. But at the same time, these surveys, they're on a macro level, they don't really give us any sufficient data to go off on.  </p><p>For example, even me personally, when, if you ask me, I'm the person who emails every website that I want to delete my account from, and buffer them until they do that. But at the same time, I will sign up for any app you want me to if I need WiFi in an airport.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>It's, you know, depending on a day, depending on the situation, each consumer has their own needs. And what we should focus on is the real harms that are done to the consumer. And that's why the system that we have, like the Notice and Consent System that exists, that was created in the '70s, obviously, it's not efficient enough for the internet in the 21st century. And right now, 2019 is the Super Bowl for privacy lawyers. And we should all really, you know, gather our teams and focus and ask these hard questions to figure out what to do next. </p><p>SANCHEZ: Right. And so I think, you know, a lot you have gotten to the heart of--of common critique of the-the Notice and Consent model that governs most dimensions of privacy protection, that is the idea that the way your privacy is protected is that sites will offer you some degree of specificity about what their practices are, in terms of service, you know, that's the thing that everyone pretends to read before they click, \"Sure, let me use the thing.\" You know, after skimming through but not actually reading any of the 10 pages of dense legalese. And this is this sort of consumer evaluation and consent provides privacy protection. And I'm, you know, inclined to say we all recognize that is for better or worse, not very meaningful, right. And most people are not particularly meaningfully informed, you know, as--as Lindsey alluded to, a fair amount of research suggesting that it's not even, literally, physically possible for most people to actually read the privacy policies for all the sites that they use. That it would take, you know, essentially a month of their year to, if they were to actually just once a year read--read all of those documents.  </p><p>And so I wonder if, you know, how does--how does it sort of problematize the idea of consent when we sort of admit that practically speaking, the people who are agreeing to this stuff aren't reading it and don't understand what--what they're giving up? I think it's a little bit too quick to jump from that to a particularly regulatory solution as--as a solution but, you know, is sort of the heart of the way we approach this now, based on an unrealistic conception of what a normal user can--can sort of accommodate, has bandwidth for? </p><p>BARRETT: Absolutely, and I think with that acknowledgment that it's--it's simply not possible to sift through the thousands of times a day that someone asks us, \"Oh, okay, are you okay, with x, y, z,\" in order to do something like, \"Hey, I have a work email at this end of the airport. We have to understand in that context, okay, what is the what is the baseline of collection practices or use practices that just shouldn't be okay? You know, in--in other consumer protection context, we don't ask people to evaluate, \"Oh, okay, you know, some people are okay with a certain amount of lead in their paint. And some people are asking with a certain amount of toxins in their coffee.\" We say, \"All right. You know what? We know that in these decision-making contacts, this is bad for people and people are not able to evaluate or the--or the,\" you know, I--I don't know what kind of benefits or could be to lead in--in paint. But I--I want to say it was used for a while, and I probably should have researched this-- </p><p>STAPP: Delicious.  </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah, well, there. </p><p>SANCHEZ: It tasted sweet, right? Yeah.  </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah. But all of the various, you know, chemicals that, you know, we decided after a while, \"No, no, maybe it makes paint thinner, or, you know, dry more quickly, but, you know, toddlers probably shouldn't eat it,\" you know, that--that is similar to this context, in that people are not in a position to evaluate, \"Oh, what is the possibility that by using--by using a cell phone, someone is selling my location data to a bounty hunter?\" </p><p>KAZARYAN: Sorry, I was just going to say, the problem that we might encounter and fall into is what if we assume there will be harm but there's no real harm that we've seen? Let's say, you move to a new city, and based on whatever activity you had online, certain platforms start giving you ads for housing and for furniture and for jobs. Is there a real harm? Some people find it creepy. And I actually wanted to address that concept of creepiness because I'm afraid that it drives the debate often these days, especially amongst people who are not privacy lawyers or policy experts. And yes, it is creepy, but it's also helpful. I think we keep forgetting how helpful--helpful it is and how our understanding of creepy changes with time.  </p><p>If anyone remembers Caller ID debate when it used to be scary and people didn't like it and thought it was violation of their privacy. And nowadays, I know that if I see my mother's name on my phone I'm going to pick it up in the middle of this panel because she was going to assume I'm dead if I don't do so. I'm very grateful to the Caller ID law, you know, Caller ID technology for doing that. Even though it might be a little creepy.  </p><p>STAPP: And to follow-up on Ashkhen's about harm, I think it's important remember, I'm going to kind of quibble with the framing of the question that Julian laid out here, is that, yes, we don't have federal comprehensive baseline privacy regulation United States, but we do have sector and age-based privacy regulation that holds organizations and companies to a higher standard for those types of data. I think this matches pretty well with when you see people describe relative sensitivities of different types of data. So people are most concerned about their medical data, their financial data, their educational data, being leaked out. Well, we have things like HIPAA, FERPA, and GLBA, to address those concerns. And we are also concerned about children's data because they don't have as much of a--a rational sense of using these services as adults, we assume, then we have CAPA for that as well. I think it's a bit mistaken to say that we don't--that this is like the U.S. is like the Wild West of privacy. We do have sector an age-based privacy policies that I think match potential harms that we see.  </p><p>BARRETT: Well, at the same time, so for instance, housing ads, we want to consider kind of the incentives that the current actors in the ecosystem have in terms of how they might collect information and use it. So it--it can be great to get kind of location based ads or--or whatever it is, but also, Facebook is being sued for allowing advertisers to target people on the basis of, I think, it was aged disability, and--and whether they're Spanish speaking, for housing ads against the--against the Fair Housing Act. So we both want to understand what's possible, what's valuable, and kind of what companies are rationally incentivized to do when they know that nobody's going to come knock--knock on their door and make them not do it. </p><p>KAZARYAN: But we already have a system that will react to that, right. They're being investigated. Probably an agency or two are going to go after them. There's going to be probably a civil lawsuit also going after this. So any anytime there is any practice that is unfair or deceitful, there will be a reaction to it. </p><p>BARRETT: One can only hope. But so, Julian mentioned that I'm--I'm at Georgetown, IPR and we work a lot on children privacy, actually. And it's--it's fantastic because it is--it's an important area, you know, kids are not in a position to, you know, as adults aren't in a position to be sifting through the thousands of decisions we have to make each day, kids are not reading privacy policies, kids are not, you know, able to make those kinds of decisions. And the fact is, when we're looking on kind of things to areas where we feel like kids are being taken advantage of it is--there's more work than we could possibly take on in a lifetime. Because sure CAPA's there but the vast majority of companies putting the privacy policy, you know, and the privacy policy of a product that is, you know, a glittery kitten, puppy, baby, whatever thing that is clearly targeted to filter, that says, \"Oh, my God, no, only--only users 13 and over. We would never collect the children's data, never.\"  </p><p>And well, then you look at something like TikTok, which was forming with kids, and wonderful that the FTC, you know, brought that settlement-- </p><p>SANCHEZ: For those--for those who don't know what you're talking about do you want to-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Oh, I am. So TikTok is-- </p><p>SANCHEZ: --No the Kesha song.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARRETT: No. TikTok -- </p><p>STAPP: --They're possibly related.  </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah. It's kind of, vine clone. So brief--brief videos that you kind of swipe through the feed and a lot of kids using that platform and they have been for four or five years. And again, great that FTC brought that case. But there are all kinds of products where the same kinds of things are happening. So there's this fantastic interview with one of the co-founders of TikTok a couple years ago talking about, \"Well, yes, there are kids on our platform. What do you expect us to do about it? There are tons of kids on Instagram, and you know, there are kids on Instagram, there are kids on Snapchat, there are kids on whatever, you know, product you want to name. And--and this isn't just a vague concern of, \"Oh, no, the kids are using technology,\" we're talking about, you know, shady actors that have no reason to not, for instance, send kids, excuse me, send kids information unencrypted, send, you know, CAPA by using behavioral advertising, which is something that we saw in an FTC compliant we brought against the Google Play Store. </p><p>KAZARYAN: But here's where, sorry, here's where, okay, well, already have a lot that CAPA that protects, you know, children's privacy, if someone violates it laws are violated on a daily basis and all we can do is enforce them. We can't shut down the browsers or police every single online behavior to make sure it's not a kid that's on Instagram. My 12-year-old sister is on Instagram and I'm sure if I try to take it away, we won't have a relationship anymore. So there are definitely some kind of tradeoffs when you say, \"Okay, like there's a law, there are rules, there's an enforcement, but it's not enough. Let's go to the next level. Let's do even more restrictions.\" </p><p>STAPP: Yeah, just to follow up on that, I think we get my kind of get a little myopic with policy solutions when we think this is an ideal tradeoff between protecting kids and allowing people to use technology. Therefore, we need another privacy law, we need a new regulation from Congress. But also another way, as Lindsey mentioned, is that they're currently enforcing these laws just not enough to her liking and maybe we can agree on that. That means that we need higher enforcement intensity, maybe more resources for the FTC if they're already willing to pursue these cases, but maybe they're understaffed or something, but it doesn't necessarily imply that we need new laws. </p><p>SANCHEZ: Let's talk a little bit more (INAUDIBLE). Lindsey alluded to--to lead paint, this is a kind of a category I like to think of as exploding toaster regulation. That is, you know, probably the--the--the best case scenario for making our--for regulatory intervention is a case like an exploding toaster, or, you know, lead in paint where you've got a fact that it's very difficult for the consumer to directly evaluate, you know, \"Is this toaster going to explode?\" But also, you have an outcome that essentially, clearly, everyone agrees is bad, almost no one would sort of willingly unknowingly by an exploding toaster, unless they work in a movie prop department, maybe. And so it's not--you know, it doesn't involve a very difficult trade off to say, \"This is something that you would only agree to if you didn't really understand what you were agreeing to.\" So it's--it's, you know, an easier case to make to say, \"So, the rule should just be, your toaster can explode.\" </p><p>Privacy is a little more complicated there, because--because often, you know, people have more diverse preferences, but also it's often a little fuzzier what exactly the harms are, which doesn't mean they don't exist, but it is necessary to sort of articulate it because it's not necessarily as straightforward as, you know, what--what are the harms of lead paint? So what are we concerned about? We've heard people allude to the potential for discriminatory practices, you know, targeting ads or offering housing on the basis of race or other suspects characteristics. But what are--what--what is sort of the downside? What are the problems we should worry about as a result of, you know, companies like Google having the level of detailed information about people we would normally associate with a police state? </p><p>BARRETT: As problems (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I think, on a baseline level, you can't know what's--if you don't know how your data is being collected and used you can't be sure of how it's being used against you. So what one--one of the things that stuck in my brain is there was a--there was an article about period tracker apps. And one of them was ingenious enough to pitch to insurers that they could,--that they could tell insurers when women are--when employees are thinking of becoming pregnant. Which is horrifying to me because of how rampant pregnancy discrimination is. And again, despite the fact that there are laws in the books and you know, that I think, collectively, normatively, we would all say, you know, \"Firing a pregnant lady is bad because she's pregnant, bad.\" </p><p>So I think it's--it's both a matter of sort of the opacity of the structure that we're working in, and the fact that you can't bring an enforcement action, you can't sue someone, you can't do any of that if you don't know what's happening to you, or why it's happening. And just I think the because we are in a sector by sector system, sure, in--in these narrow columns we have particular protections that are reactively enforced, you know, when they're enforced, but that leaves a lot of information uncovered. So, you know, (INAUDIBLE) protects genetic information in certain contexts, but not--not that broadly. And sure--sure FERPA protects, you know, the specific--however, you define school records against disclosure in XYZ context. But then there was--I'm trying to remember, anyway, a test prep company that was selling school records or selling students information because that doesn't fall into the category.  </p><p>So overall, I think there's a lot of ways in which data can be used in kind of shady ways and you can't, you can't enforce against that if you don't know it's happening to you. </p><p>KAZARYAN: As the only other person on this panel who can comment on the period app-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I would say that, yes, that is awful. And--but that's literally just driving into a discrimination if they want--if they pitch that and if they went forward with that plan, they could be, you know--there will be enforcement against them. That is--there is no way that would be unnoticed. And this goes back to, you know, there are a lot of cases like this where Facebook's--Facebook gives ads to women who were pregnant and then had a miscarriage and that's traumatizing for them. And obviously, these stories, they have a huge emotional impact on our whole society. But what also happens is that platforms they adapt and they reshape their policies and they reshape the way they do the ads and the way they serve them to certain customers so this wouldn't happen. Because at least in this quite few years that I've been working in this field, I've noticed how fast the response is of a company's to the public opinion, way faster than their responses to government action against them. </p><p>STAPP: I have probably a narrower set of concerns than Lindsey but I--I try to look for things where there's--there's the likelihood of a market failure and therefore, a rationale for government intervention. And I think we're likelier to see that in cases of data security that rather than data privacy. And so if you look at things like data breaches that are in the news where, and again, not just data exposures, but data breaches where a bad actor actually took sensitive data from a company without consent, I think you see a misalignment of incentives there were companies, like in the Uber case, where they had like 50 million records stolen, and they redirected the hackers to their official Bounty Program to report it as a bug. And they didn't disclose that for a while, and then were later sanctioned by the FTC for that--that action. I think that's a case where, clearly, the user would likely never hear about that if the company didn't notify them at some point, and the company has an incentive to hide that information. So I think looking at data security practices, maybe a breach notification rule, would make more sense, but I think on data privacy in general, people manage their own tradeoffs pretty well. </p><p>SANCHEZ: What about concerns about--I mean, at the--at the heart of the--the Cambridge Analytica scandal, I think, was a concern, perhaps, you know, not--not fully realistic based on sort of the current state of the art of technology. But--but a I think, in principle, reasonable enough concern about the use of private data for manipulation in a way that implicates not just sort of individual harms but the civic arms in the sense that companies with enormous amounts of data battles may be able to--to nudge target manipulate us in ways that we ourselves are not necessarily aware of, but have implications for things like the integrity of elections. How--how realistic are those concerns do you think? </p><p>BARRETT: Pretty realistic? I think it can be tempting to say, \"Oh, well, we don't know,\" for instance, \"we don't know was it--was it the Russian trolls saying, you know, fomenting hate and bringing out both kind of replicating, you know, very real tendencies that people have, and--and just creating it out of the blue,\" you know, because we don't know if that was the--the clinching point of what turned the 2016 election then how can we say that manipulation is--is a real problem? And I think that's setting the bar a bit too high.  </p><p>It's like talking--if we're talking about market failure, we can't say, \"Oh, well, you know, people still use Facebook. Therefore, there's clearly no problem in our society with privacy,\" because there are all kinds of reasons why people need to or just simply do continue to do the things that they do. So I think when we're talking about manipulation we can talk about commercial manipulation and we can talk about more nefarious like in--in voting in various other normative areas that people will have a problem with, but it's very much a problem. </p><p>KAZARYAN: I think we should separate the two layers, though. I agree with you, this is too high level. When we talk about manipulation there's commercial, and then there's political, and then we have to talk about the political ad disclosures and the way they operate online and the way they should probably be a little bit more adjusted and developed, especially for the next election cycle.  </p><p>But then we have to be very clear on what is manipulation and what is advertising, right. So if we take political out of it and talk about it a separate panel or a separate whole conference, Matthew, we can talk about, \"Okay, well, is it manipulation that I'm getting ads for certain movies just because I buy online tickets for rom coms or Marvel movies? Is that manipulation or is it just serving the customer? </p><p>SANCHEZ: Yeah.  </p><p>BARRETT: I don't think anybody would. </p><p>KAZARYAN: Then--then what is manipulation?  </p><p>BARRETT: No, absolutely. And it's important to make sure that the definition is there enough because, you know, manipulating, if--if you're, if you're setting a ceiling too broad, like, yeah, manipulating is trying to get someone to do something like buy something. And, you know, that's--I think that we'll be able to carve out a kind of an understanding of all right, relying on people's vulnerabilities to get them to do something that is against their interest, you know, try and figuring out like, narrower understandings of what is manipulation, as opposed to, \"Hello, would you like to buy this thing?\" </p><p>STAPP: Yeah, I think it's definitely important to keep these two things and distinct buckets so we have our economics of privacy concerns, and also these distinct political concerns. But I think it's also important, once we get into the political bucket, to dive into the details and not get too panicked about these things if the details don't warrant it.  </p><p>So let's just make sure we reflect on the Cambridge Analytica scandal. What they were essentially doing was collecting data on American voters to categorize them, according to the Big Five personality traits and so then they can better target political messaging and they were political consultants selling this information. But research from political scientists and cognitive psychologists tell us that the magnitude of change you're going to get with these things is very small, it's hard to nudge people from a Democratic vote to a Republican vote entirely. So on the margin, maybe we're going to have some very small effect. But remember, this is a political consulting firm whose incentives as to say, \"We're the masterminds behind this election. We're the reason the outcome was different.\" But then if you look at the underlying research it tells us that it's much harder and people are much more complex to get them to change their boats. </p><p>SANCHEZ: So that's vote changing was only imagined, right. Hypothetical, evil, Facebook decides they want to change the outcome of the election they can pretty easily tell, you know, with a very high level of accuracy, who you probably are going to vote for. And so people who are going to vote the way they think is correct get a reminder in the morning, you know, this is your nearby polling station. Other people get a reminder that there's a great, you know, happy hour nearby, or--or just given news stories that prime feelings of resignation and helplessness that make them less likely to get out of bed and go vote. So, not--not essentially, you know, changing from Republican to a Democrat vote, but change your propensity to actually turn out. Is that--is that a more realistic scenario? </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah, because we--we saw it happen. we don't know about the--about, you know, what toggles were happening, but Facebook has conducted tests, including on voting and, you know, in--in--in their kind of, \"We're trying to make sure that everyone goes to vote.\" I mean, there's--there's no need for--there's not necessarily a need to read any sinister, you know, my God, which voters were they telling to go out and vote? But also, we don't know. And, you know, other--other experiments that they've conducted, again, we don't have a way of knowing. And I think-- </p><p>KAZARYAN: In my personal experience, so I've looked at the way that Facebook classifies me and they know that I'm a foreigner living in America and other things about me, they still always ask me to go vote, and I'm like, \"I'm Russian. If I go vote. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I might go to jail.\" So I think the--the algorithm is still not super like specific to you. It's more high level which makes it less damaging, first of all. And second of all, I just want to scale back a little bit and talk about vulnerabilities and what is vulnerabilities. I'm a woman, is that a vulnerability? Definitely, that information can affect my job applications, if I get into certain programs or not, many, many things, just the way I'm paid, the way I treated online and offline. So yes, obviously, but at the same time, it's such a broad category that without having that information a platform can really cater to your needs. So I think there's another conversation to be had about what is a vulnerability? If someone is a Bernie Sanders supporter, is that a vulnerability? I think, yes.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But it's all, you know, it's all very marginal. </p><p>STAPP: I just want to address Julian's point directly in this thought experiment--thought experiment on Facebook being the actor to directly nudge people to vote or not to vote. If Mark Zuckerberg runs for president in 2020 I will be much more worried about this scenario. But as I see current incentives at play, Facebook is a mass market platform, they have an incentive to be neutral, to address both sides of the aisle, in American political speech. You see this continuously with the censorship of conservatives' debate. And there's actually no real evidence for that because they have an incentive to keep conservatives on their platform as well as liberals because they want to sell as many eyeballs to advertise to.  </p><p>KAZARYAN: And if they didn't want to there can be a separate Facebook. Didn't Don Jr. want to create a Facebook for conservatives? They should do it if they want to because First Amendment and you can do and create platforms for whoever you want.  </p><p>STAPP: Surprisingly, it's not going great.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SANCHEZ: I'm shocked to hear. A separate conservative internet, which I suppose some people would--on both sides might think is a good idea. </p><p>So let's then sort of move from the problem to some of the proposed solutions, right. One thing about conservatives, they've prompted a range of legislative reactions at the--at the U.S. federal and state level abroad, obviously already, in terms of most well-known the-the GDPR in the EU. And I was hoping we could get sort of a taxonomy of approaches to it. So on the premise there is a perception of a problem requiring, you know, some sort of regulatory response, what are the sort of the flavors of solution that we are--should expect to see under consideration? </p><p>KAZARYAN: Before I pump this to Lindsey and Alec, I want to say, and probably we should have said in the beginning, that privacy, and we talk about privacy is this one big thing, but it's not, it's like saying Spice Girls, you know, there are different parts of privacy that are completely, you know, in need of different regulation, there's data protection, like GDPR. There are over like privacy rights. And some people say that privacy is a human right. Some people say that privacy is property, right. We can get into that later. But privacy is no one single concept and the information that is protected is not one single type of information. There's information that we share, our photos, our emails, videos-- </p><p>SANCHEZ: --The Posh Spice.  </p><p>KAZARYAN: Right, the Posh Spice.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>There is the information about our activity online, Scary Spice. And then there is the logical kind of explanation of number one and number two, that leads platforms or whoever collects and has that information, to some assumptions about us. That can be I don't know, Baby Spice. So there are different things. And so when we talk about privacy legislation we should keep in mind that--that there are so many different pieces of a puzzle that we're trying to regulate. And now I'm punting. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, I think if we're going to taxonomize different approaches, there have been a lot of--a lot of people thinking about that and pouring money into that and there's a bunch out there. High level GDPR does kind of privilege privacy and--and data production both as a fundamental right. It's built on both kind of a normative desire to treat privacy as an important thing to protect and kind of privilege that above other concerns, though, we have that as a model, a bunch of individual rights, real--real enforcement to back it up, expansive jurisdiction, all of that.  </p><p>On the kind of U.S. scrambling to, \"My God, what are we going to--CPA is bearing down on us.: We have that coming in the rearview mirror. here's been a bunch of state bills kind of emulating part of the CCPA, part of-- </p><p>STAPP: --CCPA for the-- </p><p>BARRETT: --I'm sorry, the--California Consumer (INAUDIBLE). There we go. And-- </p><p>SANCHEZ: --Should we--there's actually, looks like, you know, we should in a minute probably explain that in a little more detail so for those who are not already steeped in this stuff.  </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah. And then a bunch of different kinds of approaches bubbling up. So we've seen kind of bills that strengthen the enforcement side of privacy. So that's Ron Wyden has a great bill that would, for instance, in certain--certain circumstances, holds individual executives at companies responsible which I think. And in--in the TikTok case I mentioned before, commissioners Chopra and Slaughter filed a--a concurrent statement saying that they think that that's something that we should look at.  </p><p>Another bill is the Data Care Act, which is Brian Schatz and 14 other senators, which would apply more information fiduciary idea to data collectors. It's I--I--I--I think he kind of said, \"Oh, it's information fiduciary-like.\" It's not quite the same as the theory that Jack Balkan and John (INAUDIBLE) have put forward. And then there are--there are a couple other--there's a lot of other bills that off the top my head I couldn't rattle off. But-- </p><p>STAPP: I appreciate Lindsey, that you can see there are many different approaches that are being taken around the world today. But I think one thing that, a common thread that you see in many of them is that you have this essential--essentially you a Privacy Bill of Rights. And so they enumerate different particular rights. And I think we can just run through a few of them, because they all sound good in theory. I think we need to be careful about the costs and benefits of each associated right. And you see these appear in both GDPR and other bills around the world.  </p><p>So right of access. If the company has data about me I have a right to access it and ask them what data they have. The downside of that is if my account gets hacked the hacker has the exact same right, and they can export all my data. We've already seen this happen with GDPR in Europe.  </p><p>Right to be forgotten. So if I want to kind of erase certain sensitive information about myself from the internet, or from a particular company, I have a right to be forgotten. But then we also have to think about who has the highest incentives to exploit this feature? And we see that scammers are using people who have been convicted of crimes to kind of erase the--the trail of--of their misdeeds.  </p><p>Data portability. So if you have data at one company and this isn't particularly people think it's important with social networks, if I can export my data from Facebook to a--a new social network. I think it's important to keep in mind that the Cambridge analytical scandal, from another lens, is looked at as having too many data portability, a third party took your data out of Facebook. As well as the direction of portability doesn't get discussed enough--because--because startup companies will be creating new data and then Facebook will be able to have you import that from the startup to Facebook as well. So we're not sure the direction of--of movement there.  </p><p>And then finally, the last one I want to point out, is the right to opt out. In many cases, we already have a right to opt out in the United States. But the key differentiator you see in many of these privacy bills is that once you opt out the company is required not to discriminate against you as a user. But as we know, many of these services are free to use and that's exactly because of all the user data that's contributed to the platform so they can provide ads. And if certain users opt out it's a clear and classic free writer problem, where some users are subsidizing the privacy of others to use those services. So I just want us to keep in mind as we hear these rights, they sound really good, but there are costs each of them. </p><p>KAZARYAN: And to kind of continue with you both were saying, I think a framework that we believe is the right way of thinking about it and structuring this privacy debate in 2019 is, okay, what are the rules that we are all 100 percent sure should be there, you know, the ones that have the bright lines that we all are going to not cross? And they'll--those can be in a privacy national legislation. And then we say, \"Okay, whatever standards that should be in place that we all also agree on and use when we decide case by case where is the violation of privacy rights and where there is not? </p><p>I think that in kind of--in conjunction with enforcement, will be a really good way for the United States to move forward with updating our privacy laws, while also not just copy/pasting the European approach that obviously applies to, A, their legal system, that's very different from American common law system. B their political views and their political history, that's very different from American history. And C, just the way the enforcement works in both kind of regions is so different that every time you try to implement and copy/paste something, it's--it's going to just break your own system. Which is what we see in CCPA, because not only it took a lot of things from GDPR, it even went further, and that's why we're all, you know, in a rush to talk about privacy and in a rush to pass something on a national level, because even groups that are more on the left of this issue, I've heard them agree, maybe not in public, but in private, but also in public that CCPA is going to break the internet. </p><p>SANCHEZ: So this actually, let's--let's--let's maybe dive into that a little bit. So a couple people have alluded to California's consumer privacy legislation, which will sort of have restrictions that kick in starting in I think, 2020. And one reason I think we're seeing a lot of legislators and even tech companies now very quickly making their peace with the idea of federal privacy legislation is the idea that sort of state--state alternatives are already in place are already going to kick in in ways that are--the companies find extremely onerous, and they would rather have that legislation preempted by a--a federal approach that at least provides a single, as they would prefer less--less--less restrictive standard across the board.  </p><p>Is there a case, you know, just sort of on--on, I guess, direct commerce clause, kind of federal grounds for saying, \"Well, if states are going to act, and we're going to have a kind of 50 state quilt of different restrictions, it would be better to have a federal--you know, a single federal rule?\" </p><p>KAZARYAN: I mean, it's going to be a black mirror episode on January 1, 2020, if this happens, because not only big companies--here's the thing, big companies can always adjust. Big companies hire thousands of lawyers and the big tech adjusted to GDPR in no time, they can throw money at the problem and it goes away. What will happen--will that Mom and Pop shops, eCommerce, websites that are nonprofit, websites that actually help facilitate discussion and free speech, will be the ones that are hurt because you don't have a team of lawyers complying, restructuring the way your business or just your website or your platform operates.  </p><p>And either we're going to have a separate internet and companies who are going to decide, \"Okay, I'm not going to work in California. I'm going to work with California residents.\" And then California residents getting VPNs to try to actually get those services. Or we're going to just be, you know, another situation that might happen is California is just going to--California law is going to become the law of the land because everyone will be like, \"Well, let's just do it.\" And then, again, small businesses and eCommerce is going to suffer and consumers, too, because of that. Consumers are going to be so confused and just lost in this huge amount of rights that they're getting.  </p><p>I would also like to say that just the California law itself was passed in not just a rush in basically a blackmail type of situation, that I personally don't believe is a democratic process of passing such crucial law. And I hope that we can all figure out some way to preempt that black mirror episode from happening.  </p><p>SANCHEZ: Just to--to reduce the confusion in--in--in the room, does someone to volunteer to kind of give a--a more concrete sort of rundown of what is in the CPPA? </p><p>BARRETT: Nope.  </p><p>SANCHEZ: Okay.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KAZARYAN: Okay. Let me just say, like, there are things like, you know, what information the company has on you, they have to have like databases for separate types of information, you--you have a right to know why they have that type of information. You have a right, not only you, but like other organizations can sue on your behalf, I believe.  </p><p>And the thing about California law, is also that it's like 3,000 like pages or something. I tried last night to read it again and I just gave up. And that's why all these wonderful privacy experts also don't want even get into it. Because none of us actually think--none of us think it's really that great, right? I don't want to speak for you. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, no, I mean, I was on a train. I've--I've had a big week.  </p><p>But no, I--I think we--we can also talk about kind of the--there's the content of the California law and then there's also preempt and writ large. So when we're talking about a baseline privacy, like some--some future, hopefully, magical, federal privacy law, of course, you know, it'd be lovely if they're worse privacy law that we can all agree on, and you know, we could all go home and be happy. But there isn't any inherent virtue in passing one single standard if it's not better than what we already have.  </p><p>And another--a couple important points to keep in mind are, one, you know, companies have always dealt--you know, now--now we're talking about my God, the crazy patchwork, but companies have always dealt with this--with this patchwork. There are 50--50 data breach notification laws. And, you know, the vibrant internet that we know today grew up in that, you know, in that--in that chaos so there's that to consider. And we also want to keep in mind, when we're talking about kind of the differential impact of regulation on different sizes of companies, we don't want to get to a point where that argument is used as the basis for no regulation at all because that's the logical extension of it.  </p><p>With the--the GDPR in particular, we've seen various ways that businesses cope. So for instance, the New York Times switched to contextual advertising, which--which actually works under the--which complies with the GDPR and they saw their revenues go up. So I think to some extent, the arguments that \"Well, my God, if we pass a new law, then we couldn't--you know, the--the small businesses will immediately flounder and die,\" is probably not the most realistic assessment of what will happen. And I think when we're talking about preemption, we need to keep in mind that, one, the--the crazy patchwork is what we've always dealt with. And we don't want to preempt, just for the sake of preempting that.  </p><p>KAZARYAN: But the difference is-- </p><p>BARRETT: --Sorry.-- </p><p>KAZARYAN: So the difference is, with data breach laws, the 50 data breach laws, only thing companies need to know is what state the user is in, and then just notify them about a data breach. It's not that hard. With privacy, the way California law operates, you would need to restructure your whole system. Another thing about the GDPR point you made, yeah, companies sought a revenue up because a lot of new companies couldn't come to the market. </p><p>STAPP: Yeah. And I think I just want to emphasize that Julian asked three supposed privacy experts to describe on the record what is in CCPA and we all hesitated because it was written in less than two weeks, and is evidently contradictory in many different places. So going on the record and saying, \"Well, it says this or doesn't say that,\" is--is risky. And I think just to make that concrete, the opt out provision that is in GDPR is also in CCPA, but it--we can't tell yet whether it's nondiscriminatory or discriminatory. So in one place it says that if a user ops out of data collection they have to be given the same exact services as other users. But then in a different place it says that if a user opts out of data collection, they can be given discounts. And I can--you know, free services can be contrived as a discount in many different ways. So there's, obviously, going to need to be fixes to California law before it goes into effect next year.  </p><p>But also it's more to keep in mind why think Julian mentioned that some tech companies are coming out in favor of these laws, especially federal comprehensive privacy legislations, because they're global tech companies this is these are the Apples, the Facebook's the Googles, it's because they've already invested billions of dollars and millions of hours complying with GDPR, and they can just port that system over to the United States for a relatively low cost. So it's in their self-interest to do so and their smaller competitors who haven't already been in compliance with GDPR won't be able to do so as easily. </p><p>KAZARYAN: So this is what we would call the Spotify model for that California law would create. So Facebook, let's say, potentially would have or whatever new website like the next Facebook would say you pay $5 and you get to see your grandma's posts, and then you pay $10 and you see your mom's posts, and then you pay $15 and you see your friends post. And like, it will be like a subscription model. And I'm not saying a subscription model is a bad thing but when you talk about information it's different than like getting services for a subscription. </p><p>BARRETT: And then just to--as a final asterisk, one thing that we should also keep in mind when we're talking about kind of the--the objectives that we hope privacy laws will have, we, obviously, want to keep in keep in mind, you know, what is going to entrench the--the behemoths and what is going to make it difficult for new models that Facebook can then, you know, clone and copy and, you know, RIP Snapchat, et cetera. But we also want to keep in mind, you know, privacy laws are intended to deliver privacy rights and small businesses can violate your privacy, too.  </p><p>SANCHEZ: But actually, I want to just dive into the weeds in a couple things. I'll keep talking about sort of a free rider problem with respect to (INAUDIBLE) requiring services to provide to people who choose not to provide their information. It occurs to me I free ride pretty egregiously, insofar as I use plugins like Ghost Story that block and tracking and I'm going to sites--I'm visiting all the sites that have a revenue model that is based on showing ads, and I've chosen not to look at those ads and indeed, to deprive them of information about my conduct. And that's a sort of non-regulatory, private solution that--that nerdier people like me-- </p><p>KAZARYAN: Have you used (INAUDIBLE) mode to look at New York Times articles? </p><p>SANCHEZ: I--I plead the fifth.  </p><p>BARRETT: No, comment.  </p><p>SANCHEZ: No, I actually I--I subscribe to The New York Times, don't ask about The Washington Post. </p><p>But so, you know, I mean, is--is that, like as a practical matter, we already have substantial ability to free ride by depriving companies information at their revenue model, to some extent. It depends on, I think, it's if the company sort of seem to be surviving, mostly because not that many of us do it. In practice, is that--is that a--a kind of threat to the lifeblood of digital economy? </p><p>STAPP: Yeah. Well, I think I'll leave it to the moral philosophers to decide how bad that action is really, to free ride off of these new services. I think it's important to keep in mind that news services do charge a monthly subscription fee after you passed the paywall, which they're currently is no option for Facebook or Google for that option. So maybe if free writing increases with laws like GDPR and see CPPA then we'll see a move to a more paid model and that, again, that's just a higher cost to consumers in the--at the end of the day, </p><p>BARRETT: I think we should also, you know, there--we should also maybe hesitate to just characterize all--using all kinds of ad blocking services as free writing. So there's all kinds of reasons why you wouldn't want every company under the sun. So I used (INAUDIBLE) as well and one of the reasons that I use it is it blows my mind to see the kind of--the, like, just volume and range of trackers that will follow me on various sites. So I think in--if we're characterizing using ad blocking tools as a free rider problem, we also have to think it's a problem is the internet isn't usable in an enjoyable way. Like, if we're---we're talking about, you know, people with attention problems who are being battered with, you know, our auto-play video ads every time they try to read like that's also a problem. </p><p>KAZARYAN: But it's also of a difference between us making a private choice of using those extensions and technology versus government saying, \"Okay, you web browsers, you built into, you know, your technology those things, so all the users just bite the bullet, like don't see ads or don't get tracked.\" There is a difference between government fully reshaping the market and users making a choice and enough users making a choice but the market reshapes itself. </p><p>STAPP: And I think it's important to mind that we're discussing currently available free tools to protect your privacy that thousands, and thousands, and thousands of people use. And beyond that, Apple explicitly pitches itself as a company that protects its users' privacy because their business model is aligned with that they sell you hardware, they sell your services. And so if you would like to pay for a more private experience on your mobile device, or on your computer, you can go to Apple for that and then use Ghost Story and use other services.  </p><p>SANCHEZ: Oh, this--this--I feel like this begs a kind of Anatole France response, right the law and its majestic equality prohibits the rich as well as the poor from, you know, begging in the street and sleeping under bridges. </p><p>STAPP: Used iPhones exist, Julian.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>SANCHEZ: (INAUDIBLE) great data extraction opportunity.  </p><p>So what I think a couple people have touched on is a kind of potential intersection here with the level of competitiveness in the market. A lot of the folks who are concerned about, you know, the privacy implications of data being collected by firms like Google and Facebook are, in essence, concerned about it as one dimension of a broader concern about the dominance of these handful of platforms, at least in the sort of English-speaking market. But there's also been suggestions I think that are plausible that a lot of the kind of regulatory interventions we're talking about are--plausibly will have the effect of making it more difficult to compete with them. These are, in a sense, companies that already have I kind of a special ability to extract consent from users, right. Facebook and Google already have your eyeball at their portal in a way that other targeted advertising firms, as a rule, don't. Is--do we think there is a tension potentially, between sort of the regulatory intervention and concern about the down ends of a small number of platforms?  </p><p>And on the flip side, how much of our concern about privacy is in part a concern about people not, you know, not really having a choice between a lot of different options that--that would allow them to express a preference for greater privacy?  </p><p>BARRETT: I think that's absolutely a concern. So one thing that I highly recommend, if you haven't already read, Kashmir Hill at Gizmodo did this-- </p><p>SANCHEZ: --I know Kash very well.  </p><p>BARRETT: --Yeah, well, she did this fabulous series of actually trying to extricate the big tech companies from her life. And as you will see, it is comically, unfortunately, very difficult. So I think when we're talking about kind of the realistic possibility of people being able to make choices based on what--what they think companies do with their data, we have to talk about how possible it actually is. And I think also, it's important to remember, again, at the end of the day, you know, differential compliance is an important thing to think about but small businesses can also violate your privacy. </p><p>STAPP: And I think I just wanted to point out that Kashmir Hill's peace series, which is great, can be viewed from different lens to wear these companies provide very valuable services to people for low or no cost. And so that's why you see them around and so omnipresent in your life. But it is a concern I want--I want to maximize choice for you as well. If you really want to opt out of--of big tech that should be an option. I think it's--we need to be clear that there is a direct trade off between privacy regulations and competition in the market.  </p><p>So for the reasons that the traditional compliance costs are large and fixed so the big players have the lawyers they can afford to comply, that's one reason there's a tradeoff. But it goes beyond that. I think Julian's point, we need to be very clear about the difference between first party ad networks and third-party ad networks. Facebook, Google, they're first party ad network because they have a one to one relationship with the users and they're going to get consent every time. So GDPR really entrenches them in the market and that same thing will happen in the United States. we already have data on this. In the--in the EU, third party ad networks have lost 18 to 32 percent of their market reach in the first six months after GDPR. Google, Facebook, Amazon, they've seen their market reach go up because they have those first party relationships. If that's a tradeoff we're comfortable with to get more privacy regulations then I think we should just be aware of that trade off as we're making it and not kind of deny it. </p><p>KAZARYAN: With the 2020 coming up big tech is going to be one of the main issues on every platform in each party. So my question just is, I get it, like tech industry was developing. It's not like a junior anymore. It's a big adult industry, hence we're going and asking hard questions. But also have you ever tried getting out of the bank system or an insurance system? Can someone try to live without those? It will be very difficult to fully operate in our society without them. And honestly, I'm more just I don't trust banks. I don't trust insurance companies. They have a lot of my personal data and I don't know what they're doing with it. </p><p>SANCHEZ: All right, if--if your argument is, you know, Facebook should be no more regulated than banking and insurance-- </p><p>KAZARYAN: --No. No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SANCHEZ: --Facebook is probably not very happy with it. </p><p>KAZARYAN: No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, there are other industries that have similar kind of, you know, weight on it. And the difference with technology is it's actually something that is pushing our society forward. And it's something that's giving people with disabilities opportunities. It's something that's giving people who live across the world from each other an opportunity to connect. It's something that's giving countries that have tyrants governing them a chance to get democracy and organize. So, we can't do the same thing we do to the banks to the technology. And also, to close my point, towards MySpace and Yahoo!. </p><p>SANCHEZ: As a--as a--as a--kind of--right before I turn to--to questions from the audience, I just want to consider whether there are other options. I think a lot of us would agree that the--the--the current model involves people very often agreeing to--to terms they don't understand very well. They may be surrendering more privacy than they mean to and maybe getting benefits in return, but--but maybe not reflecting their ideal preferences.  </p><p>At the same time, there are downsides that we all seem to acknowledge to regulatory approaches sort of on offer. I've always viewed this as essentially a kind of UI, user interface or user experience design problem, right? So, fundamentally, the problem is, at some level, it is very difficult to present users with control over their both information about how their data is used and control over it by--in a way that's sort of salient to them and--and prompts good decisions and just doesn't overwhelm them with checkboxes. </p><p>And so, I'm--I'm sort of wondering if there are approaches people kind of envision or can--you know, have seen that they think--provide an opportunity for improving on sort of our--our current, you know, click acceptance and--and pray model that--that also sort of reflects the--the range and diversity of--of people's concern about--and privacy--and how--and their willingness to share data. </p><p>BARRETT: I think it's--I mean, there's been a lot of work in this area because, again, like, just the way that kind of--the layout of a website, the--the way that kind of you interact with the environment you're in can very much shape the decisions that people make. I haven't seen anything that I think is--you know, the--any kind of silver bullet. There's been great work trying to automate privacy policies and kind of minimize that process knowing the decision to take that people encounter. And there's--(INAUDIBLE) is one. There are a couple of various--like, bro--(INAUDIBLE) extensions. There's a great project over at Carnegie Mellon doing a lot of work on this. </p><p>And I think those are--those are fabulous, those are important, and we need them. They're not--they're not a replacement for a curb on exploited practices, but they're--they're really important. </p><p>STAPP: And I think--I like Julian's way of framing this as a user interface problem because just imagine every service you use on the internet and you go to the privacy tab on the home screen and then you go to the control panel. People have a wide range of preferences about the level of granularity they want to be able to control on that. And because these are mass market platforms, there's a single pane. And so, they're only going to hit probably the median person for their preference for control over their privacy. </p><p>And so, I think the best solution here is competition and choice. So, having more platforms that are targeted towards different levels of privacy preference. And in this case, that means that we need to be very concerned about the unintended consequence of comprehensive privacy regulation that reduces choice and entrenches the incumbents further. </p><p>KAZARYAN: I think user experience is crucial. And in my personal experience, Google's privacy tab is very helpful. You just go and you're, like, don't track my--what I watch on YouTube and don't track what I Google. It's pretty straightforward. Users--a lot of the users--my kind of problem with this is they don't even know what kind of privacy rights or privacy little circumstances there are that they can control or that apply to them and in which ways. So, I ha--I haven't seen it. I don't think it is possible, at least right now, to have a comprehensive overview of every single thing that can happen to you online. And then, a tool to control that. </p><p>And that's why we should have, you know, bright line rules and we should have standards that we can hopefully all agree on that can kind of guide the discussion and guide the user experience. </p><p>SANCHEZ: So, let's, since we only have a few minutes left here, turn to the audience. We have some folks coming around. I would ask folks to first give us your name and any affiliation you choose to or refrain if you prefer to remain anonymous.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And please, keep your questions to a sentence or two. You know, the span of a single breath, perhaps. And, you know, elevate your voice at the end to indicate an interrogative as opposed to a disquisition.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Let's start over there, I suppose, since you're already at the mic. </p><p>QUESTION: I know. But--so, I'm Jonathan. I work at The Glover Park Group doing research on a variety of issues and trying to understand this one more. My two questions, keep it in one breath, is how do you solve the business to business issue in this market because we've been talking about it from a consumer or government angle, federal or state? But, a lot of the incentives are business to business.  </p><p>And the second question connected to that is the implication in the framing of consumer versus government is, right, you pay nothing? But, the business's incentive is then you take your data and sell it. So, it's actually probably worth more than being free given the business to business model because they consistently make more money off you, right? That's what banks do with you--when you put a dollar in, right? So, how do you solve this business to business issue? And the second question is, is your data actually worth more than being just free? Like, is there a monetizable amount that you deserve for what you're giving them? And do you have thoughts on that? </p><p>KAZARYAN: Didn't someone recently do research on--it was, like, $26.50 per person?  </p><p>STAPP: That sounds high. </p><p>KAZARYAN: Yeah. Right? </p><p>STAPP: It's very--it's very-- </p><p>KAZARYAN: --I'm just--that's--that's very deep philosophical ec--economically and social questions that I don't know if I can answer in, like, a minute. But, I think it's important to kind of go off of what is the (INAUDIBLE) because if someone is making money off of you while--I mean, so what? </p><p>STAPP: Yes. I think--I think to--to kind of rephrase your first question--I assume you're referring to data brokers where, like, a profile's being created about you and it's being sold between businesses? </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC). </p><p>STAPP: Yeah. </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC). </p><p>STAPP: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's definitely--it's--it's an important point and one that wasn't discussed in terms of drawing this distinction between relationships that the user has directly with the company or these third-party relationships that you're not even aware are going on. I see the potential there for more of a market failure, but I also want to ask you to keep in mind the benefits of these things. So, oftentimes--let's say it is being used to market things to you. That feels icky. But, it's also being used to prevent fraud. So, banks use these data profiles a lot to prevent financial fraud. And you--and the 23andMe example you bring up, that's how we're catching serial killers now. It's also how we're going to be using the data to-- </p><p>KAZARYAN: --Heal cancer. </p><p>STAPP: Yeah, to create genetic targeted medicine. And so, I think there are huge benefits that we need to keep in mind. I think small incremental reforms--like, I know that Tim Cook proposed--because right now, you can go to every individual data broker and ask them to delete your profile and not collect data on you. But, it's a--it is a--it is a cumbersome process and it's difficult to do. I reckon--so, the option is there, but creating something, like a centralized exchange where all these--these data brokers are required to make it simpler for you to opt out, I think, is something that we might be open to. But, we also need to recognize the benefits of having these profiles in public. </p><p>BARRETT: Well, and I think another important thing about kind of the business to business side is--it's not as though because the business that you are--that the user is working with is then selling your--or sharing or whatever, you know, words we want to use, your information to somebody else. It's not as though you have--you're not implicated in that. I--I think that there can be a tendency to say, oh, well, then, you know, why would you care? Of course you care. And you know, making sure that consent, whenever it's obtained, is actually informed and understands where your data is going in this giant ecosystem is really important. </p><p>SANCHEZ: Is that--I mean, but is that--is that, I think (INAUDIBLE). Sorry. Foreign scan (INAUDIBLE). Helen (INAUDIBLE) has--has written compellingly about that just the--the--the--the back end data flows are so complex that it is really just not feasible for people to have any real understanding of--of how that works. That--you know, essentially either, you know, you can have--a binary system says, you know, no or yes. But, the idea that these individual consumers are going to understand the contractual relationship between, you know, a platform and 50 different other entities they're sharing data with is--is sort of excessively demanding. </p><p>KAZARYAN: Right. But, the second there is harm, FTC comes in, right?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARRETT: One can only hope.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>They don't seem to be doing a ton of coming in that much all these days. But--and I think the other thing to keep in mind--I lost my train of thought. </p><p>KAZARYAN: I'm so sorry. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARRETT: No. No. </p><p>STAPP: Well, I--I agree that--that we need to look at staffing resources at the FTC, but I also wanted to--we have some data on this. The FTC's taken more than 500 enforcement actions on privacy and security related issues since 1998. So, they--they are taking action. And I think something that could potentially change this debate I think significantly is that the FTC still has an going investigation into the Facebook Cam--Cambridge Analytica scandal and there are early reports that this could be a multi-billion dollar fine.  </p><p>So, I think the--the jury is still OUT on what the FTC's actually doing. </p><p>KAZARYAN: And when you say 500, it means there are 500 cases that all the companies hopefully follow, you know, the decisions that were made in those cases. Companies are, like, okay. I should not do X now. And then that adjusts the landscape. </p><p>BARRETT: 1998 was also a while ago. </p><p>STAPP: Five hundred is also a lot. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SANCHEZ: Let's--let's see if we have any further questions. The front row. </p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Thank you for an interesting talk. My name is Steven Keat (PH). I'm a retired state department official. And also, in my time at the state department, amongst other things, I worked in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. So, I know for a fact that I'm on a lot of Chinese, Russian, et cetera databases. I also have a pretty good idea of what the U.S. government is capable of gathering, right? </p><p>So, looking at what companies are doing, which is what you're addressing today, and looking at governments' roles, I'm, quite frankly, not very confident in relying on governments to protect us. And I think that in the end, it comes down to us as individuals to protect ourselves, with the exception being people like minors and people who are incapacitated where you might want to be looking to the parents to protect them. So, this is a question. I would like you to comment on that, please. </p><p>BARRETT: Yeah. I mean, I think it's--I think we're--we're talking about pretty difficult problems to tackle. I think we can absolutely talk about how the government has failed to safeguard its--its own information, you know, OPM. We can talk about kind of the (INAUDIBLE) enforcement, whatever--whatever you want to talk about.  </p><p>But, at the same time, I think saying well, you know, everybody's bad at it, let's hope that individuals can do better, I think, is kind of forgetting about how--how difficult it is really for anybody to--as we were talking about, you know, we're in an ecosystem where you're (INAUDIBLE) how--however many privacy policies a day. We don't know what every business that is collecting our information because it might not even be the one that we're contracting with. You know, they're--these are risks that are so far beyond both individuals' ability to kind of allocate risks and to control or--or change them, even, if they are aware of what the risks are. </p><p>So, I--I agree with your frustration with government failing to protect privacy and companies failing to protect privacy. But, I don't think saying, oh, well, people just have to go out and forage for themselves is a good solution. </p><p>KAZARYAN: So, the OG big brother--thank you for that question. Julian and I both work on surveillance reform and I think it's a great question to highlight the difference between companies and the way they handle privacy rights and the way--the way they handle our information versus government. I believe that we have way more trouble trying to get anything out of a government and any reform and any transparency or fairness or process or checks and balances into the government process spend the--the mechanisms, us, every day people, have and power we have over companies. So, Julian, you want to-- </p><p>SANCHEZ: --Yeah. I mean, I guess, simply just note that--right. As--as folks may not know if they're not steeped in surveillance. One of the--one dimension of concern about platforms is that under sort of current supreme court jurisprudence, it's been attenuated a little bit by some recent decisions. But, data in the po--broadly speaking, data in the possession of these platforms loses substantial--substantially its fourth amendment protection under a doctrine that holds that you sort of assume the risk of disclosure and therefore waive your privacy interest and information that you've permitted a third-party corporation to retain.  </p><p>And so, you know, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are delighted to have this trove of information that they're able to get with usually much less stringent legal process than a probable cause warrant. And so, one dimension of this is both--it is very difficult under current law to kind of provide information to accompany without also, in effect, giving access to the government under a--a greatly diminished standard. And also, the governments themselves seem to have attention in their interest. You know, on the one hand, we have these proposals for greater privacy protection being (INAUDIBLE) out. At the same time, you know, we have calls for stricter data retention, right? The--the most privacy best practices include the idea that you purge data when you don't have a need for it any longer. At the same time, law enforcement agencies would very much like if platforms were hanging on to data longer for their own purposes. </p><p>Do we have time for one more question? Two minute--one more question and then let's see if we can slip--slip one in. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. My name's Robert Benton. I work with the--the Counter Extremism Project, which is about bad content online, but this is a completely separate question. And my question is, you know, as--as someone who thinks about free markets and appreciates them, I hear what's talking a lot about, you know, the--the way that different regulations could harm small businesses. But, if we take a step back, isn't this more about aligning incentives?  </p><p>One of the reasons maybe we don't have a central place to go and make big privacy decisions online is that the online community has no incentive to offer that, you know? And if change the incentives to say, you know, you do have a responsibility to manage our privacy better, don't you expect that some really smart people in Silicon Valley are going to start a new company that says, hey, if you pay me two or $3, I'll fix this problem for you? Or, from the GDR perspective, there are new companies popping up, as I understand it, that will help small companies comply better with the GDPR regulations. </p><p>So, it's almost like you change the economic incentive and then you let technology and you let commerce take over and companies come to fill that gap so that they can bridge the space between the small companies and the GDPR. </p><p>KAZARYAN: In an interest of saving time, I'm just going to refer to you to everything I said before  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>and say that nerding harder is always just kind of a default setting for Silicon Valley and technology companies and they do react to the incentives. Us having this conversation is an incentive for them. And for California shop clock is an incentive for them. </p><p>STAPP: Yeah. And I just--I would just break this into two separate answers. One on, like, the data broker's business to business level. I believe the way Tim Cook lays it out, this would be a pretty simple exchange that wouldn't require tech geniuses to build. In fact, we'll see how that works. But, then on the user to business, direct one to one relationship, I think companies already have an incentive to respect your privacy and give you privacy control in line with privacy demand. And so, insofar as you've changed the incentives with the law, I think that's another way of saying imposing cost on users and being misaligned with their natural interest. </p><p>BARRETT: I think we also--I hope that there are incentives for the build--building up of perfect privacy controls that can allow people to manage everything to exactly what they want and need. But, we--that can also kind of deflect from the fact that we do need a--a baseline law that kind of--that cuts off the--a--a baseline of exploited practices and collection practices and a focus on kind of transparency in tools isn't going to do it. </p><p>SANCHEZ: Well, it sounds like a more complex version of the do not call list, right? The idea of being something, like, the regulatory intervention might be--there's going to be, you know, privacy.gov or whatever or some privacy equivalent. And just, okay, if a user sets some kind of privacy preference at this one location, other sites have to sort of respect that without making them check a box. Is that--I'm--I'm--I'm--I'm wondering how feasible that is sort of just logistically, but--and--and whether-- </p><p>KAZARYAN: (INAUDIBLE) panel. </p><p>SANCHEZ: Yeah. This sounds like it's one for the next panel. And I think we're out of time. So, I--I--I'll--I'll hope we can bat that to a--a future panel. It's an interesting--interesting thought, though. Please, join me in--in thanking our panelists. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>KAZARYAN: Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>FEENEY: Thank you very much, Julian, and thanks to Ash, Alec, and Lindsey for the thoughts that I'm sure will provoke continued conversation. Before we turn to a break, which will happen at 11:00, I want to hand over to Burcu Kilic, who's the director of dig--of the digital rights program at Public Citizen.  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VK2-9VD1-JDPT-T3VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

My name is Ilya Shapiro. I'm the director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute and this is the third inner series on coronavirus and the Constitution. Three months into the pandemic, things are opening back up and fits and starts with legal challenges about lingering shutdowns that may no longer be justified as well as other shutdowns that were always on dubious legal grounds.  </p><p>We're still talking about the state's police power to govern for Public Health and Safety. And this is a power that's not unlimited like any power but governors and mayor's do have broad discretion assuming they have a good enough justification for putting in their restrictions and regulations.  </p><p>Three months ago, these officials were acting on the best epidemiological data. The idea is that we were all potentially fists swingers. You know, my freedom ends at the point of your nose. Well, if asymptomatic people could transmit a deadly virus, then shelter and place orders and the like could be justified.  </p><p>Some state actors have gone beyond their state constitutional limits. A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin found that that state's health authorities violated the separation of powers, went against Wisconsin administrative law. There's also been lower court rulings in Oregon, Ohio, and Illinois about different aspects of those states shut down orders in whole or in part.  </p><p>I think that's gratifying that we still have checks and balances that we--the--the--there's no pandemic exception to the Constitution as the Supreme Court of Texas put in a concurrence a few weeks ago. And this all goes to Jacobson versus Massachusetts of famous Supreme--our now famous Supreme Court case from 1905 allowing mandatory vaccination. Although, Jacobson still recognized that there are limits, let me quote from that.  </p><p>If health regulations went beyond the necessity of the case and under the guise of exerting a police power violated the rights secured by the Constitution, the court would be bound to hold such laws invalid. And so, even beyond kind of broad-based challenges to lockdown orders, some specific measures have gone too far. Restrictions on drive-in churches when drive-in liquor stores across the street are open. Tennis courts, roping off store aisles that have so-called non-essential goods rather than simply restricting the number of people per square foot of a store, that sort of thing.  </p><p>A woman in Dallas who was jailed for opening her hair salon that was ultimately reversed. An Ohio Court ruled stopping the closure of gyms because it wasn't the proper authorities, they weren't exercising that kind of power. The Attorney General last month sent a letter saying that the federal government would be enforcing people's civil rights and it's done so in several occasions particularly with regard to religious liberty. And the Supreme Court speaking of religious liberty just last week issued a five-to-four decision not stopping a California--a restriction on in-person church gatherings although that might need to be re-evaluated now that California has permitted the demonstrations and protests.  </p><p>And so if churches are similarly situated to those kind of secular gatherings, maybe the law looks different. Even if the orders all go away tomorrow though, people won't feel safe right away. although, public opinion is changing rapidly on all of that and shows that private action is just as or more important than public law. Now that we flatten the curve preventing hospitals from being overwhelmed, indeed health care workers have been laid off, people want to resume their lives and recoup as much as they can.  </p><p>Conventional wisdom is that we could get things moving quicker if we have broader testing programs and more ambitious contact tracing. But can the government any level force you to get tested before you go to certain places or participate in certain activities? Can it make you wear a mask whenever you go outside? Can businesses require temperature testing at the door? Can the government work with technology companies and force you to download apps to track your phone and make sure you're following distancing guidelines? Whether digital or analog, what kinds of powers can contact tracers have, and how does all this relate to the Fourth Amendment?  </p><p>For all of these issues, I'm going to turn to my colleague Matthew Feeney, the director of Cato's Project and Emergency Technologies and federal FTC commissioner, Christine Wilson who had a very interesting May 13th op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, coronavirus demands a privacy law. Turn it over to Matthew first. Matthew seems to be muted.  </p><p>FEENEY: I'm here now. Sorry about that, yes.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: There we go.  </p><p>FEENEY: There we go. So thank you--thank you really and I'd like to start by pointing out that I come at this through technology and civil liberties perspective. I treat this issue as one that--that implicates obviously the Fourth Amendment which protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures as well as new and emerging technologies. And we're in a situation now where it looks to many people as if increased surveillance would actually be very useful. We're in a situation now where there's a ongoing pandemic and you can reliably tell a lot about the spread of the pandemic depending on where people have been arguably.  </p><p>And the issue is that many people have talked about emerging technologies in the context of contact tracing which is to find out more about where people have been and people they've spoken to. And that many of the viewers will be familiar with the Fourth Amendment which protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures. And since 1967, the expectation of privacy tests has really been the lodestar of this amendment. And when we're thinking about (INAUDIBLE) rotations as well as some of the emerging technologies we've seen recently, there are--there are two cases I'd like to discuss because I think they're relevant to the conversation that Ilya outlined.  </p><p>The first is U.S. v Jones which concerns the use of a GPS tracker on a Jeep. Here, the law enforcement officials put a GPS tracker on--on a Jeep belonging to Antoine Jones who they suspected of being a drug dealer. This was done without a valid warrant. And there, the court took a bit of a dodge by saying well, this physical attachment onto the car actually implicated a trespass onto the vehicle and therefore it's unconstitutional.  </p><p>It's a notable case because there is a five-justice so-called shadow majority where you had justices, the--the traditional liberals as well as Alito arguing basically, well, it can't just be this. We have to think about reasonable quotations and tracking. The other is a case that came out a few years ago. This is cop into the United States. There's--many viewers will be familiar I hope that the phone is playing a constant game of Marco Polo with nearby cell towers.  </p><p>This case involved the government access to information gathered about Timothy Carpenters' whereabouts in order to secure a conviction for armed robbery. And what's interesting here is that the Court did hold that the warrantless collection of these kind of records for about a week did violate the Fourth Amendment but it's a very, very narrow holding with the Chief Justice noting that the opinion didn't touch other surveillance technologies. And this brings us to the ongoing conversation about the kind of technologies we're concerned about. You've seen some people from Apple and Google talking about Bluetooth technology so that if you download a certain app, your phone will notify you if you've been within physical proximity of someone who's tested positive for COVID-19.  </p><p>The issue here is that because Carpenter's a narrow decision, we haven't had any ruling on this technology per se. What I will say is when it comes to government mandating of the downloading of apps onto phones, you potentially do implicate Jones here because it is potentially arguably a trespass onto your property. This and other issues were discussed by present professor Rozenshtein from the University of Minnesota law school who had a great article about not just how this is a potentially a trespass but also raising the issue of the special needs doctrine that under the Fourth Amendment, there is a special needs exception. Usually, this is discussed in the context of drunk driving stops or searching, student-athletes.  </p><p>But we do know that for example, justice Cavanaugh does believe for example that the bulk NSA metadata collection was justified under special needs. And it's possible that you could have a pandemic special need. Ilya didn't mentioned that the so far isn't a pandemic exception to the Constitution but that's the kind of question I think Wolf will have to consider if it becomes mandatory if there's government mandates for certain technologies to be installed or owned. And with that, I'm happy to turn it over to Christine.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Before Christine starts, I should remind the viewers that you can ask us questions whether on the website or through Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube using the hashtag Cato Scotus. Christine. You're muted now, Christine.  </p><p>WILSON: There you go. And we were warned not to make the mistake.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Technical hosts should have reminded every buddy that were--the technical who should have reminded everybody to mute themselves and then unmute. That caused more problems than it fixed.  </p><p>WILSON: So, thank you Ilya for inviting me to participate in the program, and thank you Matthew for laying such a great foundation for my discussion. I come at this as a perspective of a lawyer who practices consumer privacy data security law. The Federal Trade Commission has--does have responsibility for consumer privacy and data security enforcement in the United States. </p><p>Using its general authority, we do not yet have a comprehensive privacy law--of federal privacy law in this country. We do have some sector-specific privacy legislation including health data, financial data, children's data. But lots of gaps are emerging as technologies evolve and we also have a multiplying set of state and international regimes which is creating a patchwork of laws. And so on a bipartisan basis, for many years, the FTC has called for federal privacy legislation that would create predictability and certainty for businesses but would also provide consumers with transparency about how their data are collected, used, monetized, and shared and the transparency would help create digital trust.  </p><p>People may be unwilling to adopt new technologies if they're not sure what's happening with their data and in any event, people can make more informed choices about what products and services to use if they understand the implications for their data. Now, the coronavirus as it began to spread around the world drove a new aspect of these discussions and I believe underscored the need for a federal privacy law.  </p><p>As efforts to engage in contact tracing and containment of the virus began to multiply, we saw mandatory apps deployed around the world. We also saw mechanisms formerly used for prisoners applied to those exposed with COVID-19. So for example risk trackers--mandatory risk trackers and--and this, of course, raises concerns particularly because we're talking about sensitive health data, sensitive location data. And privacy principles have a lot to say about these issues including use limitations for data that is collected.  </p><p>If you're collecting it for purposes of containing the virus, it shouldn't be used for any other purpose. Data minimization only collect the data that you actually need to implement the contact tracing and containment of the virus. But this issue is also important for Fourth Amendment reasons and this is one of the things that I wanted to emphasize in my op-ed. Matthew described the reasonable expectation of privacy test.  </p><p>And when you understand the implications of that test, you begin to realize that the commercial data--that the data that's collected on the commercial side actually is intricately related to government action. It is, you know, the reasonable expectation of privacy test really complicates the relationship between government action and commercial data collection. And so, we're talking about heightened concerns here and in fact, we have heard that recent initiatives to track protesters maybe using contact tracing information which brings yet another wrinkle to this story.  </p><p>Last weekend, Minnesota's public safety commissioner used to praise contact tracing to describe law enforcement efforts in connection with the murder of--with the protests that we're taking place in--in connection with the murder of George Floyd. And the statement it seems to have triggered widespread social media claims that contract tracing apps are being used by law enforcement agencies to track protesters for nonpublic health purposes. And some of the social media discussions referenced the technology that Apple and Google have worked on that--that Matthew described for us.  </p><p>Interestingly, Travis LeBlanc who was a Democrat on the privacy and civil liberties oversight board here in the United States sent a letter to acting secretary Chad Wolf on Monday to the Department of Homeland Security. He said, the pandemic is not a Hall Pass to disregard the privacy and civil liberties of the traveling public and I concur heartily in--in what Travis said. So the point of my op-ed even before the protests over the murder of George Floyd raised new issues was to say we need federal privacy legislation that can help apply some of the principles, the very familiar principles that we talk about in the privacy arena to the collection of health data, location data and--and with these established legal boundaries, companies would be better equipped to determine when the government is asking them to cross the line for the public good and whether they should require a subpoena or inform customers before turning over the data.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Great. Thank you for that Christine. Matt, do you have anything in response to that or did--did Christine's remarks trigger anything that you wanted to add?  </p><p>FEENEY: Only the very briefly that I think the commissioners comments really do highlight that the Supreme Court set the--the floor, not the ceiling. That although we might be upset with a lot of Supreme Court precedent when it comes to things like the (INAUDIBLE) of privacy test or the third-party doctrine and a host of other issues, nonetheless that doesn't prevent the legislature from improving upon that standards which is obviously what Christine is calling for.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Yeah, I didn't know the--  </p><p>WILSON: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, I was just going to say there's a great book called (INAUDIBLE) data that traces the line of Supreme Court cases that culminates with Jones and carpenter and makes the point in the last chapter that technology continues to outpace what the courts can handle and that it really is up to Congress to step in and address this issue. And so I completely agree with Matthew that the Supreme Court is setting the floor but we can do better.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: The court also never wants to get ahead of technology whether we're dealing with the Fourth Amendment or privacy area or antitrust or any--any legal areas where technology can disrupt as it were legal doctrine. And so in this area, what's interesting about the confluence of the Jones and carpenter cases is that this is, you know, Fourth Amendment privacy protections often bring the left and the right together against the middle or rather they, you know, the principle versus the pragmatic if you will on the court. And so in these cases, you see justices Sotomayor and Gorsuch perhaps forging the next doctrine. You know, the reasonable expectation of privacy that doctrine 50 years old in an analog world that in turn updated previous doctrine from the early days of the telephone maybe now in the digital age whether you're focusing on peoples--strong protections for their personal effects which can be all contained effectively on your phone.  </p><p>Think about, you know, your financial health records family photos, so much is on that one little device more than the police could get from, you know, two hours of ransacking your home perhaps. You know, those kind of principles the meaning of those things along with Justice Sotomayor's concerned for interpreting people's privacy and in a modern age where police have different tools and--and what have you.  </p><p>And it could, you know, people have been expecting even as the court takes very small steps in the Fourth Amendment arena to update doctrine. People have been expecting kind of a super session of the reasonable expectation test but maybe this emergency-type unusual pandemic related situation will provide a case contact tracing or otherwise where--where that will happen.  </p><p>FEENEY: We have a question that maybe we should address at the outset, kind of the most obvious ones. Matthew, why don't you, this is comes in from a Singlard Broussard (PH) who asks CAN states require their citizens to download a contact tracing app. My understanding of the--the law is that no, it would, of course, they could have a certain circumstances, I suppose. You can imagine a situation where there's--again, this gives us back to--to--to special needs where there's actually potentially a carve-out. But as things stand especially in this context, I don't see that being legally feasible.  </p><p>Something that we should keep in mind is something like the following which is you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy and illegal contraband or illegal behavior necessarily so this gets us back to technologies or techniques like drug-sniffing, dogs. So I suppose it's hard to imagine how this would work. But if there was a technology that only notified the police when you broke some kind of lockdown order, then potentially you'd be in safe legal grounds but at the moment, I don't see that being feasible.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: And I'll remind people that you can ask your questions either on the Cato website if you're viewing it there or on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube with the hashtag Cato SCOTUS. Christine, as you're looking at and proposing a federal privacy law, how do you delineate what's there for--for whether the FTC or another federal agency to do versus leaving things to the States?  </p><p>WILSON: So with that, is--it's a great question that--that actually proved to be one of the two sticking points in--in getting federal privacy legislation across the finish line. The first sticking point has been preemption and should there be preemption including of California's new law CCPA which sets a very high bar for privacy? And I think that preemption is important because the internet doesn't stop at state boundaries let alone national boundaries.  </p><p>I believe that the Federal Trade Commission should be given authority to enforce federal privacy legislation and that the state AG's should also have authority to enforce that legislation as force multipliers for the Federal Trade Commission. But--but I think that state laws that set different levels of protection for consumers will--will just maintain this patchwork of--of laws that is going to lead to consumer confusion about what their rights are and what kinds of data are allowed to be collected in any different--in any given state. And then also chill innovation and investment in new technology by companies who are--who are facing a essentially a patchwork of laws and need to tailor their efforts to a lowest common denominator.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Just to be clear for the non-lawyers watching, preemption means that sometimes the federal government can through the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution can trump state law that's to the contrary, the preamble--can preamp that law in that--in the legalese. But of course, you always have to look at whether the federal government has the requisite powers. In this case, it would be to regulate interstate commerce with data traveling all over the place as well as these--these civil liberties concerns.  </p><p>But you--you could have a cooperative federalism in a sense or rather state and federal regulations that both have to be satisfied when dealing with this sensitive data. Matthew, did you have something to add there?  </p><p>FEENEY: No, I would only--actually, something did just occur to me. So that you have seen that there have been states that have passed their own privacy--privacy laws in California being perhaps the most notable. And I think the experiences that should make us cautious about what's involved in federal privacy legislation because I--part of what I worry about is not only privacy but also speech and making sure there is an innovative entrepreneurial market for tech. And I do worry that if we're not careful that Congress could end up passing some kind of federal privacy law that actually is anti-competitive that only powerful marketing (INAUDIBLE) can comply.  </p><p>WILSON: Yes. So Ilya, if I could take a moment. That--that's actually--that's the experience that the EU saw with its privacy legislation GDPR. And they saw an increase in the market shares of some of the largest incumbents for advertising like Google and Facebook and they saw a venture capital investing in smaller companies dry up because of this--essentially this entrenchment of incumbents and the chilling of competition.  </p><p>Given so much emphasis on privacy, the costs of compliance were incredibly high and a lot of smaller companies either couldn't afford those costs or chose not to bear those costs, you also saw lots of US companies withdrawing from the EU market because of the cost of compliance. And so I completely agree with Matthew that we do need to take competition into account. We don't want a privacy law that chills innovation and stifles competition. At the same time, a privacy law could help boost trust in new technologies.  </p><p>Right now, consumers realize they have no transparency with respect to what data is being collected and how it's being shared and deployed. In fact, Matthew was talking about mandatory use of apps in response to a question about that. In fact, if it were voluntary, the Washington Post conducted a poll and found that basically, more than half of Americans would be unwilling to download those apps because they don't trust that the tech companies are going to keep their identities private if they end up testing positive for COVID-19.  </p><p>And so that lack of digital trust leads to a lack of use of emerging technologies and, you know, and that can lead to chilled innovation, decreased incentives to invest in innovation. But during the time of the pandemic, actually, the lack of confidence in tech companies and contact tracing could prove fatal. So there are--there are very serious consequences of getting it right but also of not doing anything.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Yeah, sure. Like with any regulation you have to guard against the--the--the big established incumbent player is always having more money to spend on compliance officers and lawyers that--that can crowd out there--their would-be entrepreneurial competitors. Matthew, I know that we've been talking in the last week's offline about whether digital contact tracing is even effective. I mean if--if you're in a fairly dense urban environment and you get a ping that you're somewhere close to or have been somewhere close to someone who is infected, how useful is that and conversely, would it give, you know, a danger that they're by, the authorities would just lock down, you know, a thousand people that are in a relatively small geographic area just because everyone's so close together without really giving any parsimony to the--to the contact tracing?  </p><p>FEENEY: That is--that is a real concern. I think--I hope that lawmakers and law enforcement officials are taking lessons from the current pandemic. I think it's fair to say that you can make a strong argument that this kind of contact tracing is highly effective at the beginning of the outbreak where you have a handful of cases. However, where we are now, I think there are serious questions about how effective it would be.  </p><p>So, for example, as Ilya pointed out, the--the Bluetooth technology or that kind of technology that's been discussed in this context notifies you if you've been close to another telephone which presumably is on a person who is tested positive. Now, if you're in a--in a dentist's apartment building or looking out on the street and a bus pulls up next to you and the person inside the bus has that's a positive and you're outside the bus and you--you are negative, it's--it does not exactly the kind of dangerous exposure that I think a lot of people who are designing these technologies are--are worried about or--or health professionals are worried about.  </p><p>Other factors that you're going to put a lot of people into lockdown in many, many environments if that kind of tracing is what's used. And some could make the argument, of course, that look, maybe it's better to be overly cautious, oh, we should lock down an entire apartment and buildings or maybe whole towns and cities because, in this kind of environment, everyone's going to be notified they've been in close contact. And now, that's been a question for local officials about how much of the economy they're willing to sacrifice for that kind of degree of--of health and public safety.  </p><p>But I think it's very important is and I'm glad Ilya highlighted this, it's very important that as well as the constitutional issues and the legal issues, we should also have a discussion about the technology and whether it would even be effective at this point.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Here's a related question from Aaron Kremen (PH). Is an additional app even needed? All phones are tracked now, I would assume that information is de-identified to some degree. But we know through the accuracy of online advertising that you don't actually have to actually know who I am in order to know who I am.  </p><p>This gets to a doctrine that we haven't discussed which--which piggy backs off reasonable expectation which is the so-called third-party doctrine. This idea being that you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy and information you \"volunteer\" to third parties such as your telephone company or your internet service provider. And Congress has improved upon this floor and--but nonetheless, it still remains the case that you don't have the degree of privacy and a lot of information you give to internet companies that you would of--of--pieces of property you have in your home for example.  </p><p>So the question is correct that there is a lot of information out there already about where phones are located. But that was the kind of data that was at issue in carpenter, for example. And then, I think if the court was to consider other kind of tracking technologies, they would likely come to a similar conclusion in carpenter which is well, for this particular kind of tracing as used by governments, that's important.  </p><p>You know, the fourth member protects against government action. As far as the government's concerned, actually this would probably run awry of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. But when it comes to whether Google could just volunteer all this information to the FBI or to the Department of Justice or to Health and Human Services, that's more in Christine's wheelhouse I suppose. But I would say that at least from a law enforcement perspective in the wake of Carpenter, you hope that they'd be somewhat hesitant to try and engage in that sort of snooping.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Christine, do you have anything on that?  </p><p>WILSON: So I would say that goes to the digital trust issue. We have seen Apple respond vehemently when the government tries to collect information from it with respect to potential crimes that have been committed. And it is--it is an ongoing question that companies are grappling with, when and under what circumstances do they need to turn information over to the government and--and--and we saw in carpenter one answer to one narrow question. We've also seen with respect to contact tracing and with respect to other technologies deployed, these questions are arising and I think federal privacy legislation could have provided some guardrails here.  </p><p>But, for example, we saw a Facebook turning over information about where people were at various times so that the--the efficacy of quarantine and stay at home orders could be traced and supposedly all of that information was de-identified. We see Facebook deploying surveys across the country to--to collect information about symptoms and giving that information to researchers. And--and so Facebook has said well people consented to sharing this information because, you know, we have a privacy policy and people are supposed to read it and they're supposed to consent before they can use our services.  </p><p>And the fact is no one gave consent have their information used for purposes of contact tracing in a pandemic. No one had a pandemic in mind when they opened a Facebook account and gave consent. And I'm using Facebook as an example and maybe even as sort of a proxy for many other tech companies. But these are the kinds of questions that--that we do need to grapple with. When information is collected by a Facebook or a Google or any other tech company for a certain limited purpose of providing a service, is it then okay for them to use the data for a completely different and unanticipated purpose?  </p><p>And so federal privacy legislation would presumably provide some guidance about purpose limitations. And--and so there are--there are lots of questions that are emerging, and frankly we have more questions than answers. And it's one of the reasons I put in the op-ed. It would have been really great to have federal privacy legislation in place to at least provide some guardrails to help us grapple with some of these issues during the pandemic, and now during nationwide protests and a national unrest.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Here's a related question from--  </p><p>FEENEY: If you don't mind--go ahead, yeah. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Oh, sure. Go ahead. </p><p>FEENEY: I was just going to say that Christine's last comment reminded me of the case Jones which we've discussed before where Justice Sotomayor and her concurrence actually put her finger on exactly this concern about what kind of good sense there is when it comes to these technologies and she asked \"I would ask whether people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the government to ascertain more or less at will that political and religious believe, sexual habits and so on.  </p><p>And I think this exact question that we're trying to grapple at the moment raises those issues which is well, because you click on the terms and agreement when you sign up for a Facebook account or Gmail, does that really mean that you're consenting to all the kinds of behaviors that are going on behind the scenes? So what Facebook and Google are doing with that data? And that's--that's a difficult question for I think lawmakers to grapple with because on the one hand, these--these companies have to be careful with their Terms of Service, but on the other hand no one's ever got to read through the dozens and dozens of pages necessary so squaring that holes going to be difficult.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: There's a related question from Singlard Broussard (PH) again good--good second question. Apple and Google defined some privacy standards that the app developers have to comply with to be able to use their technology. Do you--I think this is probably more directed to Christine. Do you see this as a restriction of the government's sovereignty or I suppose an attack on, I don't know, FTC jurisdiction or something or rather as a welcome initiative to protect privacy? And how would your proposed federal law--I'm adding this part--how would your proposed federal law affect this question?  </p><p>WILSON: Great question. So the Federal Trade Commission over the course of many years has set out general principles with respect to consumer privacy. One of those is accountability for--for companies. And--and in lieu of federal privacy legislation that puts limits on the kinds of information that can be collected or the kinds of uses to which information can be put, the Federal Trade Commission has urged companies to abide by many of these principles. So data minimization.  </p><p>Only collect the information that you need for the purpose that you're using it for so that among other things if you're hacked, that information is it is more limited in scope and can perhaps do less harm if it's exposed. de-identification, if you don't need to have identities associated with data, don't keep that data in--in that way.  </p><p>And so, a lot of those principles that the FTC has put forward and frankly that a lot of good privacy-focused organizations around the world have put forward are--are being adopted by companies in--in--in the vacuum that's been created by the absence of comprehensive federal privacy legislation. And so the point is if Apple and Google are imposing minimum standards on the apps that are in their app stores, I would like to take a little bit of credit for the FTC, for the fact that, they are doing that that the Federal Trade Commission has long urged companies to bear more of the responsibility to not rely solely on consent when we know consumers can't possibly read all of the disclosure that--that they received their--their friend studies done that calculate the hundreds of thousands of hours it would take for a consumer to read every privacy policy for every website and every surveys that the visitor uses and it's a massive number of hours, hundreds of thousands of hours that it would take us.  </p><p>Until we know consumers aren't reading it and part of a--part of the consequence of that is to say businesses need to be more accountable for risk assessment, risk management, having privacy policies in place, having vendor management principles in place so that if you give information to a third party like a researcher or a data broker, you are also asking them to be accountable for what they're doing with that data. And so maybe--maybe a bit of a long answer but--but I view those guidelines that get imposed as it's very welcome in--in the marketplace.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: I have a couple of questions from anonymous about HIPAA, the Health Insurance Privacy Act. I don't know if Matthew you've come across that in your research on contact tracing policy. One says my neighbor has COVID. I feel they--I guess the government, the local government or someone should have informed me. But are they protected by the Constitution to keep that info private? Well, it's not the Constitution it's HIPPA. And so we have how does HIPAA factor into the contact tracing or privacy discussion? I mean, the Health and Human Services is charged with enforcing it but how do--do--do other agencies also get involved? </p><p>FEENEY: Yeah, I'm afraid I don't have as comprehensive an answer as the questioner might ask. I've spoken offline with a health policy director, Michael Cannon (PH) about HIPAA in other context and I know we did, or at least we're planning to do an event on a book called Big Brother in the operating room or in the hospital to get the exact title. But it's certainly true that look, that there's a lot of sensitive information about some people's health that is also about that but I don't want to claim to be a HIPAA expert. And so I'd rather encourage anyone with questions about HIPAA particular to follow the work of Michael Cannon and his colleagues because it's something that he's solely keeping an eye on.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Yeah, I--I--I'm a simple constitutional lawyer so don't know much about HIPAA.  </p><p>WILSON: Okay. So I can--I can talk a little bit about HIPAA, Ilya. So HIPAA protector information--HIPAA protects information in the hands of medical providers; your--your doctor's office, your hospital. But it does not collect health information. It's collected by say a Fitbit that you wear on your wrist or by health apps that you use on your phone. And frankly, that's one of the gaps because of emerging technologies that I mentioned for--for yet another rationale for federal privacy legislation. And so there is a lot of information, a lot of health information that is collected now by devices and--and is not covered by the protections that HIPPA offers because that data is collected and stored outside of providers offices and hospitals and so on.  </p><p>And so, if--the question is a good one but I think it also reminds us, there are exceptions for--for various reasons both under HIPAA and under, for example, children's privacy laws where for safety reasons, information may need to be disclosed. And so the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control has long had the right to get information about people who test positive for various diseases like tuberculosis. And--and so in certain circumstances, we cannot expect privacy about, you know, illnesses that we have or diseases that we're carrying because it is necessary to protect society.  </p><p>And so COVID positive names were reported to the CDC under various state laws and I think even a federal law. And so that is--it's something that we expect in this kind of circumstance and maybe it fits into the special needs exception that you mentioned at the top of the hour, Ilya. And so--so again, there are tensions, there competing interest in privacy and the need for protecting the welfare of society. But--but HIPPA is--a HIPAA is an example of a place where we're seeing gaps emerge.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: I had no idea that we had knowledge about HIPAA on this program. Fantastic. We have a question now from Facebook, Guinevere Liberty Nell (PH). I don't know if Liberty is her actual middle name or (INAUDIBLE) but either way terrific. And she asks could anyone private or public be held responsible for not enforcing social distancing or other rules if people get COVID-19 by way of recklessness whether by lawsuit or other means or are the only dangers being too harsh on liberties?  </p><p>I'll take a first stab at that by way of directing this question more to my colleague Walter Olson who was on our first coronavirus in the Constitution series and he's been writing about potential problems with being sued if you do sue and if you don't if restaurant or another business takes measures or doesn't take measures. The liability issues are pretty tricky and that's why there's been a lot of debate in Congress, some question about whether Congress can change the rules for-for tort suits after all, for--for the country, whether it can preempts state law, there's that word again or whether this needs to be on a state-by-state basis.  </p><p>But yeah, I mean this is that does open up if--if you went to a store and a week later, you have COVID, what do you have to prove? Can you sue that store in the first place? Even if the story ultimately wins, that's a lot of legal fees. What kind of precautions the store have to take and if it takes those precautions and you, the customer, or an employee still get sick, what does that mean?  </p><p>These are all very good questions but it's--it's, you know--with not many answers right now, it's--we're kind of planning on--on an open playing field but--but as I said, Walter Olsen has written about this. Matthew or Christine, do you have anything on that?  </p><p>FEENEY: I would only add that it strikes me as just very, very difficult to be able to show for sure that you definitely got ill from a particular person or a particular store. I mean, one of the difficult things about this virus is that you can have it for a while before exhibiting symptoms and you can catch it from people who aren't exhibiting symptoms. So that--that strikes me is a potential difficult barrier. But--but I, of course, defer to my colleague Walter Olson on anything to do with tort and liability.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: All right, we have a question from Steve Dewey (PH) in Arlington Virginia right next door to where I am in--in Falls ChurchVirginia. He asks what kind of differences exists in state emergency decree-laws that is the some states have no emergency decree laws, some have laws for certain time periods, and have some state governors imposed emergency decrees that are both illegal and unconstitutional. I'll take that one.  </p><p>Yeah, this is an issue of state law and I don't claim to have expertise over any States law really but each state has a different constitution, and states also, of course, have police power. That is the--the--the public officials in those states exercised certain powers that might not even be listed in the Constitution unlike what is in the Federal Constitution which is a finite list of all the powers that the federal government has.  </p><p>Now, those state constitutions and related federal state statutes will have limitations or regulations about how those powers can be exercised, for how long, when the legislature has to get involved if you're exercising emergency powers. Of course, we're in an unusual type of emergency when you tick--think about the typical emergency weather a hurricane or a tornado, a natural disaster, whether a mass shooting. These things are short term by definition. They end in hours or days and so there's not much more of a question of these broader powers lasting indefinitely.  </p><p>Well, we're now as I said in two the third month and there have been disputes including litigated in state courts about legislatures trying to override or end or sunset certain powers and courts ruling that certain powers indeed have sunset because there hasn't been legislative ratification, others continue. And that's a very I think healthy debate to be had.  </p><p>Congress has passed obviously the PPP and other federal legislation. Certain states have done as well. So it's not that legislators can't meet at all. It's not like they've been bombed and they literally do not exist. So state constitution and state laws do impose certain kinds of restrictions. Of course, certain places, even if the legislature acts, the governor might veto that kind of restriction. So you do have attention.  </p><p>In some cases, something that could be characterized as a state constitutional crisis but that's a very good question in these times. A question for commissioner Wilson. Can you give more details or examples of what companies employed contract contact tracing to track protesters in Minnesota or if indeed they did so? This is an urban myth based on this exaggerated statement by a police commissioner.  </p><p>WILSON: (OFF-MIC) details other than what has been reported publicly. The--the gentleman in Minnesota used the word contact tracing and then I think tried to clarify what he said. But there are other examples reported or rumored on social media to be occurring. I don't know which specific contact tracing apps were deployed. But I think this is--this example highlights at least two or three issues. First of all, digital trust and it's one of the reasons that in the Washington Post survey that I mentioned, people are very worried about downloading these apps. Among other things there's just a lack of trust in--in big tech in whether our privacy will be protected.  </p><p>Second of all, it shows that purpose limitations are important. We--we want limitations put on the uses to which data can be put once it's been collected from us. And so, if I download a contact tracing app for purposes of, you know, the altruistic purpose of protecting society, I don't want to be a spreader of coronavirus unwittingly, and so sure, I will let a company know that I have tested positive and--and--and for altruistic purposes, others can be notified if they come in contact with me. But I certainly don't want my information including my location information to be used for a variety of other purposes.  </p><p>And third, I think it just highlights this connection between information that's collected for commercial purposes and information that ultimately gets used by the government. There is this inextricable link now because of the reasonable expectation of privacy test. And so, we're talking not only about Fourth Amendment but we're also talking about First Amendment. Right to free speech, right to assemble, free exercise of religion. Lots of civil liberties issues have popped up because of coronavirus and because of the national protests that we're seeing and--and the uses to which our data are put.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: We have a couple of related questions about actions by private businesses or companies. can shops and restaurants require temperature checks or documentation of negative tests or contact information for later tracing? That is you make a restaurant reservation, you give all your information that's stored in a log query whether the government then looks at that log at some point or not. Do workplaces have the right to require this from employees? And relatedly, what about immunity certificates to board and fly airplanes?  </p><p>What I'll just say about all of this is that if it's a rule put in by that private business, restaurant, shop, airline, well, they can put in pretty much whatever rules they want and you can decide then whether you want to go into that store or restaurant or fly that--that airline. It gets a little different if--if it's a government--becomes a government rule or regulation. But again it's--it's subject to that police power over which the--the challenges that we've discussed about, you know, for the last couple of months about restricting gatherings and closing businesses and shelter in place, and all the rest.  </p><p>So if there's some justification for that kind of government regulation, then it could be allowed. Now, in terms of keeping people's information and having the government check that later, that runs into some problems with for example Supreme Court decision in a case called Patel versus city of Los Angeles where the Court struck down just the requirement that innkeepers, motel owners keep all these records that can be looked at by the police whenever they like without a warrant or--or anything else.  </p><p>Here, the justification would presumably be stronger for contact tracing, maybe as long as the information is--is deleted or destroyed within two weeks, the incubation period of COVID or something like that perhaps a regulation like that could be drawn if there are other privacy protections. Matthew or Christine, anything on that?  </p><p>FEENEY: I would only add that it seems like it wouldn't necessarily be--be required to gather this kind of information for most kind of customers. So the majority of people who are still going to restaurants are going to make the reservation online. Even if they do show up, there's a very good chance of using credit or debit card in order to pay. They'll be leaving digital footprints everywhere.  </p><p>So it's not clear to me that if a state would really, really intent on tracking down people who were say at a restaurant in a certain time period that they would need some kind of special authorization or a new order or something like that. It seems to me that there's plenty of data already out there and mechanisms by which they could gather it. Now absent some kind of special new law that just allows them to get at wholesale or a special need. There might be some hurdles that would frustrate law enforcement but I don't think we should forget that there's already many ways for people to gather that kind of information.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Okay. Another question from--go ahead.  </p><p>WILSON: I was just going to say from an FTC perspective there are principles again that would guide shopkeepers activities here. So for example, data minimization the identification where possible that sort of thing. And also, I would commend to the person who asked that question a very interesting, read again, Travis LeBlanc's letter to Acting Secretary Chad wolf. Travis sits on the privacy and civil liberties board and he was addressing the airline's proposed collection of health information from passengers. And--and he pointed out that that information could be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive.  </p><p>There are many reasons that someone could be running a fever including just being in a state of education or being pregnant as opposed to having coronavirus. And then under-inclusive because we know many people with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic. And so he asked a host of questions about how the program would be implemented and about how the data would be used in a variety of implications. And so, I would commend the folks interested in this issue, I would commend that letter to you because he does--he does grapple with a lot of these issues.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: We have two related questions from Facebook. Cynthia Figueroa asks it seems that never downloading the software is the only answer to avoid the contact tracing which would impact the use of the phone. Is the only answer to get a flip phone and then what if the federal government bans flip phones if they're being used to avoid tracking. A more technical a related question to that from Guinevere Liberty Nell.  </p><p>The UK contact tracing app was supposed to be open source and was on GitHub but the updates to it have not been. New versions were added to the Apple App Store, etc. How does this affect the legality if the same thing happens in the United States?  </p><p>FEENEY: I'm happy to take a stab at that. I would say that Google and Apple are private companies and if they mandate that some kind of contact tracing app is a necessary part of an update, it seems to me that there aren't that many difficult legal questions that--I'm not saying there are none necessarily but that'd be much easier.  </p><p>Now, the government coming in and saying look to Google and Apple, you must impose or must have this app installed on your next update, that--that's a very, very different kind of question. It would seem to me that, Ilya would know more than me. But I don't think the government would do very well if they tried to ban an entire kind of phone for this purpose. Now, it's certainly true that look, if you are a Apple, Google user, and you're not happy with these--with these apps and you have privacy concerns, there are limited options if these companies decide to make the app download mandatory and sometimes maybe one way to do that.  </p><p>But certainly, if it's a private company and they've decided this is in the best interest of their users, it strikes me as less legally troubling than the government coming in and mandating that private companies install certain technology.  </p><p>WILSON: With respect to the privacy consequences of those apps that we've already seen one instance in which a contact tracing app inadvertently disclosed information to third parties after guaranteeing that the information would not be disclosed to third parties. And so there's a lot of opportunity for mistakes here. In terms of FTC enforcement, right now, a lot of our privacy enforcement in this area is based on our ability to get a deceptive active practices. And so, if an app promises in its privacy policy that information will be maintained in a certain way, it will be held secure, it will not be shared with third parties except under specifically identify--identifiable circumstances.  </p><p>And then the information is shared in ways that controvert those promises. The FTC can go after the company for deceptive claims. We also have authority over unfair practices, although that's much more amorphous. And so, I would say that right now the FTC's authority with respect to enforcing any--any privacy issues for apps is--is--is too narrow and again federal privacy legislation could help us. But--but right now I can--I can guarantee that if you download an app and it promises, it will only use your information in a certain way and it violates that promise. That's an area where the FTC can get involved for a deceptive act.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: We only have a couple of minutes left here's one question that probably goes to Christine again. Given that she displayed knowledge about HIPAA, maybe she knows something about this. This might be ERISA anyway. Jay Haynes from Twitter asks, early in the pandemic, my employer purported to require all employees to inform them if the employee or anyone in their family were diagnosed with coronavirus. That seems to be a step too far. Do you know, anything about that Christine?  </p><p>WILSON: HIPAA yes, ERISA no. sorry.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Good. Well, I can only surmise that normally disclosing health, this might be a HIPAA thing. Anyway, employment laws of various kinds, disclosing employees health information to each other is probably normally a no-no but might be allowed to prevent the spread of conta--contagion or requiring employees to stay home, those kinds of rules, I'm sure that would be backed up. But again, I'm not an expert on ERISA or whatever the more specific law in this area might be.  </p><p>Here's an interesting question. Again, going back to what Matthew was saying about the policy of contact testing, whether you do it digitally or the old-fashioned way. the problem with testing aside from false positives is that someone testing positive isn't necessarily contagious and someone testing negative isn't immune from contagion. Doesn't this make contact tracing meaningless?  </p><p>FEENEY: I think it certainly calls into question how feasible is going to be to--to stop the spread and be part of the worry throughout all of this is that we're going to take a sledgehammer to a nail and that many people who shouldn't be are told to stay at home and to lock themselves down and the impact that could have on --on the economy in the long run. And potentially even people's health is something that we should all keep in mind.  </p><p>But unfortunately, look that this as viruses is a tricky one. The asymptomatic is the--the length of time (INAUDIBLE) all different kinds of difficult issues and this gets back to what I was saying earlier which is as well as the legal issues we should also make sure to keep in mind the feasibility issues and the utility issues.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: Okay. And with that, I'm afraid we'll have to close. Thanks very much to everyone for attending. We're sorry weren't--we weren't able to get to all the questions, there were quite a number. If you'd like to follow up with any of us, our--our twitter handles at least or on the event page and you can contact me or any of my Cato colleagues through our website as well. The video recording of the event will be available on the web page later today. And with that, thank you everyone, and have a good weekend.  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603J-P2G1-JDPT-T0ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Even with President Trump embroiled in a trade war with China, the S&amp;P 500 index, the best measure of the health of corporate America, hit an all-time high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Back in September, the sun was shining, the birds were chirping and if you listened hard enough you could hear the ice cream truck in the background,\" Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said. \"We had an idyllic scene: synchronised global recovery.\"</p><p>Then relations between America and China soured further, growth in Europe and emerging markets slowed, manufacturers showed signs of decline and the US Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates without signalling that an end was in sight. \"Euphoria in September had turned to panic by late December and now we have a lot of storm clouds on the horizon,\" Mr Levkovich said. \"We're going through an earnings reset at the moment and that can be painful. Some investors are worried about an earnings recession, where earnings go down even without an economic recession.\" This sets the tone for the coming earnings season in the United States, which gets going this week with fourth-quarter reports from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and other finance heavyweights. Research published last week by Morgan Stanley suggested that in mid-December investors were the most cautiously positioned in US finance stocks in five years.</p><p>Fourth-quarter profit numbers will be important, but Mr Levkovich is most interested in companies' guidance for the first quarter of 2019. \"Given the uncertainties, I expect companies to be more conservative because it pays for them to play it that way,\" he said. \"They're going to use that cringeworthy 'cautiously optimistic' tone. They might hide a couple of percentage points of growth in their pockets. They can blame it on China, the shutdown - anything.\"</p><p>The consensus among analysts is that fourth-quarter profits at S&amp;P 500 companies rose by 10.7 per cent on average compared with the same period in 2017, weaker than the 15.9 per cent growth predicted at the start of October. It is also a marked slowdown from an average 25 per cent profit growth in the first three quarters of 2018, figures from Zacks Investment Research show.</p><p>As fourth-quarter profit growth forecasts have declined, so, too, have full-year 2019 forecasts: growth this year is expected to be 6.7 per cent on average among S&amp;P 500 companies, down from a forecast of 9.7 per cent at the end of October.</p><p>Apple alarmed technology investors (and pretty much everybody else) as the year began with its first sales warning in 16 years. Earnings estimates for tech have been hit especially hard. As well as broader concerns for the market, Big Tech is suffering from the threat of greater regulation. The ten technology companies in the NYSE Fang+ index, which include Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix, together have lost about $812 billion in market capitalisation since the start of October last year. Only Tesla and Twitter have grown in value.</p><p>December's sell-off forced analysts to cut their forecasts for where the S&amp;P 500 will end this year. Even so, most continue to believe that it will end the year higher than where it started. BMO Capital Markets sees the index hitting 3,000, a gain of nearly 20 per cent.</p><p>The American consumer remains strong, which is good news for the US economy, given that two thirds of it relies on consumption. Retail sales are in good shape in store and online, there are considerably more jobs than unemployed people (as has been the case since March last year), wages are rising and petrol prices are falling.</p><p>Outside manufacturing, the wider economy seems to be doing well, with December's jobs report, the most keenly watched of all economic indicators, coming in well ahead of expectations. Federal Reserve officials, not least Jerome Powell, the central bank's chairman, have made soothing noises of late about being \"patient\" with raising interest rates.</p><p>These are some of the factors behind Wall Street's recent rally, which pulled the index out of correction territory, defined as a drop of 10 per cent from its last peak.

Even with President Trump embroiled in a trade war with China, the S&amp;P 500 index, the best measure of the health of corporate America, hit an all-time high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Back in September, the sun was shining, the birds were chirping and if you listened hard enough you could hear the ice cream truck in the background,\" Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said. \"We had an idyllic scene: synchronised global recovery.\"</p><p>Then relations between America and China soured further, growth in Europe and emerging markets slowed, manufacturers showed signs of decline and the US Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates without signalling that an end was in sight.</p><p>\"Euphoria in September had turned to panic by late December and now we have a lot of storm clouds on the horizon,\" Mr Levkovich said. \"We're going through an earnings reset at the moment and that can be painful. Some investors are worried about an earnings recession, where earnings go down even without an economic recession.\" This sets the tone for the coming earnings season in the United States, which gets going this week with fourth-quarter reports from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and other finance heavyweights. Research published last week by Morgan Stanley suggested that in mid-December investors were the most cautiously positioned in US finance stocks in five years.</p><p>Fourth-quarter profit numbers will be important, but Mr Levkovich is most interested in companies' guidance for the first quarter of 2019. \"Given the uncertainties, I expect companies to be more conservative because it pays for them to play it that way,\" he said. \"They're going to use that cringeworthy 'cautiously optimistic' tone. They might hide a couple of percentage points of growth in their pockets. They can blame it on China, the shutdown - anything.\"</p><p>The consensus among analysts is that fourth-quarter profits at S&amp;P 500 companies rose by 10.7 per cent on average compared with the same period in 2017, weaker than the 15.9 per cent growth predicted at the start of October. It is also a marked slowdown from an average 25 per cent profit growth in the first three quarters of 2018, figures from Zacks Investment Research show.</p><p>As fourth-quarter profit growth forecasts have declined, so, too, have full-year 2019 forecasts: growth this year is expected to be 6.7 per cent on average among S&amp;P 500 companies, down from a forecast of 9.7 per cent at the end of October.</p><p>Apple alarmed technology investors (and pretty much everybody else) as the year began with its first sales warning in 16 years. Earnings estimates for tech have been hit especially hard. As well as broader concerns for the market, Big Tech is suffering from the threat of greater regulation. The ten technology companies in the NYSE Fang+ index, which include Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix, together have lost about $812 billion in market capitalisation since the start of October last year. Only Tesla and Twitter have grown in value.</p><p>December's sell-off forced analysts to cut their forecasts for where the S&amp;P 500 will end this year. Even so, most continue to believe that it will end the year higher than where it started. BMO Capital Markets sees the index hitting 3,000, a gain of nearly 20 per cent.</p><p>The American consumer remains strong, which is good news for the US economy, given that two thirds of it relies on consumption. Retail sales are in good shape in store and online, there are considerably more jobs than unemployed people (as has been the case since March last year), wages are rising and petrol prices are falling.</p><p>Outside manufacturing, the wider economy seems to be doing well, with December's jobs report, the most keenly watched of all economic indicators, coming in well ahead of expectations. Federal Reserve officials, not least Jerome Powell, the central bank's chairman, have made soothing noises of late about being \"patient\" with raising interest rates.</p><p>These are some of the factors behind Wall Street's recent rally, which pulled the index out of correction territory, defined as a drop of 10 per cent from its last peak. Not long after Christmas, the index was within touching distance of a bear market, down 20 per cent from its last peak. Maybe the sun will be shining and the birds chirping again by the time spring comes around.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-50830295</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6C-D6R1-F021-62W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

That's not necessarily a bad thing. Hong Kong, at least, was spared the headache some other major cities \u2014 including Shanghai, Wuhan and Guangzhou \u2014 had in trying to find \"graveyards\" large enough to contain hundreds of thousands of bicycles discarded after the bicycle-sharing boom-bust.</p><p>Not too long ago, many financial gurus scolded the government for its reluctance to promote the so-called \"P2P\" (peer to peer) lending platforms in Hong Kong. They have kept their complaints largely to themselves since the collapse of the P2P market on the mainland, resulting in considerable losses to \"lenders\" using the now-defunct platforms.</p><p>It is a debacle Hong Kong can ill afford because of the predictable damage it can cause to its reputation as an international financial center. A former financial official once said he and his colleagues were vindicated for erring on the side of caution.</p><p>Indeed, the Hong Kong government and Hong Kong Monetary Authority have often been criticized for their overly conservative approach to financial innovation. This emphasis on the regulatory framework and institutional integrity is exactly Hong Kong's strength in fulfilling its expected role in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and other initiatives.</p><p>To be sure, Hong Kong enjoys other advantages, including excellent infrastructure, an efficient civil service and free access to information. But the greatest value it can bring to the table is expertise and experience to ensure orderly development which will not create new and bigger problems.</p><p>In the United States, for instance, big tech companies such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook can usually have their own way. Their monopolistic power and disruptive impact on various industries is largely seen as beneficial, or at least tolerated, because they are seen to have brought greater convenience and lower prices to many millions of consumers.</p><p>But when it comes to financial business, these technology behemoths will have to forge partnerships with established banks in offering their \"innovative\" services. That's because they don't see the benefit of going it alone, considering the high cost and complexity in complying with banking regulations.</p><p>Take electronic payment for example. Customers using that service usually have to put some money first into accounts with the service provider, who is, in effect, a deposit-taking company that is not regulated or supervised like those regular deposit-taking companies, mostly banks, by the regulator.</p><p>As such, customers of these electronic payment service providers are exposed to the risk that their money may not be managed with the level of prudence required of banks and regulated deposit-taking companies. It can be argued that such a risk is minimal when the service providers are the industry leaders sitting on big piles of cash. But it is important to note also that even some large banks required government bailouts to stay afloat after the outbreak of the credit crisis in 2008.</p><p>It can be expected that finance will be a major area of innovation in coming years. Fintech has the potential of letting the Chinese mainland quickly catch up with developed economies in the advancing financial services and markets.</p><p>The technological infrastructure and business know-how for fintech development are readily available. The hard part is drafting a regulatory framework and establishing enforcement capability to ensure things don't spin out of control, requiring corrective measures that are usually cumbersome, retroactive and counterproductive.</p><p>Hong Kong has vast experience in regulating complex financial systems and capital markets which withstood the onslaught of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and, again, in the global credit crunch in 2008. The strength and resilience of its financial institutions in those testing times are testimony to the integrity of its regulatory environment.</p><p>That will be the key contribution Hong Kong can make to the mainland's drive for innovation in financial development.</p><p>The author is a current-affairs commentator.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDHK-117967005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDHK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGF-BTP1-JDJN-61K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 China Daily Information.

Now, Jennifer you long argued that your problem was with the party that should have thanked you, guys, for putting them in the power in the House, but then sort of left them at the door?</p><p>JENNIFER STEFANO, TEA PARTY ACTIVIST: Right. Never before have I seen a group take their natural allies and turn them into their enemies. The fact is the message that the Tea Party delivered in 2010, where the idea that the government should listen to you, you have people in Washington that are for a limited government, for smaller, and empowering the individuals, that message sold, when they muddled (ph) us, ignored us all through 2012, you saw what happened, Neil. And the fact is, I don't care what you call me, call me a Tea partier, call me whatever you want, but it is the message, the principles and ideals that we're trying to deliver. And you know who is coming over to our side, Neil? It's moderate Democrats who are now furious with the Democratic Party for lying to them about Obamacare, that are now starting to work with us. To say, you know what? I don't like that none of these people did it, and the Republicans, they refuse to fight, so who can we trust? We can only trust ourselves, and I think you're going to see that personal momentum well up of individual coming out to fight. No matter what you call us. Tea Party, moderate Democrat, whatever.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, mainstream Republicans call you dividers, as you know, and they point to Ronald Reagan and saying he'd rather get 80 percent of a loaf in a deal than no loaf at all, and he was famous for trying to move the ball forward to then Speaker Tip O'Neill. And trying to get some sort of a deal because stubbornness on other side doesn't necessarily -- things get done. What do you think of that?</p><p>STEFANO: Well, I think it depends on what 30 percent you are not doing, if you are selling out the President Obama's ideas on Obamacare or big government on extending regulation on shutting down coal and bankrupting people, bankrupting industry, then -- no, that is a 30 percent, I don't care what are those 70 percent you're with us on. These are things that cannot stand, you have to look at it from the perspective. The most people look at what is personal to them, right? What impacts me as a head of a working family or otherwise? And the Republicans are not in many areas standing up to fight that battle. Boehner should take those Tea Party freshman and do -- basically what Rand Paul does, what you see Ted Cruz is doing. Those words, those messages, they are resonating it. That ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But they are not -- they're not resonating with the -- they are not resonating with the speaker, Jen. To that point, then, do you think John Boehner should be speaker?</p><p>STEFANO: Someone who cannot lead his people. And by the way, it is just not enough to manage inside Washington D.C. You have got to go out and speak to the people, and the fact of the matter is, the House has often not been able to properly address or to talk about why what they are doing matters to average people, and not to getting anything done. They could have put this president on offense 500 times, and by refusing to allow the group of people, like the Tea Party, the original Tea Party freshmen to really rise up and have a voice, like you are seeing in the Senate. I think you're really creating a situation where we're going to be set up to lose again. We cannot continue to fall back, because Barack Obama is denting policy that most Americans don't agree with, but we don't have a confident voice on the right in leadership or in a large position arguing that point. I think -- again, I point to the United States Senate, if you want to see, the future of the Republican Party, and, of course, to the grassroots, and it would be great, Neil, if we really focused on women, women are earning 60 percent of college degrees, they are continuing to be in industries that make the highest income.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>STEFANO: I think the Republican Party has to (inaudible) and recruit women, to run profits, I think this is a very important point, and I hate gender politics, but man, I am never going to be sidelined by this women issue crap. Like I was back in 2012. That never will happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, Jen, speak your mind, I never know where you are coming from. But finally, to that point about reaching out the women. Is it by design or just coincidentally that I'm noticing in these latest Tea Party push, not much to talk about social issues, a lot of talk about, to your point, economic issues.</p><p>STEFANO: Sure, well, first of all, I think you can stand -- I mean I am pro-life and you can certainly talk about it, just talk about it like you are not insane and like you are a human being. And talk about it</p><p>CAVUTO: What does that mean? What does that mean?</p><p>STEFANO: Well, I think it means when you have guys like Todd Akins saying illegitimate rape, you just sound outrageous, the rape -- that's an outrageous thing to say. I think as a woman, most -- I have friends that are pro-choice, I have friends that have all done all sorts of things, but I can talk to them, and they can talk to me, and it is not a hysterical blood bath. I think Republicans have to learn how to be -- more outreaching. On the other hand, I think the economic issues are the more important ones, because number one, it's what most Republicans and most Americans, can you night around. As long as you explained them, why it matters to their lives as working families, and I think if you talk about spending and debt in these big aggregated term, we lose people, because the Democrats talk about people first, and Republicans and those of us on the right tend to talk percentages, and pie charts, we need to change that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Very well put.</p><p>STEFANO: We have to change the way we talk, and I'm telling you: get the women in there, more women to run for offers on the Republican ticket. And you will see success, I hate to say it, but Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was right. When women run, women win. And I'm no -- those pinko commie feminist Birkenstock wearers, I can't stand them. But I'm telling you ...</p><p>CAVUTO: They do win. More often than not, they do win.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Jen, it's always good having you.</p><p>STEFANO: They win.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much.</p><p>STEFANO: Thank you, <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so Foster Friess who feels Jen's fury. But urges caution the Tea Party is in general, not go too -- too far. Foster, we call the very rich guy, supported that largely giving up for political debt meet guy, Rick Santorum. Remember him? Until Rick gave Mitt more than a race than anyone thought. So, what is Foster up to now? And who is he putting his money on dough. He joins us, Foster, what do you make, first of all, what Jennifer just said.</p><p>FOSTER FRIESS, FRIESS ASSOCIATES FOUNDER: I think Jennifer is extremely wise in terms of Democrats talk to the heart and the emotions, we talk to the intellect and the brain. And when we talk about health care reform, if you talk about bloc granting medicated estates, or you talk about changing some of the tax code or, selling cross state lines, that is wonkish kind of a head talk, and so we have to talk about how do we help young people reduce their premiums, how do we make sure we create a safety net that allows people not to go into a spiral financially? So, she's right on there. However, I do believe we have a huge, huge opportunity of coming together with the establishment, Republicans, the Tea Party Republicans and the people formally on the left, and she said a lot of Democrats are upset, here we have James Hoffa, a head of a union siding with -- let's do something about Obamacare. The head of the IRS unions. As I like my health care just the way it is. And Neil, I have to tell you a little story that kind of ties in about the young kid runs his car in the ditch, buries it up to the half-(inaudible) in mud, and he calls a farmer over and puts a big horse on it. Pulls (inaudible), nothing happens, pulls Tom, nothing happens, pull Bill, nothing happens. And the farmer says, pull Homer, pulls him out just sleek as it could be. The young kid says, how come you have to call your horse four names before doing it? Well, you see son, Homer's blind. If he saw there's only he wouldn't give a damn.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRIESS: So I think that's why -- that's where we are.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, you know, a lot of people criticize Republicans to a horse, but usually the other end of the horse.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: And they say that, say because Republicans have a habit of nabbing the feet from what look like the jaws of victory, and they say that because they end up going far afield from what makes their message alluring, and that is the economic message. That you believe into the -- alluded to at the time Rick Santorum was running. But then you get caught up in either social issues or as Jennifer Stefano said the crazies who then all of a sudden become the face of the party, and it's not an accurate face, do you agree with that?</p><p>FRIESS: Well, I agree that the left likes to pick out the worst spokesman.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>FRIESS: And that is why it makes me nervous that you picked me. Because maybe they want to see me on TV.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, how would you combat that? I mean you are a savvy businessman, you are a good value investor, that's, obviously, you got your money and also you know something about seeing diamonds in the rough, right now things are rough for Republicans, how do they improve their image with all people? That their party reaches out back to those Ronald Reagan days? To all Americans.</p><p>FRIESS: It is so simple, Neil. It is so simple. All you have to do is take one rifle shot, for example, rather than talk about defunding Obamacare, delaying, postponing, all that we have to do is let's ask President Obama to treat the little guy as fairly as he treats the big corporation, so he gave the corporations a relief from their mandate, although the Republican have to do is now insist he does the same thing for the little guy, and keep it on that issue. And I don't think it makes sense to defund Obamacare, I think instead, what we want to do is reschedule the implementation of the mandates, so that the young -- the little guy can have a better chance to look what is in store for him, and the young people still favor Obamacare, and they are the ones that going to be hurt the most.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, you would be against, Foster this effort of Ted Cruz and other to defund it, that it would a waste of time?</p><p>FRIESS: Well, I think their intentions are good. And any of other people who want to repeal, and that's good. So, we -- everybody knows we have to get rid of it, that's the given. The trick is, what is the best way of doing it, and I suggest the best way of doing it, is just have a rifle shot, and just say, let's treat the employee, equal to how we're treating employer, give him a one year hiatus, don't spend all this money on ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRIESS: $50 million is going to be spend on advertising, which is going to go to advertising firms headed by Obama's donors. So, I think if we just asked for that one stall, not a stall, but a rescheduling, I think we can all come together. Establishment ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Got you.</p><p>FRIESS: Tea Party, Democrats we're all in this together. And that's what's exciting about what I see happening.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, who are you pushing for -- I'm sorry to rush you there. Who are you pushing in 2016?</p><p>FRIESS: Well, I've told folks I'm still think Santorum is wisest of the group.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, really? So, he runs again, he's got your backing.</p><p>FRIESS: Well, he was -- he was talking in Iowa the other day about -- we talked about the job creators, why we talked about the job holders. I became wealthy not because of my acumen, but 70 people that are around me, and if it were not for them I would not be sitting in this chair, so I think the main thing we have to be sensitive to that hotel clerk that checks us in at 2:00 A.M. in the morning, the skycap that gets us on that plane at 5:00 in the morning, they get up at four. Those are people who make our country work. And I think Republicans care about them, and that is why they want to get rid of this Obamacare, which is going to be destructive to these people. So, I think, we just don't need to change our taxes, we just need to take our message, and Santorum's message, it's the beautiful one. Let's look out for the job holder.</p><p>CAVUTO: Foster Friess, it's always a pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, talk about perfect timing, as libertarians are about to take off, the Ron Paul channel turns on.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, then quick, what is the difference between Glenn Beck and Ron Paul? What if I told you nothing? At least on the Internet. Because one is already a big star there, and the other is about to become one. Because the Ron Paul channel is online and like (inaudible) is firing a lot of folks up. Paul says, 200,000 potential subscribers have expressed interest in paying upwards of $9.95 a month, for a channel, the former presidential candidate says, we'll give it folks straight every day. He is here to tell me also about a feature that promotes itself urging you first turn your TV off.</p><p>All right, Congressman, that is where you lose me -- particularly. Not a good, not a good strategy going forward. But nevertheless, because I admire you greatly. I'll let you come for this one last appearance, but I'm joking, but what's the -- what's the idea behind us?</p><p>FMR. REP. RON PAUL (R-TX): Well, the whole idea for me to have the ability to continue to do what I've been doing for 35 years, and that's talk about issues that you've helped me talk about many times over the years. And to bring it to the attention of as many people as possible. And there are some frustrations, you know, with regular TV, I don't have a job on regular TV. I don't want to live in New York, or Washington or L.A., but I can do this from my hometown -- I can talk to people, but it takes a big step, it takes a lot of help, it's much more complicated than I ever dream, and so it's really worked very well for me, although we're at beginning stages, as a matter of fact, just within the hours, I released that the burger M. is now available. So, it is you -- you have timed it very well. And although we go after TV, I will always turn to Cavuto when I want to hear the real (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You -- I have to tell you, young man. You dare go after us, and then it's worked. But having said that, I'm curious, would this be then more like a libertarian channel congressman. How would you describe it?</p><p>PAUL: Well, it's going to not promote the ideas I disagree with. And most people have a pretty good sense of what I believe in. You know the foreign policy has been different than traditional, they're for the monetary policy, you know, as well. And economics, I believe in (inaudible), free market economics. So, no, there was the views I'm going to express. But it's also going to be -- turning into get people, not the ones that -- not only the ones who agree with me, but you know, like, our first host, our first guest was Glenn Greenwald. You know, we talked about Edward Snowden. And -- so, and I'm not -- I'm sure they are sympathetic to libertarian views, but I don't think, you know, they necessarily, you're going to be libertarians, but if they are interesting in talking about the things in trying to reveal the truth, I would just like to get to the bottom of things, and it gives me a little bit extra time to do this. The one thing that's nice about the Internet is that I don't have to deal with advertisers and I don't have to deal with a clock. So you, guys, get to be experts, you know how to cut me off when you need to.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAUL: And I -- you know, if I get long winded, and my 30 minutes is up, I can go 40 minutes, because I think even though we yesterday, it would have 30 minutes or so showed ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAUL: I think the first one today's about 45 minutes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really, is that just you, congressman? Just you? 45?</p><p>PAUL: Oh, no. You've got to take a look at it. You will be all right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Very good.</p><p>PAUL: 45 minutes they would get tired of me ...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAUL: So, that is why -- that's why I have guests, and, you know, I think the people who are working with me have done it very professionally. They'll be a lot of visuals and things like that. That makes it as interesting as possible.</p><p>CAVUTO: How will this help or hurt your son, Senator Rand Paul who is rumored to be (inaudible) a run for the presidency in 2016?</p><p>PAUL: Sure, I hope it doesn't hurt him, but you know, you never know, what -- what it might do. I can't believe it will hurt him -- and hopefully it helps him to some degrees, because the views will be very similar. And that's what we're going to be talking about.</p><p>CAVUTO: What did you think, then, of his dust off with the New Jersey Governor Chris Christie? Much ado about nothing and you offered the governor an olive branch? The governor more or less slapped it right back at him. What do you think?</p><p>PAUL: Yeah, I don't like the bickering back and forth. I think it was a significant debate, you know, one person blasting those of us who believe in liberty and saying that you should not be that you know critical of the government. That is significant, but still, again, two politicians going at it, I much rather you know talk about why we should have a Fed or why we shouldn't have a Fed.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it sounds like you are not a Christie fan.</p><p>PAUL: That would be safe to say, yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if he was the Republican nominee in 2016 we're way ahead of ourselves, if you'll forgive me, congressman -- but if he were, if he were, would you not support him?</p><p>PAUL: Oh, no -- I -- at this moment, he is not going to have -- you know, a change of heart.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah.</p><p>PAUL: He is a big government person. So, it would be similar to you know, in the last go around, I could not endorse our candidate.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah.</p><p>PAUL: But I want to change things. I don't think we're doing well, you know.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are sort of -- both parties are sort of -- sort of glommed into one another here. And I'm just wondering, there is this sort of philosophical battle going on within the Republican Party, to your point on the Chris Christie-Rand Paul dust up over how far you go surveilling people. But having said that, is it a dangerous today within the Republican Party, one that they should have in the Republican Party. What do you think?</p><p>PAUL: Well, I think it is a very important debate. It is dangerous not to face up to it but I think it is much broader than that. I think it is big government versus limited government. And that involves the split in the Republican Party. And in the Democratic Party. Because the Democrats want to restrain, have to restrain on foreign intervention and some of the surveillance.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah.</p><p>PAUL: So, I -- I think it is a much bigger thing. In economics, Nixon once said we're all Keynesians, well, I would like to change that around. And he was right, Republicans and Democrats became Keynesians, and that, of course, is -- like the picture (ph) we have, or the chairman or the Federal Reserve. I don't think we should have a Federal Reserve (inaudible) chairman.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, well, that you just read my mind, (inaudible), and for now we do have a Federal Reserve, and for now we do, presumable do Keynesians or those who are big believers in government stimulus in the running for the job. Larry Summers and Janet Yellen. Do you like one more than the other? Do you think they are both going to continue Ben Bernanke policy of propping things up on steroids. What?</p><p>PAUL: No, it won't make any difference, because they both believe that the Fed there is -- the Fed is there for the lend of our last resorts for banks and corporations that overextend themselves, they believe in the regulation, they put -- one might put more emphasis on regulation versus monetary policy. But they definitely endorse the idea that they monetize debt. If they didn't, the interest rates would soar to the sky. So long- term it makes no difference between the two. The debate should be do we need a Federal Reserve board chairman or do we even need a Federal Reserve system. Possibly, if they would study that, they would come to the conclusion that they have been much more harmful than helpful, and have caused a lot of damage to our country.</p><p>CAVUTO: Congressman, I don't care where people are on the political spectrum. You challenge debate, you make people think things they should be thinking about. So I wish you much luck, not too much luck but much luck, Congressman. Very good having you, happy kickoff day.</p><p>PAUL: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Now, remember, when we feared at the rate we were going, we'd end up another Greece? After you hear what I am about to tell you, you might wish we were Greece.</p><p>CAVUTO: Greece is the word, and apparently we are the turd (ph). Well, not really, but Greece does have a surplus, and we do not. And because Greece has slowly but surely started addressing its spending mess, and we have got all of Washington taking August off as if we don't even have a spinning mess. So what is the Greek (inaudible) term for, we're the one that is (inaudible)? Imogen Lloyd Webber (inaudible), and Lizzy MacDonald. Lizzy, really, great Zeus? Greece gets it, we don't.</p><p>LIZZY MACDONALD, FBN ANCHOR: Yes, Greece gets it and we don't. You know, listen, what Greece -- what is going on there is, they have been doing austerity, and they have Germany over their shoulder saying, listen, if you don't fix your spending and your spendaholic ways, you are not going to get IMF money, you're not going to get your money, you're not going to get ECB money. We're just not going to help you, you got to do it. Whereas here in the United States, we have this echo chamber, the liberal media and people in Washington, D.C., you cannot admit any contrary opinions or facts, that the facts are you cannot spend your way out of your problems. You can't. Countries around the world have never succeeded doing that, and I just -- what -- the thought process here is we have the dollar, we have the reserve currency, we can print our way out of this. You know, China is still buying our debt, and we're going to be OK. It ain't happening (inaudible).</p><p>CAVUTO: Imogen.</p><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER: I am going to give America a round of applause. You have you done better than everyone else in the world getting through the financial crisis. Take my home country of the U.K.</p><p>CAVUTO: I had no idea you were British.</p><p>WEBBER: No idea at all. We have these GQ boys, you called them, in charge, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, and even Nick Clegg--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: They do look like --</p><p>WEBBER: Has even admitted that when we get austerity measures in Britain, full-on austerity measures, we did too much too soon. We've now got anemic growth. The chief economist of the IMF said, Britain, you have not done well.</p><p>America, on the other hand, your deficit is absolutely going in the right direction. It's going to be lower now I think this year than they have been actually--</p><p>CAVUTO: Still adding to our debt.</p><p>WEBBER: Yes, but at the same time, you clearly are leading the way and leading the world in the recovery. You don't want to be a Brit, you want to be in America.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think of that? We actually do get it, and Greece, whatever its turnaround and fortunes, is not us.</p><p>LENWOOD BROOKS, PUBLIC NOTICE POLICY DIRECTOR: I'm not sure we do get it here in America, Neil. After 2008, we saw nearly four years of a trillion-dollar-plus deficits. Just because it is half that now, it is still incredibly too high. But back to Greece, Neil, I don't think Greece is a country we should be following in terms of fiscal paths. If you look at it, the unemployment rate in that country is over 25 percent -- two- thirds of all youth cannot find a job. That's not the way you want to get the economy back on track. But they are having to listen to all these foreign creditors telling them how to run their country, they waited too long.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you make, though, basically, Lizzy, of the point Imogen was making that maybe because we haven't gone as austere as some of these countries, on that we have been spending and our own Federal Reserve has been in the game, adding $85 billion a month to keep this going, that, say what you will, we're certainly in better shape than the rest of the world?</p><p>MACDONALD: I think Imogen has a point there. Talking about Great Britain, I think that the central bank over there is buying, I think, government debt, so they are doing the same thing that our Federal Reserve has been doing, but we're so short-term focused in Washington, D.C., that is to say that austerity is going to kill us. Remember there were fears that we were going to have something equating the Mayan collapse if we had $85 billion, now it's around $50 billion in spending cuts for this year? Well, guess what, it did not happen, guess what, things are moving along. Even though the growth is not that great.</p><p>The problem is when we have such anemic growth of 1.5 percent or 2 percent, when you have the pension costs piling up, when you have Obamacare adding a trillion dollars to the nation's deficits, you got to say to yourself, we do need restructuring in a big way, state, local and federal level.</p><p>CAVUTO: You mentioned, Imogen, as well, that Britain overdid it. Wasn't the argument that you started with tax hikes right away, spending cuts came later? So you actually got it, not you personally, ass- backwards?</p><p>WEBBER: It was about 80-20, that was always the aim of (inaudible), and it was all done pretty much--</p><p>CAVUTO: But the big old tax hikes were the ones that came first, and then they had to take it back--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WEBBER: The main one was the consumption tax, that went up to 20 percent.</p><p>CAVUTO: And then did they dial that back? They realized how stupid it was?</p><p>WEBBER: It is still 20 percent. Britain has just been (inaudible), don't use Britain as an example. However--</p><p>CAVUTO: Wait. The wealthy surtax, what happened to that? Because they dialed that one back.</p><p>WEBBER: That one got dialed back.</p><p>CAVUTO: Because they realized it was a mistake.</p><p>WEBBER: Bottom line, with austerity in Britain, they were busy doing spending cuts across every government department, yes, across every government department apart from health care and foreign aid. And in regards to the U.S., fundamentally, you have got to reform that tax code, that has got to be the aim of Congress. And that will sort it out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Bottom line is, I always think it sounds impressive to stand out in the world. But when you realize you are the tallest pygmy in the room, you realize as well that you are the tallest pygmy in the room, so what are we bragging about? Or should we be bragging about?</p><p>BROOKS: I don't think we should be bragging, Neil. I mean, we haven't taken a serious look at our spending. It might be down slightly this year, but if we look at the mandatory spending side, the real drivers of our spending in the future, we haven't touched those, and until we touch those, we have nothing to be bragging about. These programs are important, but they need to be preserved and protected.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much. Up later, just going to tell you something, that Imogen has a shocking news alert, (inaudible) on agreeing with me. Now, when that happens, we're going to alert it. But I will leave it there. I will leave you wanting to watch this, like you always are anyway.</p><p>WEBBER: A tease.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a tease, exactly. Meanwhile, Harry Reid accusing unions of frightening people about Obamacare. But wasn't this the same guy all but likened Paul Ryan to pushing granny off a cliff? Off his game or just off his rocker?</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Harry must be Harry because now he is going after pretty much everyone. Last week, for Republicans for all but being racist going after the president's agenda and now fear mongering unions for their questioning that agenda.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR HARRY REID (D), NEVADA: He is exaggerating but I would recommend he'd calm down and stop frightening people. Because the law is going forward, he should work with it. I'm working with him and the administration to try to solve some of the issues that he has talked about, but he's exaggerated them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: That's going after union. Has the leader lost it? To public policy expert, Gretchen Hamel and D.C. insider, Chris Stirewalt. Gretchen, what do you think?</p><p>GRETCHEN HAMEL, PUBLIC NOTICE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: I think Harry Reid is just being Harry Reid, and you know, just criticizing anyone who is criticizing some of the work that he and other Democrats have done. He started criticizing conservatives with the same sort of criticism a few years ago. Here he is going after union leaders based off what they said is going to destroy the 40-hour workweek.</p><p>CAVUTO: Chris, what do make of this? Obviously, there is frustration that health care law seems to be falling apart on their trying to keep it going, but now unions, a key Democratic Party backer, a big health care backer now wanting to back out of this or increasingly so. What is going on here?</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, first of all, D.C. insider, Mr. Cavuto. I don't know. That -- I think that is pejorative --</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm sorry. I did not mean that, but I delight in saying it - - a highly connected person. What do you make of that?</p><p>STIREWALT: OK, how about this? Is it a feature or is it a bug? That is what they say in software. That's the question that Harry Reid is ultimately trying to answer. Unions have serious problems with the law because it makes membership and dues paying into unions less attractive. It makes as Gretchen pointed out, what it does to the 35-hour workweek, and all that other stuff, there are problems for unions.</p><p>When Harry Reid says calm down and don't be so alarmist, what he is saying is, we will figure this out in time. Let's not give Republicans any ammunition right now to knock down the bill. We'll get it figured out in time. And as he said in same interview, it is all leading to us to a single payer European-style plan anyway. So don't get -- now. We're going to get there eventually.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think, Gretchen, that is heart of what is going on here. Chris should run from that opinion now because I agree. But the ultimate goal here was to get to something single payer because unions would embrace that. The left would generally embrace that. That is what Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and certainly the president wanted when they first pushed that and now we might be ending up getting that.</p><p>HAMEL: Absolutely. That is what they pushed for in the very beginning of this debate, when it first started four years ago. They weren't able to get what they wanted and now they ended with a law that is unworkable and --</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think of what he is saying to the unions, will you just get on the same page with us? Just shut up.</p><p>HAMEL: Yes. Well, I mean, he doesn't want them to give any ammunition. I mean, what the unions are saying, the letters that they have been, you know, sending off to Congress are being used against Democrats in political ads and across U.S. It's highlighting the discrepancy we see between Americans and having them sign up for Obamacare, businesses getting a pass for a year, and the congressional staffers getting a pass for a year too. They are saying, you know what, we know there are problem, we'll find a fix and a solution for you just hold tight and don't say anything that could be used against us.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is this thing in big trouble, Chris?</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, yes. But, it is in big trouble, but part of it that relates to paying for it, the part of it that relates to the promise that people like, Leader Reid and other leaders in the Democratic Party like Max Baucus and Jay Rockefeller and others have said this law is not coming together like we want it to. The part that is not coming together like they wanted it to is the paying for it part.</p><p>The part that was the nod to Clinton Democrats, this was an all Democrat plan, but the Clinton Democrats have wanted some fiscal restraint. That part the wheels are coming off that buggy. The part that is going forward regardless of what happens with the Obamacare, data hub, and all these other implementation concerns is getting as many human being signed up for free or subsidized insurance as possible to constitute the benefits so that can cannot be taken away.</p><p>CAVUTO: Gretchen, good seeing you again. In the meantime, Apple is announcing that it is going to introduce a new iPhone to the world next month. Is this a more timely and telling lesson for Apple?</p><p>CAVUTO: Blackberry shopping, Twitter politicking, and food delivery services feasting, a lot to get blitzing. Here to do the honors, Monica and Gary B. Smith. Welcome to both of you. OK, Gary B., to you first on Blackberry.</p><p>The company that once ruled the smartphone roost all, but crowing to anyone interested that it is up for sale or at least exploring strategic alternatives on the very same day present industry kingpin Apple announces it will be rolling out a new iPhone sometime next month, I believe September 10, your thoughts?</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT: Well, I think you said it in right before to the segment. Tease that now it's Apple that better watch out, because you know they think they have a moat around their products, you know, I used Apple. I love their products. You never know when you are going to turn out to be the next Blackberry or old Sony Discman or the IBM PC, all which thought, you know, we have it. We have it sold. We have it locked. We don't need to worry about innovating and sure enough someone reinvents the wheel and you're looking to sell your company.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think of that, Monica?</p><p>MONICA MEHTA, SEVENTH CAPITAL: Well, I think Gary B. is right. It's a reminder of how quickly the consumer can leave you and forget about you because Blackberry was first in the smartphone market, but there were other competitors that came and they had wildly advanced technologies and it didn't take a very long for consumers just to stop caring about the Blackberry. You know what? They may have great products that come out, but I just don't think that anyone is looking any more.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you even think, Gary B., that we bury these guys too soon? I remember Netflix. Remember when they thought they were going the way of the dodo bird. They come back. You know, they have a business model that seems to make sense. The down streaming -- the rage again and they are back on fire again with independent programming and the like and on and on. So who's to say that Blackberry can't do that?</p><p>SMITH: Well, look, I think they can, you know, that Netflix you talk about is a good example. I never stopped paying my monthly fee for them and I was heartened when they started coming out with some of these new shows only available on Netflix. So they showed all along that they were willing to innovate and I think that Blackberry is also. I think they started showing that willingness though when their market shared really started eroding maybe a little bit too late.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, issue two, tweeting to anyone interested in immigration reform because Twitter now joining Facebook in the immigration debate, two of the more prominent high tech names behind big immigration reform being sought by, well, the likes of billionaires like Bill Gates and a hosts of other. What do you make, Monica, of this billionaire push? Does it help or hurt?</p><p>MEHTA: Well, I think I am not surprised that all that Twitter has a pack, back in 70s, lobbying was tens of millions of dollars. Now today it is billions of dollars and I think that anybody out there who is looking for politicians to do something for them should understand that everyone needs to follow the money. This is what the story tells me, and we need to be pushing for all of our legislators and lobbyists to behave like NASCAR drivers. They should have little patches, who are they representing? We need to know because this is where it's going. You need to follow the money and this is what's happening today.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, the one thing I like about Twitter being involved in this is they'll keep the debate to a minimum. Maybe 163 characters or what, but what do you make of that, Gary B., and why, I understand why big tech titans are all interested in getting big tech help. But, they are all in on it.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, they are all in on every debate. I think Monica makes a good point. It's like congressmen and senators are like NASCAR drivers, unless you are in there, speaking on every single issue, I think that is really just all of the issues are just a hedge to make sure that you have the ear of your, you know, appropriate senator or congressman on other issues down the road, which you might not know of maybe a internet tax or some Twitter tax, whatever it is. That you are cozying up to right person or people in this case that your business, in this case Twitter case should you go public your stock share will not erode.</p><p>CAVUTO: Very interesting. All right, guy, issue three, perhaps the real food for thought here on this first trading day of the week. America's appetite for food delivery is alive and well. Monica, it's a phenomenon that feeds on itself, grub hub and -- latest to emerge. What do you make?</p><p>MEHTA: I think -- a wonderful service, and disrupting something that was inefficient, you had to pick up a phone, place a order to restaurant, there is a lot of noise in the background, maybe they are going to send you your catsup on the side, maybe they won't. So it is great you can do it online. It's a great service.</p><p>But what I thought to be very interesting, I read is that they are charging these restaurants who have very low margin businesses to begin with 15 percent. I mean, restaurants really do make just a shred of money on what they charge you.</p><p>CAVUTO: An added customer is an added customer.</p><p>MEHTA: Well, not when your margin is 8 percent. So the order delivery service needs to remember its place. It's the restaurant that maintains the customer loyalty. So I think if they continue to be greedy there is in nothing to say that this trend is going to continue.</p><p>CAVUTO: Gary, a lot of these say, this order is not for one person Mr. Cavuto. Leaving that aside, what do you think? Is it a trend?</p><p>SMITH: I'm going contrarian on this. I think as they say in bridge, slowing throwing a looser on a looser, you get two plates of pasta for you and your wife, $40, I looked up on grub hub, which I have never used, they tax on $10 charge. Plus 20 percent of bill, you pay, $50 for $40 worth of food, $50, I think people are saying, you know, times are tight, you know we're aging our income is going down, I think it is too expensive. I do not like this business at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so, I will put you don't you down as a maybe. Guys, thank you very much.</p><p>When rich get fed up, proof they really do pack up? See the numbers on this.</p><p>CAVUTO: I could be wrong, but I think this is a rich guy a version of telling the government to take a flying leap because all bunch of them are packing up and leaving. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting a sharp surge in the U.S. taxpayers renouncing their citizenship and up and leaving the country, they have to fill a form out first. A number of them have. Last quarter those Americans filed to file out. That is double the previous high set way back in the first quarter, a trend that appears to be picking up more steam this quarter.</p><p>To Imogen Lloyd-Weber and this Fox Business alert, Imogen is surprisingly sympathetic with these folks and my point of view, you think you can tax people to hell, until they diagram back an come back and say go to hell.</p><p>WEBER: Last week, I cried about the U.S. tax thing, I am a Brit, and moving here is a nightmare. I think I have sympathy in a sense of people that move here, normally the little guys that move here like me, trying to comply, trying to keep up with all the U.S. tax paperwork and so forth is a complete an nightmare.</p><p>CAVUTO: The regulation part or shear scope of taxes?</p><p>WEBBER: It's regulation part. To comply, you end up paying the accountant you could ever owe in a million years. If you get one bit wrong with the IRS then they could haunt you for the rest of your life.</p><p>CAVUTO: If we're to believe this, you have to be hitting a wall when a lot of people say, we're out of here.</p><p>MACDONALD: You are hitting a wall. They -- why is this news? For God's sake, that number that you quoted that was more that had left the country and you know, basically said --</p><p>CAVUTO: You knew we were doing a segment you can just play along.</p><p>MACDONALD: I am playing along.</p><p>CAVUTO: They push it then go.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's right. I'll tell you something. You see it happening even at the local level, Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, every time that they raise income taxes, people leave. Those cities have seen over the last decade a drop in their population. It's gotten so bad that cities like Kansas City and St. Louis have said if we fry to try to hike taxes on income then we have to revisit the law to make sure we do not lose population.</p><p>CAVUTO: Going around them so maybe rich don't notice?</p><p>BROOKS: Well, Neil, this is really about why we need tax reform. It's so complicated, that people say enough. They throw up hands say enough, I think this shows we need to comprehensively reform the U.S. tax code.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you know what I think whether you're a Brit or American, when you leave your country over tax rates maybe you're not that patriotic.</p><p>WEBBER: On some levels and this is why I'm saying my sympathy goes with the little guy, who is caught up in this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you a citizen in both countries?</p><p>WEBBER: No. I am a green card holder here.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you have kissed the motherland goodbye?</p><p>WEBBER: No, I am still a U.K. citizen however.</p><p>CAVUTO: There is a double --</p><p>WEBBER: There is a double jeopardy rule. We do have a treaty, Brits and Americans do still talk.</p><p>CAVUTO: We love you to date, and who could forget Monty Python. Here I thought Donald Trump ruthless when it came to firing people on the spot, the guy at AOL has him beat by a mile, at least Donald fires them in person, Tim Armstrong did it on a conference call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM ARMSTRONG, CEO, AOL: Able, put that camera down right now. Able, you are fired, out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Do you think what's going on right now is a joke and you want to joke around about it, you should pick your stuff up and leave. The reason is and I'm going to be very specific about this, is Patch from an experience -- Able, put that camera down now. Able, you're fired. Out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: What the hell? I mean, sir, former, sir, former -- just pack your bags and get the hell out of here right now. That is really how long it took AOL CEO Tim Armstrong to give the heave out to a worker who went too far. His sin, snapping a picture at a conference call meeting or did this guy simply too far.</p><p>The guy who fired him, let's have it out with Apple Metro CEO, Zane Tankel, who says this was fast graceful. And Anahita Sedaghatfar, defense attorney, who says, this is just like in the corporate world. You are a leader of the corporate world. Do you ever do stuff like that?</p><p>ZANE TANKEL, APPLE METRO CEO: It is certainly not life in the corporate world. He may be able to fire really quickly, trying hiring somebody of competency when that is your management style. It's so hard to get really great people with the work ethic. There was a recent article that said, 70 percent of all workers today are not engaged. Try getting them engaged when you --</p><p>CAVUTO: Maybe this puts the fear God into them.</p><p>TANKEL: I don't think in today's world. I don't think in today's world.</p><p>CAVUTO: So if you fire someone, it's one on one.</p><p>TANKEL: Neil, there's three reasons why people work today. One is their ethics, their father, their mother. They have a work ethic. Two is fear such as this and three is because they want to. The way you run a successful company you do it because they want to and because of fear.</p><p>CAVUTO: What little I do know about the AOL CEO, he's been here -- he strikes me as a very calm, reason measure guy and maybe this is a meeting in which he snapped, but coolness, for whatever reasons, and with a thousand people listening in, maybe the question of it. What do you think?</p><p>ANAHITA SEDAGHATFAR, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Yes, I agree. I mean, when I first listened to that tape, I really did think has Mr. Armstrong been watching too much \"Apprentice\" with Donald Trump and if so, someone should have told him. You're not Donald Trump. This isn't TV. It's real life, but you know --</p><p>CAVUTO: Even Donald Trump does it to his face -- the guy was snapping pictures of him that might have --</p><p>SEDAGHATFAR: Yes, he snapped and I get it. I'm a business owner. I get it. You get frustrated with his employees, but this isn't the way you go about running a business. And I was trying to say sadly for this employee he does not have type of employment discrimination case gain AOL or Mr. Armstrong because New York, like many other states is an at-will state, and what that means is that an employer can do exactly what Mr. Armstrong did here.</p><p>CAVUTO: Even if it does not look good. You might be legal, but it does not look good.</p><p>TANKEL: It is legal, but what is the message to your staff.</p><p>CAVUTO: What is the message?</p><p>TANKEL: If I don't perform right, I am gone.</p><p>CAVUTO: What is bad with that message?</p><p>TANKEL: I'll tell you what's wrong with it. You can't be on point 24/7 and watching people work, they have to do it because they want to, they are motivated by the leadership, motivated by accomplishments, by money. There is a lot to motivations.</p><p>CAVUTO: But fear isn't one of them.</p><p>TANKEL: Fear is not long-term motivation.</p><p>SEDAGHATFAR: I absolutely agree. From a legal standpoint no lawsuit, but the purpose of this conference call, Neil, remember was to get the employees fired up, get them pumped up.</p><p>CAVUTO: Maybe 999 were, one was not?</p><p>SEDAGHATFAR: I mean if you are an employee on the phone how will you be inspired to do well when your employer really does not care.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I just keep thinking, but Mr. Spacely! Anyway, it's too late for that, thanks for watching.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2013081201cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5940-JP81-DXH2-63PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>August 12, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000CRBB</classCode><className>TEA PARTY MOVEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE000A5DL</classCode><className>NEIL CAVUTO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009VZZ</classCode><className>RONALD REAGAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009WM7</classCode><className>JOHN BOEHNER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

A police force to monitor companies and whether they are complying with Obamacare. Navigating to push and coax Americans into Obamacare. And NSA now capable of retreating 75 percent of all Internet traffic. And IRS still -- still going after tax exempt groups. A Justice Department still intimidating Americans, now suing Texas over its voter I.D. law. A president bypassing Congress to push a cell phone tax to pay for Internet in all schools. A Senate majority leader determined to up the spending, period. And scores of cities and states equally determined to dramatically up the minimum wage. All this week. All this week. And it's got me feeling well, very weak. So much big government firing on so many fronts that it amazes me Republicans have all but raised the white flag. The speakers taking a pass by proposing a punt. We will get into that later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reality right now. The air of big government -- well it is back with a vengeance. And doesn't give a damn how much you complain.</p><p>Welcome, everybody, I am <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And that's pretty much where we stand. We don't stand a chance. Because now we have a Congress that doesn't only take a pass on spending, but a president who's bypassing them altogether when it comes to taxing. The fallout for you is startling. The fallout for your boss, numbing. A big on here with me right now, and he's worried like never before -- about government encroachment. He warned us it would get out of control, and now officially is. A tech guy, a fed-up (ph) guy.</p><p>Going along with me tonight, because his temper is kind of short tonight. With me now, Cypress semiconductor CEO, <person><nameText>T.J. Rodgers. </nameText></person>T.J., always good having you. But man, I mean you were kind of like a high-tech Nostradamus, you saw a lot of this coming. But it's here, and what's a little scary, T.J., is it's accelerating. It is not slowing, it's actually accelerating. What do you make of all of this?</p><p><person><nameText>T.J. RODGERS, </nameText></person>CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTORS FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Well, I see the, you know, the government trying to take over bigger and bigger part of the economy. That litany you just gave -- it sounds like we need, you know, radio \"Free Europe\" -- written out and called radio \"Free America.\" You know, the thing I'm worried about right now is jobs, the unemployment is still high. It is persistent. We have been doing the standard low interest rates and pump the economy thing, the depressing method -- for years now, it hasn't worked. And now we're talking about taxing the rich to pay their, quote, fair share, unquote. The thinking I did about it was that if we actually did raise taxes on the rich, right now the top five percent pay 58 percent of all taxes, I think that's already confiscatory, but leave that alone. If we take more money. The question is will that money create more jobs, and to me that's the big lie. I looked at what it cost small business to create a job, I have a small business in Wisconsin, it costs me $18,000 per job to create 65 jobs. The average in America for small businesses is $30,000 a job. It costs the government a million dollars a job in these stimulus programs to create a job. So, if you tax a million dollars out of the private economy, you lose, you know, 50 jobs, some number like that, and you create one job. And they keep saying, let's tax the rich guys in order to create jobs. And they don't count the fact that when they take money from the wealthy, that money comes out of investment, which is done by better, by better experts that are in the government. And the jobs lost on the private economy overwhelmed by a factor the jobs gained by the government.</p><p>CAVUTO: And what job gains, would you see, as you know, better than they, have been part-time. In fact, that is the trend. An unprecedented sort of a development in American history here. The health care law has a lot to do with that, that's not exclusively the reason. But obviously, big bosses like yourself are leery, and they are hedging their bets. How long do they hedge?</p><p>RODGERS: As long as it takes. You know, right now people say, companies are sitting on profit. And, of course, we are. You know, when you hire somebody, in effect it's like for CEOs, it's like having a kid. You're going to pour concrete, you're going to hire people, you're going to give them a stock option, five years duration. You're going to make plans for the future, you're going to create a product that will take you a couple of years to make. And if you don't feel the economy is going to be stable, level playing field for the next -- just a steady playing field for the next few years, you just don't do it. You sit back and wait. And you know, the litany you just read off, an idea a day out of Washington, all of which could change the viability of the business, means you just sit and wait until we get a president who will just run a stable country.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think of what Speaker Boehner is doing in the meantime? His critics say he is taking a pass, others are more pragmatic and say, they're just trying to keep the ball moving. But another temporary extension to sort of get us over the next hump, like so many others we have seen before. And that rattles some in corporate America, as we never get to the core of our problems, we just keep kicking the proverbial can down the road. What are your thoughts?</p><p>RODGERS: Oh, I have mixed feelings on that. Anytime you leave money with private individuals by not taxing them, you're better off. So, we have sequestering of funds, we're not spending as much. Guess what? I didn't notice the thing, you know, nothing I care about changed with this sequestering. So, in one way, I like the government getting smaller and maybe it will learn how to get smaller, maybe people understand it doesn't need to be as big as ...</p><p>CAVUTO: But do you think he is leading the effort on that regard or he is losing an opportunity to spearhead these issues?</p><p>RODGERS: He's losing an opportunity to spearhead -- I'm not sure, right now, if Americans are willing to listen. You know, we're in the summer. People just don't want to hear more squabbling ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah.</p><p>RODGERS: (inaudible) Even for ... Two presidencies, we've been listening to partisan bickering. People are getting kind of tired of it. We need to solve the problem. I think if we had a balance budget amendment and like cities and states they have today. If you don't have, you can't spend it, you can't print money, you can't borrow money. That would be -- that would be a big step forward. That would be a fundamental root cause solution to the problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it will do anything to gate (ph) what was planned to be a number of rallies over the next week, T.J., with folks demanding a doubling on a minimum wage, helped and propelled by unions, I'm sure, eager for new members. What do you think of that?</p><p>RODGERS: Well, I've always felt it was hypocritical. Either ignorant or hypocritical, on the minimum wage. I mean we all like to feel that if somebody's willing to work, that they're going to be taken care of, and the minimum wage -- they're going to be -- you know, they are at least going to be able to live right, but the fact is, what really happens in the real economy, like it or not, the minute you raise the wage to a higher level, the people below that are going to be unemployed. You're going to take people out of employment and put them on welfare, and they're going to be worse off. And then you're going to brag, that I'm -- I'm the great altruist, they're taking of the people, I've raised their wage. But the fact is, you put a bunch of people out of work. I've always felt that it's hypocritical -- at best ignorant economically, ignorant move to make, but it's -- I've been listening to the argument, talking to myself about it for 40 years, and not going to change.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, Wall Street, it's gyration, notwithstanding (inaudible) and then NASDAQ shot down and the rest. It has been kind of doing OK, with all the bumps still, what the Dow is still up about 13 to 14 percent. NASDAQ doing nicely. D you think it's missing something or is it just now grasping?</p><p>RODGERS: No, I think there is a reason the business is doing OK. One of the things you learn in business, is if you focus on something and do it right, you win. And then once you win, you get convinced that if you do more and more and more, that you'll win out on bigger scale.</p><p>You know, I think when business decided to hunker down, take the people a have (ph), and run the company right, that was -- that made some strategies better. Point one. Point two, our dollar is not worth what it used to be. You know, where the New Mexico? It's a good place to manufacturing. Or manufacturing companies could become more competitive. So smaller -- not smaller, but more conservative companies hunkering down. And -- and devalue dollar, are making for a reasonable climate. No growth, lousy unemployment but a reasonable climate for business right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: T.J., you're great. All we talk. You want to take a peek of young man and maybe consider running for office, but I guess you've had before. But T.J, thank you very, very much.</p><p>RODGERS: You're welcome.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, will here is how scary this big government thing really is getting. A prominent liberal is saying stop. Why Dennis at the NFA is a menace? And not only it needs the and besets (ph). It needs to no longer exist.</p><p>Then look the ESPN. Fox is a secret weapon. Rodgers, Fox Sports one. Looking to be number one. (ph) And the love king -- that's the tycoon there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Dennis Kucinich has had enough of big government. Well, not really, but when it comes to the NSA, actually, yeah, really. Because the former Democratic congressman and presidential candidate has heard more than enough about the agency's surveillance abuses and reprimands to say nothing of its constant overreach. So, he wants to reach for the stop button. And not only cut the agency's funding. How about cut the agency altogether? Dennis, congressman, do I have that right?</p><p>FMR. REP. DENNIS KUCINICH (D-OH): You do. And if you look at the Declaration of Independence, it said very clearly that when a government becomes disrespectful of the aims of a democracy or of our country, that we have the right to alter or abolish it. The NSA has clearly violated the Constitution, violated the laws of the land by broken trust, damaged the right to privacy. It has to go.</p><p>CAVUTO: You sound like a libertarian, Congressman.</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, I am. I am someone who believes in liberty and freedom and we cannot let this unholy marriage between big Internet corporations and big government cause our right to privacy to become polarized, and if we don't have a backlash from the American people who connect with the deeper principles of our Constitution, we're looking at losing not only the right to privacy, but losing a whole chain of freedoms that are connected with it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Congressman, do you think the president, then, lied, when he said there's not domestic surveillance going on in this country or he didn't know?</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, either scenario is pretty distressing. And one thing for sure: when we see that this agency, the NSA has unashamedly lied to the FISA court, repeatedly lied to Congress and either lied to the White House or is complicit with them, the agency has to go. There are plenty of intelligence agencies that can take up the slack, but the message has to be this: if you violate the Constitution, you violate American's right to privacy, you turn America to something that it's not, you're out of here.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, you don't buy the notion this is being done to keep us safe?</p><p>KUCINICH: We have to be protected from the NSA now. And this whole idea of -- they've created a protection record, it's the electronic protection record in the 21st century, analogous to the other kind of protection records that were run in the '30s, the '40s and '50s in this country, where people would go around and say, you've got a nice place, so you want to keep it that way. No, we've got to eliminate any kind of force within our government that is repeatedly violating the Constitution or otherwise we're going to lose our country, we're losing the sense of what it means to be an American now. If we get government, and we just -- we are -- government just turns rogue or an agency turns rogue, repeatedly violates the Constitution, annihilates or polarizes the right to privacy. You know, this whole idea of personhood, privacy is a spiritual space as well. Government has no right in that area, and yet we have seen the violations by the tens of thousands every year according to the FISA Court, by NSA. Neil, frankly, this cannot be tolerated and it needs to be the highest standards applied here. And I think the ultimate punishment, which is -- you are done.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is very well put, Congressman. Thank you very much/</p><p>KUCINICH: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Dennis Kucinich.</p><p>Is it time for the man with the pen to just walk into the sunset? Why something the speaker wants to do has some Tea Partiers ready to throw him overboard.</p><p>CAVUTO: Tonight's Clash -- time for Boehner to bolt? Growing anger now among a lot of conservative House members over John Boehner's push for a short-term budget bill to keep the government kind of limping along for another couple of months. It is the speaker's way of avoiding a government shutdown, but it's gotten some very angry House colleagues wondering whether the speaker should just step down. Should he?</p><p>Lizzy MacDonald says after so many punts, she is not surprised some of his members want to give their speaker the boot. Adam Lashinsky says calm down, the man is just trying to make everyone happy. Lizzy, you kind of say that that is a problem.</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FBN: Yes, I don't think they should compromise. Listen, they should not shut the government down, though. That is a really bad move. They will get blamed for it. They will basically not be able to fund the military, the FBI.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is what Boehner was saying, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: I don't think they shut the government down at all. They did it in '91 and '95. The GOP got blamed for it. By the way, they only have 45 votes in the Senate, so they can't get that done.</p><p>The thing that I'm talking about is hold their feet to the fire about the sequester. It worked. Even the government union is saying, yes, we found places to cut the fat (inaudible) through the government. We did not have to do the furloughs that they expected. It was successful.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think then the speaker should go or not?</p><p>MACDONALD: I don't know if he should go. I'm just saying he should just hold their feet to the fire and not be so ready to bend and compromise during this coming costume drama of the debt ceiling fight that is coming up.</p><p>CAVUTO: Adam, is he now running into the buzzsaw we already knew was there, and now he's going to pay dearly?</p><p>ADAM LASHINKY, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: Actually, I think not. Boehner is doing what passes for statesmanship right now in Washington. He's actually behaving responsibly.</p><p>CAVUTO: How is that statesmanship if we keep, you know, I understand what you're saying, but there is always a bump-along, temporary measure, temporary measure, temporary measure, just to keep us going.</p><p>LASHINSKY: It is far from ideal. But a temporary measure to avoid a shutdown, which would be bad for the country and bad for his own party, it is, you know, as I said, I hedge my language, Neil. It is the closest we can come to statesmanship right now. He is in a difficult negotiation with both the administration, and his own party, his own base in the House of Representatives. I see a man who's doing his best and I applaud him for doing his best. I'd much rather have him doing that than then elect a leader who would accede to their wishes and wreak havoc on the country in a completely irresponsible way.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, whether you guys are right or wrong, he's gone, I think he's gone. I think (inaudible) enough--</p><p>MACDONALD: And by the way, the Democrats are about to wreak havoc on the country, wanting to raise taxes yet again. I mean, enough already. Do the right thing by the American people and stop hitting us in our wallets and take care of your own fiscal house first.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, leave us alone.</p><p>LASHINSKY: Neil, I am probably going to be wrong with what I say, because I've never see you be wrong on tactical political issues. I think he survives for the same reason that he has survived so far. Because he is trying to do this balancing act. And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LASHINSKY: -- neither side in his own party wants to fire him.</p><p>CAVUTO: He could provide cover for them, I've heard that argument as well.</p><p>Our second clash, guys, is this. Would you still own bank stocks? If you knew the government was never, ever, ever going to rescue them again, ever? But Moody's is threatening to downgrade a bunch of them. Convinced the White House means what it says, when it says it will not bail them out if they ever get in trouble again. I think that could be the ratings agency's way of kind of stating the obvious. So for investors, take away the training wheels, would you still ride this bank bike? Lizzy, are bank stocks by definition a riskier investment if you take out the argument the government won't be there when everything hits the fan?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, they are. Just look at the big guys, I mean, look at Citigroup. They are still struggling. They still have a massive exposure to bad mortgage assets, and a lot of the bank balance sheets are improving because the Fed has been helping them out with the housing recovery by keeping rates down.</p><p>I mean, I will tell you something, this whole thing about bailing out banks is so bad. We should not have started on this process. It worked for a very long time by merging healthy banks with sick banks. The problem is when you have bailouts, and why have this massive regulatory scheme. It sort of undoes that whole rule-making agenda if you're going to bail them out anyway.</p><p>CAVUTO: So take the training wheels off, but without that guarantee, I know your views on rescues, you would not be looking at things.</p><p>MACDONALD: The reason why they do it is because the banks are the biggest buyers of government bonds.</p><p>CAVUTO: Exactly, no, no, exactly. So, Adam, that is essentially what Moody's -- I am way oversimplifying, and maybe too much so. But they are saying take that sort of factor out of the equation, you know, bank stocks lose a lot of their appeal. What do you make of that?</p><p>LASHINSKY: I think there is a ray of hope here. Yes, they lose their appeal, but that -- from an investor perspective, that is concerning. From a sort of national, from the stability of the financial perspective, this is really good news, because with Dodd-Frank, we are going to instead of bailing them out, we are going to wind them down. So if your bank that you invested in behaves badly, you will in fact--</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you really believe that, though, Adam? I always think with everything, when push comes to shove -- and I agree, that would be the logical approach, what you're advocating. But I think everyone gets scared, there is a meltdown coming, they fear it's going to be oh my God, Katie bar the door, and they scramble to the rescue.</p><p>LASHINSKY: I think we are making steps in the right direction. Lizzy glossed over this, but the leverage ratios are down, the balance sheets are better. This is partly for the reasons she said. Also because again, the regulators are forcing them to improve their balance sheets. This is all relatively good news. I'm not saying let's start doing cartwheels. They are de-risked so that Moody's can make this observation that they won't necessarily be safe.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm not glossing over that. Listen, when you are trading- -</p><p>CAVUTO: I knew that was going to start fire.</p><p>MACDONALD: When you are trading at only one times book value, that means you are really--</p><p>CAVUTO: Don't even get me going on book value.</p><p>MACDONALD: Don't even get me going on book value. But I'll tell you something, they are so inefficient, so huge and dangerous and not transparent, these big guys, the way they are running their balance sheets. I'm not liking this too big to fail regime.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You just had your ATM (inaudible) disconnected. Guys, thank you really, both, very, very much. Have a great weekend.</p><p>Meanwhile, you think ESPN is unbeatable on the cable sports front? I think they used to say that same thing about CNN 17 years ago on the cable news front. Fox News, of course, had a guy named Roger. Fox Sports has an equally cunning star. And his name is Regis!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGIS PHILBIN: Google my name, you get 7 million results. Walk Hollywood Boulevard and look down, there's Regis again! You want an Emmy? Take one of mine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, the professional football season hasn't even started. And we are getting word that ads for next year's Super Bowl are almost completely sold out. What the Fox? Well, it must be Fox, right? Which would be broadcasting the big game, of course, and it must be a very good omen for my next guest, because Fox's big time in the cable sports game. That's right, ESPN, start getting rattled, because Regis is rumbling. Regis Philbin, the star of Fox Sports One and a very friendly face behind Rupert Murdoch's latest plan to take over the universe. Regis, very good to have you.</p><p>PHILBIN: Thank you. That's about it, too.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, that is it. You are on a mission from God.</p><p>PHILBIN: That's right.</p><p>CAVUTO: What made you do this? You've done everything else.</p><p>PHILBIN: Well, I was out for a year and a half, and a friend of mine had an idea about a once a week show that we used to do years ago in LA. And so he took it to Eric Shanks (ph), one of your top guys, and the more they talked about it, the more Shanks became interested. They both flew to New York, we spent some time, and Shanks was more interested in the sports network that was starting here on Fox.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you, you say you are not a sports guy, although you're quite good at this. But what made you do it? It's certainly different.</p><p>PHILBIN: It is different. Yes. I've always loved sports. And there were times when, in my career over the year, I had a little sports show here and there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, you did stuff before Fox Sports One?</p><p>PHILBIN: Yes, yes. And enjoyed it very much. And then would always talk about sports on my talk show with my co-host, who she wouldn't -- either one of them would never listen to me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PHILBIN: -- would say what--</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PHILBIN: Is he talking about sports? What?</p><p>CAVUTO: But I am wondering, you know, you joked about it yourself, an 81-year-old guy, reaching to the 18-to-49 demo. What do you think of that?</p><p>PHILBIN: I think it can be done. I'm hoping it can be done. I am going to do things like you know, instead of just athletes, we've got to have some entertainers in there as well. We got a guy coming up next Wednesday on the show, Bill Cosby, who played defensive back for Temple University. In the last couple of years I'm looking at Temple University and they are growing into a pretty good football machine. So all of a sudden on my Notre Dame schedule this year, it's Temple. The first game we played. So Cosby knew about it too. I said you got to get Bill Cosby on the show. He flew down to Philadelphia give the Temple team a pep talk.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have a pretty impressive role. So does it bother you? You just move on?</p><p>PHILBIN: No, I haven't heard that yet. I mean, people are interested in seeing how we will approach it. And what we are going to offer. That is what we are doing all week.</p><p>CAVUTO: There a lot of connections already. But I notice that it's bigger on your personality. Was that by design? Is going to be different? Sports and events that define it, is this about the personality?</p><p>PHILBIN: I must tell you. I really didn't expect to be working with five other people. But they have some interesting people in there. They have a great big football player from the Baltimore Ravens and the Denver Broncos, 14 years in the NFL, two Super Bowls, just a terrific guy, Trevor Price, big defensive --</p><p>CAVUTO: Anyone you hate, you think it's going to problem?</p><p>PHILBIN: No. There's a guy who wants to be a comedian. He is a former tennis pro. There's Jason Gay from the \"Wall Street Journal.\" They flew in a gal named Georgie Thompson from England who is into soccer. Do you know much about soccer?</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a sport where you kick the ball.</p><p>PHILBIN: It's going to be the biggest deal in the world the way it looks.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's interesting in this country it's big with our kids when they are young and then it falls away.</p><p>PHILBIN: You're absolutely right. They are in the schoolyard. They are playing soccer. And you got around New York City. They are playing soccer. We talk about soccer every day.</p><p>CAVUTO: You are a nice guy. Usually people who survive just have an evil quality to them. You just love what you do.</p><p>PHILBIN: Thank you very much. I just love television. They checked me out very carefully, but it worked out really well. But I just never thought a million years when I was at Notre Dame that I would be offered any broadcaster radio. Then I was in the service and I would look at television and I would say, gosh, that looks like fun.</p><p>But what can I do? I don't have a broadcasting voice come I don't have any talent. Two tough guys, they went in as private because they were honored when on the battlefields. But anyway, the guy said to me, what you want to do in your life, now that you are leaving.</p><p>And I look at these people on TV and it is like, don't you know that you can have anything you want in this life. You've only got one chance. Now do you want it and I said, I just -- I don't know and he said, I said do you want to? And I said, yes, sir. It's the first time I said that.</p><p>One of my producers for Mike Douglas went out and had a job that they had, Little Roger.</p><p>CAVUTO: Everyone is getting ready with musical chairs.</p><p>PHILBIN: I just don't know. You know, I'm surprised that NBC is letting Jay Leno go. I guess they are looking for the young audience. I can't answer that question. I followed you for years. I want to know <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>How is Apple going to do next six months?</p><p>CAVUTO: We will talk after the show. I don't give this stuff out for free.</p><p>PHILBIN: You are hilarious. I watched you for years talked about this. I need help. Anyway, what else you got?</p><p>CAVUTO: I look at the landscape. He seemed to be always up front, everyone going on around you. But what do you like to watch?</p><p>PHILBIN: I'm watching sports, to tell you the truth, because it's really important.</p><p>CAVUTO: I could be wrong. It could be an inner passion of yours.</p><p>PHILBIN: I mean, to see those guys battle it out. They're trying to bring boxing back and we have him on as well. We have those who are bringing the boxing writer, bringing the right spots. People love to see it, you know?</p><p>CAVUTO: You guys are hooking your wagon to this.</p><p>PHILBIN: Please don't forget soccer.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that enough? You need to do stuff like more college football? You know, to get this other kind of stuff that won't give up?</p><p>PHILBIN: I think that they are slowly moving into that area. Fox has looked at that. Fox did get the chance to play at Stanford.</p><p>CAVUTO: He came out with a bang. It is not too shabby.</p><p>PHILBIN: I think that's just great.</p><p>CAVUTO: And income at the time they were rich when they were CEOs. Do you pay much attention to politics?</p><p>PHILBIN: I really don't get into that very much.</p><p>CAVUTO: In the old days it was every bit as heated.</p><p>PHILBIN: I think that they were more genteel with the people. I started in San Diego. Richard Nixon.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know what did you think of him?</p><p>PHILBIN: Well, I said to him that I had a piano the end I heard about you playing the piano. And I thought, let's go. He played the piano forums and he was pretty good. We had a lot of laughs. Somehow I got into him and so that he became a terrific guest. Years later I ran into a guy named Paul Keys. And you know, he said, wow, I love being with that guy. And I really felt good about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: It seems like it would be really important. Some may have a type that and it would break down things with you. But we were doing a lot of these specials, leading up to the dreaded fascination, and here is how different kinds of work. In the interview John Kennedy says can we review a couple of these questions, and they allowed it. They allowed it. It goes along in a few, but that was a different time. For the president said if we did it again, we were doing.</p><p>PHILBIN: I think it's going to be very honest. He's beginning out there and taking it for whatever it is. It's a tense interview? Who have now come another day? But he is quite a guy.</p><p>CAVUTO: When you look at just the TV message, that young people today, my daughter for example, I think everything is on that. Rupert Murdoch says that this is just how it is and transported and is it the same with I.T.?</p><p>PHILBIN: I don't have one of those devices. I really don't. So what is going on? Everyone is talking about little thing and it's kind of scary. What we have on the show is girl from Boston who was into the situation. Who is inside the internet? We go on and what is the latest on what is going on. We're covering ourselves. One of them is going to happen, I'm sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: What have you done with all of your dollars?</p><p>PHILBIN: Well, I have about six kids and I have about 13 more at Notre Dame. The scholarship thing is incredible. It really is. So that is what I am doing.</p><p>CAVUTO: A great accomplishment, a great fortune. They just want to have a blast and travel the world.</p><p>PHILBIN: I have a nice house in Connecticut.</p><p>CAVUTO: You just sold one in Connecticut, didn't you?</p><p>PHILBIN: Yes and I brought another one. I'm answering all your questions. Tell me about Apple, Apple up or down?</p><p>CAVUTO: Could you see yourself doing what the network talk show? I look at all these things come in the big names come and they are good. Not blowing smoke, I think and two of the best interviewers out there. I think people of all ages clearly love you. And I think a lot of these guys are across the board with al groups. Do you ever want that? Without getting in the mix with these guys?</p><p>PHILBIN: I don't think so. I think the age factor would stop.</p><p>CAVUTO: The older you got come in with young people accepted.</p><p>PHILBIN: Thank you very much, I agree with you. Why don't you how many? Let's call river right now you get him on the phone.</p><p>CAVUTO: You look at this as a long-term effort? My first contract went to eat. That was here at Fox. And we had the other entries here.</p><p>PHILBIN: When he left have to make that decision. Did you know it was going to be week to week?</p><p>CAVUTO: It was actually thought it was a full hearted mission. But it is tough when you go against the grain and everyone says oh, in your case, ESPN is the dominant player, good luck. Good luck with this news channel that you will dominate. It's amazing how much it can seem to be wrong.</p><p>PHILBIN: Well, I don't know. They seem to keep going. They have hit this and they're running forward. I think age has a lot to do with it. I don't know anyone my age, but is still having this. I think it's a great bottom line.</p><p>CAVUTO: Best of luck to you.</p><p>PHILBIN: Tell me about Apple.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you are going to talk about this comment might be like Carl Icahn. Regis, thank you, you are the best. In the meanwhile, I hope that this has nothing to do with the CEO of Microsoft announcing that he might be leaving in the year. I think we just put them up-to-date. It is kind been downhill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT GRAIFELD, NASDAQ CEO: We were deeply disappointed with what happened yesterday. We did become live quite successfully and finished the day in normal course of business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, someone find me a body language expert. I am not buying it. A whole bunch of traders aren't either. From professional folks to average folks who seemed to be saying to the Nasdaq folks after this latest snafu that it's getting kind of long. Which could mean trouble for all of those who have stocks residing on the Nasdaq. If their exchange looks rocky, who are you to say that stocks like Apple, Intel, Cisco and so many others don't look rocky as well? Maybe just not some, what do you think?</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, MONEY MAP PRESS: You know what his interview look like after this whole crash? I didn't do it. I mean, you know, body language that was it. I think this big tech companies are suspect because if the foundation is rocky then who is to say the pricing is actually accurate. You know, whether or not it is the exchange, data coming in, who knows.</p><p>But investor confidence was dead and buried a long time ago between the insider trading, the big banks, the bailouts you guys were talking about. It's easier to find someone that believes in the tooth fairy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Does it affect Nasdaq issues though especially some of those prominent technology names, Gary B., would add just another level, but another level of caution?</p><p>GARY B. SMITH: To the high-frequency trader, yes, absolutely. That three-hour glitch was like a canyon, but 99 percent of the people who are not involved, absolutely no effect. I asked my wife at the end of the day, do you know about the Nasdaq outage and it's like, what he talking about. That is what the average person is saying in the Ciscos of the world.</p><p>CAVUTO: Steve, I love showing folks whooping it up. I said that you are every bit as impressive with incoming freshmen. So maybe it is just coincidental. But I hear that you are getting all of these calls to team up and do motivational speaking. And I saw that you are already a billionaire. So Gary, I do know that once word got out, the stock was jumping.</p><p>SMITH: I think what you read into it, he's really every horrible. I look back in the last 15 years in the Microsoft stock has done zero. In that same time Apple has not 7000 percent. You know, I think that they need to start thinking differently. They need some of this in America.</p><p>CAVUTO: That could be you. You become what you think?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: You know, a blogger said he looked like planet of the apes when he did that dance, the CEO got to do that? No, I have long advocated that it's a good thing that he's gone.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so you have this note. In the final blitz and speaking of Apple, offering a series of new phones before Apple's big announcement. It has a 40-hour per month preview. I guess no limit. Hitler said it is because the advertising buzz is just slowly filling in. You're not so convinced about that?</p><p>SMITH: I am not. I think it's just best to avoid these stocks. I never liked that. You have to keep paying every time. I think that's more stable way to go.</p><p>CAVUTO: Could I switch gears then and look at the other side of this, would you, Keith, Apple, I mean, it's getting attacked on all fronts. It's getting sort of wind up by what used to be considered effusions now going for the prints. Are the wounds piling up, damage done, what?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: You know, I think they are. I think since Jobs' unfortunate demise or death, the company is oozing MBA's are no longer oozing innovation. I think bandwidth has gone to zero. There's certainly be changed to foreign factor with regard to its iPad and iPod. But you know, bandwidth is ubiquitous now and I think Pandora is making move. To me the thing is more interesting about this is the application feed that's going to develop as a result of it. I think Pandora is simply stepping out ahead. I think Apple is going to play me too. This reminds me of the Sony Betamax wars years ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's interesting. Guys, I want to thank you both. Have a great weekend. I look forward to Mark Cuban on Monday. This is a place where billionaires come home to roost.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2013082301cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:596B-5JD1-DXH2-61D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>August 23, 2013 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

If the IRS is not going to cut any one over these targeted groups, how about we just cut the IRS's funds and target its budget. Welcome, everybody. I am <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>Well, GOP to IRS, how is this for tax thing? House Republicans looking to cut 3 million bucks from the IRS budget. 4 million less than what the White House wants. Clearly, it is punishment for an agency that won't so much as reprimand itself, and its administration, that just as clearly thinks, it really doesn't have to, because two months after the White House promised that it was going to get to the bottom of this IRS mess, not a single targeted conservative group has been questioned or so much as an initial finding had been reported. So, maybe the IRS's getting its budget cut it just deserves. After all, if you're going to whack groups for no reason, why not whack their finding? For what seems like very good reason. Now to the congressman leading that charge and eager to cut the cash. With me now <person><nameText>Republican Kevin Brady </nameText></person>in Texas. Congressman, it sounds like a sound idea to me. Does it have much popular support?</p><p><person><nameText>REP. KEVIN BRADY, </nameText></person>(R-TX), HOUSE DEPUTY WHIP: You know, I think it does, and mainly because it's something you don't see around Washington much, which is accountability. This cut simply says, look, clean up your act, follow the recommendations of the inspector general, stop the frivolous funding on from bonuses to conferences, and by the way, stop covering up these patterns of abuse and open up the IRS, so we can get to the truth, and I think that is fair.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now, this would have an (inaudible) fight in the Senate, I imagine, even if it gets through the House. So, you're probably more truly sending a warning to the IRS, that you're on it, you expect accountability, expect reaction, you expect immediate action on some of these abuses and that has been shortcoming, has it?</p><p>BRADY: You know, it has not been happening at all. The new acting head of the IRS, I think, is trying to manage the problem, rather than create trust, open it up, help us get to the truth here. But just know this, Neil. These dollars that have been withheld are for specific actions. If the IRS follows the recommendations of the Inspector General in cleaning up their act and changing their behavior, you know, than finding follows, until they do that, they need to know that their behavior or lack of reforms have consequences.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Does this have any implication down the road, Congressman, IRS's role eventually in policing at least the financial part of healthcare? There are about 40 somewhat different areas that they will oversee when the healthcare law comes in to full fruition. Do you want to stop that as well because their budget is going to go up exponentially once that happens.</p><p>BRADY: You know, at this point I think the IRS has lost any credibility enforcing the Affordable Care Act. This is - they're using their dollars in their enforcement to pursue political agendas, based on political belief, we don't think they have the credibility to enforce the 23 taxes and all the mandates within Obamacare either. Nor is there confidence among American public they will protect our taxpayer information once we give it to them, so right now they're probably the least credible organization in the federal government. They've got some changing to do.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Congressman, we'll watch closely on Kevin Brady of the fine state of Texas, on what could be a way to get the IRS going or not, depending on your point of view.</p><p>But now to the Tea Party who says, why just cut around the corners when it didn't got to the core? And maybe cut the IRS itself out of existence. With me now Tea Party activist Gina Loudon. Gina, good to have you. You are not for just sort of doddering here, you're for walloping. Explain why.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GINA LOUDON, TEA PARTY ACTIVIST &amp; RADIO HOST: Music to my years, Neil. You know, the IRS has become a weapon of mass destruction against the taxpayers. It is so corrupt, we know, that is unconstitutional, it was actually voted unconstitutional once upon a time. There are so many problems with this and not only that. It's so old school. There's such much more efficient ways we can tax the people in the United States that are much more fair. And I think would settle well with most of the American people. It's definitely time to make these reforms.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but you know, be careful what you ask for. You just might get it, and that the argument is to just abolishing the IRS. Well, a lot of people share that view. It is - that's impractical and you need an organization that polices whether people are paying the taxes. You pay your taxes, I pay my taxes, but there are a lot of people who tried to pull some fast ones, and you need an agency, whether it's IRS or something else to monitor that.</p><p>LOUDON: But it doesn't need to be the largest organization in the federal - largest federal bureaucracy, there is. It doesn't need to be an organization that has targeted minority groups. It doesn't need to be an organization that votes itself fat cat bonuses. If this were a private business, Neil, you and I both know, it would be long gone, because the government would have regulated it out of business. It is completely corrupt, it's unconstitutional and it needs to go away. And there are great answers out there. You know, the progressives are always saying, they love the word fair, right? So let's do something fair. Let's do something that does tax everybody straight across the board like a consumption tax. It can't be avoided by the black market work like ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, you don't need a big agency.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I see, but you don't need a big agency to police that.</p><p>LOUDON: Yes, you don't.</p><p>CAVUTO: But back to these whole harassment of conservative groups, what you - I think you might have been one, but do you know anybody in your case or others, whether they were contacted by these group that's supposedly investigating what happened at the behest of the president?</p><p>LOUDON: I know so many different people that have been attacked by the IRS and one from another ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, but no one - no one has been - where (inaudible)</p><p>No one has been contacted, these groups that were targeted, had not been contacted by this White House investigator, that is looking into what happened, and that worries me.</p><p>LOUDON: That's right. That's right. And I'm still hearing continued stories of abuse that are new stories of abuse, so basically nothing is being done here, and this organization needs to go way. Having an organization like this is sort of tantamount to driving a covered wagon to a hospital. We need to come to the edge, this century, of automobiles and get this done in a much more efficient, transparent, technologically savvy way. It's time for the IRS to be abolished. Straight up. Get them gone.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but as you know, they're going to play a central role in health care and unless something changes and fairs the roll out for that, actually begins next year. And it's sort of ...</p><p>LOUDON: You're fine.</p><p>CAVUTO: Setting a stone, and you're saying, unset it.</p><p>LOUDON: You know, I am always looking for opportunities for politicians to be heroes. I thought W. (ph) in deep hole this week that said two-thirds of Americans are demanding that the IRS, go away. This is the chance for politicians - I thought you were on the Superman list this week. This is the chance for politicians to ingratiate themselves to the American population they're supposed to serve and say, hey, we are going to do what makes sense here, instead of continuing on because this is the way things have always been done. The American people have spoken, Neil, and it's time to make some changes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Gina, always great having you on. Thank you very much.</p><p>LOUDON: Always good to be here with you. Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Gina Loudon. By the way, Congress isn't only busy cutting cash for the IRS. Now, it's looking abroad and seeing this as full and cutting the catch out there as well.</p><p>But you'll never guess where they want to start. It's enough to get Joe Lieberman here on the flash to say Congress, you are going too far.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Cairo is still a mess, and a government now toppled, to which we have already given billions, gets worse. No wonder why Republicans want to cut any more aid now. But guess where they are targeting their spending at right now? Not Egypt, Syria. As all the dough that we are forking over to Syrian rebels, they worry that it is going to the wrong guys, rebels who need us, but don't much like us, and because many are aligned to al Qaeda, it might actually turn around to kill us. To Joe Lieberman who says, they're jumping to conclusions and giving a thick pay to (inaudible), a big jump on continuing to crush its people. Senator, good to have you back.</p><p>FMR. SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN (I-CT): Neil, great to be back.</p><p>CAVUTO: I just wondered myself, this seemed out of the blue, I mean I would be looking that maybe if you had any reason to sort of curtail. Funny you can reassess Egyptian government and changes there, but the Syrian thing, I think, was just odd. What do you make of it?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yeah, no - I agree. Look, this has been going on in Syria now for more than two years. More than 100,000 people have died. I mean it is a humanitarian disaster and the cause of freedom is on the line. We should have been in there in the beginning. I went over earlier on met the opposition to Assad. Assad is an anti-American dictator. These were ...</p><p>CAVUTO: And how do you know, some of these other groups that have formed? Justice (inaudible)</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Well, now we've waited too long. And ...</p><p>CAVUTO: We don't know this.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: We know enough, we - listen, if our intelligence is not good enough, and I am sure it is good enough, to know who the good guys are over there and who the bad guys are, we've got a problem. And ...</p><p>CAVUTO: But it started out earlier what we did, like when guys like you were there and you knew who they were ....</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: But now the fear is what Republicans are saying senators. Now, we are not quite so sure and do we want to make the same mistake we apparently made in Egypt?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yeah, I think we've got to take a risk. And the reason is not only to try to stop the humanitarian disaster of the killings, but what is happening in Syria is really a proxy war between Iran and Russia on one side, and our allies in the Arab world and us on the other side, but we're not very much on the field. We finally have begun to give some assistance to the opposition to Assad. If Assad goes down, it is the biggest defeat for Iran, his patron in the Middle East, in a long time and helps us to put pressure on them to stop their nuclear weapons program, which, I think is the biggest threat to the region and the world today.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Senator, I had Ron Paul here not too long ago, and he was saying, what have we got for all the money we've given? Now, of course, he's clearly libertarian, his point of view, it is not worth it, you know, stop it, and all that. Because in one country after another we've had a record of putting that on the wrong people and they come back and they bite us. And he sees things like U.S. flag burnings at some of these demonstrations. So, why add insult to injury?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yeah.</p><p>CAVUTO: What is that?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: So, looking a lot of places around the world over the last 25 or 30 years, this has really been and advance of democracy and freedom and pro-American allies. That is certainly true in Eastern and Central Europe, the former Soviet Union and it is also true in Asia.</p><p>CAVUTO: But what about this region? Maybe, I don't know - when there's a gentlemanly way to put it. You were the last gentleman in Washington. Maybe they are just nuts? And there is no way you can bet on any group, because they all seem crazy.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yeah, but they are not all crazy. I spent a lot of time over there. And what happened in Tunisia and Egypt, and then Libya, and it began to happen in Syria, was an uprising of what I would call moderate sort of modernizing young Arabs who were sick and tired of the dictators who are not only ...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, why did they turn on the very government that they put in power?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: This last time around?</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Right. In Egypt because they concluded and I agree with them, that an election is only one element of really having a democracy. The rest of it is, that's just as important, more important, ultimately. It's freedom. It's human rights.</p><p>CAVUTO: But does it trouble you on some level, senator, that whatever merits you think - what you're saying is accurate, that it was a military that toppled the democratically elected government. Maybe for valid reasons ...</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: That doesn't look good.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It doesn't look good. But I will tell you, and it's the most unusual circumstance, and it's not - you know, you try to follow your ideals, but then sometimes you just have to be practical about this, and in this case, Morsy, the previous Muslim Brotherhood leader of Egypt was really becoming a dictator. The people had no alternative, but to go out in the streets and very unusually, the military basically got him out of power and now give the revolution that started against Mubarak a second chance to work, but they have got to learn to work with each other, and that is a real challenge.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, this is - probably going to sound like a racist comment, but isn't it by design in nature that, you know, the Muslim-led government by design isn't going to reconcile with the secular interest of its people? Maybe that's that what happened in this government's case? And that is irreconcilable.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: So, in this government's case, in the case of Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood, they won the election. Not by a lot, but they won it, and then he began to close off the opposition, people's freedom, putting ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Because it's given his background - given his ...</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yeah.</p><p>CAVUTO: It wasn't in his DNA, to be a democratically elected leader.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: So, I by the way, I think it depends on the leader. It depends on the Muslim leader. In Tunisia, we've had an encouraging situation, which is an Islamist party, actually, got more votes than any of the other parties, but it needed to form a coalition ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: ....to get a majority to govern and it made the coalition with secular Muslim Arab parties and they pretty much held together.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think that could be (inaudible), because it looks tough.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It's tough. But that is the (inaudible). It's very hard to go from where a lot of these countries going when you had central dictatorship, not only controlling their freedom, but basically, taking the wealth of the country. And the people got fed up with it. Most of them want what you and I want, which is a better life, the kids grow up better. And not to be governed by extremist whether they are secular dictators or Islamist extremist. That's the whole - it's not going to be easy to get there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator, really quickly on this healthcare thing. Many argue it is falling apart. It's losing a key source of funding. It's imploding. What do you say?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: I don't think it is imploding. I mean I think this step back on that funding requirement was probably smart to do to show some flexibility in the Obama administration, that they were responding, no problem. But there - they have not said they're going to repeal it. It's coming in a year when I think people are going to be better able to take it. No, I think it's going to be there. I will never forget when President Clinton came in to talk to a bunch of us, senators when we were reconsidering the House healthcare proposal, and he said, get it as good as you can and then adopt it, because trust me, you're going to be coming back for 25 years to fix it because you cannot get it right the first time. And that is the question. I mean it remains unpopular, I'm afraid that the administration has not done as good of a job as it should have done in convincing the American people that this was - to the ....</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think they knew all these problems were there, and they just did not say?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: I don't know. I can't say.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think you do.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, I have no idea.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Joe Lieberman, it's always a pleasure. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Great to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Just classed up the city nonsense in letting here - anyway. You had it was Google handing over your stuff. Well, how about telling Google to just get stuff? The search engine that is making it awfully tempting and actually, awfully easy. After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, if Ed Snowden is right, the government might snoop, but it sure has a whole lot of culprits helping it out. Among them scores of high-tech companies, that not only hand over the affirmation what the NSA asked, but according to Snowden, keep a back door open, just in case they want to come back and get some more. To the search engine that says Uncle Sam to just search on, because it won't be giving up a thing. And promises it uses no one is going to be tracking them. That engine is called DuckDuckGo. And the guy, creating all this quacking joins us now. CEO Gabriel Weinberg. Gabriel, how do you stick to that? How do you stick to that promise?</p><p>GABRIEL WEINBERG, DUCKDUCKGO CEO: So, when you search anything on the Internet or going any Web site, you are automatically sending over this information, the metadata that we keep talking about, right? What we do is literally throw that information away. We throw that metadata away, so that we just start completely anonymous searches. So, if someone were to come to us and ask us, you know, hand over data on E.U. We literally cannot do that, because we don't have it.</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't believe you. No, because I think you guys are so hi- tech and brilliant. You have ways - and you know.</p><p>WEINBERG: That is the beauty of it is. You literally throw it away and never write at a desk. Never store it. So, even if someone's stole out your servers, for instance, or hacked into your system, which has happened to big tech companies. There is still no way to expect the information.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, how do you make money?</p><p>WEINBERG: That's the beauty of it. It is a myth that Web search engines need to track you to make money. We make money the same way they do, which is serve and ad based on the keyword, and not the person, so you type in like car, you will get the car ad. It's pretty simple.</p><p>CAVUTO: But are you keeping track of a number of times that I punched in the word \"Car\" ?</p><p>WEINBERG: No, no so all they have ....</p><p>CAVUTO: It might just be one time I did car and that's what's doing it, or ...</p><p>WEINBERG: Exactly.</p><p>CAVUTO: What's - you at least get to be the first time.</p><p>WEINBERG: So, it's all in real time. So, you're typing car, you get a car ad. The next day you come and type in mortgage, so you get mortgage ads.</p><p>CAVUTO: You don't have these big old size of Rhode Island servers that are keeping track of all this?</p><p>WEINBERG: No, no, data center in Utah.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. So, let's say now the NSA, when it come to you and say, we need to collect all of your records. What do you say?</p><p>WEINBERG: We say the laws are structured that you cannot force a company to change its business practices.</p><p>CAVUTO: Understood, but that's under a judge's order.</p><p>WEINBERG: That's right. But still, the order says, only orders about turning over existing business records or they have preservation orders, which (inaudible) about enabling you to keep records for longer. So, if you start for 24 hours, you know, start for two weeks. And since we don't have any records, there is really nothing to compel us to turn over.</p><p>CAVUTO: But what is to stop me as an NSA agency saying, you know, this guy's is too clever for words. I bet he does have that stuff, I'm going to take over this, I'm going to get access to this, and I'm going to prove that he does have?</p><p>WEINBERG: Right. If they saw we had access, and we're trying to hack us, or came to us with a court order, you know, we would be compelled to turn over our data and that is why we don't store anything.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you find the Google's and the Apples and the others - who have given information, they say for national security reasons, or they were told at the time.</p><p>Do so easily, do so almost too easily?</p><p>WEINBERG: You know, it's a little unclear from all of the statements falling around, but what is clear is that the presumption for big tech companies is to store as much data as possible and hope that, you know, they could use it later for something useful. And the reality ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Google says he keeps this stuff so they could target ads ...</p><p>WEINBERG: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, whatever.</p><p>WEINBERG: Who knows, I think most of it is just kept and not used, but the reality is that there is about court order. Whenever that turns out to be a valid, whenever we decide this constitutional line. If it's still valid, they have to turn it with the data. And because the data exists, they are going to have to turn it over.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, what are you making when Ed Snowden tells at interview in Europe, I believe, he was talking about this, that a lot of it keeps this sort of back door open, which I think, and you know this far better than I, allows the government to come back in? And so to check the place out.</p><p>WEINBERG: Although there is a story out today that companies have been charging, you know, the government ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right, right, right.</p><p>WEINBERG: For wiretapping an access. And what that says to me is that there are systems in place to deal with this request and the volume.</p><p>CAVUTO: I always think the government doesn't need those inconsistency, right? It's just sort of ...</p><p>WEINBERG: Well, it makes it easier for the company, right?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WEINBERG: They are getting thousands and thousands of requests, you got to do something and hand it over easily. And that's the worry right? That's become too easy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Has your business grown since this whole Snowden thing (inaudible)</p><p>WEINBERG: Yes. I mean we always think people don't want to be tracked but really, they don't know what to do about it, and so, what this has really revealed is that there are private alternatives you can switch to, it's a little sacrifice. And so, we have seen, you know, our users spreading it to their friends and family and saying, hey, you know, I use this search engine that gets great results, but also, it does not track you. And so we've been up about 90 percent since this whole ...</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>WEINBERG: Yes, since this new cycle.</p><p>CAVUTO: Totally clear. It's just - the ballpark kind of question. Do you think Ed Snowden is a hero?</p><p>WEINBERG: You know, it's a little too early to tell. If you need - if you can whistleblower in this manner and stay in the U.S., I think that's ...</p><p>CAVUTO: You think the fact that he did not stay in the U.S. takes away the free speech he wrote (inaudible)</p><p>WEINBERG: You know, there was an editorial by Daniel Ellsberg the other day in \"The Post.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah. Pentagon papers.</p><p>WEINBERG: Yeah, and it was - it was pretty compelling that you would have to leave the country. And so, I don't really know what to make of it, but I know that I like there is an open discussion about the constitutional lines of this stuff. And I think it's great to be public, and not private. I don't like at all being secret.</p><p>CAVUTO: Good for you. Thank you very much. DuckDuckGo the founder and CEO on fire right now.</p><p>Remember what (inaudible) on immigration reform was in the Senate? But don't look now, but it's falling apart in the House. The Republican Congress and - knows why after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, the president might be touting its economic benefits, but as things stand out, immigration reform is looking kind of like that health care law on life support. Only healthcare is the law and immigration reform is a long way from becoming law, and that's because Republicans at the House think it - well, not only doesn't make money, Louisiana Republican Congressman John Fleming says, at this point it really doesn't make much sense. The congressman joins me on the phone. Congressman, you are still opposed to this thing, right?</p><p>REP. JOHN FLEMING (R ),LOUISIANA: Yeah, absolutely, Neil. And I just came from an extended conference with my fellow Republicans, and out of over, you know, well over 210 members, I don't think there was one single person in that room who would vote for this current Senate immigration amnesty bill.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow. So that would effectively kill it in the House. There is all sorts to talk, but John Boehner is under enormous pressure to try to woo some of those reluctant colleagues of yours. Has he had any luck, if you're right? No.</p><p>FLEMING: Well, you know, it's interesting - there is a broad consensus we all want to solve the problem, we want to fix the immigration. We see it as broken. But we also have a broad consensus that it all begins with border security and the Senate bill is anything but border security.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I had Senator Marco Rubio here not too long ago, Congressman. He says that has been addressed and he doesn't know how to make it more forceful that the proviso was in there -- you know, saying under threat of military action. What do you want to see that presently you don't see in the Senate version?</p><p>FLEMING: Well, first of all, there is no end point. There is no verifiability. There is no certification process. We offer one in our homeland security bill that's passed of a committee. It authorizes a bunch of resources, but the president as he has done in many cases can redirect those any place that he wants and it does not appropriate money even borders resources.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you worry that this will be a redoubt of what Ronald Reagan was (inaudible). In other words, a grant amnesty or what seemed to be at the time in 1986 amnesty, but without getting the promised reinforced border?</p><p>FLEMING: I think it doubles down in and takes the problem from bad to worse.</p><p>CAVUTO: Congressman, thank you very much.</p><p>FLEMING: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, here's how bad are things getting for Speaker Boehner and all of this? Harry Reid says he actually feels sorry for him and Republicans are keeping him from doing what is right on immigration reform and so Reid expects no immigration reform from now. Does he have a point? Dennis Hastert, what do you think?</p><p>DENNIS HASTERT, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: You know, I think Boehner's probably in a tough spot, but you know, you look at the issue. The issue isn't going to go away. The issue doesn't get better by not addressing it. That's what leaderships about. You have to convince folks that there is a way.</p><p>To just reject the Senate bill, you have to have something to beat something. So there should be something of the House. What the House really needs to do is come together and say, OK, we need more border security. Let's put up together a bill with more border security.</p><p>If we need to have a path -- a naturalization process that automatically happens with automatic citizenship at least there has to be a path to citizenship. Let them get the citizenship like everybody else does. You know, apply for it and wait and go to the process.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think the party is dragged by my conservative members say don't bend and telling John Boehner if you even blink, your toast?</p><p>HASTERT: Well, it's either the party is telling a leader or the leader is leading the party, but there has to be a happy medium here and there has to be a come together. You know, one of the things that -- we'd need to get reform done on immigration neither. So I'm just saying, I know what the pitfalls are. There has to be a team approach on this. You have to bring it together and you had to bring the ideas together --</p><p>CAVUTO: But I don't see the team and I'm wondering if behind the scenes either cooler heads are trying to prevail or say, look, guys, if this goes down, politically it doesn't look good because if you're concerned how poorly we did with the Latino vote in the last election, we're going to do worse. So you think that those kind of conversations are going on? Do you think they are legitimate fears that everything hinges on this?</p><p>HASTERT: I think there are legitimate fears in this situation. But there are a lot of people and I think that aren't convinced yet, but they have to be convinced. It is a common-sense approach to this and if we just let all of these, you know, hard feelings get melted out a little bit and take the common sense. I hope we get it done.</p><p>CAVUTO: Dennis Hastert, thank you. Good to see you again.</p><p>HASTERT: My pleasure.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile a federal judge ruining your party? Well, you know, there's an app for that. If only Apple could find a way out this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Apple not so happy birthday, not to expect an expansion and not a crystal clear forecast, so many blitzes, so many buts. Time to start getting this straight and here to do their blitzing, Jared Levy and Todd Wilemon.</p><p>First stop, Jared, Apple, who could blame the executives there if they cried at their birthday if they want to because on at store's five-year anniversary, a federal judge crashes the party that Apple colluded with five U.S. publishers to artificially drive up the e-book prices, if so, out of control? What do you say?</p><p>JARED LEVY, ZACKS.COM SENIOR EQUITIES STRATEGIST: You know, it is funny. I was so excited about my five free apps and five free songs today. I pretty much blew over the news and a lot of traders actually did the same. If you look at Apple's stock, it didn't really move down that much. And what that tells me is the market sort of spoken here.</p><p>Remember, this happened last year over in Europe. The European Commission, you know, ruled on the antitrust issues and Apple settled without admitting any wrongdoing. I think we need to look now is what is the next big thing? I think that's what traders are looking for.</p><p>In September when we see the new iPhone, is it really going to wow us? You know, if it doesn't, I think the stocks moved way lower, but for now, I think this is something press aside and look forward to the future of Apple, which I am still unsure about.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you know, you could make the argument that the stock has been punished enough and maybe that's it is not punishment enough what do you think about that?</p><p>TODD WILEMON, NYSE EURONEXT MANAGING DIRECTOR: I would agree with that. The stock is already down. It's already down big time from its high of over $700. Realize, you know, historically when big companies have tangled with the government on anti-trust or anti-competitive issues, going forward after the company gets finished -- after the government gets finished with that company, the company doesn't do that well.</p><p>Two cases of point AT&amp;T during the '70s and `80s and then you have Microsoft. There is a real worry that this is going to take the focus on Apple away from what they do best and that's competing and coming out with great products that people like to buy. So going forward, I would be worried about Apple. They lost Steve Jobs. Now they've lost this antitrust. Let's hope that iPhone is good.</p><p>CAVUTO: And let's hope my memory is even better. Todd, I apologize. In the meantime, issue two, Yelp on the roll or should I say roll out because this web site known mainly for compiling local business reviews is teaming up with smaller companies to offer a food delivery service and soon even a medical appointment service.</p><p>So, Jared, I think that means you can review a local company online while you're ordering a sandwich online and if you get food poisoning while eating the sandwich, click an appointment with your doctor to have him check you out. Is that far out?</p><p>LEVY: All in one. No, it's (inaudible) -- right. I mean, you know, Yelp has done it right. Out of all the social media companies out there that came public, I think Yelp has the most promise. What you got to remember first of all is Yelp is still losing money, right. And to do this right on national scale, they are only doing it in New York and San Francisco.</p><p>It will take a lot of mechanics. They are partnering up with a couple of different companies like you said. I think Yelp has a little bit of legwork here. I think the stocks a little bit over bought, probably going to come down. I think it is a real smart idea. I like the reservations type thing because listen, people believe Yelp.</p><p>In fact, a buddy of mine, a company he hears that Yelpers, you know, they complain about specific employees. Companies are firing them left and right because they've got faith in Yelp. As horrible as that sounds, it is good for the company. And I think long term Yelp is good, but I look for a full back in the stock here in the near term.</p><p>CAVUTO: Jared, that's another reason to admire you. You have a friend who runs a valet company. Todd, what do you make of that?</p><p>WILEMON: We need his number. I think Jared hits it right on the nail. But it is great about Yelp because the internet is the great disrupter. Yelp has a lot of people that go on there and critique things, which they love to do because people love to point out where people are failing. And they are trying to monetize the eyeballs. If it is successful, all those critiques are going to be perfect for Yelp.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, issue three, gentlemen. Big Ben, big confusion, investors buying initially as they hear that Ben Bernanke may not pull the plug on stimulus anytime soon and will pull back so if the tapering is still on, Jared, any clues here?</p><p>LEVY: You know, all right, so the minutes showed us that about half of the members were fully on board with bringing tapering back in September late year and we saw the market has sort move lower then Bernanke spoke in Cambridge after the markets it is probably better than Ambien for putting you to sleep, but he did let us know a couple of things.</p><p>What he portrayed to us was a little bit more of a dubbish stance. In other words, you know, the fed will not tighten as aggressively as possible and on that futures are higher. So here's what I think. I think for now this trajectory remains the same. I think markets are excited.</p><p>But we are looking forward to a post QE world and we're looking positively forward and I think Bernanke lead us to believe we can be positive and for now we continue to drink the Kool-Aid and the markets, well, they are going to move a little bit higher until the next piece of news comes out.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, whatever they do before hand. I don't think once the act happens, you know, Todd and they actually do start tapering or cutting down from the 85 or so billion a month that they've been, you know, throwing cash at these markets. It will not be a big deal ahead of the fact? What do you think?</p><p>WILEMON: I totally agree. It is the news not the rumor because right now markets moving on the rumor. When the news comes out, it's not going to be that big of a deal. I'm reading through the notes, all that kept going through my mind was Ricky Ricardo going Lucy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, thank you both very much. Guys, thanks again. In the meantime, a country even fatter than we Americanos. Wait until you hear who just knocks us off the world's most obese list.</p><p>CAVUTO: Here is the bad news. We're still fat in this country. Here's the good news. We're no longer the fastest country. Mexico went ahead of us. Enchiladas are fattening? I digress. Maybe now the food police can cease and desist here and move south. Michelle Fields hope so. Imogen Lloyd Webber sure hopes not. Imogen, what do you make of this.</p><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Obesity. The only reason I'm here is to say the word obesity. Michelle is here to say this. Obesity is a public health care catastrophe. It threatens to shorten U.S. life expectancy for the first time since -- not only that it cost America output of $147 billion in related health care cost. Obesity is actually long way compared to your health care problems here.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, what do you think of that, Michelle?</p><p>MICHELLE FIELDS, NEXTGENERATION TV CORRESPONDENT: Look, I think that the government should stop trying to tell people what they can and cannot eat because it is obviously not working. If they want to do anything, why not stop a lot of the subsidies that we provide for additives -- makes junk food cheaper. I don't think that this is a collective problem. This is a individual problem what happens to personal responsibility?</p><p>The only reason we look at this as a collective problem is because we have big government in health care. So whether you have high cholesterol or high blood pressure that ends up being everyone's because everyone have to pay for your medical bills, and whether you go to the doctor or not. At the end of the day government should not be in health care, but we should mind their own businesses.</p><p>CAVUTO: We have a good shot at dropping at number three because New Zealand looks like it's pretty hefty on the chabua front --</p><p>WEBBER: We are at number seven.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you guys to do that we're not doing?</p><p>WEBBER: There is seriously, obviously a link between poverty and obesity and the scary thing is a lot of obese people are actually malnourished. So it does come down to I'm afraid that there's need to be some government help, some comprehensive help. From labelling, Oklahoma State University proved early on this in a study that labelling helps to educate people who need educating in all of this --</p><p>CAVUTO: In this city they publish menus with the calorie count you don't know the double whopper has a lot of calories?</p><p>WEBBER: It is about accessible and affordable food so again looking at farming methods and so forth. There is a point. We need a public way to tackle its. This is a public health care catastrophe. Therefore, you need a public way of looking at it to tackle it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it's an obesity catastrophe.</p><p>WEBBER: It's an obesity catastrophe.</p><p>CAVUTO: We have to get dragged ourselves away from that? Maybe we should give birth wouldn't it be great if that little tight grew up to be a fat so?</p><p>WEBBER: No Henry the Eight. Not yet.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Michelle, when you look at these parents are not policing their kids right. We are eating all the wrong stuff. We have to do something because it is out of control?</p><p>FIELDS: Well, I think it has a lot to do with the economy. Look, it's cheaper to go to McDonalds and buy your whole family food than to go and buy tons of fruits and vegetables. I think improving the economy will make it so that people can go out and afford to buy good food.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, but we've been getting it good and bad the economy alike.</p><p>FIELDS: Certainly and I think that a lot of times it is education. Like she said we need to educate people, but I don't think having these programs for our children where you limit the amount of calories they can have for school lunch is not appropriate. It's not working.</p><p>CAVUTO: Did you hear the school system where they were forcing the kids' (inaudible) --</p><p>WEBBER: The scary thing is the World Health Organization -- is now saying that obesity eating too much is a bigger than starvation. This is an issue. We all need to be together tackling this.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you take no solace in Mexico moving to the top.</p><p>WEBBER: Certainly not, no.</p><p>CAVUTO: Duly noted. Good luck with the baby. Hope it is not fat kid. Say it one more time.</p><p>WEBBER: Obesity.</p><p>CAVUTO: Remember when Republicans said that the president couldn't delay the employer mandate because it's law, well, count me confused because now Republicans want to delay the individual mandate because they say unfair.</p><p>CAVUTO: What you do for my boss you better do for me. I think that pretty much sums up what Republicans are saying about the administration delaying employers having to provide health care for their workers. Their workers are entitled to the same delay providing it for themselves. Gretchen, what is at stake here?</p><p>GRETCHEN HAMEL, PUBLIC NOTICE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: Individuals having to undergo and have a big burden of Obamacare be resting on them this next year. Here we are. We have small businesses and businesses being delayed on the employer mandate, but individuals are still going to have to be signing up for these plans next year because this whole plan hinges upon young people to shoulder the burden of the older generations to be paying more in premiums for the next year to fund Obamacare in the future.</p><p>CAVUTO: What I don't understand is some inconsistency among Republicans because yesterday they were talking, no, Mr. President, you cannot change that because it's the law. A law that they were against, but today they are saying if you do for the boss you have to do it for dominion which I can understand, but it's either all in or all-out. I just don't understand that Republican position.</p><p>CHRISTIAN DORSEY, ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Yes, I mean, this is about, you know, the Republicans have tried 38 times to repeal Obamacare in the House. It is just another attempt at trying to do what they've been unsuccessful in doing for four years. Everyone knows that the individual mandate is a key to making this work affordably and efficiently.</p><p>CAVUTO: Then why doesn't the White House ease the angst its getting now by just pushing it back for everybody?</p><p>DORSEY: Well, the White House has handled this whole thing poorly. I will freely admit that, but you know, the individual mandate has been in play in Massachusetts for over five years and it is proven to reduce cost in the individual insurance market to make the whole thing work. So that's why you don't want to delay it because if you delay that particular piece, Neil, then the whole thing just ought to be delayed and there's no reason to do that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, here's what I worry about. Right now, it's falling apart because all the financial, all the ways that it makes money are drying up, fewer young people signing up, low wage workers, they aren't able to afford signing up. Even the uninsured to be interested to sign up and now the companies that were going to be the butlers for this delayed in having the fork out. So they're running out of financing options, what do they do?</p><p>LENORE HAWKINS, MERITAS ADVISORS PRINCIPAL: Absolutely and this also showing that there is no respect for the rule of law. Here's we've got where the government is attempting to take over about 15 percent of the economy. With four years' notice, they still can't get it together to distract information. Now they say Congress is going to pass a series of laws, just what the administration wanted, but now chivvying treasury discretion? Where does that and? When does Congress ever pass something and then give another part of the government. Discretion is to whether or not they are going to actually implement.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, some of our biggest laws in entitlements whether you're for against it or not there is a history to how bumpy they start out. Medicare is a good example in terms of little things, but be that as it may with from some of FDR's new deal program -- JFK came up with domestic initiatives, rocky starts, many returns to the well to fix things so how is this any different? Gretchen, what do you say?</p><p>HAMEL: Well, it's not really any different. You could make the argument that the things have not been fixed with Medicare, which has $50 billion worth of fraud every year. You look at the IRS and what the IRS has been doing and receiving bonuses, misusing taxpayer funds. You can look across the government and see the incompetence that the government has -- has executed over the course of the past few years and now they are going to be dealing with our health care.</p><p>Our personal choices with our health care, our premiums have gone up. Our plans are changing and there's going to be doctor shortages. Of course, there are bumps along the way, it does not show no matter how much glitz or glamour it will cover up that will have flawed executions.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it is unpopular law right now and one of 10 Americans like it. They may live up to those expectations, but it is a tough sell because doctors don't like it, specialists don't like it. I am wondering if Nancy Pelosi did indeed read it and know what was in it and just didn't want to say it?</p><p>DORSEY: You know, Neil, we have to stop pretending that the affordable care act is some novel construct -- wait a minute. The major tenants of how this will work nationally have been in place in Massachusetts for over five years. We know how it will work if anybody cares to actually read the bill and study what has happened. We have to stop pretending.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is not happening. Something went wrong.</p><p>DORSEY: Because there's been a full frontal assault against it from the day the ink dried on the legislation. That we can all agree on --</p><p>CAVUTO: Doctors are seeing costs go up as a result of it. Health care premiums are rising because of it. That is not imaginary stuff, the responsibility of Republicans blasting it. That is the reality.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DORSEY: Are you telling me with health care premiums?</p><p>CAVUTO: I have no idea. That was not supposed to happen, but it is happening.</p><p>DORSEY: But to promise at premiums to will go up and we have seen all three. Those promises were made and they have been broken.</p><p>HAWKINS: It cannot be saved. All it did very simply was increase the demand for medical services while at the same time suppressing the supply because it is not in their best interests. Make it more difficult to apply medical services while increasing demanding at the same time. It teaches prices are going to go up.</p><p>CAVUTO: We'll see. It's still early. We will give it time is a bumpy road. But folks, good to have you. Thank you very, very much. We will follow all of these as some changes they are proposing to pay at a possible tax hike to cover the gap.

You've got to be for something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: Welcome everybody. I'm Charles Payne in for <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And all week we have been hearing the president talk about the economy. But instead of saying he wants to work with Republicans, he has been blaming and attacking Republicans saying they are the ones holding a middle-class down. To Melissa Frances, Carl Paladino and Chris Stirewalt on if the president is looking for the economy to pick up or is he just looking to pick a fight. Melissa.</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, \"MONEY WITH MELISSA FRANCIS\" HOST: You know, he says you cannot be against something, you've got to be for something. How about being for the Keystone XL pipeline. I mean he talks about the economy and politicians fighting on each other -- fighting with each other. Why don't we get behind some projects that could actually create jobs? Keystone could create 20,000 jobs out of the gate construction jobs. That is conservative. Some people think it is 40,000.</p><p>PAYNE: Unions have a bigger number than that, I think.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely. Half a million barrels of oil a day would wipe out our need to bring in Venezuela and South American oil. This is something that could create jobs and lower prices for American. Get behind that.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Carl, it always feels to me when the president speaks is that if you are not for my ideas, you don't have any ideas. It is just weird.</p><p>CARL PALADINO, (R ), NY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Yeah, but his ideas are contradicting each other. On the one hand he gives us Obamacare, which scares the heck of the small businessmen in the nation who create 80 percent of the jobs. Then he comes back and now he's got a jobs plan, to put public employees to work and to put the trade unions to work. That is not necessarily creating jobs in the middle-class, right? That is not. In fact, building the private sector in America. And that's what we are all about. We're about the private sector. Why aren't we building that ...</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Chris, the idea of building, I think, also applies to politics. Down in D.C., where is the idea of building consensus, building something where both parties can agree? It just feels like the president is consistently on the attack, on the attack, on the attack.</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, let's put a little finer point on what you guys are talking about. The president does not really say that his opponents have no ideas. He says that his opponents are cynical, politically motivated, and dispatriotic. They want to do things, he says, that are actively harmful to Americans as part of an effort to defeat the president politically. So why don't we have consensus? Why don't we have agreement? When you start a discussion impugning the worst, most heinous motives on your opponent, how likely is it that you're going to have any substantive discussion? You are not a patriot, but let's talk about the budget. That doesn't happen.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, Carl, you ran for office as a Republican. How does that make you feel? If someone says, listen, this is not about your ideas. You inherently as a Republican, you don't like this country. You hate poor people. You hate the middle-class. You only like the one percent of people at the top, and that's all you're ...</p><p>PALADINO: No, that's not me. But I am.</p><p>PAYNE: But the party, though. He is saying that is the entire party.</p><p>PALADINO: Well, that is a very poor definition of the real Republicans. Yes, some rhinos took us off in that world of one percent. And ...</p><p>PAYNE: (inaudible)</p><p>PALADINO: They took us down that road. OK. And the majority of Republicans did not want to play that kind of ball, OK? Because when you are in the private sector, when you had a day job in your life and your learn the responsibility of not trying to find an excuse and to lay the blame on somebody else, OK, when you learn that you are responsible and that you bring all of your -- all of you're the elements of your personality and your ability to bear in order to get by in the private sector, then you can enter public leadership.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, and Melissa, that is the word, responsible. That we are in a -- people talk about redistribution of wealth. I always think that the president's policies are redistribution of responsibility.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>PAYNE: And I also feel that this speech this week was sort of an attack on capitalism itself, because you cannot control outcomes. In other words, if you and I had a race down the hall you would probably beat me. And there was nothing ...</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know about that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know about that.</p><p>PAYNE: Chris has his money on you, that's what I could tell you.</p><p>FRANCIS: I've got to tell you, what I think is so frustrating about that speech that we heard, is that it was about politics and not about economics.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: It was supposed to be about the economy. They were going to have bright new ideas and how we are going to add more jobs. If you want to add more manufacturing jobs in this country, get out of the way of shale and fracking. That is a way to make energy cheaper and put those jobs on American on parity, make the labor equation makes sense because the energy, the fuel manufacturing is cheaper. We could bring some of those jobs back. You know, I talked to CEOs all the time who do not have trained Americans here in the U.S. to feel the jobs that they have open. They would like to partner with local schools and colleges, increase the training they need. Why don't we promote that? Why don't we get them tax incentives to do that or get out of the way. There is a thousand ideas out there to create jobs. Why are we talking about politics?</p><p>PAYNE: Maybe that is just it, Chris. It feels like, you know, what I heard this week was sort of a greatest hits, if you will, snippets from all the speeches we have heard before.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>PAYNE: In fact, the president probably could have done this one without the teleprompters. And so, again, again ...</p><p>FRANCIS: OH, mass show.</p><p>PAYNE: Oh mass show, right.</p><p>STIREWALT: The remix.</p><p>PAYNE: So, get back to the idea of was this really an economic speech, was it a political speech looking to the midterm elections? What do you think his real goal was?</p><p>STIREWALT: It was neither of those things. What it really was, there is -- in Washington we talk about the outside in game. And it's been played very successfully by presidents in the past. Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and at times George W. Bush, especially everything about him on education. Because when you go to the public, you say \"I have an idea.\" Congress is blocking me from this idea. I want to do tax reform, or I want to do this. Or I want to do whatever. I need your help, come with me and help me on stock this out of Congress. The president claims that that's what he was doing. And Jay Carney and others said he's going to go talk to the American people to rally them to change Washington. But what he was really doing was playing the inside out game. He went to other places at America to turn around, pick up a bullhorn and say, reporters, shame on you. Don't cover phony scandals. Republicans, shame on you. You people hate America and poor people. And you're just obsessed with me. So he went to other places to talk to Washington. It was not about economics, it wasn't about manufacturing. It was about what he thinks Washington ought to be focused on.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And real, quick, Carl.</p><p>PALADINO: Bill Clinton had followed through ...</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>PALADINO: Bill Clinton followed through on those promises and those statements that he came out with. He always there.</p><p>PAYNE: You refer -- you just made reference to the rhinos. It seems to me also the president feels like he can drive a wedge in the Republican Party. He senses this friction between the Tea Party, the rhinos, the old school guys. I haven't noticed more and more he's thrown that out there. Is it possible that he can get do that?</p><p>PALADINO: You will get away with saying it.</p><p>PAYNE: I mean, but as some Republican to have an epiphany and join him -- join him in his ram skins.</p><p>PALADINO: The Republicans had a nervous breakdown last year, OK? They are in disarray.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PALADINO: They have to get a new identity. They have to start to learn who they are from the future. They have to engage other constituencies.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>PALADINO: There is no question about that. And Obama will take advantage of that because that is the way they think. Everything is political. How about doing the right thing for the American people? How about -how about expanding on our shale and our oil. How about creating more jobs by putting up some tariffs against the Chinese.</p><p>PAYNE: Oh, guys, I can tell you right now. I for one -- I just look forward to the speech where we'll talk about how great we are, how far we have come and how far we're going to go. That's what I'm looking for. Thanks a lot. You guys are all fantastic. And coming up, tax reform sounding a lot like tax hikes. The latest Democrat push that's going to push taxes way up. But first, snooping from this guy and sniffing through your e-mail. The government spying spiraling out of control.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, call it what you want, but the president is not calling it anything. The administration ruling it does not have to determine whether that mess in Egypt is a government takeover or not. So, that -- we will just keep sending that country over a billion dollars in aid. The former congressman Ron Paul who says, we need to cut the funding. Congressman, how -- I mean -- I think we have to label it something, and it seems pretty obvious that there was an overthrow of a democratically elected government, whether we like that government or not.</p><p>FMR. REP. RON PAUL (R ) TEXAS: Yes, I think you're right about that. That is pretty obvious. But you know, if we had a proper size government, if we had a government living within the law and following the Constitution this argument would be irrelevant. Because I think it would be much easier to say that nobody should have any foreign aid and we should not condition it. So, here we are saying well, we will send the money which we have been doing for what -- 30 some years and billions and billions of dollars that went down a rathole. So, I would say that this discussion about was it a coup or wasn't it coup, we're missing the point. We should quit funding these nations and trying to pick the good guys versus the bad guys because it always seems to end up badly and we are always switching sides. We put the bar (ph) again and then we throw the out and then we get another election and then we helped throw him out.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. Right.</p><p>PAUL: And then we argue about the coup. I would say this argument for the defense of this country and quit giving our money away.</p><p>PAYNE: And I get also say, congressman, it's -- it also feels like there is no gratitude. You know, the more money America gives the country, it seems like the more animosity they have towards us anyway.</p><p>PAUL: Yeah. You can't -- you can't buy friendship. And besides, we don't have money. We have to just borrow the money from somebody or print the money. And it contributes, you know. But it is a bit arrogant for the president to do what he is doing. You know, even if we don't have the system I would like. It make it much more -- much cleaner. There are some rules that he is supposed to follow them. And under the rules, he is supposed to cut off that aid. But the solution is not going to be well, if they do exactly as we want we're going to give you money. So often our foreign policy has been that way.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>PAUL: You'd be our dictator, we give you money, if you don't behave than we bomb you. And I would like to see some day that we have a different foreign policy.</p><p>PAYNE: Yeah, well, you know, you have a large following that agree. You know, you just touched on something that with the president. And a sort of sense of arrogance with respect to rules that have been in place for a while. You know, this week we know that Holder says he's going to go after taxes and they're voting system despite the Supreme Court ruling. We are seeing a tremendous amount of arrogance at hearings on scandals whether it is NSA, IRS that come up there, they sort of yawn. What is going on? Is this -- is this something that always happens? Or is this something that's really unique for this particular administration?</p><p>PAUL: Well, it has been happening for a long time. It's just much worse, and you could add to your list, these ideas that the president announced today that he would not go to the Congress. That Congress works too slowly and he's going to do the funding of all the projects necessary. So, now it is lawlessness. First these programs are -- many of them are unconstitutional. But at least they are supposed to pay a little attention to the Congress. But you know, these executive orders are out of control. And I would say, no, it is not unique for this president. But believe me. It is worse than ever before ...</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>PAUL: ... and continues to get worse. But it is up to the people and it's up to the Congress to rein this in. They could if they wanted to, but unfortunately, there's not enough backbone up there to really rein in the presidential powers that he's assumed.</p><p>PAYNE: But why -- I mean, so why would Republicans allow this to happen. And the only theory I can believe is that, they figure OK, you know what -- make this office the all money omnipotent. Sooner or later Republican will have that kind of power. I mean why else would they lay down for this?</p><p>PAUL: Well, it is inbred in our system. There is complacency. And for the long time, it kept growing and people did not complain too much because there was enough money to go around for everybody. Liberals got what they wanted, conservatives got their money to pass out, you know, around the world.</p><p>PAYNE: Yeah.</p><p>PAUL: But now everybody's realizing, you know, we are on the verge of a bankruptcy. Technically, we're bankrupt, but people still trust us. They take our money and we can keep bringing them money. But they know it's coming to an end.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>PAUL: And this is why, I think people are becoming more partisan. But it is a mess. It's the -- it's the acknowledge man and the allowing of our presidents to a use of these powers and act on their own.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>PAUL: That has been so dangerous, but it's been around for a long time.</p><p>PAYNE: It's amazing. It's absolutely amazing. And to your point, somebody better draw a line in the sand real soon. We're glad you're still around to talk about it. And we appreciate your time tonight. Thank you.</p><p>PAUL: Thanks for having me.</p><p>PAYNE: All right.</p><p>Well, D.C. might be afraid to stir up trouble over there, but it is not afraid to snoop on people here. New reports of NSA demanding big tech companies like Google and Microsoft handover your passwords. On the same day we are learning that the FBI also has been using drones on U.S. soil.</p><p>Former White House cyber czar Howard Schmidt says, there is a fine line between snooping and security. What is that fine line?</p><p>HOWARD SCHMIDT, FMR. WHITE HOUSE CYBERSECURITY CZAR: Well, I think that is one of the things in the post's September 11th world that we've got to figure out. The problem is right now we hear all the time that what we're doing is legal, it's authorized under law. But just because it is authorized, number one, the public does not really understand what's going on. But just as importantly it does not mean we shouldn't necessarily do it. And that is the thing we need to start looking at. Just don't grab everything and try to pick out pieces. Let's figure out what we need in the new world of digital economy we live in, and then say how do we protect privacy, civil liberties, while still protecting the nation.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Howard, you know, you talked about the public not being necessarily educated on this. But it seems like Congress, Washington, has no clue what is going on. I mean every time someone testifies it seems like it is a new revelation for them as well. Are these programs, have they become so powerful that just one person can operate them without any accountability to anybody else?</p><p>SCHMIDT: Yeah, and I don't know if they are that compressed, that it's only one person, but there has been a very select member of Congress that have heard about these programs for years and know exactly how they work. And what happens now, is we see the rest in the Congress are elected officials becoming more cognizant of how it's being done, where it's being done and what powers and authorities are being used. Wait a minute now. That is not what we voted for. But to make it even more complicated we talk about this country. You think about all the other nations in the world that really don't have the same privacy controls and protections that we have, as concerned we are about them. And see what goes on with the rest of the world because these emails, the passwords, and everything you talked about, they are universal, they are all around the world, not just here in the United States.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, I've got to tell you, Howard. I have equated this is sort of like a digital form of stop and frisk. And everybody in America is a suspect. I mean this is how we are being treated as citizens. We're all suspected of a crime and we're actively being investigated against.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Well, that's correct. And that's one of the things the Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic -- Electronic Privacy Information Center, they are saying the same thing. Wait a minute now. In the digital world we should still look at things like the Fourth Amendment, we should look at the First Amendment, for freedom of speech. Not automatically figure somebody that's pulled him aside; that sits through everything and see if we can find something wrong with it.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, now, this is the big question. Is it too big, is it too powerful, can it stop? In other words, have we crossed a Rubicon and kiss our freedoms good-bye in a realistic sense?</p><p>SCHMIDT: Well, I don't think we have. I know from a public perspective we have not done it. We have not agreed to do it. And that's where, I think it's important that we're having this discussion, not only in Congress, but on shows like yours to say wait a minute now. What exactly is being done, how is it being done and who is it being done to. But there is another nexus here that I think we oftentimes forget. And that's when you look at the economic peace of this. Much of the digital technology evolves around the United States. I was in Europe a couple of weeks ago when a lot of this announcements came out. And the Europeans are saying wait a minute now. Why do business with a U.S. company, if we're going to have to worry about our data or our privacy. We're going to start shifting our business to Europe and other markets there, which then affects us not only from a privacy perspective, but also from a business and economic perspective.</p><p>PAYNE: Yeah. Well, you know what, I've got to tell you, there's economic, there's morality, there's a whole lot of things there, and, of course ...</p><p>SCHMIDT: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's not forget the Constitution. You brought that up as well. Howard. Thanks a lot. We really appreciate it.</p><p>SCHMIDT: My pleasure, good talking with you.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, guys, I've been getting a lot of amazing reactions to my special last night. Now, lots of your people seem excited to invest. But today we are getting a word fewer of them are actually investing in our education. Find out why more are getting out of college and they could be out of luck.</p><p>PAYNE: This is what happens when you keep sticking it to students. Students stick it back to you. By not sticking around a new report showing college enrollment fell two percent in the last year. High tuition, a major factor. Dee Dee Benkie says tuition will keep rising as long as the government keeps writing cheap loans to students. She's joined by Rick Ungar and Lizzie MacDonald. This is going to be a good one. All right. What's the deal? This is all about just cheap money.</p><p>DEE DEE BENKIE, FMR. BUSH 40 WHITE HOUSE AIDE: Yeah, well, you know, first of -- I want to give kudos to Mitch Daniels, who is the president of Purdue University, and he is some former governor of my home state. You know what he did, he froze tuition for two years. I think everyone should follow through. Because again, we don't really -- we want to give reasonable loans. We don't want to get cheap, we don't want to get too much. But they should be reasonable for students. But also, the universities need to cheap them and they need to tighten their belts. And that's what Mitch Daniels has done.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Rick. That is a good point. These universities, (inaudible), billion dollar endowments, and these gigantic campuses. And professor's taking a year or two off to read a book. I mean what the heck is this all about?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: In the meantime they (inaudible) more and more money. Well, they say, to right ...</p><p>RICK UNGAR, PROGRESSIVE COLUMNIST: I like that. I like that.</p><p>PAYNE: But, you know, they really ...</p><p>UNGAR: That was good. That was pretty good. I like this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNGAR: But, you know, believe it or not, I think if you look at the actual statistics, there is more supply and demand here at work then government. You had a real glut of three-20- year old people coming in up to 2009. They, of course, were applying to go to college, that means more demand, prices go up.</p><p>PAYNE: True.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENTT: Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.</p><p>UNGAR: Hold on. Let me finish the statistic. After 2009 we started to see a decline. These are facts. So ...so ...</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD: All right.</p><p>UNGAR: ... there may be more to this in terms of the ...</p><p>MACDONALD: Can I give you some facts? Can I just ...</p><p>BENKIE: Thanks you, Liz.</p><p>PAYNE: Just go the fact ...</p><p>MACDONALD: And here's the problem.</p><p>UNGAR: Was that not true?</p><p>MACDONALD: No, here's the real -- there is the real important fact. That the administrative are outnumbering faculty by about, I think ...</p><p>BENKIE: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: 20 to one.</p><p>PAYNE: We're talking about blows. We should talk about these blows.</p><p>MACDONALD: And the reason why tuition costs are going up for colleges across the country, and gouging the middle class family, it's because these (inaudible) academics think their hotel moguls, their real-estate moguls, academics like -- they are acting like Donald Trump mini-me's and running this hotel style of business. That is the business model for college campuses now. They have got seven figure salaries for some of these guys running this school. And you know what I say? These colleges are nonprofits, Charles. They are not supposed to be acting in their own private (inaudible).</p><p>Padding their own wallets as non-profits. So that means you curtail their salary. They should be backing the exploding student loan debt. The colleges themselves should be guaranteeing it ...</p><p>BENKIE: I agree with it.</p><p>MACDONALD: ... and then you would bring that number down.</p><p>UNGAR: I'm good with that. But you didn't blame government. I'm happy.</p><p>MACDONALD: I am blaming government, too, for aiding and abandoning it.</p><p>PAYNE: But what about ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: As they are non-profit.</p><p>PAYNE: Rick, I mean, we're talking tuition outpacing inflation by like 600 percent.</p><p>UNGAR: Yeah.</p><p>PAYNE: Something outrageous.</p><p>UNGAR: But now, it's going to come down.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, famous last words. I mean Dee Dee? How is that going to come down, if they keep -- the federal government's taking over the student loan business. They pushed everyone out. And then they just churning out their loans. It's churn them out, churn them out. I look at the Fed numbers every month. And they are just churning them out.</p><p>BENKIE: Well, we know the federal government, they mess up everything. Everything in business just needs to be taken over by someone that cannot handle this.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENKIE: If that -- well, certainly, not the federal government and the problem is, if they are not reasonable now. I mean something reasonable and fair to students, but here's the problem: you have Solyndra, you have all this waste to these people who didn't deserve the money. And now there is no money left. We have too much debt ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: Because I have got Solyndra and do it this ...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BENKIE: And I had to.</p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, you sure.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Do you know why has it \"Cash for Flankers?\" That is what Solyndra was, \"Cash for Flankers.\"</p><p>BENKIE: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's how we're working in into this. I mean -- but here's the problem, too. Student loan debt has tripled, right? Over the last decade and a half. And that is a real serious problem. It is now ranks just below. And for the first time in the history of this country, Charles, students loans -- excuse me- students are entering colleges in a really rotten job market. And they are exiting colleges in a really rotten job market. On that, you want just a high-school -- high school degree -- a high school education and engineering before ...</p><p>BENKIE: The tuition is too high. Way too high.</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, how many -- I mean there are so many students who take these gigantic loans and don't even get a degree. You want to talk about getting out with, you know, a degree in paper folding, what about no degree at all? And you are still -- you're still saddled with debt. But here is the thing though, Rick. There is also this implication that the president laid it out pretty thick last election that -- take the loan, it's going to be wink-wink. We'll take care of it in the future. You won't even have to pay it back. I mean ...</p><p>UNGAR: We might have watched different elections. I didn't quite pick that up from anything the president said. Look, here is the reality of your student loans -- you are absolutely right about the amount of debt that is piling on these kids. It is pretty grim. But ...</p><p>PAYNE: But that, that can also hit the American taxpayer.</p><p>UNGAR: Understood, fair enough. But let me add this: if you have to come up with another way because if you take that away, let's be honest, we are going to end up with only wealthy people going to college.</p><p>BENKIE: Yeah, that's a problem.</p><p>UNGAR: How good can that be for the country?</p><p>BENKIE: They don't have a problem going to school. And then the important students are probably going to make it. It's the middle-class that are hurt, yet again. And Liz is exactly right. It's the administrative cost. And these people really are looking like fat cats.</p><p>PAYNE: I don't disagree.</p><p>BENKIE: You can go to school? But guess what?</p><p>UNGAR: And the building.</p><p>BENKIE: I'm going to the Acme bartending school or shop, because you can't afford to go to school.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: So ultimately I think we are all in some sort of agreement. College is out of control, because they have no accountability there and a favored (ph) class. No one ever says anything bad about them. And the federal government is enabling them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: And by the way, you're absolutely right. The White House did talk about, hey, there is a chance you could forgive student debt. That was floated a couple of years ago, but there was a backlash.</p><p>PAYNE: That was floated this week in the president's speech.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's right, and Charles, listen, there is a backlash against colleges. You saw in Rhode Island, for example, they are starting to charge for fire department and cop service to university campuses. If the colleges don't get a clue and fix their financial models and stop gouging the American people, then they are going to see it at the local level.</p><p>PAYNE: And we have to leave it there, Rick. I see you are eager to get in, but.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: Talking about your favorite topic. Taxes just went up again, Rick. But that's not stopping the government from trying to take an even bigger chunk from millions of paychecks.</p><p>PAYNE: California just hiked taxes and now it is looking to tap taxpayers for even more money. Lawmakers want to force private companies to take 3 percent of workers' pay then the state would hold on to that money and they will invest it for you until you retire.</p><p>California small business owner Craig Huey says this would be a disaster and it is waiting to happen. Craig, it is great to have you on the show, but this is California. Of course, it is going to be a disaster, but you guys like this kind of stuff.</p><p>CRAIG HUEY, CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS OWNER: Charles, I don't understand it is like a time bomb ready to explode and the politicians in Sacramento and Governor Brown, they are at it again. All your viewers nationwide, they need to be as worried as we are about what is about ready to happen.</p><p>I mean, what we have now is a kind of a competitor to Social Security run by California, by bureaucrats, these are the politicians, Charles, who cannot keep debt out of the way. They are constantly going to debt and they are constantly raiding one fund after another to try to balance things. It is insanity. It's fantasy economics.</p><p>PAYNE: So Craig, what do you say though to people who say, well, you know what? Workers, particularly workers on the lower end of the economic run, they don't save enough money and they need help. Since they've been unable to help themselves, it sort of the responsibility of government to step in and do this kind of thing?</p><p>HUEY: Well, you know what? Allowing an employee to have the option of being able to invest in aggressive stocks, conservative stocks, whatever they want, that's the path we should go. What this does it forces the employee to be able to pay money that's going to give them 1 percent or 2 percent from a ridiculously low amount.</p><p>You know, they are not going to be able to keep up with inflation. Instead of trying to grow the economy, you know we have businesses leaving California. We got millions of people fleeing California. We have a situation where instead of creating an opportunity state. We're pretty in a state where people are leaving.</p><p>So doing this is like -- I don't quite understand except this, Charles, you know, California is $127 billion in debt according to the legislative analyst, $3 million per individual in debt. The politicians are panicking.</p><p>CalPERS, which is the state retirement fund is $60 billion in debt. They will be able to manage the billions of dollars forced out of these employees. It's a sense why the unions are behind it to rescue the debt.</p><p>PAYNE: So I mean, really, so what you're saying and what you're charging here, correct, is that, this is actually a scheme to, and I think you used the word earlier, sort of fill for this money? I mean, they take it under the guise of we'll invest for you, but they are going to take it in the start to apply -- sort of a Ponzi scheme?</p><p>HUEY: You got it, Charles. The fact is on the surface it is like the expansion of the nanny state, big brother, but it is much more than that. The winners in this are the politicians, the bureaucrats and CalPERS. The losers are employees and employers and individual freedom.</p><p>PAYNE: You know what, Craig, again this more than likely, I know it is sort of preliminary and a trial balloon, but more likely this will be the latest in greatest from California.</p><p>HUEY: It will be and it's going to be the models for liberals and progressives nationwide to say look we have this program that will force the employees in who aren't covered by companies that have 401(K)s and what is going to happen, Charles, is this. What's going to happen is that there will be competitors to Social Security in all progressive states.</p><p>PAYNE: My Ponzi scheme is better than your Ponzi scheme. Imagine, any government that will go out and tell them I am going to take money from you. Don't worry you'll get it back with interest as if they can guarantee anything with their track record. You guys are in trouble, but guess what, by extension, we all are. Craig, thanks a lot. Appreciate your time.</p><p>HUEY: Charles, thank you.</p><p>PAYNE: Believe it or not, this could be Yoko Ono singing a happy song because while she sells like she is in pain. The oil companies could be the ones actually feeling the pain.</p><p>PAYNE: \"Wolverine\" could be plowing its way to the top, Amazon slashing profits and Washington is cutting down big oil. Dennis Kneale and Jonathan Hoenig are here to blitz.</p><p>Consumer confidence (inaudible) but Amazon could be warnings about something that's far from amazing because as the online giant says its lost $7 million in the last quarter, says things may not be much better this quarter.</p><p>Jonathan, you have been called the wolverine of economics. Is this a sign of more bad news for the consumer to come?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG ASSET MANAGEMENT: Bad news for the consumers, certainly not for Amazon, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Didn't they lose money, is that good or bad?</p><p>HOENIG: Well, it is good for the stock, Charles, not too far from its all-time high and the reason they are losing money is they are not resting on their laurels. I mean, this is company that's become, of course, the dominant online retailer. They are not done yet. They reinventing themselves and I know Dennis is well versed in this, into essentially a technology company with hardware, with dominance in the Cloud. So yes, Amazon isn't making a lot of money now, doesn't planting the third quarter, but the investments they are making are going to pay off. I think why you are seeing the stock continue to do so well.</p><p>PAYNE: But what about the consumer? Where do you think the consumer risk is? We get mix signals almost every day these earnings come in.</p><p>DENNIS KNEALE, FOX BUSINESS: I think it is really important to look at these big retailers as a pulse point, but I think Wal-Mart is the vastly better predictor of what consumer is and where it's going than Amazon. Amazon is a very select mix and they are very different from the typical retailer simply buying stuff from someone and sell it. They are making their Kindle and selling stuff they use that Amazon kindle to shop on Amazon there is so many directions. I'm not sure that Amazon -- also their sales growth is really strong and that is consumer demand. It's their earnings.</p><p>PAYNE: To your point, this dollar stores, I mean, stocks have been hot. The family dollar had a huge number of week or so ago, is that a red flag?</p><p>KNEALE: Because the thought being that they are hot because people are thinking that the consumer is going to trade down?</p><p>PAYNE: That is not a great sign of confidence.</p><p>KNEALE: It is time to stop worrying and start spending.</p><p>HOENIG: They are, Charles, I mean, Target has been strong. Wal-Mart has been strong. A lot of the (inaudible) retailers have been strong and I tell you consumer confidence tends to follow the stock market. So the market at an all-time, it's not surprising to see this consumer feeling a little bit better moving forward.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, I think we're in a period, guys, where people are just spending money. They are not necessarily borrowing, but whenever they had in that check, they'll spend it. I don't know if it's good or bad with respect to the future.</p><p>Let's shift gears a little bit. To the attack on fracking, bad enough the EPA is looking to regulate fracking. Now the Justice Department is going after companies like Halliburton. Jonathan, will this war on oil ever stop?</p><p>HOENIG: Well, the war on fossil fuels in general, Charles, and it's terrible because whether it's oil or natural gas, which of course, fracking use to produce. I mean, it is a tremendous benefit to the consumers at large. Fracking is safe. It's been practiced for decades in this country and just in the last two years the innovations in fracking have helped bring natural gas prices down 70 percent. That is a huge benefit for the economy and for everyday consumers just trying to go out and make some money, feed their families and live the American dream.</p><p>KNEALE: Yet, why is a Justice Department investigating frackers right now? They are looking into antitrust. Now since when do plunging prices of gas, plunging prices of frack services end up leading to an antitrust investigation?</p><p>Charles, here's what really bothers me about this, in the wake of the IRS targeting scandal going after opponents that President Obama maligned. I don't trust other arms of the Obama administration not to seek opponent base on the political agenda. We know this administration hates fracking and is against it. Now your Justice Department is investigating antitrust in a market where prices fall?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, here's the thing, Jonathan. They better be very careful because fracking, to your point, has been the economic godsend. If they mess around with that the only reason this country is not in a recession right now. If you take away the fracking miracle, we would be in a deep recession.</p><p>HOENIG: Indeed. I mean, Charles, it is fracking and its energy production in general. I mean, there are so much energy resources available to help power this country's economy forward. Unfortunately, it is not the earth that we seemed to battle so often. It's the regulators themselves, they don't want that what to make that process as difficult as possible.</p><p>PAYNE: I tell you what there will be no manufacturing renaissance without cheap fuel. By the way, if you control fossil fuel, you control the world. Finally, guys, this is a fun one. (Inaudible) because Wolverine is expected to hit the snap the summer slump streak. I know he's my man. Dennis, all right, these big budget movies have been dead. What about this?</p><p>KNEALE: Well, you know, we have had some huge successes, but we also have some huge flops in Hollywood feels like \"Wolverine\" to the rescue. It could bring in $80 million this weekend. It cost $120 million to make, but understand we've had four flops in a row, \"Long Ranger, White House Down, Pacific Rim and RIPD,\" those four films combined cost almost $700 million to make and their U.S. gross so far is well under $300 million and the studios keep only half of that 300.</p><p>PAYNE: OK, but you would put your money on Hugh Jackman, right?</p><p>KNEALE: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: This is the only action figure you still see. What do you think, Jonathan?</p><p>HOENIG: Well, I mean, I thought trading stocks was dangerous and risky, Charles. I mean, the movie businesses, to Dennis' point is far more risky $120 million put in this film? I had to say though I think it will do well. \"Wolverine\" like all these Avengers characters has this broad appeal. It's the old folks remember from their childhood and it's a lot of new consumers. So despite the fact there's a lot of competition out there for movie dollars I think \"Wolverine\" soars and has a great opening weekend.</p><p>PAYNE: A lot of people say the blockbuster model is dead.</p><p>KNEALE: We always think the way of doing business is going to be invented.</p><p>PAYNE: But at the end of the day don't they want to make profits in Hollywood?</p><p>KNEALE: There words, \"Iron Man Three\" $1.2 billion and you can't shake a stick of that.</p><p>PAYNE: You guys are fantastic. Really appreciate it. Health care is looking so bad, government workers who are going to work on the law are actually trying to avoid being covered by that same law. We'll figure.</p><p>PAYNE: Family doctors are selling and that's driving prices up. More hospitals are buying private practices and a new study says this could drive up cost by as much as 20 percent.</p><p>Dr. Leigh Vinocur says that is the latest bad news courtesy of the health care law. Doctor, thanks for joining the show. You know, I've been hearing about this and I am shocked at some of the numbers. I mean, this is big time thing a lot of hospitals, a lot of private physicians are just selling out.</p><p>DR. LEIGH VINOCUR, EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN: Yes. Well, it is predicted that two-thirds of the 1 million doctors in 2014 will be salaried and working for some health care system or some hospital because it's frankly getting to the point where doctors cannot afford to be in solo practice that's a thing of the past. The structure from the affordable care act is changing for repayment. So these accountable care organizations are starting up and doctors are having to join them.</p><p>PAYNE: Of course, that means -- the idea that you are going to stick with your doctor will probably change dramatically. The idea that will give lower prices changes dramatically because economics 101, the last competition that there is, the higher prices typically go.</p><p>VINOCUR: Well, theoretically that is true. But health care sort of never kind of fit really neatly in that supply-side economics. You know, it is going to be precarious. I am anxious to see what is going to happen because there is going to be penalties if the quality goes down and with these accountable care organizations, there's going to be one pot. It's going to be like a decapitated payment. So they get one pie for the patient and if they use it up because the costs have gotten higher. Then that is the end of it. So, you know, they could be shooting themselves in the foot by doing this, but we will see how it works out.</p><p>PAYNE: It is interesting because that is the risk they're apparently willing to take because the alternative they know already would be a lot worse.</p><p>VINOCUR: Well, there is not going to be a lot of fee-for-service anymore. It is kind of changing the way reimbursement is and you know, solo practitioners just start making it any more, I mean, their reimbursement fees are going down. There's cut, more and more cuts are going to be into Medicare and then they cannot afford the malpractice and running the office.</p><p>So that's what doctors are saying and these accountable care organizations are what this affordable care act is promoting. So you have to be a part of it to get reimbursed.</p><p>PAYNE: So Dr. Vinocur, this is the thing I think a lot of people are concerned about, there is a big difference between health care insurance and quality -- access to real quality health care. It sounds like what was already a numbers problem bringing 30 million more people into the system, it is going to even be worse than probably even imagined.</p><p>VINOCUR: Well, I mean, that is a very good point. I've been saying that for a long time. Just because you have health insurance doesn't mean that you have access to care. What we saw in Massachusetts is once everybody got coverage, there weren't enough primary-care doctors and that is the problem that the affordable care act doesn't address.</p><p>There is a predicted shortage of almost a hundred thousand doctors coming up by 2020 and unless we get more primary-care doctors involved and have better access for people to go, it doesn't matter if you have insurance if you cannot find a doctor to take care of you.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely. You know, of course, some changes have already been made. The president just made a change with the employer mandate. Do you think at the very least, forgetting about political ideology, at the very least though this is something that probably should be pushed back the entire thing and rethought a little bit?</p><p>VINOCUR: Well, you know what? It is already starting to go in motion. Insurance companies are already planning these products. People that are getting insurance today are being told. So I think it is probably too late to turn back. And the biggest issue is there was a pool of patients that didn't get insurance, that had too many illnesses and they couldn't get insured.</p><p>But for it to work you need this pool of healthy, young individuals that are going to buy insurance and you know, if you're only paying a $95 penalty and if January 1st there's a law that says it doesn't matter if you have a pre-existing condition. It doesn't make sense. I can't see a young person paying $300 and $400 a month just in case they need it. They might as well just pay the $95 penalty once and wait until they need it so I'm not sure how it's going to work because of that.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, I mean, that is pure logic and we know it's going to happen and to your point, we don't know how bad it's going to be, but this thing is going to have some real ugly moments without a doubt. Thank you for lending us your expertise and we appreciated.</p><p>VINOCUR: My pleasure.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Senator Harry Reid, he strikes again. This time telling Republicans that there will be no tax reform until he gets this, $1 trillion in tax hikes. Democrats holding tax reform for ransom that's next.</p><p>PAYNE: What do tax hikes have to do with tax reform? For Senator Harry Reid, everything, the Democratic majority leader says he wants nearly $1 trillion in new revenue as a starting point, this on a day where the pope is scolding the rich pay up as well, telling a crowd in Brazil that they have to bridge the gap on incomes of haves and have-nots.</p><p>Dee Dee Benkie, Rick Ungar and Liz MacDonald back on the war on the rich. Lizzie.</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS: I think Harry Reid should resign. I love how Americans are treated like tax cheats because they are not paying their fair share when the government has blown over $1 trillion and not selling their real estate, empty building that should have at the top of the market.</p><p>I'm telling you they have been hitting the middle class really hard this administration. They are the worst administration overseeing economic -- worse economic growth since the great depression. I mean, we've got job growth that is basically service sector jobs at minimum wage.</p><p>To think that you could take $1 trillion more out of the American people's pocket and that is going to create middle class job, that's not the way to go.</p><p>PAYNE: Rick, what do you make of the pope, who's now, his nickname is the slum pope. The guy walks to the worst neighborhoods of Brazil. He's applauded and he's been pretty adamant about wealth or the wealthy doing more. What do you make about that message?</p><p>RICK UNGAR, PROGRESSIVE COLUMNIST: Listen, I am not a Catholic, but this pope is so cool. I've actually giving it some thought. I love this guy.</p><p>DEE DEE BENKIE, FORMER BUSH 43 WHITE HOUSE AIDE: May I interrupt? Since you're rich and I'm poor, give me $50 right now.</p><p>UNGAR: What was I saying? I love this guy, but what's going to be fascinating though is people -- Catholic businesspeople who made the big fuss based on their religion about contraception and Obamacare, how will they deal with this issue in terms of how they pay their own workers in light of what the pope says?</p><p>PAYNE: I don't know. I just think the idea that you just answered it yourself. The fact that I am a business owner and providing jobs and opportunity for someone should put me in a positive light with the pope. The pope is talking about the super wealthy doing more that is his position, but the fact of the matter and I'm glad we're talking about this because this was debate all year last year, what is rich, what's not rich. The fact of the matter is in capitalism, people who create opportunities for themselves typically have duty.</p><p>BENKIE: I don't think anyone -- you are rich and I am for so give the many. That is not right. That is not the way that it should be they create the jobs and businesses that it is how they do not just hand over money that doesn't help anybody.</p><p>MACDONALD: As a practicing Catholic, I want to tell the pope listen American taxpayers are paying between 60 or 70 percent of the federal tax revenues in this country. We have the most aggressive income tax system this is not about spending wealth, but creating wealth you do not do that by taxing.</p><p>PAYNE: We have a crisis of selfishness and individualism's year and have to be wealthy to be selfish. I think someone who is sitting at home sucking up government benefits all day long that is another forum.</p><p>UNGAR: I don't disagree for one second. But selfishness is when you look at people working in the same company who earn 500 percent or 600 percent more than the lowest person on the rank and feel no trouble with the fact that person cannot supply a his family with food and have to go on Medicaid. That is what he is talking about.</p><p>BENKIE: Those people should be paid well.</p><p>UNGAR: They let people work in this business?</p><p>BENKIE: That is capitalism.</p><p>MACDONALD: He is trying to unite. This president and this White House and congressman like Senator Harry Reid are the most divisive politicians even Reagan and Clinton reached across the aisle and try to get bipartisan agreement. It is striking that this president who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner is one of the most divisive president in recent history.</p><p>PAYNE: I think both the president and the pope are in the same position where they have to recruit more followers. In Brazil, 90 percent of the people used to be Catholic. It's down to 57 so you need a hard message, but in America what is the president trying to accomplish? It feels like he is ripping us apart.</p><p>UNGAR: I have to say apparently the president was able to recruit enough followers to still be president. You want to throw that out the window for some reason.</p><p>PAYNE: He talks about Washington as if it is separate from him. What are you talking about?</p><p>UNGAR: Talking about those guys sitting in the House of Representatives who will not let him do a thing.

Welcome, everybody. I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And never mind, we haven't even gotten to the first debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some Democrats are already laying out their spending plans for a second Obama term's first day. Vermont Democratic Congressman Peter Welch wants to get back to an energy policy that acknowledges the climate change is real. For now, he is leaving out the price tag to address it, which Republicans predict will be unreal. California Democrat Mike Honda wants to refocus on health care to expand on increasingly cost days and state days insurance exchanges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arizona's Raul Grijalva favors a conservative push on immigration reform. Still, others interpret any Obama win as a referendum for more stimulus out of the middle-class, good or bad, depending on your political point of view. More taxes are on the rich to help pay for regardless of your point of view.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So get ready for it. They are already licking their financial chops planning for it. Never mind, you haven't even cast your vote.</p><p>It seems a lot of politicians are already grabbing for your wallet. Not much talk about getting this debt under control -- lots of talk, though, about, as we say, getting the very spending that helped get it out of debt and into debt out of control, an issue now that worries two former titans of the Senate, Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican Bob Bennett, thereby partisan red (ph) is coming up first to some worry post-election watchers right now.</p><p><person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Digital Political Editor, Chris Stirewalt and townhall.com's Katie Pavlich.</p><p>Chris, what are we to make about sort of these plans for a second <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>-- might not come to pass, but they're getting their spending priorities in order.</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, DIGITAL POLITICAL EDITOR, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS</nameText></person>: Well, look, Neil, the -- the thing that the president is very clearly doing in this reelection campaign is being very vague. And while Democrats accuse <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>of being vague, the president has intentionally talked only in general about the need for infrastructure and other stimulus kind of spending and the need for what he says will be a tax increase on top earners to pay for it.</p><p>But when you get down to specifics, you don't need -- you don't hear very much about what it would be. Part of the reason for that is that the president knows that there are a lot of people with their hands out.</p><p>There are a lot of people with ideas for how that money ought to be spent. And one concern that he has aside from frightening moderate voters with more spending is creating this line up at the trough for lawmakers from his own Party that would be looking for the second term to be even more lavish than the first.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you think that will be the case, Katie?</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM: I think it could be. But based on, you know, what these Democrats have already lined up in terms of what they want for a second Obama term, it does seem a little bit out of touch because as we know, more spending when you're spending outside of your means -- we have $16 trillion in debt -- just means the expansion of government.</p><p>And poll after poll shows that the American people and American voters are concerned about how big the federal government has been getting. And I hear a lot of repeats in what they're asking for.</p><p>President Obama may not be, you know, implementing an environmental policy that's directly geared toward climate change, but you look at the EPA's policies under President Obama. And they're geared towards addressing climate change in terms of regulations on coal mines.</p><p>And in terms of immigration reform, we've seen President Obama work on the dream act. And we just saw his executive order that was very similar to that piece of legislation.</p><p>So it's kind of a repeat of what we've already seen and I would say a little bit out of touch with what people are concerned about right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: I wonder, Chris, if it's part of this -- the perceived victor's already claiming these polls. I suppose if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>were the runaway favorite right now and you're in the defense establishment, you are seizing on keeping open those facilities and military contracts or jobs that could be imperiled as a result of even automatic sequestration.</p><p>So are we just seeing something we always see, just more obvious now or what?</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, I certainly think there is truth in that. And on the Republican side, Neil, what you'd expect right now would be a lot of calls for Romney to move right and position himself so that there would be cuts and that there would be things like that.</p><p>You might hear social issues crop up. But I think for the president, what this is -- we saw a poll today that was conducted for the Hill that said that 87 percent of Democrats are confident that the president's going to win.</p><p>And certainly, it is not helpful to the president's chances of winning for Democrats to be talking about new spending now at a time when people are very concerned about debt and deficit. But as these folks continue to believe that their man is going to carry the day on November 6, they probably want to get in line first.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just wondering, if there's always the risk when word lot (ph) of this leaks out, that they look like they're, you know, decorating the office before they're guaranteed they're going to have it, Katie. Now, if you're Barack Obama, you already have it.</p><p>So what's to stop you from saying, I might look at that new rug or what have you. But you know what I mean. There does seem to be a sense that -- that, you know, that they are planning for a victory that might not happen.</p><p>And if this gets out, then it could strike a lot of voters as, at the very least, arrogant.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, I think, too, that they're forgetting that President Obama isn't the only piece of the puzzle. You still have a Republican House which Republicans look like they're going to hold onto the House.</p><p>And if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>loses, well, let Paul Ryan is still going to be the budget chairman. And so Democrats can line up all these big spending initiatives if they want to.</p><p>But the fact is that the House is still going to be majority Republicans. If Republicans don't take back the Senate, it's going to be the same situation that we've had for the past two years.</p><p>And I would say, if they're going to go as far as trying to, as you say, decorate the office before they have it, well, we might see another turnaround election in the year 2014, like we did in 2010, if they continue to push this big spending, big government ideas going forward.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Wait a minute, you're not giving up on -- you're not giving up on 2012. It almost sounded like you were there.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, I'm just simply saying, if they're going to go decorating the office, see (ph).</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. Guys, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>PAVLICH: Thank you.</p><p>STIREWALT: You got it.</p><p>CAVUTO: And well, don't look now, but he is back. Remember Ross and his charts 20 years later, back with a vengeance, and now, a new warning -- so deep in debt. Ross Perot fears we're easy baked (ph) to be taken down.</p><p>A former Clinton Press Secretary, Debate Commission Co-Chair, Mike McCurry on those warnings from a guy who two decades ago almost up-ended the presidential race.</p><p>Michael, very good to have you.</p><p>MICHAEL MCCURRY, FMR. CLINTON PRESS SECRETARY: Good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: I remember Mikey and his charts -- I remember Bill Clinton responding to that, addressing that. And many will argue, it was your boss who did address some of those same debt issues that Perot claimed fame for.</p><p>But Perot is back saying, both Parties have let him down. I think he goes on to say that he doesn't like other guy and that both Parties have essentially risked throwing the country down the drain. Is that resonating?</p><p>MCCURRY: Well, I think that's classically Ross Perot. And I think, you know, that would be an attitude you expect him to have. But look, there is an opportunity with these debates on Wednesday night to get to some of the specifics that, you know, some of your commentators say are missing.</p><p>We're hoping that the format we have for these debates will get back beyond some of these slogans and the traditional talking points we're hearing from some of the candidates and get into a more substantive discussion. We're designing it that way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Are they allowed charts, Mike? They can't bring charts like Ross Perot, right? So they have to tell it.</p><p>MCCURRY: It's a good question. The two campaigns have been in discussions with each other. The commission kinds of take a hands-off view...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I see.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...of that. I don't know if they've got an agreement on that. But we've seen both Governor Romney and President Obama use charts from time to time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>MCCURRY: So we'll tune in and we'll see what happens.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, one of the things that I remember about the debates in '92 with Bill Clinton and others who have sort of mastered this as trying to get a complicated stuff across easily, particularly (ph), Ronald Reagan had this knack as well on the Republican side, to take complicated material and synthesize it for the people.</p><p>I mean, in this case, it would be a lot more money going out than is coming in. So I think to your old boss's credit, he would say, we have to address both Republicans, he'd been saying, now just to address all that money that's going out, address spending.</p><p>But how do you encapsulate that in a one-minute or 90-second rebuttal response to a point on spending?</p><p>MCCURRY: Well, that's the point. You really can't. So that's why we have redesigned the format of these debates so that there will be 15-minute chunks. And the candidates have to address the topic.</p><p>Now, Jim Lehrer, who will be moderating...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...the debate on Wednesday night has already said, the first three subjects will be the economy, the economy, the economy. And then the fourth subject will be health care -- obviously, Medicare, financing, and health care financing, a big issue. And then to what your panelists were just talking about, the fifth topic will be the role of government.</p><p>And I think this goes, if you want to, you know, think about how to simplify the debate a little bit, one of my other old bosses, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said, look, the quintessential question for the American people is how much government do we really want?</p><p>And how much are we really willing to pay for? That's a pretty simple set of questions. And that's really the heart of the debate they're going to have.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But I think you're right. I think that's what every election -- if you think about, it comes down -- unless you're in the middle of a crisis, but to that point, Mike, when you say, the 15 minutes, you address these in chunks, they are still timed on answers to each question.</p><p>So can -- can they go at each other, you know, unencumbered by a moderator or, you know, something that gets in the way of them getting at each other?</p><p>MCCURRY: Absolutely. I mean, the only ground rule is that there will be a question posed in each -- at the beginning of each segment to each candidate. And they get about two minutes to go, you know, to lay out what they have to say on an issue like the deficit, like infrastructure...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...like the economy. And then -- then they really are going to be asked by the moderator, I'm sure, to sort of let's flush this out a little bit. Let's talk about it.</p><p>There is some -- we need some more specifics here. And we'll see how both candidates respond.</p><p>Now, I have to make clear, it's not up to our commission to decide how that conversation...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...is structured. It'll really be up to the moderator, Jim Lehrer. But you know, knowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But would the moderator going to have to say you didn't answer that question or you didn't give me a specific answer or after one or two tries, does he say, well, this is going nowhere fast. I'm onto...</p><p>MCCURRY: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...the next thing.</p><p>MCCURRY: I'll say this. If you just -- if you only walk into that debate with a lot of zingers or one-liners or sound bytes, you're not going to be able to fill up the, you know, the chunk of time that's going to be around that -- that debate. So I think it'll be -- I'm hoping it'll be an opportunity for both Governor Romney and President Obama to really have a textured conversation about this.</p><p>And then more importantly, to get to those philosophical differences that clearly they have on what the role of government should be.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm looking forward to it. Mike, thank you very much. Good seeing you.</p><p>MCCURRY: Nice seeing you. Good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, by the way, we will be out live, 8:00 p.m until midnight this Wednesday for that Denver opening debate. And we'll be covering back (ph) all the debates right here on Fox Business.</p><p>Meanwhile, get ready for the October surprise, only it might be a number, not a blunder. I'm going to explain. There is a difference. But it could be China that turns the election around by taking our economy down. And it would take only a few guys to do it. and the old-timer says Washington is running out of time. Former Senators Bob Bennett and Sam Nunn are having none of it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: It's October 1st. Do you know where your election surprise is? To hear political pundits tell it, you can count on it -- the gap or crisis that will tip the selection one way or the other.</p><p>But what if it's not a misstep that does it but just a boring old economic number that ultimately decides it? Todd Schoenberger and Sandra Smith on the data that could pull a doozy at the polls.</p><p>Todd, it could be any host of data, right?</p><p>TODD SCHOENBERGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LANDCOLT TRADING: That's right. I mean, we've just had the GDP -- the report card on the U.S. economy, came in very low. We have the upcoming jobs report.</p><p>There are a couple of, clearly some time bombs there, that -- that can actually sway. It could be a game changer for the election. I personally think it's going to be higher oil prices.</p><p>I think this Middle East uprising is going to boil over. And if that's the case, you're going to see higher prices at the pump.</p><p>And as you know, Neil, voters vote with what's in their wallets. So if you take some cash out of those wallets, it could sway the election.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sandra, I always tend to think that things are kind of baked (ph) to do a cake when it comes to the economic numbers, that unless they're so awful or even so great that their way out of what was expected, it's -- it's not going to move the needle much.</p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, but...</p><p>CAVUTO: What is the expectation for -- for something approaching that?</p><p>SMITH: Well, the two big jobs reports that we have from -- between now and the election, I mean, we saw last month a dismal jobs growth of 96,000 jobs. And Neil, we have another jobs report on Friday.</p><p>If we see anything above eight percent unemployment, which we're still there now, we've been hovering around that level -- if we see a jump in that unemployment, if we see another dismal jobs growth number, these markets are going to react.</p><p>And let me tell you something, Neil, when you look at the stock market and people go home and look at their 401ks here as we enter into this...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes.</p><p>SMITH: ...last quarter of the year, Neil, if we see a 10, 15 percent drop in the stock market, yet voters will react. And traders on the floor are warning that investors have become so complacent. The VIX is down 63 percent over the past year.</p><p>The stock market's up 15 percent this year. Between now and election day, we could see a significant sell-off in this market.</p><p>Voters will indeed react to that.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Todd, to Sandra's point, for now, a lot of them are looking at those statements and seeing that double-digit run-up depending on statement, depending on the 401(k), and they like what they see. And they might like what anecdotally they're getting out of sights at zillow.com and the rest that children (ph) at their homes are no longer at least imploding.</p><p>They're not exactly soaring. But they stopped, you know, tumbling. And is that enough in this environment where we tend to expect so little to help the president?</p><p>SCHOENBERGER: Well, let me tell you something, that's absolutely correct. Sandra's absolutely right. The next 30 to 45 days are absolutely critical. You had the average 401(k) balance in this country.</p><p>It's about a hundred and 7,000. Yes, but S&amp;P -- it's up 14 percent plus year-to-date. If you see those gains evaporate, if they -- they go away because of poor macro headlines, higher oil prices, anything that's going to cut down on earnings, that would actually be the game-changer for voters because what they don't want to see is a brokerage statement and see these -- these numbers just start melting away.</p><p>And if that's the case, they probably will start to change, using their wallets, come election day.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you know, Sandra, when you look at the data and the markets, and if the market's, our forward-looking mechanism and the markets, you know, it could be all over the map and the gyrations read (ph) today is notwithstanding, it is still the president's trend and friend.</p><p>Would an October surprise or like a -- cause pause, in other words, that they would just say, well, wait a minute, but barring that -- that the President dodges a financial bullet?</p><p>SMITH: But one could simply argue that the stock market is -- has been artificially propped up by the Fed's money printing measures...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>SMITH: ...and when the market looks forward, Neil, they look at earnings. And we're about to get the latest report on quarterly earnings.</p><p>And UBS just put out a very dramatic note, saying that they believe that we are going to enter earnings recession, meaning two straight quarters of negative earnings growth. Those are the fundamentals that should be driving the stock market.</p><p>We're still sort of in this euphoria period after quantitative easing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p>SMITH: ...three by the Fed, to stimulate the market. What happens when we get those negative earnings report so for the next month or so?</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, real quickly, Todd, and then go over here a little bit, but I remember, 1980, there was a sounding (ph) point during that weekend before, when a lot of people just said, to hell with it. They had seen Ronald Reagan in the debate with Jimmy Carter, liked the idea that they could switch horses at that stage.</p><p>Even though they weren't sure then, he seemed to comfort himself well. They were ready to do it. They just tired of everything and needed a reason to just say, we're done. This guy's out.</p><p>Are we approaching anything like that now where -- where whatever...</p><p>SCHOENBERGER: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...we're seeing it boil (ph) now, could reverse dramatically?</p><p>SCHOENBERGER: Yes, because if you remember that time, American pride was even -- was down the tubes. I mean, the misery index was super high, as it is now, Neil. You know, we -- we actually get accustomed to seeing some of the -- you know, the new products from, say, in Apple.</p><p>And we start thinking, oh, everything's great. And then you hear from the politicians and you hear everything's in recovery mode. But it's simply not the case.</p><p>Main Street does not buy it. And if sentiment if poor, the jobs picture continues to be weak, then yes, then leading up to this election, you have 30-plus days left, Neil.</p><p>If people are not feeling well going into the election poll, going into the polls, that Tuesday, it's going to be pretty for -- for the incumbent.</p><p>CAVUTO: We shall see. Guys, thank you very, very much.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, how is this for an October surprise -- a hack attack that could be a huge setback for the entire economy -- the guy who says that he's closer than you think?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: A red alert at the White House. We are learning that Chinese hackers breached a computer at the White House's military office. Now, the White House is saying no -- no harm was done.</p><p>But this is just the latest hack attack -- cyber crooks just hitting several major U.S. banks. So Homeland Security Adviser, Michael who says this is a bigger economic threat than the military one it would obviously pose. Explain what you mean by that?</p><p>MICHAEL BALBONI, FMR. HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: We, in a society, we do everything now digitally. And when you think about the -- the past, I mean, even companies like eHarmony, with those breaches, more and more what the attacks have been about is not only taking information but distorting it as well.</p><p>And the recent attacks against the banks just point out that this is the evolution. You know, Congress has been wrestling with this for the last couple of years.</p><p>And they cannot get out of their own way to say, how do we set a standard, how do we get information shared about these attacks? And how do we make American businesses and society more resilient and less vulnerable to these types of attacks?</p><p>CAVUTO: But they keep happening, right? I figure, you know, it happens that, you know, a mid-sized company -- even one of these large companies, it worries whether it happens to a big tech company because then I'd say, well, you're tech if you can't figure it out then for god's sake, how can anyone else?</p><p>BALBONI: Right. Very true, yes, absolutely. They can have the budgets from the I.T.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But now, what happens to a government computer, I mean, and it goes all the way to the White House and they say, well, you know, technically, this is just like a phishing expedition quite literally where they plant a virus-plagued mail and it disrupts the computer. Well, they planted a virus mail and it disrupted a computer. End of story.</p><p>BALBONI: Well, the problem with any of the governmental structures that -- the I.T. structures is that it all relies on one component -- the same component. And that is a human element.</p><p>And oftentimes, what happens, even though we assume that everybody from the folks in the White House on down to the Department of Defense, to any other of the governmental agencies, everybody knows what they're doing when it comes to e-mail and how to deal with the computer systems.</p><p>What we're really finding out is they don't know as much as they should. And so every opportunity that the hackers can have to find somebody that they can infiltrate and get them to open up one of these e-mails and download a malicious payload is all you need to -- to prevent and to start an attack. And preventing it is really difficult.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Michael, why are the Chinese so blatant about it? I mean, they're -- in a thousand U.S. corporation instances, to say nothing of repeated government attacks, it's as if they set up shop at a Starbucks and are doing it in broad daylight. And they're not even denying it.</p><p>They say, oh, what do we do about that?</p><p>BALBONI: Well, look, the Chinese government has been very open about the fact that they hire young students. They train them to do hacking. They train them to go into the computer systems and decide how the United States and the rest of the world does their cyber business, go in and get that information and take it for their own use...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, where do you see this going, Michael? How far does this go? What do you see happening?</p><p>BALBONI: And actually -- and actually, the information I've received about some of the bank attacks -- the recent bank attacks is that there's a more disturbing evolution here. And that is that it's not just the attack where you go after a Web site, and you try to take down the Web site through a denial service attack.</p><p>You basically wall it off, or you try to insert some malicious code there. But they're actually going after the domain names, in other words, the infrastructure of cyber security world.</p><p>And what's so disturbing about that is that now, you can take the information. And yes, you could stop it. But you could also distort it.</p><p>And that now, when you have a consumer-based cyber security or cyber network, where you do all your cyber business, what do you do if you say, you get onto your bank account and now, everything's gone. What happens if we lose confidence in our cyber system in this nation? That's an economic ruin.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, well-pointed out, Michael. Thank you very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, ignore all the polls. Focus instead on how many might be going to the polls.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Halftime, are Democrats the ones who are going to get throttled? Now, you don't see that certainly in most polls. But you do see it in the number of Democrats who, so far, aren't planning to go to those polls, because compared to this time in 2008, not a whole lot of jazzed Democrats in 2012, at least not nearly as many, in Ohio, 490,000 -- fewer folks registered compared to four years ago.</p><p>And 44 percent of them in Cleveland and surrounding Cuyahoga County where Democrats are a two to one advantage over Republicans. Another survey -- this one by a left-leaning think tank, Third Way, shows similar Democrat voter registration declines in Florida, Iowa and New Hampshire.</p><p>And that is not to say, the president still doesn't lead in polls in these states and might win big of these states -- just the Democrats' tepid get- out the vote campaign might not translate into victories in these states, not if their own troops don't even bother showing up.</p><p>And if passion is a factor, is the president a possible loser in swing states where he, right now, looks like a winner? Hard to say, this much is not. If the key to victory is jazzing your base, the president is not.</p><p>And that's not to say that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>has. But by comparison, the number of Republican registered voters is about the same, if not slightly hire than in 2008.</p><p>Who knows what any of this means? And who knows whether all these registered voters surveys failed to appreciate the influence of just plain old independents who presently align themselves with neither Party.</p><p>Let's just say, for the president and for Democrats, a sign they should hold off on that Party. So our question tonight is this -- if so many Democrats aren't coming back, who says <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really is that far back?</p><p>GOP Strategist, Cheri -- Cheri, I think I know what you're going to say. But what do you say?</p><p>CHERI JACOBUS, PRESIDENT, CAPITOL STRATEGIES: Well, I do think there are some problems with the polling. A lot of people are looking at the 2008 models, Neil. And that's not the way to go. Obama voters and Democrats were very energized in 2008. And they're not now. So a lot of people talk about registered voters, as if they're all going to the poll. And you have to look at likely voters.</p><p>And even then, I think we have some problems. In 2010, pollsters were way off. They really could not have predicted that Republicans would have picked up a net of 63 House seats and six in the Senate. It was kind of a surprise. And we even saw this in '94. I don't think Newt Gingrich really expected to be speaker in '94. It was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, no, no, there is historic precedent to divide (ph) kind of getting it wrong. I don't know -- well, it's a Machiavelli in plan, I doubt that. But I will say this -- that in some states, and it's still early, as you remind me, it is beyond the margin for sampling error. By that, I mean...</p><p>JACOBUS: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...if -- if Barack Obama is up eight to 10 points, even allowing for whatever statistical bias you see, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>should be worried, right?</p><p>JACOBUS: Well, he should be worried. But again, it doesn't make sense. Nationally, you've got this race statistically tied, Romney just a couple of points down.</p><p>And you see that in poll after poll. And now, you're looking at these battleground states where we're hearing, you know, Obama is so far ahead. It doesn't make sense, Neil, because those battleground states are probably about 25 or 20 percent of the entire votes.</p><p>So there's something off right there. And I think that you have to look at maybe the 2010 models.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>JACOBUS: Again, it was an unexpected victory...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And if you did that, Cheri, if you did that -- by the way, the counter to that argument would be in core states that are safe, Republican states, Texas comes to mind, some southern state <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>enjoys significant leads.</p><p>Is this typically the case where core states to each -- each candidate go their way? But having said that, do you think that there is room for a wide swing within those swing states? And if so, how significant would it be? Normally, the closer we get to the election, the less likely that is, although in 1980, it happened. But what do you see happening?</p><p>JACOBUS: Yes, well, look, you've got a president who's only got a 47 percent approval rating. If you are under 50 percent, and you're the incumbent and it's October, you've got big, big problems. So the case has been made for this -- for that why this president should be hired. The problem now is Romney has to make the case why he should be hired. But he has picked up in the past week or so with independence. So that's very good news for the Romney campaign.</p><p>So I think when you see these battleground states with the number so far -- with the margins so -- the distance between the two candidates so large, I -- I think that it's unlikely that it can be that stark in those states. So the numbers have to be off. It was seen that even in battleground states, even if there's some urban areas that tend to favor the Democrat, you have to look at likely voters -- the voters who are going to turn out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>JACOBUS: And again, Neil, if I'm a campaign -- seems to be relying just on getting voters angry, almost to the point of hatred. And you've got to keep them riled until election day and still get them out on election day - - very different from 2008 when it was very positive -- all hope, all change are very uplifting.</p><p>So that's a real challenge for the Democrats, for the Obama campaign to get those voters riled up again where they were almost euphoric in 2008. And now, they have to be so angry. That's -- that's a tough job.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. You want them registered at least. You want them out there set to vote. Cheri, thank you very much. Cheri Jacobus...</p><p>JACOBUS: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...in Washington.</p><p>Well, Bill may sell the man. I want you to meet the Republican and the Democrat, who actually do the math.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: Now, people ask me all the time, how we got four surplus budgets in a row. What new ideas did we bring to Washington? I always give a one- word answer -- arithmetic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, we interrupt this political shouting for something that's exploding -- our debt. Ross Perot wasn't the only one coming back in a page one set in USA today, in fact, to say it's going to crush us. Two season of Washington veterans, Democrat and a Republican say, this keeps up.</p><p>Ross is actually understating it. We all go down. Here to spell it out, and the options we still have before time is up, former Georgia Democratic Senator Sam Nunn, and former Utah Republican Senator, Bob Bennett.</p><p>Welcome, gentleman, and an honor having both of you.</p><p>Senator Nunn, do you first, of course, long ago, you were reminding people of the dangers of this accumulating debt. But it's still accumulating. And I'm wondering if in this election year, it's an issue they're even bothering to address. If you had your druthers in this upcoming debate, what would your words be to both candidates?</p><p>SAM NUNN, FMR. SENATOR, (D) GEORGIA: Well, I would like for them to use common sense and honest arithmetic. And I'd like to see the candidates explain to the American people that we really do have a serious problem.</p><p>And all parts of the budget have to come under scrutiny. We have to play with a whole deck of cards.</p><p>But we particularly have to discuss, frankly, with the American people, that the entitlement programs simply cannot maintain the same trajectory. We're not going to cut people's Social Security or cut people's Medicare.</p><p>But we have to bend the coastline downward. Otherwise, we will simply not be able to sustain the programs that we have, and our country, with a fragile economic recovery, and a global environment that's very fragile, will be in deep difficulty.</p><p>No one can predict how long the bond markets will support American debt. But we're borrowing 40 cents, approximately out of every dollar that we spend today.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it will keep doing so as long as Ben Bernanke keeps this thing going again.</p><p>But Senator Bennett, I always think, and I know we've chatted about this before, sir, that -- that we live in an environment, where each party is captive to the extreme elements that don't want to budge and not even these varied -- either those extreme elements.</p><p>Well, on the Democratic side, to Senator Nunn's point, that if you're trying to rein in the growth of entitlements, you're overthrowing grandma off the cliff on your side.</p><p>And you experienced this first-hand, Senator, if you're trying to address, you know, closing loopholes and credits and allowances that allow some, to not pay the taxes at all, you're raising taxes so tea partiers hate you. So you can't move the ball forward, when that's how we're playing the game, can you?</p><p>BOB BENNETT, FMR. SENATOR, (R) UTAH: Well, there needs to be some honesty here. And Sam Nunn has got it exactly right. The challenge with entitlements, frankly, is not because of anything that Republicans have done, not because of anything the Democrats have done.</p><p>It's because of changing demographics in the country. And demographic trends are the most difficult trends to change. And they've been coming at us for years. And we've known this is coming for years. And we keep putting it off, saying, well, I'll just demagogue the issue in this election.</p><p>And then, we'll deal with it later on. Well, you can't do that. The baby boomer started retiring, started swelling the ranks, demographically of the people drawing entitlements in just a year -- 2008. So just as we have the problem that hit with us with the financial collapse that occurred in September of 2008, we saw the increases demands going up simply because...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>BENNETT: ...we are an aging nation. Now...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But you know, you explain that very clearly. I mean, you could be left or right and understand that that's an escapable truth. We're getting older, a lot more of a big crush of people, such at the same time, getting older, too. The -- the dynamics don't support what we've got right now.</p><p>But Senator Nunn, I'll address this in a Democratic perspective than a Republican perspective, the idea is you even try to slow that momentum in spending, and address that growth in population. You -- you are torpedoing benefits that are sacrosanct.</p><p>How do you get people around the notion you're trying to save those benefits or they're gone?</p><p>NUNN: Well, I don't think a torpedo should apply when you're treading a line that continues to grow up. You're just not making the trajectory as sharp.</p><p>We have to tell younger people, frankly, you're going to have to save more money because by the time you retire, the age of retirement may go up somewhat. That happens over a long period of time. And we may have to say on cost to living type adjustments over a long period of time...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Easy solutions, never offered -- never ever offered...</p><p>NUNN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...never accepted by enough to get that ball moving forward.</p><p>NUNN: Well, they've been offered -- they've been offered on the floor of the Senate, even when I was there, several times a week...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're actually right about that.</p><p>NUNN: We never had a majority vote for them. You're right about that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senators...</p><p>BENNETT: I wrote -- I wrote a bill...</p><p>NUNN: People never understood the problem. People have to understand it. When they do, the American people, I'm confident, will support...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, no, I think you're right. I think you're right. But Senator Bennett, it's getting past that hurdle, right, to get the word out to them.</p><p>BENNETT: Yes, well, I -- I wrote a bill that was -- that did exactly the things that Senator Nunn is talking about. And it was scored by the administrators, the board of trustees, if that's the proper term of the Social Security administration, as a 100 percent fix of Social Security that would -- would make Social Security safe in perpetuity.</p><p>And I took it to the Republican leader and said, this is what we ought to be doing. And he said, Bob, that'll be the Republican position. And we'll get behind it as soon as you get your first Democratic cosponsor. And so I walked across the aisle and sat down with some of my Democratic friends and laid it out. And they said, you know, this is great. This is -- this will solve the problem.</p><p>And we'll get behind it. We'll join you right after the election.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>BENNETT: Well, you know, there we were. One point I really want to make, that Washington's the only place I know where, when you give somebody more this year than you gave them last year, that's called a cut.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a very good point. And it's a point I want to pick up on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENNETT: Because you're giving them less than they were promised.</p><p>CAVUTO: Less than what they were expecting. I'm going to swirl (ph) it a little bit because that is something that we get wrong in the media, this idea of cuts, when you're actually talking about slowing the growth of something, to Senator Nunn's point, about making sure that line doesn't go up as much as it presently is.</p><p>The debate over -- the very words we use in this debate after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Fair and balanced -- we've got former Senator Bob Bennett, former Senator Sam Nunn, debating what we do now on -- on the debt. And you're quite right, gentlemen. Normally, this stuff comes up in detail in bravery (ph) after an election.</p><p>But Senator Nunn, do you -- if Barack Obama is reelected, the argument is, right now, we're hearing a lot of Democrats -- not all are already planning spending initiatives of their own. In other words, to keep the spigots spigotting, nothing changes.</p><p>Republicans, conversely if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>were to win, are planning a lot of more military and the like spending. How do we disavow each side of its knee-jerk inclination to spend on industry's favored to its Party?</p><p>Senator Nunn, to you first.</p><p>NUNN: Well, I thought, hope that the debate will produce some more honest dialogue. And then right after the election, whoever is elected, whether it's President Obama or <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>we face the fiscal cliff in January. And almost all economists left or right or center, say that that would cause a high-risk of another recession, a deep recession.</p><p>So what I would like to see instead of the fiscal cliff that we face, and instead of kicking that can down the road six months, why don't we change cans? Why don't we use Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin or some legislative combination of those, substitute it for the cliff and say, OK, you've got six months.</p><p>You can overturn it. You may not like it. But it's a lot better than what we face right now. So why not substitute a logical and sane default position for what we have facing us now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator Bennett, what in your gut, do you think, they will do? I mean, regardless who wins in November, the prevailing wisdom is they either delay these cuts, try to screw around with sequestration so that the cuts are put off a little bit or all the Bush rates don't expire immediately -- a glorified way of kicking the can down the road. What do you think will happen?</p><p>BENNETT: Well, I think the suggestion that Senator Nunn has just made is exactly the right thing we ought to do -- we ought to see them do. I do not see sequestration, a fiscal cliff.</p><p>I see Congress blinking very big time and saying, well, let's delay this.</p><p>CAVUTO: We've got a lame duck session that decides that?</p><p>BENNETT: No, no, I think...</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>BENNETT: ...maybe they'll do it in the lame duck. They come back on the third of January, do it quickly well or just put it off a little while while we talk about it because no one wants to be responsible for their consequences that would come if they did nothing.</p><p>So the instinct is well, let's just put it off a little while, while we talk about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, well, we've done that forever.</p><p>BENNETT: Let's not...</p><p>CAVUTO: But Senator Nunn, to that point...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENNETT: ...that's not a solution. That's not a solution.</p><p>CAVUTO: I agree with you.</p><p>BENNETT: That's not a solution.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Senator Nunn, to that point, if we end up doing something like that, are we reinforcing the credit ratings agencies' desire to downgrade us, that that's the stuff of Banana Republic's and that (ph) now, there's going to be hell to pay for doing it.</p><p>NUNN: Well, I think Bob is basically correct. Yes, it's - it's an issue of rating agency. But the fundamental issue is a moral issue and a generational issue. And beyond the numbers, we can deal with the numbers - - all sorts of people on both sides that can work this thing out.</p><p>But the real signal to the markets and to the world and our own country is that this government cannot function. That's a more dangerous signal than even the numbers.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think, Senator Bennett, that if we don't make a move and soon, the message to the markets will be, sell-off like crazy?</p><p>BENNETT: The one thing that disturbs markets more than anything else is uncertainty. And Sam has just described the biggest uncertainty of all, which is will the U.S. government be able to function? There are...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, let me keep -- we're going to go a little longer if we...</p><p>BENNETT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ... I want to hear what you're saying, that if we -- if we don't act immediately, what you're saying, Senator Bennett, is that you can't keep pulling this stunt, that -- that this time, there would be hell to pay for that?</p><p>BENNETT: Well, I think, GDP growth would continue to be sluggish, if indeed, not tip over into another recession, just because, as has been pointed out in previous versions of this, there are trillions of dollars waiting on the sidelines for some sense of certainty...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>BENNETT: ...to come into the economy and investment. And if the federal government can't get its act together...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: If they get -- if they get their act together and respond...</p><p>BENNETT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...that...</p><p>BENNETT: That money won't come in.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm sorry. Senator Nunn, sorry, pressed for time here. I just want to make be clear on something. And do you think then that there would be a collapse or would these sequestration cuts just cuts off the growth of spending in the military and all these others, over 10 years no less. Are they really that draconian, that there would be that kind of a hell to pay?</p><p>NUNN: Well, to change all our previous habits but it's not draconian. We make modest changes now or everyday or month or a year. We wait. The changes have to be more dramatic.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, I understand. But these sequestration cuts that everyone all but calls doomsday -- are they really that doomsday?</p><p>NUNN: Well, it's a huge increase in taxes. And it's a very large cut of expenditures. All at once, it's not...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All at once, yes.</p><p>NUNN: All at once. This is sudden and it's in a fragile economy. So no one knows precisely what's going to happen. But you know, I think we're right in the middle of Winston Churchill's prophecy where he said that America will always do the right thing after its tried every other alternative.</p><p>We don't know how long we're going to have to get through with the alternatives and do the right thing. No one can predict that.</p><p>The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable. And it happens as we've seen in Europe very rapidly.</p><p>CAVUTO: A very good point. The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable. That is a very good point.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>NUNN: Thank you, Neil. Thank you, Bob.</p><p>BENNETT: You bet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Progress is possible, folks. More after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, now, it is going to get busy -- very, very busy. The first big debate in Denver, coming up on Wednesday night. We're there. A little more than a week after that, the vice presidential debate, then we've got yet another presidential debate wrapping things up with the final Obama- Romney clash.</p><p>We're on each and every single one because it's your money. It's your life. And we mean it when we say it. We like to travel and we like to look out for you. Watch us.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil  Cavuto.  And never mind, we haven't even gotten to the first debate.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some Democrats are already laying out their spending plans for a second  Obama term's first day.  Vermont Democratic Congressman Peter Welch wants  to get back to an energy policy that acknowledges the climate change is  real.  For now, he is leaving out the price tag to address it, which  Republicans predict will be unreal.  California Democrat Mike Honda wants  to refocus on health care to expand on increasingly cost days and state  days insurance exchanges.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arizona's Raul Grijalva favors a conservative push on immigration reform.   Still, others interpret any Obama win as a referendum for more stimulus out  of the middle-class, good or bad, depending on your political point of  view.  More taxes are on the rich to help pay for regardless of your point  of view.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So get ready for it.  They are already licking their financial chops  planning for it.  Never mind, you haven't even cast your vote.  </p><p>It seems a lot of politicians are already grabbing for your wallet.  Not  much talk about getting this debt under control -- lots of talk, though,  about, as we say, getting the very spending that helped get it out of debt  and into debt out of control, an issue now that worries two former titans  of the Senate, Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican Bob Bennett, thereby  partisan red (ph) is coming up first to some worry post-election watchers  right now. </p><p>Fox News Digital Political Editor, Chris Stirewalt and townhall.com's Katie  Pavlich.  </p><p>Chris, what are we to make about sort of these plans for a second Obama  administration -- might not come to pass, but they're getting their  spending priorities in order.  </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, DIGITAL POLITICAL EDITOR, FOX NEWS:  Well, look, Neil, the  -- the thing that the president is very clearly doing in this reelection  campaign is being very vague.  And while Democrats accuse Mitt Romney of  being vague, the president has intentionally talked only in general about  the need for infrastructure and other stimulus kind of spending and the  need for what he says will be a tax increase on top earners to pay for it.  </p><p>But when you get down to specifics, you don't need -- you don't hear very  much about what it would be.  Part of the reason for that is that the  president knows that there are a lot of people with their hands out.  </p><p>There are a lot of people with ideas for how that money ought to be spent.   And one concern that he has aside from frightening moderate voters with  more spending is creating this line up at the trough for lawmakers from his  own Party that would be looking for the second term to be even more lavish  than the first.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So you think that will be the case, Katie? </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM:  I think it could be.  But based on, you know,  what these Democrats have already lined up in terms of what they want for a  second  Obama term, it does seem a little bit out of touch because as we  know, more spending when you're spending outside of your means -- we have  $16 trillion in debt -- just means the expansion of government.  </p><p>And poll after poll shows that the American people and American voters are  concerned about how big the federal government has been getting.  And I  hear a lot of repeats in what they're asking for.  </p><p>President Obama may not be, you know, implementing an environmental policy  that's directly geared toward climate change, but you look at the EPA's  policies under President Obama.  And they're geared towards addressing  climate change in terms of regulations on coal mines.  </p><p>And in terms of immigration reform, we've seen President Obama work on the  dream act. And we just saw his executive order that was very similar to  that piece of legislation.  </p><p>So it's kind of a repeat of what we've already seen and I would say a  little bit out of touch with what people are concerned about right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I wonder, Chris, if it's part of this -- the perceived victor's  already claiming these polls.  I suppose if Mitt Romney were the runaway  favorite right now and you're in the defense establishment, you are seizing  on keeping open those facilities and military contracts or jobs that could  be imperiled as a result of even automatic sequestration.  </p><p>So are we just seeing something we always see, just more obvious now or  what? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, I certainly think there is truth in that.  And on the  Republican side, Neil, what you'd expect right now would be a lot of calls  for Romney to move right and position himself so that there would be cuts  and that there would be things like that.  </p><p>You might hear social issues crop up.  But I think for the president, what  this is -- we saw a poll today that was conducted for the Hill that said  that 87 percent of Democrats are confident that the president's going to  win.  </p><p>And certainly, it is not helpful to the president's chances of winning for  Democrats to be talking about new spending now at a time when people are  very concerned about debt and deficit.  But as these folks continue to  believe that their man is going to carry the day on November 6, they  probably want to get in line first.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm just wondering, if there's always the risk when word lot (ph)  of this leaks out, that they look like they're, you know, decorating the  office before they're guaranteed they're going to have it, Katie.  Now, if  you're Barack Obama, you already have it.  </p><p>So what's to stop you from saying, I might look at that new rug or what  have you.  But you know what I mean.  There does seem to be a sense that --  that, you know, that they are planning for a victory that might not happen.  </p><p>And if this gets out, then it could strike a lot of voters as, at the very  least, arrogant.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Well, I think, too, that they're forgetting that President Obama  isn't the only piece of the puzzle.  You still have a Republican House  which Republicans look like they're going to hold onto the House. </p><p>And if Mitt Romney loses, well, let Paul Ryan is still going to be the  budget chairman.  And so Democrats can line up all these big spending  initiatives if they want to. </p><p>But the fact is that the House is still going to be majority Republicans.   If Republicans don't take back the Senate, it's going to be the same  situation that we've had for the past two years.  </p><p>And I would say, if they're going to go as far as trying to, as you say,  decorate the office before they have it, well, we might see another  turnaround election in the year 2014, like we did in 2010, if they continue  to push this big spending, big government ideas going forward. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Wait a minute, you're not giving up on -- you're not giving up on  2012.  It almost sounded like you were there.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Well, I'm just simply saying, if they're going to go decorating  the office, see (ph). </p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  Guys, thank you both very, very much.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you. </p><p>STIREWALT:  You got it. </p><p>CAVUTO:  And well, don't look now, but he is back.  Remember Ross and his  charts 20 years later, back with a vengeance, and now, a new warning -- so  deep in debt.  Ross Perot fears we're easy baked (ph) to be taken down.  </p><p>A former Clinton Press Secretary, Debate Commission Co-Chair, Mike McCurry  on those warnings from a guy who two decades ago almost up-ended the  presidential race.  </p><p>Michael, very good to have you.  </p><p>MICHAEL MCCURRY, FMR. CLINTON PRESS SECRETARY:  Good to be with you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I remember Mikey and his charts -- I remember Bill Clinton  responding to that, addressing that.  And many will argue, it was your boss  who did address some of those same debt issues that Perot claimed fame for.  </p><p>But Perot is back saying, both Parties have let him down.  I think he goes  on to say that he doesn't like other guy and that both Parties have  essentially risked throwing the country down the drain.  Is that  resonating? </p><p>MCCURRY:  Well, I think that's classically Ross Perot.  And I think, you  know, that would be an attitude you expect him to have.  But look, there is  an opportunity with these debates on Wednesday night to get to some of the  specifics that, you know, some of your commentators say are missing.  </p><p>We're hoping that the format we have for these debates will get back beyond  some of these slogans and the traditional talking points we're hearing from  some of the candidates and get into a more substantive discussion.  We're  designing it that way. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Are they allowed charts, Mike?  They can't bring charts like Ross  Perot, right?  So they have to tell it.</p><p>MCCURRY:  It's a good question.  The two campaigns have been in discussions  with each other.  The commission kinds of take a hands-off view...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  I see. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...of that.  I don't know if they've got an agreement on that.   But we've seen both Governor Romney and President Obama use charts from  time to time.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Sure. </p><p>MCCURRY:  So we'll tune in and we'll see what happens.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, one of the things that I remember about the debates in  '92 with Bill Clinton and others who have sort of mastered this as trying  to get a complicated stuff across easily, particularly (ph), Ronald Reagan  had this knack as well on the Republican side, to take complicated material  and synthesize it for the people.  </p><p>I mean, in this case, it would be a lot more money going out than is coming  in.  So I think to your old boss's credit, he would say, we have to address  both Republicans, he'd been saying, now just to address all that money  that's going out, address spending.  </p><p>But how do you encapsulate that in a one-minute or 90-second rebuttal  response to a point on spending? </p><p>MCCURRY:  Well, that's the point.  You really can't.  So that's why we have  redesigned the format of these debates so that there will be 15-minute  chunks.  And the candidates have to address the topic.  </p><p>Now, Jim Lehrer, who will be moderating...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...the debate on Wednesday night has  already said, the first  three subjects will be the economy, the economy, the economy.  And then the  fourth subject will be health care -- obviously, Medicare, financing, and  health care financing, a big issue.  And then to what your panelists were  just talking about, the fifth topic will be the role of government. </p><p>And I think this goes, if you want to, you know, think about how to  simplify the debate a little bit, one of my other old bosses, Daniel  Patrick Moynihan, said, look, the quintessential question for the American  people is how much government do we really want? </p><p>And how much are we really willing to pay for?  That's a pretty simple set  of questions.  And that's really the heart of the debate they're going to  have. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I think you're right.  I think that's what every election --  if you think about, it comes down -- unless you're in the middle of a  crisis, but to that point, Mike, when you say, the 15 minutes, you address  these in chunks, they are still timed on answers to each question.  </p><p>So can -- can they go at each other, you know, unencumbered by a moderator  or, you know, something that gets in the way of them getting at each other? </p><p>MCCURRY:  Absolutely.  I mean, the only ground rule is that there will be a  question posed in each -- at the beginning of each segment to each  candidate.  And they get about two minutes to go, you know, to lay out what  they have to say on an issue like the deficit, like infrastructure...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...like the economy.  And then -- then they really are going to  be asked by the moderator, I'm sure, to sort of let's flush this out a  little bit.  Let's talk about it. </p><p>There is some -- we need some more specifics here.  And we'll see how both  candidates respond. </p><p>Now, I have to make clear, it's not up to our commission to decide how that  conversation...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...is structured.  It'll really be up to the moderator, Jim  Lehrer.  But you know, knowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  But would the moderator going to have to say you didn't answer  that question or you didn't give me a specific answer or after one or two  tries, does he say, well, this is going nowhere fast.  I'm onto... </p><p>MCCURRY:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...the next thing.  </p><p>MCCURRY:  I'll say this.  If you just -- if you only walk into that debate  with a lot of zingers or one-liners or sound bytes, you're not going to be  able to fill up the, you know, the chunk of time that's going to be around  that -- that debate.  So I think it'll be -- I'm hoping it'll be an  opportunity for both Governor Romney and President Obama to really have a  textured conversation about this.  </p><p>And then more importantly, to get to those philosophical differences that  clearly they have on what the role of government should be. </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm looking forward to it.  Mike, thank you very much.  Good  seeing you. </p><p>MCCURRY:  Nice seeing you.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, by the way, we will be out live, 8:00 p.m until  midnight this Wednesday for that Denver opening debate.  And we'll be  covering back (ph) all the debates right here on Fox Business.  </p><p>Meanwhile, get ready for the October surprise, only it might be a number,  not a blunder.  I'm going to explain.  There is a difference.  But it could  be China that turns the election around by taking our economy down.  And it  would take only a few guys to do it.  and the old-timer says Washington is  running out of time.  Former Senators Bob Bennett and Sam Nunn are having  none of it.                     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  It's October 1st.  Do you know where your election surprise is?   To hear political pundits tell it, you can count on it -- the gap or crisis  that will tip the selection one way or the other.  </p><p>But what if it's not a misstep that does it but just a boring old economic  number that ultimately decides it?  Todd Schoenberger and Sandra Smith on  the data that could pull a doozy at the polls.  </p><p>Todd, it could be any host of data, right? </p><p>TODD SCHOENBERGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LANDCOLT TRADING:  That's right.  I  mean, we've just had the GDP -- the report card on the U.S. economy, came  in very low.  We have the upcoming jobs report.  </p><p>There are a couple of, clearly some time bombs there, that -- that can  actually sway.  It could be a game changer for the election.  I personally  think it's going to be higher oil prices.  </p><p>I think this Middle East uprising is going to boil over.  And if that's the  case, you're going to see higher prices at the pump. </p><p>And as you know, Neil, voters vote with what's in their wallets.  So if you  take some cash out of those wallets, it could sway the election.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Sandra, I always tend to think that things are kind of baked (ph)  to do a cake when it comes to the economic numbers, that unless they're so  awful or even so great that their way out of what was expected, it's --  it's not going to move the needle much.  </p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, but...</p><p>CAVUTO:  What is the expectation for -- for something approaching that? </p><p>SMITH:  Well, the two big jobs reports that we have from -- between now and  the election, I mean, we saw last month a dismal jobs growth of 96,000  jobs.  And Neil, we have another jobs report on Friday.  </p><p>If we see anything above eight percent unemployment, which we're still  there now, we've been hovering around that level -- if we see a jump in  that unemployment, if we see another dismal jobs growth number, these  markets are going to react.  </p><p>And let me tell you something, Neil, when you look at the stock market and  people go home and look at their 401ks here as we enter into this...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, yes. </p><p>SMITH:  ...last quarter of the year, Neil, if we see a 10, 15 percent drop  in the stock market, yet voters will react.  And traders on the floor are  warning that investors have become so complacent.  The VIX is down 63  percent over the past year.  </p><p>The stock market's up 15 percent this year.  Between now and election day,  we could see a significant sell-off in this market.  </p><p>Voters will indeed react to that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Todd, to Sandra's point, for now, a lot of them are looking at  those statements and seeing that double-digit run-up depending on  statement, depending on the 401(k), and they like what they see.  And they  might like what anecdotally they're getting out of sights at zillow.com and  the rest that children (ph) at their homes are no longer at least  imploding. </p><p>They're not exactly soaring.  But they stopped, you know, tumbling.  And is  that enough in this environment where we tend to expect so little to help  the president? </p><p>SCHOENBERGER:  Well, let me tell you something, that's absolutely correct.   Sandra's absolutely right.  The next 30 to 45 days are absolutely critical.   You had the average 401(k) balance in this country. </p><p>It's about a hundred and 7,000.  Yes, but S&amp;P -- it's up 14 percent plus  year-to-date.  If you see those gains evaporate, if they -- they go away  because of poor macro headlines, higher oil prices, anything that's going  to cut down on earnings, that would actually be the game-changer for voters  because what they don't want to see is a brokerage statement and see these  -- these numbers just start melting away. </p><p>And if that's the case, they probably will start to change, using their  wallets, come election day.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you know, Sandra, when you look at the data and the markets,  and if the market's, our forward-looking mechanism and the markets, you  know, it could be all over the map and the gyrations read (ph) today is  notwithstanding, it is still the president's trend and friend. </p><p>Would an October surprise or like a -- cause pause, in other words, that  they would just say, well, wait a minute, but barring that -- that the  President dodges a financial bullet? </p><p>SMITH:  But one could simply argue that the stock market is -- has been  artificially propped up by the Fed's money printing measures...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>SMITH:  ...and when the market looks forward, Neil, they look at earnings.   And we're about to get the latest report on quarterly earnings.  </p><p>And UBS just put out a very dramatic note, saying that they believe that we  are going to enter earnings recession, meaning two straight quarters of  negative earnings growth.  Those are the fundamentals that should be  driving the stock market.  </p><p>We're still sort of in this euphoria period after quantitative easing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right. </p><p>SMITH:  ...three by the Fed, to stimulate the market.  What happens when we  get those negative earnings report so for the next month or so? </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, real quickly, Todd, and then go over here a little bit,  but I remember, 1980, there was a sounding (ph) point during that weekend  before, when a lot of people just said, to hell with it.  They had seen  Ronald Reagan in the debate with Jimmy Carter, liked the idea that they  could switch horses at that stage. </p><p>Even though they weren't sure then, he seemed to comfort himself well.   They were ready to do it.  They just tired of everything and needed a  reason to just say, we're done.  This guy's out.  </p><p>Are we approaching anything like that now where -- where whatever...</p><p>SCHOENBERGER:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...we're seeing it boil (ph) now, could reverse dramatically? </p><p>SCHOENBERGER:  Yes, because if you remember that time, American pride was  even -- was down the tubes.  I mean, the misery index was super high, as it  is now, Neil.  You know, we -- we actually get accustomed to seeing some of  the -- you know, the new products from, say, in Apple.  </p><p>And we start thinking, oh, everything's great.  And then you hear from the  politicians and you hear everything's in recovery mode.  But it's simply  not the case. </p><p>Main Street does not buy it.  And if sentiment if poor, the jobs picture  continues to be weak, then yes, then leading up to this election, you have  30-plus days left, Neil.  </p><p>If people are not feeling well going into the election poll, going into the  polls, that Tuesday, it's going to be pretty for -- for the incumbent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We shall see.  Guys, thank you very, very much.  </p><p>SMITH:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Meanwhile, how is this for an October surprise -- a hack attack  that could be a huge setback for the entire economy -- the guy who says  that he's closer than you think?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  A red alert at the White House.  We are learning that Chinese  hackers breached a computer at the White House's military office.  Now, the  White House is saying no -- no harm was done.  </p><p>But this is just the latest hack attack -- cyber crooks just hitting  several major U.S. banks.  So Homeland Security Adviser, Michael who says  this is a bigger economic threat than the military one it would obviously  pose.  Explain what you mean by that? </p><p>MICHAEL BALBONI, FMR. HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER:  We, in a society, we do  everything now digitally.  And when you think about the -- the past, I  mean, even companies like eHarmony, with those breaches, more and more what  the attacks have been about is not only taking information but distorting  it as well.  </p><p>And the recent attacks against the banks just point out that this is the  evolution.  You know, Congress has been wrestling with this for the last  couple of years.</p><p>And they cannot get out of their own way to say, how do we set a standard,  how do we get information shared about these attacks?  And how do we make  American businesses and society more resilient and less vulnerable to these  types of attacks? </p><p>CAVUTO:  But they keep happening, right?  I figure, you know, it happens  that,  you know, a mid-sized company -- even one of these large companies,  it worries whether it happens to a big tech company because then I'd say,  well, you're tech if you can't figure it out then for god's sake, how can  anyone else?  </p><p>BALBONI:  Right.  Very true, yes, absolutely.  They can have the budgets  from the I.T. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  But now, what happens to a government computer, I mean, and it  goes all the way to the White House and they say, well, you know,  technically, this is just like a phishing expedition quite literally where  they plant a virus-plagued mail and it disrupts the computer.  Well, they  planted a virus mail and it disrupted a computer.  End of story.  </p><p>BALBONI:  Well, the problem with any of the governmental structures that --  the I.T. structures is that it all relies on one component -- the same  component.  And that is a human element. </p><p>And oftentimes, what happens, even though we assume that everybody from the  folks in the White House on down to the Department of Defense, to any other  of the governmental agencies, everybody knows what they're doing when it  comes to e-mail and how to deal with the computer systems. </p><p>What we're really finding out is they don't know as much as they should.   And so every opportunity that the hackers can have to find somebody that  they can infiltrate and get them to open up one of these e-mails and  download a malicious payload is all you need to -- to prevent and to start  an attack.  And preventing it is really difficult.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Michael, why are the Chinese so blatant about it?  I mean,  they're -- in a thousand U.S. corporation instances, to say nothing of  repeated government attacks, it's as if they set up shop at a Starbucks and  are doing it in broad daylight.  And they're not even denying it. </p><p>They say, oh, what do we do about that? </p><p>BALBONI:  Well, look, the Chinese government has been very open about the  fact that they hire young students.  They train them to do hacking.  They  train them to go into the computer systems and decide how the United States  and the rest of the world does their cyber business, go in and get that  information and take it for their own use...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, where do you see this going, Michael?  How far does this go?   What do you see happening? </p><p>BALBONI:  And actually -- and actually, the information I've received about  some of the bank attacks -- the recent bank attacks is that there's a more  disturbing evolution here.  And that is that it's not just the attack where  you go after a Web site, and you try to take down the Web site through a  denial service attack. </p><p>You basically wall it off, or you try to insert some malicious code there.   But they're actually going after the domain names, in other words, the  infrastructure of cyber security world.  </p><p>And what's so disturbing about that is that now, you can take the  information.  And yes, you could stop it.  But you could also distort it.  </p><p>And that now, when you have a consumer-based cyber security or cyber  network, where you do all your cyber business, what do you do if you say,  you get onto your bank account and now, everything's gone.  What happens if  we lose confidence in our cyber system in this nation?  That's an economic  ruin.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, well-pointed out, Michael.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Meanwhile, ignore all the polls.  Focus instead on how many might be going  to the polls.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Halftime, are Democrats the ones who are going to get throttled?   Now, you don't see that certainly in most polls.  But you do see it in the  number of Democrats who, so far, aren't planning to go to those polls,  because compared to this time in 2008, not a whole lot of jazzed Democrats  in 2012, at least not nearly as many, in Ohio, 490,000 -- fewer folks  registered compared to four years ago. </p><p>And 44 percent of them in Cleveland and surrounding Cuyahoga County where  Democrats are a two to one advantage over Republicans.  Another survey --  this one by a left-leaning think tank, Third Way, shows similar Democrat  voter registration declines in Florida, Iowa and New Hampshire.  </p><p>And that is not to say, the president still doesn't lead in polls in these  states and might win big of these states -- just the Democrats' tepid get- out the vote campaign might not translate into victories in these states,  not if their own troops don't even bother showing up. </p><p>And if passion is a factor, is the president a possible loser in swing  states where he, right now, looks like a winner?  Hard to say, this much is  not.  If the key to victory is jazzing your base, the president is not.  </p><p>And that's not to say that Mitt Romney has.  But by comparison, the number  of Republican registered voters is about the same, if not slightly hire  than in 2008. </p><p>Who knows what any of this means?  And who knows whether all these  registered voters surveys failed to appreciate the influence of just plain  old independents who presently align themselves with neither Party.  </p><p>Let's just say, for the president and for Democrats, a sign they should  hold off on that Party.  So our question tonight is this -- if so many  Democrats aren't coming back, who says Mitt Romney really is that far back? </p><p>GOP Strategist, Cheri -- Cheri, I think I know what you're going to say.   But what do you say?   </p><p>CHERI JACOBUS, PRESIDENT, CAPITOL STRATEGIES:  Well, I do think there are  some problems with the polling.  A lot of people are looking at the 2008  models, Neil.  And that's not the way to go.  Obama voters and Democrats  were very energized in 2008. And they're not now.  So a lot of people talk  about registered voters, as if they're all going to the poll.  And you have  to look at likely voters. </p><p>And even then, I think we have some problems.  In 2010, pollsters were way  off.  They really could not have predicted that Republicans would have  picked up a net of 63 House seats and six in the Senate.  It was kind of a  surprise.  And we even saw this in '94.  I don't think Newt Gingrich really  expected to be speaker in '94.  It was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  No, no, no, there is historic precedent to divide (ph) kind of  getting it wrong.  I don't know -- well, it's a Machiavelli in plan, I  doubt that.  But I will say this -- that in some states, and it's still  early, as you remind me, it is beyond the margin for sampling error.  By  that, I mean...</p><p>JACOBUS:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...if -- if Barack Obama is up eight to 10 points, even allowing  for whatever statistical bias you see, Mitt Romney should be worried,  right? </p><p>JACOBUS:  Well, he should be worried.  But again, it doesn't make sense.   Nationally, you've got this race statistically tied, Romney just a couple  of points down. </p><p>And you see that in poll after poll.  And now, you're looking at these  battleground states where we're hearing, you know, Obama is so far ahead.   It doesn't make sense, Neil, because those battleground states are probably  about 25 or 20 percent of the entire votes. </p><p>So there's something off right there.  And I think that you have to look at  maybe the 2010 models.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>JACOBUS:  Again, it was an unexpected victory...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  And if you did that, Cheri, if you did that -- by the way, the  counter to that argument would be in core states that are safe, Republican  states, Texas comes to mind, some southern state Mitt Romney enjoys  significant leads.  </p><p>Is this typically the case where core states to each -- each candidate go  their way?  But having said that, do you think that there is room for a  wide swing within those swing states?  And if so, how significant would it  be?  Normally, the closer we get to the election, the less likely that is,  although in 1980, it happened.  But what do you see happening? </p><p>JACOBUS:  Yes, well, look, you've got a president who's only got a 47  percent approval rating.  If you are under 50 percent, and you're the  incumbent and it's October, you've got big, big problems.  So the case has  been made for this -- for that why this president should be hired.  The  problem now is Romney has to make the case why he should be hired.  But he  has picked up in the past week or so with independence.  So that's very  good news for the Romney campaign. </p><p>So I think when you see these battleground states with the number so far --  with the margins so -- the distance between the two candidates so large, I  -- I think that it's unlikely that it can be that stark in those states.   So the numbers have to be off.  It was seen that even in battleground  states, even if there's some urban areas that tend to favor the Democrat,  you have to look at likely voters -- the voters who are going to turn out. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes. </p><p>JACOBUS:  And again, Neil, if I'm a campaign -- seems to be relying just on  getting voters angry, almost to the point of hatred.  And you've got to  keep them riled until election day and still get them out on election day - - very different from 2008 when it was very positive -- all hope, all  change are very uplifting. </p><p>So that's a real challenge for the Democrats, for the Obama campaign to get  those voters riled up again where they were almost euphoric in 2008.  And  now, they have to be so angry. That's -- that's a tough job. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  You want them registered at least.  You want them out there  set to vote.  Cheri, thank you very much.  Cheri Jacobus...</p><p>JACOBUS:  Thank you. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...in Washington.  </p><p>Well, Bill may sell the man.  I want you to meet the Republican and the  Democrat, who actually do the math.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  Now, people ask me all the time, how we got four surplus budgets  in a row.  What new ideas did we bring to Washington?  I always give a one- word answer -- arithmetic.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, we interrupt this political shouting for something that's  exploding -- our debt.  Ross Perot wasn't the only one coming back in a  page one set in USA today, in fact, to say it's going to crush us.  Two  season of Washington veterans, Democrat and a Republican say, this keeps  up.  </p><p>Ross is actually understating it.  We all go down.  Here to spell it out,  and the options we still have before time is up, former Georgia Democratic  Senator Sam Nunn, and former Utah Republican Senator, Bob Bennett.</p><p>Welcome, gentleman, and an honor having both of you. </p><p>Senator Nunn, do you first, of course, long ago, you were reminding people  of the dangers of this accumulating debt.  But it's still accumulating.   And I'm wondering if in this election year, it's an issue they're even  bothering to address.  If you had your druthers in this upcoming debate,  what would your words be to both candidates? </p><p>SAM NUNN, FMR. SENATOR, (D) GEORGIA:  Well, I would like for them to use  common sense and honest arithmetic.  And I'd like to see the candidates  explain to the American people that we really do have a serious problem.  </p><p>And all parts of the budget have to come under scrutiny.  We have to play  with a whole deck of cards. </p><p>But we particularly have to discuss, frankly, with the  American people, that the entitlement programs simply cannot maintain the  same trajectory.  We're not going to cut people's Social Security or cut  people's Medicare. </p><p>But we have to bend the coastline downward.  Otherwise, we will simply not  be able to sustain the programs that we have, and our country, with a  fragile economic recovery, and a global environment that's very fragile,  will be in deep difficulty.  </p><p>No one can predict how long the bond markets will support American debt.   But we're borrowing 40 cents, approximately out of every dollar that we  spend today.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it will keep doing so as long as Ben Bernanke keeps this  thing going again. </p><p>But Senator Bennett, I always think, and I know we've chatted about this  before, sir, that -- that we live in an environment, where each party is  captive to the extreme elements that don't want to budge and not even these  varied -- either those extreme elements.  </p><p>Well, on the Democratic side, to Senator Nunn's point, that if you're  trying to rein in the growth of entitlements, you're overthrowing grandma  off the cliff on your side.</p><p>And you experienced this first-hand, Senator, if you're trying to address,  you know, closing loopholes and credits and allowances that allow some, to  not pay the taxes at all, you're raising taxes so tea partiers hate you.   So you can't move the ball forward, when that's how we're playing the game,  can you?</p><p>BOB BENNETT, FMR. SENATOR, (R) UTAH:  Well, there needs to be some honesty  here.  And Sam Nunn has got it exactly right.  The challenge with  entitlements, frankly, is not because of anything that Republicans have  done, not because of anything the Democrats have done. </p><p>It's because of changing demographics in the country.  And demographic  trends are the most difficult trends to change.  And they've been coming at  us for years.  And we've known this is coming for years.  And we keep  putting it off, saying, well, I'll just demagogue the issue in this  election. </p><p>And then, we'll deal with it later on.  Well, you can't do that.  The baby  boomer started retiring, started swelling the ranks, demographically of the  people drawing entitlements in just a year -- 2008.  So just as we have the  problem that hit with us with the financial collapse that occurred in  September of 2008, we saw the increases demands going up simply because...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes. </p><p>BENNETT:  ...we are an aging nation.  Now...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  But you know, you explain that very clearly.  I mean, you could be  left or right and understand that that's an escapable truth.  We're getting  older, a lot more of a big crush of people, such at the same time, getting  older, too.  The -- the dynamics don't support what we've got right now. </p><p>But Senator Nunn, I'll address this in a Democratic perspective than a  Republican perspective, the idea is you even try to slow that momentum in  spending, and address that growth in population.  You -- you are torpedoing  benefits that are sacrosanct.  </p><p>How do you get people around the notion you're trying to save those  benefits or they're gone?</p><p>NUNN:  Well, I don't think a torpedo should apply when you're treading a  line that continues to grow up.  You're just not making the trajectory as  sharp. </p><p>We have to tell younger people, frankly, you're going to have to save more  money because by the time you retire, the age of retirement may go up  somewhat.  That happens over a long period of time.  And we may have to say  on cost to living type adjustments over a long period of time...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Easy solutions, never offered -- never ever offered...</p><p>NUNN:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...never accepted by enough to get that ball moving forward.  </p><p>NUNN:  Well, they've been offered -- they've been offered on the floor of  the Senate, even when I was there, several times a week...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you're actually right about that. </p><p>NUNN:  We never had a majority vote for them.  You're right about that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Senators...</p><p>BENNETT:   I wrote -- I wrote a bill...</p><p>NUNN:  People never understood the problem.  People have to understand it.   When they do, the American people, I'm confident, will support...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, no, I think you're right.  I think you're right.  But Senator  Bennett, it's getting past that hurdle, right, to get the word out to them.  </p><p>BENNETT:  Yes, well, I -- I wrote a bill that was -- that did exactly the  things that Senator Nunn is talking about.  And it was scored by the  administrators, the board of trustees, if that's the proper term of the  Social Security administration, as a 100 percent fix of Social Security  that would -- would make Social Security safe in perpetuity.  </p><p>And I took it to the Republican leader and said, this is what we ought to  be doing.  And he said, Bob, that'll be the Republican position.  And we'll  get behind it as soon as you get your first Democratic cosponsor.  And so I  walked across the aisle and sat down with some of my Democratic friends and  laid it out.  And they said, you know, this is great.  This is -- this will  solve the problem.  </p><p>And we'll get behind it.  We'll join you right after the election.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.</p><p>BENNETT:  Well, you know, there we were.  One point I really want to make,  that Washington's the only place I know where, when you give somebody more  this year than you gave them last year, that's called a cut.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a very good point.  And it's a point I want to pick up on.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENNETT:  Because you're giving them less than they were promised.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Less than what they were expecting.  I'm going to swirl (ph) it a  little bit because that is something that we get wrong in the media, this  idea of cuts, when you're actually talking about slowing the growth of  something, to Senator Nunn's point, about making sure that line doesn't go  up as much as it presently is.  </p><p>The debate over -- the very words we use in this debate after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Fair and balanced -- we've got former Senator Bob Bennett, former  Senator Sam Nunn, debating what we do now on -- on the debt.  And you're  quite right, gentlemen.  Normally, this stuff comes up in detail in bravery  (ph) after an election.  </p><p>But Senator Nunn, do you -- if Barack Obama is reelected, the argument is,  right now, we're hearing a lot of Democrats -- not all are already planning  spending initiatives of their own.  In other words, to keep the spigots  spigotting, nothing changes.  </p><p>Republicans, conversely if Mitt Romney were to win, are planning a lot of  more military and the like spending.  How do we disavow each side of its  knee-jerk inclination to spend on industry's favored to its Party? </p><p>Senator Nunn, to you first. </p><p>NUNN:  Well, I thought, hope that the debate will produce some more honest  dialogue.  And then right after the election, whoever is elected, whether  it's President Obama or Mitt Romney, we face the fiscal cliff in January.   And almost all economists left or right or center, say that that would  cause a high-risk of another recession, a deep recession. </p><p>So what I would like to see instead of the fiscal cliff that we face, and  instead of kicking that can down the road six months, why don't we change  cans?  Why don't we use Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin or some legislative  combination of those, substitute it for the cliff and say, OK, you've got  six months. </p><p>You can overturn it.  You may not like it.  But it's a lot better than what  we face right now.  So why not substitute a logical and sane default  position for what we have facing us now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Senator Bennett, what in your gut, do you think, they will do?  I  mean, regardless who wins in November, the prevailing wisdom is they either  delay these cuts, try to screw around with sequestration so that the cuts  are put off a little bit or all the Bush rates don't expire immediately --  a glorified way of kicking the can down the road.   What do you think will happen? </p><p>BENNETT:  Well, I think the suggestion that Senator Nunn has just made is  exactly the right thing we ought to do -- we ought to see them do.  I do  not see sequestration, a fiscal cliff.</p><p>I see Congress blinking very big time and saying, well, let's delay this.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We've got a lame duck session that decides that? </p><p>BENNETT:  No, no, I think...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Really? </p><p>BENNETT:  ...maybe they'll do it in the lame duck.  They come back on the  third of January, do it quickly well or just put it off a little while  while we talk about it because no one wants to be responsible for their  consequences that would come if they did nothing.  </p><p>So the instinct is well, let's just put it off a little while, while we  talk about it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, well, we've done that forever.  </p><p>BENNETT:  Let's not...</p><p>CAVUTO:  But Senator Nunn, to that point...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENNETT:  ...that's not a solution.  That's not a solution. </p><p>CAVUTO:  I agree with you.  </p><p>BENNETT:  That's not a solution. </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Senator Nunn, to that point, if we end up doing something like  that, are we reinforcing the credit ratings agencies' desire to downgrade  us, that that's the stuff of Banana Republic's and that (ph) now, there's  going to be hell to pay for doing it.  </p><p>NUNN:  Well, I think Bob is basically correct.  Yes, it's - it's an issue  of rating agency.  But the fundamental issue is a moral issue and a  generational issue.  And beyond the numbers, we can deal with the numbers - - all sorts of people on both sides that can work this thing out.  </p><p>But the real signal to the markets and to the world and our own country is  that this government cannot function.  That's a more dangerous signal than  even the numbers.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think, Senator Bennett, that if we don't make a move and  soon, the message to the markets will be, sell-off like crazy? </p><p>BENNETT:  The one thing that disturbs markets more than anything else is  uncertainty.  And Sam has just described the biggest uncertainty of all,  which is will the U.S. government be able to function?  There are...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, let me keep -- we're going to go a little longer if we...</p><p>BENNETT:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ... I want to hear what you're saying, that if we -- if we don't  act immediately, what you're saying, Senator Bennett, is that you can't  keep pulling this stunt, that -- that this time, there would be hell to pay  for that? </p><p>BENNETT:  Well, I think, GDP growth would continue to be sluggish, if  indeed, not tip over into another recession, just because, as has been  pointed out in previous versions of this, there are trillions of dollars  waiting on the sidelines for some sense of certainty...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>BENNETT:  ...to come into the economy and investment.  And if the federal  government can't get its act together...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  If they get -- if they get their act together and respond...</p><p>BENNETT:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...that...</p><p>BENNETT:  That money won't come in. </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm sorry.  Senator Nunn, sorry, pressed for time here.  I just  want to make be clear on something.  And do you think then that there would  be a collapse or would these sequestration cuts just cuts off the growth of  spending in the military and all these others, over 10 years no less.  Are  they really that draconian, that there would be that kind of a hell to pay?</p><p>NUNN:  Well, to change all our previous habits but it's not draconian.  We  make modest changes now or everyday or month or a year.  We wait.  The  changes have to be more dramatic.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  No, I understand.  But these sequestration cuts that everyone all  but calls doomsday -- are they really that doomsday? </p><p>NUNN:  Well, it's a huge increase in taxes.  And it's a very large cut of  expenditures.  All at once, it's not...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All at once, yes. </p><p>NUNN:  All at once.  This is sudden and it's in a fragile economy.  So no  one knows precisely what's going to happen.  But you know, I think we're  right in the middle of Winston Churchill's prophecy where he said that  America will always do the right thing after its tried every other  alternative. </p><p>We don't know how long we're going to have to get through with the  alternatives and do the right thing.  No one can predict that. </p><p>The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable.  And it happens  as we've seen in Europe very rapidly. </p><p>CAVUTO:  A very good point.  The markets are comfortable until they're not  comfortable.  That is a very good point.  </p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both very, very much. </p><p>NUNN:  Thank you, Neil.  Thank you, Bob. </p><p>BENNETT:  You bet. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Progress is possible, folks.  More after this.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, now, it is going to get busy -- very, very busy.  The first  big debate in Denver, coming up on Wednesday night.  We're there.  A little  more than a week after that, the vice presidential debate, then we've got  yet another presidential debate wrapping things up with the final Obama- Romney clash.  </p><p>We're on each and every single one because it's your money.  It's your  life.  And we mean it when we say it.  We like to travel and we like to  look out for you.  Watch us. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome, everybody. I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And never mind, we haven't even gotten to the first debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some Democrats are already laying out their spending plans for a second Obama term's first day. Vermont Democratic Congressman Peter Welch wants to get back to an energy policy that acknowledges the climate change is real. For now, he is leaving out the price tag to address it, which Republicans predict will be unreal. California Democrat Mike Honda wants to refocus on health care to expand on increasingly cost days and state days insurance exchanges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arizona's Raul Grijalva favors a conservative push on immigration reform. Still, others interpret any Obama win as a referendum for more stimulus out of the middle-class, good or bad, depending on your political point of view. More taxes are on the rich to help pay for regardless of your point of view.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So get ready for it. They are already licking their financial chops planning for it. Never mind, you haven't even cast your vote.</p><p>It seems a lot of politicians are already grabbing for your wallet. Not much talk about getting this debt under control -- lots of talk, though, about, as we say, getting the very spending that helped get it out of debt and into debt out of control, an issue now that worries two former titans of the Senate, Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican Bob Bennett, thereby partisan red (ph) is coming up first to some worry post-election watchers right now.</p><p>Fox NewsDigital Political Editor, Chris Stirewalt and townhall.com's Katie Pavlich.</p><p>Chris, what are we to make about sort of these plans for a second <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>-- might not come to pass, but they're getting their spending priorities in order.</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, DIGITAL POLITICAL EDITOR, FOX NEWS: Well, look, Neil, the -- the thing that the president is very clearly doing in this reelection campaign is being very vague. And while Democrats accuse <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>of being vague, the president has intentionally talked only in general about the need for infrastructure and other stimulus kind of spending and the need for what he says will be a tax increase on top earners to pay for it.</p><p>But when you get down to specifics, you don't need -- you don't hear very much about what it would be. Part of the reason for that is that the president knows that there are a lot of people with their hands out.</p><p>There are a lot of people with ideas for how that money ought to be spent. And one concern that he has aside from frightening moderate voters with more spending is creating this line up at the trough for lawmakers from his own Party that would be looking for the second term to be even more lavish than the first.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you think that will be the case, Katie?</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM: I think it could be. But based on, you know, what these Democrats have already lined up in terms of what they want for a second Obama term, it does seem a little bit out of touch because as we know, more spending when you're spending outside of your means -- we have $16 trillion in debt -- just means the expansion of government.</p><p>And poll after poll shows that the American people and American voters are concerned about how big the federal government has been getting. And I hear a lot of repeats in what they're asking for.</p><p>President Obama may not be, you know, implementing an environmental policy that's directly geared toward climate change, but you look at the EPA's policies under President Obama. And they're geared towards addressing climate change in terms of regulations on coal mines.</p><p>And in terms of immigration reform, we've seen President Obama work on the dream act. And we just saw his executive order that was very similar to that piece of legislation.</p><p>So it's kind of a repeat of what we've already seen and I would say a little bit out of touch with what people are concerned about right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: I wonder, Chris, if it's part of this -- the perceived victor's already claiming these polls. I suppose if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>were the runaway favorite right now and you're in the defense establishment, you are seizing on keeping open those facilities and military contracts or jobs that could be imperiled as a result of even automatic sequestration.</p><p>So are we just seeing something we always see, just more obvious now or what?</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, I certainly think there is truth in that. And on the Republican side, Neil, what you'd expect right now would be a lot of calls for Romney to move right and position himself so that there would be cuts and that there would be things like that.</p><p>You might hear social issues crop up. But I think for the president, what this is -- we saw a poll today that was conducted for the Hill that said that 87 percent of Democrats are confident that the president's going to win.</p><p>And certainly, it is not helpful to the president's chances of winning for Democrats to be talking about new spending now at a time when people are very concerned about debt and deficit. But as these folks continue to believe that their man is going to carry the day on November 6, they probably want to get in line first.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just wondering, if there's always the risk when word lot (ph) of this leaks out, that they look like they're, you know, decorating the office before they're guaranteed they're going to have it, Katie. Now, if you're Barack Obama, you already have it.</p><p>So what's to stop you from saying, I might look at that new rug or what have you. But you know what I mean. There does seem to be a sense that -- that, you know, that they are planning for a victory that might not happen.</p><p>And if this gets out, then it could strike a lot of voters as, at the very least, arrogant.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, I think, too, that they're forgetting that President Obama isn't the only piece of the puzzle. You still have a Republican House which Republicans look like they're going to hold onto the House.</p><p>And if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>loses, well, let Paul Ryan is still going to be the budget chairman. And so Democrats can line up all these big spending initiatives if they want to.</p><p>But the fact is that the House is still going to be majority Republicans. If Republicans don't take back the Senate, it's going to be the same situation that we've had for the past two years.</p><p>And I would say, if they're going to go as far as trying to, as you say, decorate the office before they have it, well, we might see another turnaround election in the year 2014, like we did in 2010, if they continue to push this big spending, big government ideas going forward.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Wait a minute, you're not giving up on -- you're not giving up on 2012. It almost sounded like you were there.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, I'm just simply saying, if they're going to go decorating the office, see (ph).</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. Guys, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>PAVLICH: Thank you.</p><p>STIREWALT: You got it.</p><p>CAVUTO: And well, don't look now, but he is back. Remember Ross and his charts 20 years later, back with a vengeance, and now, a new warning -- so deep in debt. Ross Perot fears we're easy baked (ph) to be taken down.</p><p>A former Clinton Press Secretary, Debate Commission Co-Chair, Mike McCurry on those warnings from a guy who two decades ago almost up-ended the presidential race.</p><p>Michael, very good to have you.</p><p>MICHAEL MCCURRY, FMR. CLINTON PRESS SECRETARY: Good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: I remember Mikey and his charts -- I remember Bill Clinton responding to that, addressing that. And many will argue, it was your boss who did address some of those same debt issues that Perot claimed fame for.</p><p>But Perot is back saying, both Parties have let him down. I think he goes on to say that he doesn't like other guy and that both Parties have essentially risked throwing the country down the drain. Is that resonating?</p><p>MCCURRY: Well, I think that's classically Ross Perot. And I think, you know, that would be an attitude you expect him to have. But look, there is an opportunity with these debates on Wednesday night to get to some of the specifics that, you know, some of your commentators say are missing.</p><p>We're hoping that the format we have for these debates will get back beyond some of these slogans and the traditional talking points we're hearing from some of the candidates and get into a more substantive discussion. We're designing it that way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Are they allowed charts, Mike? They can't bring charts like Ross Perot, right? So they have to tell it.</p><p>MCCURRY: It's a good question. The two campaigns have been in discussions with each other. The commission kinds of take a hands-off view...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I see.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...of that. I don't know if they've got an agreement on that. But we've seen both Governor Romney and President Obama use charts from time to time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>MCCURRY: So we'll tune in and we'll see what happens.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, one of the things that I remember about the debates in '92 with Bill Clinton and others who have sort of mastered this as trying to get a complicated stuff across easily, particularly (ph), Ronald Reagan had this knack as well on the Republican side, to take complicated material and synthesize it for the people.</p><p>I mean, in this case, it would be a lot more money going out than is coming in. So I think to your old boss's credit, he would say, we have to address both Republicans, he'd been saying, now just to address all that money that's going out, address spending.</p><p>But how do you encapsulate that in a one-minute or 90-second rebuttal response to a point on spending?</p><p>MCCURRY: Well, that's the point. You really can't. So that's why we have redesigned the format of these debates so that there will be 15-minute chunks. And the candidates have to address the topic.</p><p>Now, Jim Lehrer, who will be moderating...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...the debate on Wednesday night has already said, the first three subjects will be the economy, the economy, the economy. And then the fourth subject will be health care -- obviously, Medicare, financing, and health care financing, a big issue. And then to what your panelists were just talking about, the fifth topic will be the role of government.</p><p>And I think this goes, if you want to, you know, think about how to simplify the debate a little bit, one of my other old bosses, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said, look, the quintessential question for the American people is how much government do we really want?</p><p>And how much are we really willing to pay for? That's a pretty simple set of questions. And that's really the heart of the debate they're going to have.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But I think you're right. I think that's what every election -- if you think about, it comes down -- unless you're in the middle of a crisis, but to that point, Mike, when you say, the 15 minutes, you address these in chunks, they are still timed on answers to each question.</p><p>So can -- can they go at each other, you know, unencumbered by a moderator or, you know, something that gets in the way of them getting at each other?</p><p>MCCURRY: Absolutely. I mean, the only ground rule is that there will be a question posed in each -- at the beginning of each segment to each candidate. And they get about two minutes to go, you know, to lay out what they have to say on an issue like the deficit, like infrastructure...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...like the economy. And then -- then they really are going to be asked by the moderator, I'm sure, to sort of let's flush this out a little bit. Let's talk about it.</p><p>There is some -- we need some more specifics here. And we'll see how both candidates respond.</p><p>Now, I have to make clear, it's not up to our commission to decide how that conversation...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCCURRY: ...is structured. It'll really be up to the moderator, Jim Lehrer. But you know, knowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But would the moderator going to have to say you didn't answer that question or you didn't give me a specific answer or after one or two tries, does he say, well, this is going nowhere fast. I'm onto...</p><p>MCCURRY: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...the next thing.</p><p>MCCURRY: I'll say this. If you just -- if you only walk into that debate with a lot of zingers or one-liners or sound bytes, you're not going to be able to fill up the, you know, the chunk of time that's going to be around that -- that debate. So I think it'll be -- I'm hoping it'll be an opportunity for both Governor Romney and President Obama to really have a textured conversation about this.</p><p>And then more importantly, to get to those philosophical differences that clearly they have on what the role of government should be.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm looking forward to it. Mike, thank you very much. Good seeing you.</p><p>MCCURRY: Nice seeing you. Good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, by the way, we will be out live, 8:00 p.m until midnight this Wednesday for that Denver opening debate. And we'll be covering back (ph) all the debates right here on Fox Business.</p><p>Meanwhile, get ready for the October surprise, only it might be a number, not a blunder. I'm going to explain. There is a difference. But it could be China that turns the election around by taking our economy down. And it would take only a few guys to do it. and the old-timer says Washington is running out of time. Former Senators Bob Bennett and Sam Nunn are having none of it.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's October 1st. Do you know where your election surprise is? To hear political pundits tell it, you can count on it -- the gap or crisis that will tip the selection one way or the other.</p><p>But what if it's not a misstep that does it but just a boring old economic number that ultimately decides it? Todd Schoenberger and Sandra Smith on the data that could pull a doozy at the polls.</p><p>Todd, it could be any host of data, right?</p><p>TODD SCHOENBERGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LANDCOLT TRADING: That's right. I mean, we've just had the GDP -- the report card on the U.S. economy, came in very low. We have the upcoming jobs report.</p><p>There are a couple of, clearly some time bombs there, that -- that can actually sway. It could be a game changer for the election. I personally think it's going to be higher oil prices.</p><p>I think this Middle East uprising is going to boil over. And if that's the case, you're going to see higher prices at the pump.</p><p>And as you know, Neil, voters vote with what's in their wallets. So if you take some cash out of those wallets, it could sway the election.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sandra, I always tend to think that things are kind of baked (ph) to do a cake when it comes to the economic numbers, that unless they're so awful or even so great that their way out of what was expected, it's -- it's not going to move the needle much.</p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, but...</p><p>CAVUTO: What is the expectation for -- for something approaching that?</p><p>SMITH: Well, the two big jobs reports that we have from -- between now and the election, I mean, we saw last month a dismal jobs growth of 96,000 jobs. And Neil, we have another jobs report on Friday.</p><p>If we see anything above eight percent unemployment, which we're still there now, we've been hovering around that level -- if we see a jump in that unemployment, if we see another dismal jobs growth number, these markets are going to react.</p><p>And let me tell you something, Neil, when you look at the stock market and people go home and look at their 401ks here as we enter into this...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes.</p><p>SMITH: ...last quarter of the year, Neil, if we see a 10, 15 percent drop in the stock market, yet voters will react. And traders on the floor are warning that investors have become so complacent. The VIX is down 63 percent over the past year.</p><p>The stock market's up 15 percent this year. Between now and election day, we could see a significant sell-off in this market.</p><p>Voters will indeed react to that.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Todd, to Sandra's point, for now, a lot of them are looking at those statements and seeing that double-digit run-up depending on statement, depending on the 401(k), and they like what they see. And they might like what anecdotally they're getting out of sights at zillow.com and the rest that children (ph) at their homes are no longer at least imploding.</p><p>They're not exactly soaring. But they stopped, you know, tumbling. And is that enough in this environment where we tend to expect so little to help the president?</p><p>SCHOENBERGER: Well, let me tell you something, that's absolutely correct. Sandra's absolutely right. The next 30 to 45 days are absolutely critical. You had the average 401(k) balance in this country.</p><p>It's about a hundred and 7,000. Yes, but S&amp;P -- it's up 14 percent plus year-to-date. If you see those gains evaporate, if they -- they go away because of poor macro headlines, higher oil prices, anything that's going to cut down on earnings, that would actually be the game-changer for voters because what they don't want to see is a brokerage statement and see these -- these numbers just start melting away.</p><p>And if that's the case, they probably will start to change, using their wallets, come election day.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you know, Sandra, when you look at the data and the markets, and if the market's, our forward-looking mechanism and the markets, you know, it could be all over the map and the gyrations read (ph) today is notwithstanding, it is still the president's trend and friend.</p><p>Would an October surprise or like a -- cause pause, in other words, that they would just say, well, wait a minute, but barring that -- that the President dodges a financial bullet?</p><p>SMITH: But one could simply argue that the stock market is -- has been artificially propped up by the Fed's money printing measures...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>SMITH: ...and when the market looks forward, Neil, they look at earnings. And we're about to get the latest report on quarterly earnings.</p><p>And UBS just put out a very dramatic note, saying that they believe that we are going to enter earnings recession, meaning two straight quarters of negative earnings growth. Those are the fundamentals that should be driving the stock market.</p><p>We're still sort of in this euphoria period after quantitative easing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p>SMITH: ...three by the Fed, to stimulate the market. What happens when we get those negative earnings report so for the next month or so?</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, real quickly, Todd, and then go over here a little bit, but I remember, 1980, there was a sounding (ph) point during that weekend before, when a lot of people just said, to hell with it. They had seen Ronald Reagan in the debate with Jimmy Carter, liked the idea that they could switch horses at that stage.</p><p>Even though they weren't sure then, he seemed to comfort himself well. They were ready to do it. They just tired of everything and needed a reason to just say, we're done. This guy's out.</p><p>Are we approaching anything like that now where -- where whatever...</p><p>SCHOENBERGER: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...we're seeing it boil (ph) now, could reverse dramatically?</p><p>SCHOENBERGER: Yes, because if you remember that time, American pride was even -- was down the tubes. I mean, the misery index was super high, as it is now, Neil. You know, we -- we actually get accustomed to seeing some of the -- you know, the new products from, say, in Apple.</p><p>And we start thinking, oh, everything's great. And then you hear from the politicians and you hear everything's in recovery mode. But it's simply not the case.</p><p>Main Street does not buy it. And if sentiment if poor, the jobs picture continues to be weak, then yes, then leading up to this election, you have 30-plus days left, Neil.</p><p>If people are not feeling well going into the election poll, going into the polls, that Tuesday, it's going to be pretty for -- for the incumbent.</p><p>CAVUTO: We shall see. Guys, thank you very, very much.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, how is this for an October surprise -- a hack attack that could be a huge setback for the entire economy -- the guy who says that he's closer than you think?</p><p>CAVUTO: A red alert at the White House. We are learning that Chinese hackers breached a computer at the White House's military office. Now, the White House is saying no -- no harm was done.</p><p>But this is just the latest hack attack -- cyber crooks just hitting several major U.S. banks. So Homeland Security Adviser, Michael who says this is a bigger economic threat than the military one it would obviously pose. Explain what you mean by that?</p><p>MICHAEL BALBONI, FMR. HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: We, in a society, we do everything now digitally. And when you think about the -- the past, I mean, even companies like eHarmony, with those breaches, more and more what the attacks have been about is not only taking information but distorting it as well.</p><p>And the recent attacks against the banks just point out that this is the evolution. You know, Congress has been wrestling with this for the last couple of years.</p><p>And they cannot get out of their own way to say, how do we set a standard, how do we get information shared about these attacks? And how do we make American businesses and society more resilient and less vulnerable to these types of attacks?</p><p>CAVUTO: But they keep happening, right? I figure, you know, it happens that, you know, a mid-sized company -- even one of these large companies, it worries whether it happens to a big tech company because then I'd say, well, you're tech if you can't figure it out then for god's sake, how can anyone else?</p><p>BALBONI: Right. Very true, yes, absolutely. They can have the budgets from the I.T.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But now, what happens to a government computer, I mean, and it goes all the way to the White House and they say, well, you know, technically, this is just like a phishing expedition quite literally where they plant a virus-plagued mail and it disrupts the computer. Well, they planted a virus mail and it disrupted a computer. End of story.</p><p>BALBONI: Well, the problem with any of the governmental structures that -- the I.T. structures is that it all relies on one component -- the same component. And that is a human element.</p><p>And oftentimes, what happens, even though we assume that everybody from the folks in the White House on down to the Department of Defense, to any other of the governmental agencies, everybody knows what they're doing when it comes to e-mail and how to deal with the computer systems.</p><p>What we're really finding out is they don't know as much as they should. And so every opportunity that the hackers can have to find somebody that they can infiltrate and get them to open up one of these e-mails and download a malicious payload is all you need to -- to prevent and to start an attack. And preventing it is really difficult.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Michael, why are the Chinese so blatant about it? I mean, they're -- in a thousand U.S. corporation instances, to say nothing of repeated government attacks, it's as if they set up shop at a Starbucks and are doing it in broad daylight. And they're not even denying it.</p><p>They say, oh, what do we do about that?</p><p>BALBONI: Well, look, the Chinese government has been very open about the fact that they hire young students. They train them to do hacking. They train them to go into the computer systems and decide how the United States and the rest of the world does their cyber business, go in and get that information and take it for their own use...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, where do you see this going, Michael? How far does this go? What do you see happening?</p><p>BALBONI: And actually -- and actually, the information I've received about some of the bank attacks -- the recent bank attacks is that there's a more disturbing evolution here. And that is that it's not just the attack where you go after a Web site, and you try to take down the Web site through a denial service attack.</p><p>You basically wall it off, or you try to insert some malicious code there. But they're actually going after the domain names, in other words, the infrastructure of cyber security world.</p><p>And what's so disturbing about that is that now, you can take the information. And yes, you could stop it. But you could also distort it.</p><p>And that now, when you have a consumer-based cyber security or cyber network, where you do all your cyber business, what do you do if you say, you get onto your bank account and now, everything's gone. What happens if we lose confidence in our cyber system in this nation? That's an economic ruin.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, well-pointed out, Michael. Thank you very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, ignore all the polls. Focus instead on how many might be going to the polls.</p><p>CAVUTO: Halftime, are Democrats the ones who are going to get throttled? Now, you don't see that certainly in most polls. But you do see it in the number of Democrats who, so far, aren't planning to go to those polls, because compared to this time in 2008, not a whole lot of jazzed Democrats in 2012, at least not nearly as many, in Ohio, 490,000 -- fewer folks registered compared to four years ago.</p><p>And 44 percent of them in Cleveland and surrounding Cuyahoga County where Democrats are a two to one advantage over Republicans. Another survey -- this one by a left-leaning think tank, Third Way, shows similar Democrat voter registration declines in Florida, Iowa and New Hampshire.</p><p>And that is not to say, the president still doesn't lead in polls in these states and might win big of these states -- just the Democrats' tepid get- out the vote campaign might not translate into victories in these states, not if their own troops don't even bother showing up.</p><p>And if passion is a factor, is the president a possible loser in swing states where he, right now, looks like a winner? Hard to say, this much is not. If the key to victory is jazzing your base, the president is not.</p><p>And that's not to say that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>has. But by comparison, the number of Republican registered voters is about the same, if not slightly hire than in 2008.</p><p>Who knows what any of this means? And who knows whether all these registered voters surveys failed to appreciate the influence of just plain old independents who presently align themselves with neither Party.</p><p>Let's just say, for the president and for Democrats, a sign they should hold off on that Party. So our question tonight is this -- if so many Democrats aren't coming back, who says <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really is that far back?</p><p>GOP Strategist, Cheri -- Cheri, I think I know what you're going to say. But what do you say?</p><p>CHERI JACOBUS, PRESIDENT, CAPITOL STRATEGIES: Well, I do think there are some problems with the polling. A lot of people are looking at the 2008 models, Neil. And that's not the way to go. Obama voters and Democrats were very energized in 2008. And they're not now. So a lot of people talk about registered voters, as if they're all going to the poll. And you have to look at likely voters.</p><p>And even then, I think we have some problems. In 2010, pollsters were way off. They really could not have predicted that Republicans would have picked up a net of 63 House seats and six in the Senate. It was kind of a surprise. And we even saw this in '94. I don't think Newt Gingrich really expected to be speaker in '94. It was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, no, no, there is historic precedent to divide (ph) kind of getting it wrong. I don't know -- well, it's a Machiavelli in plan, I doubt that. But I will say this -- that in some states, and it's still early, as you remind me, it is beyond the margin for sampling error. By that, I mean...</p><p>JACOBUS: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...if -- if Barack Obama is up eight to 10 points, even allowing for whatever statistical bias you see, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>should be worried, right?</p><p>JACOBUS: Well, he should be worried. But again, it doesn't make sense. Nationally, you've got this race statistically tied, Romney just a couple of points down.</p><p>And you see that in poll after poll. And now, you're looking at these battleground states where we're hearing, you know, Obama is so far ahead. It doesn't make sense, Neil, because those battleground states are probably about 25 or 20 percent of the entire votes.</p><p>So there's something off right there. And I think that you have to look at maybe the 2010 models.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>JACOBUS: Again, it was an unexpected victory...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And if you did that, Cheri, if you did that -- by the way, the counter to that argument would be in core states that are safe, Republican states, Texas comes to mind, some southern state <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>enjoys significant leads.</p><p>Is this typically the case where core states to each -- each candidate go their way? But having said that, do you think that there is room for a wide swing within those swing states? And if so, how significant would it be? Normally, the closer we get to the election, the less likely that is, although in 1980, it happened. But what do you see happening?</p><p>JACOBUS: Yes, well, look, you've got a president who's only got a 47 percent approval rating. If you are under 50 percent, and you're the incumbent and it's October, you've got big, big problems. So the case has been made for this -- for that why this president should be hired. The problem now is Romney has to make the case why he should be hired. But he has picked up in the past week or so with independence. So that's very good news for the Romney campaign.</p><p>So I think when you see these battleground states with the number so far -- with the margins so -- the distance between the two candidates so large, I -- I think that it's unlikely that it can be that stark in those states. So the numbers have to be off. It was seen that even in battleground states, even if there's some urban areas that tend to favor the Democrat, you have to look at likely voters -- the voters who are going to turn out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>JACOBUS: And again, Neil, if I'm a campaign -- seems to be relying just on getting voters angry, almost to the point of hatred. And you've got to keep them riled until election day and still get them out on election day - - very different from 2008 when it was very positive -- all hope, all change are very uplifting.</p><p>So that's a real challenge for the Democrats, for the Obama campaign to get those voters riled up again where they were almost euphoric in 2008. And now, they have to be so angry. That's -- that's a tough job.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. You want them registered at least. You want them out there set to vote. Cheri, thank you very much. Cheri Jacobus...</p><p>JACOBUS: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...in Washington.</p><p>Well, Bill may sell the man. I want you to meet the Republican and the Democrat, who actually do the math.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: Now, people ask me all the time, how we got four surplus budgets in a row. What new ideas did we bring to Washington? I always give a one- word answer -- arithmetic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, we interrupt this political shouting for something that's exploding -- our debt. Ross Perot wasn't the only one coming back in a page one set in USA today, in fact, to say it's going to crush us. Two season of Washington veterans, Democrat and a Republican say, this keeps up.</p><p>Ross is actually understating it. We all go down. Here to spell it out, and the options we still have before time is up, former Georgia Democratic Senator Sam Nunn, and former Utah Republican Senator, Bob Bennett.</p><p>Welcome, gentleman, and an honor having both of you.</p><p>Senator Nunn, do you first, of course, long ago, you were reminding people of the dangers of this accumulating debt. But it's still accumulating. And I'm wondering if in this election year, it's an issue they're even bothering to address. If you had your druthers in this upcoming debate, what would your words be to both candidates?</p><p>SAM NUNN, FMR. SENATOR, (D) GEORGIA: Well, I would like for them to use common sense and honest arithmetic. And I'd like to see the candidates explain to the American people that we really do have a serious problem.</p><p>And all parts of the budget have to come under scrutiny. We have to play with a whole deck of cards.</p><p>But we particularly have to discuss, frankly, with the American people, that the entitlement programs simply cannot maintain the same trajectory. We're not going to cut people's Social Security or cut people's Medicare.</p><p>But we have to bend the coastline downward. Otherwise, we will simply not be able to sustain the programs that we have, and our country, with a fragile economic recovery, and a global environment that's very fragile, will be in deep difficulty.</p><p>No one can predict how long the bond markets will support American debt. But we're borrowing 40 cents, approximately out of every dollar that we spend today.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it will keep doing so as long as Ben Bernanke keeps this thing going again.</p><p>But Senator Bennett, I always think, and I know we've chatted about this before, sir, that -- that we live in an environment, where each party is captive to the extreme elements that don't want to budge and not even these varied -- either those extreme elements.</p><p>Well, on the Democratic side, to Senator Nunn's point, that if you're trying to rein in the growth of entitlements, you're overthrowing grandma off the cliff on your side.</p><p>And you experienced this first-hand, Senator, if you're trying to address, you know, closing loopholes and credits and allowances that allow some, to not pay the taxes at all, you're raising taxes so tea partiers hate you. So you can't move the ball forward, when that's how we're playing the game, can you?</p><p>BOB BENNETT, FMR. SENATOR, (R) UTAH: Well, there needs to be some honesty here. And Sam Nunn has got it exactly right. The challenge with entitlements, frankly, is not because of anything that Republicans have done, not because of anything the Democrats have done.</p><p>It's because of changing demographics in the country. And demographic trends are the most difficult trends to change. And they've been coming at us for years. And we've known this is coming for years. And we keep putting it off, saying, well, I'll just demagogue the issue in this election.</p><p>And then, we'll deal with it later on. Well, you can't do that. The baby boomer started retiring, started swelling the ranks, demographically of the people drawing entitlements in just a year -- 2008. So just as we have the problem that hit with us with the financial collapse that occurred in September of 2008, we saw the increases demands going up simply because...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>BENNETT: ...we are an aging nation. Now...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But you know, you explain that very clearly. I mean, you could be left or right and understand that that's an escapable truth. We're getting older, a lot more of a big crush of people, such at the same time, getting older, too. The -- the dynamics don't support what we've got right now.</p><p>But Senator Nunn, I'll address this in a Democratic perspective than a Republican perspective, the idea is you even try to slow that momentum in spending, and address that growth in population. You -- you are torpedoing benefits that are sacrosanct.</p><p>How do you get people around the notion you're trying to save those benefits or they're gone?</p><p>NUNN: Well, I don't think a torpedo should apply when you're treading a line that continues to grow up. You're just not making the trajectory as sharp.</p><p>We have to tell younger people, frankly, you're going to have to save more money because by the time you retire, the age of retirement may go up somewhat. That happens over a long period of time. And we may have to say on cost to living type adjustments over a long period of time...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Easy solutions, never offered -- never ever offered...</p><p>NUNN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...never accepted by enough to get that ball moving forward.</p><p>NUNN: Well, they've been offered -- they've been offered on the floor of the Senate, even when I was there, several times a week...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're actually right about that.</p><p>NUNN: We never had a majority vote for them. You're right about that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senators...</p><p>BENNETT: I wrote -- I wrote a bill...</p><p>NUNN: People never understood the problem. People have to understand it. When they do, the American people, I'm confident, will support...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, no, I think you're right. I think you're right. But Senator Bennett, it's getting past that hurdle, right, to get the word out to them.</p><p>BENNETT: Yes, well, I -- I wrote a bill that was -- that did exactly the things that Senator Nunn is talking about. And it was scored by the administrators, the board of trustees, if that's the proper term of the Social Security administration, as a 100 percent fix of Social Security that would -- would make Social Security safe in perpetuity.</p><p>And I took it to the Republican leader and said, this is what we ought to be doing. And he said, Bob, that'll be the Republican position. And we'll get behind it as soon as you get your first Democratic cosponsor. And so I walked across the aisle and sat down with some of my Democratic friends and laid it out. And they said, you know, this is great. This is -- this will solve the problem.</p><p>And we'll get behind it. We'll join you right after the election.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>BENNETT: Well, you know, there we were. One point I really want to make, that Washington's the only place I know where, when you give somebody more this year than you gave them last year, that's called a cut.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a very good point. And it's a point I want to pick up on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENNETT: Because you're giving them less than they were promised.</p><p>CAVUTO: Less than what they were expecting. I'm going to swirl (ph) it a little bit because that is something that we get wrong in the media, this idea of cuts, when you're actually talking about slowing the growth of something, to Senator Nunn's point, about making sure that line doesn't go up as much as it presently is.</p><p>The debate over -- the very words we use in this debate after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Fair and balanced -- we've got former Senator Bob Bennett, former Senator Sam Nunn, debating what we do now on -- on the debt. And you're quite right, gentlemen. Normally, this stuff comes up in detail in bravery (ph) after an election.</p><p>But Senator Nunn, do you -- if Barack Obama is reelected, the argument is, right now, we're hearing a lot of Democrats -- not all are already planning spending initiatives of their own. In other words, to keep the spigots spigotting, nothing changes.</p><p>Republicans, conversely if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>were to win, are planning a lot of more military and the like spending. How do we disavow each side of its knee-jerk inclination to spend on industry's favored to its Party?</p><p>Senator Nunn, to you first.</p><p>NUNN: Well, I thought, hope that the debate will produce some more honest dialogue. And then right after the election, whoever is elected, whether it's President Obama or <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>we face the fiscal cliff in January. And almost all economists left or right or center, say that that would cause a high-risk of another recession, a deep recession.</p><p>So what I would like to see instead of the fiscal cliff that we face, and instead of kicking that can down the road six months, why don't we change cans? Why don't we use Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin or some legislative combination of those, substitute it for the cliff and say, OK, you've got six months.</p><p>You can overturn it. You may not like it. But it's a lot better than what we face right now. So why not substitute a logical and sane default position for what we have facing us now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator Bennett, what in your gut, do you think, they will do? I mean, regardless who wins in November, the prevailing wisdom is they either delay these cuts, try to screw around with sequestration so that the cuts are put off a little bit or all the Bush rates don't expire immediately -- a glorified way of kicking the can down the road. What do you think will happen?</p><p>BENNETT: Well, I think the suggestion that Senator Nunn has just made is exactly the right thing we ought to do -- we ought to see them do. I do not see sequestration, a fiscal cliff.</p><p>I see Congress blinking very big time and saying, well, let's delay this.</p><p>CAVUTO: We've got a lame duck session that decides that?</p><p>BENNETT: No, no, I think...</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>BENNETT: ...maybe they'll do it in the lame duck. They come back on the third of January, do it quickly well or just put it off a little while while we talk about it because no one wants to be responsible for their consequences that would come if they did nothing.</p><p>So the instinct is well, let's just put it off a little while, while we talk about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, well, we've done that forever.</p><p>BENNETT: Let's not...</p><p>CAVUTO: But Senator Nunn, to that point...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENNETT: ...that's not a solution. That's not a solution.</p><p>CAVUTO: I agree with you.</p><p>BENNETT: That's not a solution.</p><p>CAVUTO: But Senator Nunn, to that point, if we end up doing something like that, are we reinforcing the credit ratings agencies' desire to downgrade us, that that's the stuff of Banana Republic's and that (ph) now, there's going to be hell to pay for doing it.</p><p>NUNN: Well, I think Bob is basically correct. Yes, it's - it's an issue of rating agency. But the fundamental issue is a moral issue and a generational issue. And beyond the numbers, we can deal with the numbers - - all sorts of people on both sides that can work this thing out.</p><p>But the real signal to the markets and to the world and our own country is that this government cannot function. That's a more dangerous signal than even the numbers.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think, Senator Bennett, that if we don't make a move and soon, the message to the markets will be, sell-off like crazy?</p><p>BENNETT: The one thing that disturbs markets more than anything else is uncertainty. And Sam has just described the biggest uncertainty of all, which is will the U.S. government be able to function? There are...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, let me keep -- we're going to go a little longer if we...</p><p>BENNETT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ... I want to hear what you're saying, that if we -- if we don't act immediately, what you're saying, Senator Bennett, is that you can't keep pulling this stunt, that -- that this time, there would be hell to pay for that?</p><p>BENNETT: Well, I think, GDP growth would continue to be sluggish, if indeed, not tip over into another recession, just because, as has been pointed out in previous versions of this, there are trillions of dollars waiting on the sidelines for some sense of certainty...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>BENNETT: ...to come into the economy and investment. And if the federal government can't get its act together...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: If they get -- if they get their act together and respond...</p><p>BENNETT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: ...that...</p><p>BENNETT: That money won't come in.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm sorry. Senator Nunn, sorry, pressed for time here. I just want to make be clear on something. And do you think then that there would be a collapse or would these sequestration cuts just cuts off the growth of spending in the military and all these others, over 10 years no less. Are they really that draconian, that there would be that kind of a hell to pay?</p><p>NUNN: Well, to change all our previous habits but it's not draconian. We make modest changes now or everyday or month or a year. We wait. The changes have to be more dramatic.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, I understand. But these sequestration cuts that everyone all but calls doomsday -- are they really that doomsday?</p><p>NUNN: Well, it's a huge increase in taxes. And it's a very large cut of expenditures. All at once, it's not...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All at once, yes.</p><p>NUNN: All at once. This is sudden and it's in a fragile economy. So no one knows precisely what's going to happen. But you know, I think we're right in the middle of Winston Churchill's prophecy where he said that America will always do the right thing after its tried every other alternative.</p><p>We don't know how long we're going to have to get through with the alternatives and do the right thing. No one can predict that.</p><p>The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable. And it happens as we've seen in Europe very rapidly.</p><p>CAVUTO: A very good point. The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable. That is a very good point.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>NUNN: Thank you, Neil. Thank you, Bob.</p><p>BENNETT: You bet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Progress is possible, folks. More after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, now, it is going to get busy -- very, very busy. The first big debate in Denver, coming up on Wednesday night. We're there. A little more than a week after that, the vice presidential debate, then we've got yet another presidential debate wrapping things up with the final Obama- Romney clash.</p><p>We're on each and every single one because it's your money. It's your life. And we mean it when we say it. We like to travel and we like to look out for you. Watch us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2012100101cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56R2-R851-JB20-G0WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>October 1, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EPA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Polls</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Debt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Deficit</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp;

Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil  Cavuto.  And never mind, we haven't even gotten to the first debate.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some Democrats are already laying out their spending plans for a second  Obama term's first day.  Vermont Democratic Congressman Peter Welch wants  to get back to an energy policy that acknowledges the climate change is  real.  For now, he is leaving out the price tag to address it, which  Republicans predict will be unreal.  California Democrat Mike Honda wants  to refocus on health care to expand on increasingly cost days and state  days insurance exchanges.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arizona's Raul Grijalva favors a conservative push on immigration reform.   Still, others interpret any Obama win as a referendum for more stimulus out  of the middle-class, good or bad, depending on your political point of  view.  More taxes are on the rich to help pay for regardless of your point  of view.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So get ready for it.  They are already licking their financial chops  planning for it.  Never mind, you haven't even cast your vote.  </p><p>It seems a lot of politicians are already grabbing for your wallet.  Not  much talk about getting this debt under control -- lots of talk, though,  about, as we say, getting the very spending that helped get it out of debt  and into debt out of control, an issue now that worries two former titans  of the Senate, Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican Bob Bennett, thereby  partisan red (ph) is coming up first to some worry post-election watchers  right now. </p><p>Fox News Digital Political Editor, Chris Stirewalt and townhall.com's Katie  Pavlich.  </p><p>Chris, what are we to make about sort of these plans for a second Obama  administration -- might not come to pass, but they're getting their  spending priorities in order.  </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, DIGITAL POLITICAL EDITOR, FOX NEWS:  Well, look, Neil, the  -- the thing that the president is very clearly doing in this reelection  campaign is being very vague.  And while Democrats accuse Mitt Romney of  being vague, the president has intentionally talked only in general about  the need for infrastructure and other stimulus kind of spending and the  need for what he says will be a tax increase on top earners to pay for it.  </p><p>But when you get down to specifics, you don't need -- you don't hear very  much about what it would be.  Part of the reason for that is that the  president knows that there are a lot of people with their hands out.  </p><p>There are a lot of people with ideas for how that money ought to be spent.   And one concern that he has aside from frightening moderate voters with  more spending is creating this line up at the trough for lawmakers from his  own Party that would be looking for the second term to be even more lavish  than the first.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So you think that will be the case, Katie? </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM:  I think it could be.  But based on, you know,  what these Democrats have already lined up in terms of what they want for a  second  Obama term, it does seem a little bit out of touch because as we  know, more spending when you're spending outside of your means -- we have  $16 trillion in debt -- just means the expansion of government.  </p><p>And poll after poll shows that the American people and American voters are  concerned about how big the federal government has been getting.  And I  hear a lot of repeats in what they're asking for.  </p><p>President Obama may not be, you know, implementing an environmental policy  that's directly geared toward climate change, but you look at the EPA's  policies under President Obama.  And they're geared towards addressing  climate change in terms of regulations on coal mines.  </p><p>And in terms of immigration reform, we've seen President Obama work on the  dream act. And we just saw his executive order that was very similar to  that piece of legislation.  </p><p>So it's kind of a repeat of what we've already seen and I would say a  little bit out of touch with what people are concerned about right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I wonder, Chris, if it's part of this -- the perceived victor's  already claiming these polls.  I suppose if Mitt Romney were the runaway  favorite right now and you're in the defense establishment, you are seizing  on keeping open those facilities and military contracts or jobs that could  be imperiled as a result of even automatic sequestration.  </p><p>So are we just seeing something we always see, just more obvious now or  what? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, I certainly think there is truth in that.  And on the  Republican side, Neil, what you'd expect right now would be a lot of calls  for Romney to move right and position himself so that there would be cuts  and that there would be things like that.  </p><p>You might hear social issues crop up.  But I think for the president, what  this is -- we saw a poll today that was conducted for the Hill that said  that 87 percent of Democrats are confident that the president's going to  win.  </p><p>And certainly, it is not helpful to the president's chances of winning for  Democrats to be talking about new spending now at a time when people are  very concerned about debt and deficit.  But as these folks continue to  believe that their man is going to carry the day on November 6, they  probably want to get in line first.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm just wondering, if there's always the risk when word lot (ph)  of this leaks out, that they look like they're, you know, decorating the  office before they're guaranteed they're going to have it, Katie.  Now, if  you're Barack Obama, you already have it.  </p><p>So what's to stop you from saying, I might look at that new rug or what  have you.  But you know what I mean.  There does seem to be a sense that --  that, you know, that they are planning for a victory that might not happen.  </p><p>And if this gets out, then it could strike a lot of voters as, at the very  least, arrogant.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Well, I think, too, that they're forgetting that President Obama  isn't the only piece of the puzzle.  You still have a Republican House  which Republicans look like they're going to hold onto the House. </p><p>And if Mitt Romney loses, well, let Paul Ryan is still going to be the  budget chairman.  And so Democrats can line up all these big spending  initiatives if they want to. </p><p>But the fact is that the House is still going to be majority Republicans.   If Republicans don't take back the Senate, it's going to be the same  situation that we've had for the past two years.  </p><p>And I would say, if they're going to go as far as trying to, as you say,  decorate the office before they have it, well, we might see another  turnaround election in the year 2014, like we did in 2010, if they continue  to push this big spending, big government ideas going forward. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Wait a minute, you're not giving up on -- you're not giving up on  2012.  It almost sounded like you were there.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Well, I'm just simply saying, if they're going to go decorating  the office, see (ph). </p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  Guys, thank you both very, very much.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you. </p><p>STIREWALT:  You got it. </p><p>CAVUTO:  And well, don't look now, but he is back.  Remember Ross and his  charts 20 years later, back with a vengeance, and now, a new warning -- so  deep in debt.  Ross Perot fears we're easy baked (ph) to be taken down.  </p><p>A former Clinton Press Secretary, Debate Commission Co-Chair, Mike McCurry  on those warnings from a guy who two decades ago almost up-ended the  presidential race.  </p><p>Michael, very good to have you.  </p><p>MICHAEL MCCURRY, FMR. CLINTON PRESS SECRETARY:  Good to be with you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I remember Mikey and his charts -- I remember Bill Clinton  responding to that, addressing that.  And many will argue, it was your boss  who did address some of those same debt issues that Perot claimed fame for.  </p><p>But Perot is back saying, both Parties have let him down.  I think he goes  on to say that he doesn't like other guy and that both Parties have  essentially risked throwing the country down the drain.  Is that  resonating? </p><p>MCCURRY:  Well, I think that's classically Ross Perot.  And I think, you  know, that would be an attitude you expect him to have.  But look, there is  an opportunity with these debates on Wednesday night to get to some of the  specifics that, you know, some of your commentators say are missing.  </p><p>We're hoping that the format we have for these debates will get back beyond  some of these slogans and the traditional talking points we're hearing from  some of the candidates and get into a more substantive discussion.  We're  designing it that way. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Are they allowed charts, Mike?  They can't bring charts like Ross  Perot, right?  So they have to tell it.</p><p>MCCURRY:  It's a good question.  The two campaigns have been in discussions  with each other.  The commission kinds of take a hands-off view...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  I see. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...of that.  I don't know if they've got an agreement on that.   But we've seen both Governor Romney and President Obama use charts from  time to time.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Sure. </p><p>MCCURRY:  So we'll tune in and we'll see what happens.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, one of the things that I remember about the debates in  '92 with Bill Clinton and others who have sort of mastered this as trying  to get a complicated stuff across easily, particularly (ph), Ronald Reagan  had this knack as well on the Republican side, to take complicated material  and synthesize it for the people.  </p><p>I mean, in this case, it would be a lot more money going out than is coming  in.  So I think to your old boss's credit, he would say, we have to address  both Republicans, he'd been saying, now just to address all that money  that's going out, address spending.  </p><p>But how do you encapsulate that in a one-minute or 90-second rebuttal  response to a point on spending? </p><p>MCCURRY:  Well, that's the point.  You really can't.  So that's why we have  redesigned the format of these debates so that there will be 15-minute  chunks.  And the candidates have to address the topic.  </p><p>Now, Jim Lehrer, who will be moderating...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...the debate on Wednesday night has  already said, the first  three subjects will be the economy, the economy, the economy.  And then the  fourth subject will be health care -- obviously, Medicare, financing, and  health care financing, a big issue.  And then to what your panelists were  just talking about, the fifth topic will be the role of government. </p><p>And I think this goes, if you want to, you know, think about how to  simplify the debate a little bit, one of my other old bosses, Daniel  Patrick Moynihan, said, look, the quintessential question for the American  people is how much government do we really want? </p><p>And how much are we really willing to pay for?  That's a pretty simple set  of questions.  And that's really the heart of the debate they're going to  have. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I think you're right.  I think that's what every election --  if you think about, it comes down -- unless you're in the middle of a  crisis, but to that point, Mike, when you say, the 15 minutes, you address  these in chunks, they are still timed on answers to each question.  </p><p>So can -- can they go at each other, you know, unencumbered by a moderator  or, you know, something that gets in the way of them getting at each other? </p><p>MCCURRY:  Absolutely.  I mean, the only ground rule is that there will be a  question posed in each -- at the beginning of each segment to each  candidate.  And they get about two minutes to go, you know, to lay out what  they have to say on an issue like the deficit, like infrastructure...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...like the economy.  And then -- then they really are going to  be asked by the moderator, I'm sure, to sort of let's flush this out a  little bit.  Let's talk about it. </p><p>There is some -- we need some more specifics here.  And we'll see how both  candidates respond. </p><p>Now, I have to make clear, it's not up to our commission to decide how that  conversation...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>MCCURRY:  ...is structured.  It'll really be up to the moderator, Jim  Lehrer.  But you know, knowing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  But would the moderator going to have to say you didn't answer  that question or you didn't give me a specific answer or after one or two  tries, does he say, well, this is going nowhere fast.  I'm onto... </p><p>MCCURRY:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...the next thing.  </p><p>MCCURRY:  I'll say this.  If you just -- if you only walk into that debate  with a lot of zingers or one-liners or sound bytes, you're not going to be  able to fill up the, you know, the chunk of time that's going to be around  that -- that debate.  So I think it'll be -- I'm hoping it'll be an  opportunity for both Governor Romney and President Obama to really have a  textured conversation about this.  </p><p>And then more importantly, to get to those philosophical differences that  clearly they have on what the role of government should be. </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm looking forward to it.  Mike, thank you very much.  Good  seeing you. </p><p>MCCURRY:  Nice seeing you.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, by the way, we will be out live, 8:00 p.m until  midnight this Wednesday for that Denver opening debate.  And we'll be  covering back (ph) all the debates right here on Fox Business.  </p><p>Meanwhile, get ready for the October surprise, only it might be a number,  not a blunder.  I'm going to explain.  There is a difference.  But it could  be China that turns the election around by taking our economy down.  And it  would take only a few guys to do it.  and the old-timer says Washington is  running out of time.  Former Senators Bob Bennett and Sam Nunn are having  none of it.                     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  It's October 1st.  Do you know where your election surprise is?   To hear political pundits tell it, you can count on it -- the gap or crisis  that will tip the selection one way or the other.  </p><p>But what if it's not a misstep that does it but just a boring old economic  number that ultimately decides it?  Todd Schoenberger and Sandra Smith on  the data that could pull a doozy at the polls.  </p><p>Todd, it could be any host of data, right? </p><p>TODD SCHOENBERGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LANDCOLT TRADING:  That's right.  I  mean, we've just had the GDP -- the report card on the U.S. economy, came  in very low.  We have the upcoming jobs report.  </p><p>There are a couple of, clearly some time bombs there, that -- that can  actually sway.  It could be a game changer for the election.  I personally  think it's going to be higher oil prices.  </p><p>I think this Middle East uprising is going to boil over.  And if that's the  case, you're going to see higher prices at the pump. </p><p>And as you know, Neil, voters vote with what's in their wallets.  So if you  take some cash out of those wallets, it could sway the election.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Sandra, I always tend to think that things are kind of baked (ph)  to do a cake when it comes to the economic numbers, that unless they're so  awful or even so great that their way out of what was expected, it's --  it's not going to move the needle much.  </p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, but...</p><p>CAVUTO:  What is the expectation for -- for something approaching that? </p><p>SMITH:  Well, the two big jobs reports that we have from -- between now and  the election, I mean, we saw last month a dismal jobs growth of 96,000  jobs.  And Neil, we have another jobs report on Friday.  </p><p>If we see anything above eight percent unemployment, which we're still  there now, we've been hovering around that level -- if we see a jump in  that unemployment, if we see another dismal jobs growth number, these  markets are going to react.  </p><p>And let me tell you something, Neil, when you look at the stock market and  people go home and look at their 401ks here as we enter into this...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, yes. </p><p>SMITH:  ...last quarter of the year, Neil, if we see a 10, 15 percent drop  in the stock market, yet voters will react.  And traders on the floor are  warning that investors have become so complacent.  The VIX is down 63  percent over the past year.  </p><p>The stock market's up 15 percent this year.  Between now and election day,  we could see a significant sell-off in this market.  </p><p>Voters will indeed react to that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Todd, to Sandra's point, for now, a lot of them are looking at  those statements and seeing that double-digit run-up depending on  statement, depending on the 401(k), and they like what they see.  And they  might like what anecdotally they're getting out of sights at zillow.com and  the rest that children (ph) at their homes are no longer at least  imploding. </p><p>They're not exactly soaring.  But they stopped, you know, tumbling.  And is  that enough in this environment where we tend to expect so little to help  the president? </p><p>SCHOENBERGER:  Well, let me tell you something, that's absolutely correct.   Sandra's absolutely right.  The next 30 to 45 days are absolutely critical.   You had the average 401(k) balance in this country. </p><p>It's about a hundred and 7,000.  Yes, but S&amp;P -- it's up 14 percent plus  year-to-date.  If you see those gains evaporate, if they -- they go away  because of poor macro headlines, higher oil prices, anything that's going  to cut down on earnings, that would actually be the game-changer for voters  because what they don't want to see is a brokerage statement and see these  -- these numbers just start melting away. </p><p>And if that's the case, they probably will start to change, using their  wallets, come election day.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you know, Sandra, when you look at the data and the markets,  and if the market's, our forward-looking mechanism and the markets, you  know, it could be all over the map and the gyrations read (ph) today is  notwithstanding, it is still the president's trend and friend. </p><p>Would an October surprise or like a -- cause pause, in other words, that  they would just say, well, wait a minute, but barring that -- that the  President dodges a financial bullet? </p><p>SMITH:  But one could simply argue that the stock market is -- has been  artificially propped up by the Fed's money printing measures...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>SMITH:  ...and when the market looks forward, Neil, they look at earnings.   And we're about to get the latest report on quarterly earnings.  </p><p>And UBS just put out a very dramatic note, saying that they believe that we  are going to enter earnings recession, meaning two straight quarters of  negative earnings growth.  Those are the fundamentals that should be  driving the stock market.  </p><p>We're still sort of in this euphoria period after quantitative easing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right. </p><p>SMITH:  ...three by the Fed, to stimulate the market.  What happens when we  get those negative earnings report so for the next month or so? </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, real quickly, Todd, and then go over here a little bit,  but I remember, 1980, there was a sounding (ph) point during that weekend  before, when a lot of people just said, to hell with it.  They had seen  Ronald Reagan in the debate with Jimmy Carter, liked the idea that they  could switch horses at that stage. </p><p>Even though they weren't sure then, he seemed to comfort himself well.   They were ready to do it.  They just tired of everything and needed a  reason to just say, we're done.  This guy's out.  </p><p>Are we approaching anything like that now where -- where whatever...</p><p>SCHOENBERGER:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...we're seeing it boil (ph) now, could reverse dramatically? </p><p>SCHOENBERGER:  Yes, because if you remember that time, American pride was  even -- was down the tubes.  I mean, the misery index was super high, as it  is now, Neil.  You know, we -- we actually get accustomed to seeing some of  the -- you know, the new products from, say, in Apple.  </p><p>And we start thinking, oh, everything's great.  And then you hear from the  politicians and you hear everything's in recovery mode.  But it's simply  not the case. </p><p>Main Street does not buy it.  And if sentiment if poor, the jobs picture  continues to be weak, then yes, then leading up to this election, you have  30-plus days left, Neil.  </p><p>If people are not feeling well going into the election poll, going into the  polls, that Tuesday, it's going to be pretty for -- for the incumbent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We shall see.  Guys, thank you very, very much.  </p><p>SMITH:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Meanwhile, how is this for an October surprise -- a hack attack  that could be a huge setback for the entire economy -- the guy who says  that he's closer than you think?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  A red alert at the White House.  We are learning that Chinese  hackers breached a computer at the White House's military office.  Now, the  White House is saying no -- no harm was done.  </p><p>But this is just the latest hack attack -- cyber crooks just hitting  several major U.S. banks.  So Homeland Security Adviser, Michael who says  this is a bigger economic threat than the military one it would obviously  pose.  Explain what you mean by that? </p><p>MICHAEL BALBONI, FMR. HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER:  We, in a society, we do  everything now digitally.  And when you think about the -- the past, I  mean, even companies like eHarmony, with those breaches, more and more what  the attacks have been about is not only taking information but distorting  it as well.  </p><p>And the recent attacks against the banks just point out that this is the  evolution.  You know, Congress has been wrestling with this for the last  couple of years.</p><p>And they cannot get out of their own way to say, how do we set a standard,  how do we get information shared about these attacks?  And how do we make  American businesses and society more resilient and less vulnerable to these  types of attacks? </p><p>CAVUTO:  But they keep happening, right?  I figure, you know, it happens  that,  you know, a mid-sized company -- even one of these large companies,  it worries whether it happens to a big tech company because then I'd say,  well, you're tech if you can't figure it out then for god's sake, how can  anyone else?  </p><p>BALBONI:  Right.  Very true, yes, absolutely.  They can have the budgets  from the I.T. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  But now, what happens to a government computer, I mean, and it  goes all the way to the White House and they say, well, you know,  technically, this is just like a phishing expedition quite literally where  they plant a virus-plagued mail and it disrupts the computer.  Well, they  planted a virus mail and it disrupted a computer.  End of story.  </p><p>BALBONI:  Well, the problem with any of the governmental structures that --  the I.T. structures is that it all relies on one component -- the same  component.  And that is a human element. </p><p>And oftentimes, what happens, even though we assume that everybody from the  folks in the White House on down to the Department of Defense, to any other  of the governmental agencies, everybody knows what they're doing when it  comes to e-mail and how to deal with the computer systems. </p><p>What we're really finding out is they don't know as much as they should.   And so every opportunity that the hackers can have to find somebody that  they can infiltrate and get them to open up one of these e-mails and  download a malicious payload is all you need to -- to prevent and to start  an attack.  And preventing it is really difficult.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Michael, why are the Chinese so blatant about it?  I mean,  they're -- in a thousand U.S. corporation instances, to say nothing of  repeated government attacks, it's as if they set up shop at a Starbucks and  are doing it in broad daylight.  And they're not even denying it. </p><p>They say, oh, what do we do about that? </p><p>BALBONI:  Well, look, the Chinese government has been very open about the  fact that they hire young students.  They train them to do hacking.  They  train them to go into the computer systems and decide how the United States  and the rest of the world does their cyber business, go in and get that  information and take it for their own use...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, where do you see this going, Michael?  How far does this go?   What do you see happening? </p><p>BALBONI:  And actually -- and actually, the information I've received about  some of the bank attacks -- the recent bank attacks is that there's a more  disturbing evolution here.  And that is that it's not just the attack where  you go after a Web site, and you try to take down the Web site through a  denial service attack. </p><p>You basically wall it off, or you try to insert some malicious code there.   But they're actually going after the domain names, in other words, the  infrastructure of cyber security world.  </p><p>And what's so disturbing about that is that now, you can take the  information.  And yes, you could stop it.  But you could also distort it.  </p><p>And that now, when you have a consumer-based cyber security or cyber  network, where you do all your cyber business, what do you do if you say,  you get onto your bank account and now, everything's gone.  What happens if  we lose confidence in our cyber system in this nation?  That's an economic  ruin.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, well-pointed out, Michael.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Meanwhile, ignore all the polls.  Focus instead on how many might be going  to the polls.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Halftime, are Democrats the ones who are going to get throttled?   Now, you don't see that certainly in most polls.  But you do see it in the  number of Democrats who, so far, aren't planning to go to those polls,  because compared to this time in 2008, not a whole lot of jazzed Democrats  in 2012, at least not nearly as many, in Ohio, 490,000 -- fewer folks  registered compared to four years ago. </p><p>And 44 percent of them in Cleveland and surrounding Cuyahoga County where  Democrats are a two to one advantage over Republicans.  Another survey --  this one by a left-leaning think tank, Third Way, shows similar Democrat  voter registration declines in Florida, Iowa and New Hampshire.  </p><p>And that is not to say, the president still doesn't lead in polls in these  states and might win big of these states -- just the Democrats' tepid get- out the vote campaign might not translate into victories in these states,  not if their own troops don't even bother showing up. </p><p>And if passion is a factor, is the president a possible loser in swing  states where he, right now, looks like a winner?  Hard to say, this much is  not.  If the key to victory is jazzing your base, the president is not.  </p><p>And that's not to say that Mitt Romney has.  But by comparison, the number  of Republican registered voters is about the same, if not slightly hire  than in 2008. </p><p>Who knows what any of this means?  And who knows whether all these  registered voters surveys failed to appreciate the influence of just plain  old independents who presently align themselves with neither Party.  </p><p>Let's just say, for the president and for Democrats, a sign they should  hold off on that Party.  So our question tonight is this -- if so many  Democrats aren't coming back, who says Mitt Romney really is that far back? </p><p>GOP Strategist, Cheri -- Cheri, I think I know what you're going to say.   But what do you say?   </p><p>CHERI JACOBUS, PRESIDENT, CAPITOL STRATEGIES:  Well, I do think there are  some problems with the polling.  A lot of people are looking at the 2008  models, Neil.  And that's not the way to go.  Obama voters and Democrats  were very energized in 2008. And they're not now.  So a lot of people talk  about registered voters, as if they're all going to the poll.  And you have  to look at likely voters. </p><p>And even then, I think we have some problems.  In 2010, pollsters were way  off.  They really could not have predicted that Republicans would have  picked up a net of 63 House seats and six in the Senate.  It was kind of a  surprise.  And we even saw this in '94.  I don't think Newt Gingrich really  expected to be speaker in '94.  It was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  No, no, no, there is historic precedent to divide (ph) kind of  getting it wrong.  I don't know -- well, it's a Machiavelli in plan, I  doubt that.  But I will say this -- that in some states, and it's still  early, as you remind me, it is beyond the margin for sampling error.  By  that, I mean...</p><p>JACOBUS:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...if -- if Barack Obama is up eight to 10 points, even allowing  for whatever statistical bias you see, Mitt Romney should be worried,  right? </p><p>JACOBUS:  Well, he should be worried.  But again, it doesn't make sense.   Nationally, you've got this race statistically tied, Romney just a couple  of points down. </p><p>And you see that in poll after poll.  And now, you're looking at these  battleground states where we're hearing, you know, Obama is so far ahead.   It doesn't make sense, Neil, because those battleground states are probably  about 25 or 20 percent of the entire votes. </p><p>So there's something off right there.  And I think that you have to look at  maybe the 2010 models.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>JACOBUS:  Again, it was an unexpected victory...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  And if you did that, Cheri, if you did that -- by the way, the  counter to that argument would be in core states that are safe, Republican  states, Texas comes to mind, some southern state Mitt Romney enjoys  significant leads.  </p><p>Is this typically the case where core states to each -- each candidate go  their way?  But having said that, do you think that there is room for a  wide swing within those swing states?  And if so, how significant would it  be?  Normally, the closer we get to the election, the less likely that is,  although in 1980, it happened.  But what do you see happening? </p><p>JACOBUS:  Yes, well, look, you've got a president who's only got a 47  percent approval rating.  If you are under 50 percent, and you're the  incumbent and it's October, you've got big, big problems.  So the case has  been made for this -- for that why this president should be hired.  The  problem now is Romney has to make the case why he should be hired.  But he  has picked up in the past week or so with independence.  So that's very  good news for the Romney campaign. </p><p>So I think when you see these battleground states with the number so far --  with the margins so -- the distance between the two candidates so large, I  -- I think that it's unlikely that it can be that stark in those states.   So the numbers have to be off.  It was seen that even in battleground  states, even if there's some urban areas that tend to favor the Democrat,  you have to look at likely voters -- the voters who are going to turn out. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes. </p><p>JACOBUS:  And again, Neil, if I'm a campaign -- seems to be relying just on  getting voters angry, almost to the point of hatred.  And you've got to  keep them riled until election day and still get them out on election day - - very different from 2008 when it was very positive -- all hope, all  change are very uplifting. </p><p>So that's a real challenge for the Democrats, for the Obama campaign to get  those voters riled up again where they were almost euphoric in 2008.  And  now, they have to be so angry. That's -- that's a tough job. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  You want them registered at least.  You want them out there  set to vote.  Cheri, thank you very much.  Cheri Jacobus...</p><p>JACOBUS:  Thank you. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...in Washington.  </p><p>Well, Bill may sell the man.  I want you to meet the Republican and the  Democrat, who actually do the math.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  Now, people ask me all the time, how we got four surplus budgets  in a row.  What new ideas did we bring to Washington?  I always give a one- word answer -- arithmetic.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, we interrupt this political shouting for something that's  exploding -- our debt.  Ross Perot wasn't the only one coming back in a  page one set in USA today, in fact, to say it's going to crush us.  Two  season of Washington veterans, Democrat and a Republican say, this keeps  up.  </p><p>Ross is actually understating it.  We all go down.  Here to spell it out,  and the options we still have before time is up, former Georgia Democratic  Senator Sam Nunn, and former Utah Republican Senator, Bob Bennett.</p><p>Welcome, gentleman, and an honor having both of you. </p><p>Senator Nunn, do you first, of course, long ago, you were reminding people  of the dangers of this accumulating debt.  But it's still accumulating.   And I'm wondering if in this election year, it's an issue they're even  bothering to address.  If you had your druthers in this upcoming debate,  what would your words be to both candidates? </p><p>SAM NUNN, FMR. SENATOR, (D) GEORGIA:  Well, I would like for them to use  common sense and honest arithmetic.  And I'd like to see the candidates  explain to the American people that we really do have a serious problem.  </p><p>And all parts of the budget have to come under scrutiny.  We have to play  with a whole deck of cards. </p><p>But we particularly have to discuss, frankly, with the  American people, that the entitlement programs simply cannot maintain the  same trajectory.  We're not going to cut people's Social Security or cut  people's Medicare. </p><p>But we have to bend the coastline downward.  Otherwise, we will simply not  be able to sustain the programs that we have, and our country, with a  fragile economic recovery, and a global environment that's very fragile,  will be in deep difficulty.  </p><p>No one can predict how long the bond markets will support American debt.   But we're borrowing 40 cents, approximately out of every dollar that we  spend today.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it will keep doing so as long as Ben Bernanke keeps this  thing going again. </p><p>But Senator Bennett, I always think, and I know we've chatted about this  before, sir, that -- that we live in an environment, where each party is  captive to the extreme elements that don't want to budge and not even these  varied -- either those extreme elements.  </p><p>Well, on the Democratic side, to Senator Nunn's point, that if you're  trying to rein in the growth of entitlements, you're overthrowing grandma  off the cliff on your side.</p><p>And you experienced this first-hand, Senator, if you're trying to address,  you know, closing loopholes and credits and allowances that allow some, to  not pay the taxes at all, you're raising taxes so tea partiers hate you.   So you can't move the ball forward, when that's how we're playing the game,  can you?</p><p>BOB BENNETT, FMR. SENATOR, (R) UTAH:  Well, there needs to be some honesty  here.  And Sam Nunn has got it exactly right.  The challenge with  entitlements, frankly, is not because of anything that Republicans have  done, not because of anything the Democrats have done. </p><p>It's because of changing demographics in the country.  And demographic  trends are the most difficult trends to change.  And they've been coming at  us for years.  And we've known this is coming for years.  And we keep  putting it off, saying, well, I'll just demagogue the issue in this  election. </p><p>And then, we'll deal with it later on.  Well, you can't do that.  The baby  boomer started retiring, started swelling the ranks, demographically of the  people drawing entitlements in just a year -- 2008.  So just as we have the  problem that hit with us with the financial collapse that occurred in  September of 2008, we saw the increases demands going up simply because...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes. </p><p>BENNETT:  ...we are an aging nation.  Now...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  But you know, you explain that very clearly.  I mean, you could be  left or right and understand that that's an escapable truth.  We're getting  older, a lot more of a big crush of people, such at the same time, getting  older, too.  The -- the dynamics don't support what we've got right now. </p><p>But Senator Nunn, I'll address this in a Democratic perspective than a  Republican perspective, the idea is you even try to slow that momentum in  spending, and address that growth in population.  You -- you are torpedoing  benefits that are sacrosanct.  </p><p>How do you get people around the notion you're trying to save those  benefits or they're gone?</p><p>NUNN:  Well, I don't think a torpedo should apply when you're treading a  line that continues to grow up.  You're just not making the trajectory as  sharp. </p><p>We have to tell younger people, frankly, you're going to have to save more  money because by the time you retire, the age of retirement may go up  somewhat.  That happens over a long period of time.  And we may have to say  on cost to living type adjustments over a long period of time...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Easy solutions, never offered -- never ever offered...</p><p>NUNN:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...never accepted by enough to get that ball moving forward.  </p><p>NUNN:  Well, they've been offered -- they've been offered on the floor of  the Senate, even when I was there, several times a week...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you're actually right about that. </p><p>NUNN:  We never had a majority vote for them.  You're right about that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Senators...</p><p>BENNETT:   I wrote -- I wrote a bill...</p><p>NUNN:  People never understood the problem.  People have to understand it.   When they do, the American people, I'm confident, will support...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, no, I think you're right.  I think you're right.  But Senator  Bennett, it's getting past that hurdle, right, to get the word out to them.  </p><p>BENNETT:  Yes, well, I -- I wrote a bill that was -- that did exactly the  things that Senator Nunn is talking about.  And it was scored by the  administrators, the board of trustees, if that's the proper term of the  Social Security administration, as a 100 percent fix of Social Security  that would -- would make Social Security safe in perpetuity.  </p><p>And I took it to the Republican leader and said, this is what we ought to  be doing.  And he said, Bob, that'll be the Republican position.  And we'll  get behind it as soon as you get your first Democratic cosponsor.  And so I  walked across the aisle and sat down with some of my Democratic friends and  laid it out.  And they said, you know, this is great.  This is -- this will  solve the problem.  </p><p>And we'll get behind it.  We'll join you right after the election.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.</p><p>BENNETT:  Well, you know, there we were.  One point I really want to make,  that Washington's the only place I know where, when you give somebody more  this year than you gave them last year, that's called a cut.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a very good point.  And it's a point I want to pick up on.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENNETT:  Because you're giving them less than they were promised.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Less than what they were expecting.  I'm going to swirl (ph) it a  little bit because that is something that we get wrong in the media, this  idea of cuts, when you're actually talking about slowing the growth of  something, to Senator Nunn's point, about making sure that line doesn't go  up as much as it presently is.  </p><p>The debate over -- the very words we use in this debate after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Fair and balanced -- we've got former Senator Bob Bennett, former  Senator Sam Nunn, debating what we do now on -- on the debt.  And you're  quite right, gentlemen.  Normally, this stuff comes up in detail in bravery  (ph) after an election.  </p><p>But Senator Nunn, do you -- if Barack Obama is reelected, the argument is,  right now, we're hearing a lot of Democrats -- not all are already planning  spending initiatives of their own.  In other words, to keep the spigots  spigotting, nothing changes.  </p><p>Republicans, conversely if Mitt Romney were to win, are planning a lot of  more military and the like spending.  How do we disavow each side of its  knee-jerk inclination to spend on industry's favored to its Party? </p><p>Senator Nunn, to you first. </p><p>NUNN:  Well, I thought, hope that the debate will produce some more honest  dialogue.  And then right after the election, whoever is elected, whether  it's President Obama or Mitt Romney, we face the fiscal cliff in January.   And almost all economists left or right or center, say that that would  cause a high-risk of another recession, a deep recession. </p><p>So what I would like to see instead of the fiscal cliff that we face, and  instead of kicking that can down the road six months, why don't we change  cans?  Why don't we use Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin or some legislative  combination of those, substitute it for the cliff and say, OK, you've got  six months. </p><p>You can overturn it.  You may not like it.  But it's a lot better than what  we face right now.  So why not substitute a logical and sane default  position for what we have facing us now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Senator Bennett, what in your gut, do you think, they will do?  I  mean, regardless who wins in November, the prevailing wisdom is they either  delay these cuts, try to screw around with sequestration so that the cuts  are put off a little bit or all the Bush rates don't expire immediately --  a glorified way of kicking the can down the road.   What do you think will happen? </p><p>BENNETT:  Well, I think the suggestion that Senator Nunn has just made is  exactly the right thing we ought to do -- we ought to see them do.  I do  not see sequestration, a fiscal cliff.</p><p>I see Congress blinking very big time and saying, well, let's delay this.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We've got a lame duck session that decides that? </p><p>BENNETT:  No, no, I think...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Really? </p><p>BENNETT:  ...maybe they'll do it in the lame duck.  They come back on the  third of January, do it quickly well or just put it off a little while  while we talk about it because no one wants to be responsible for their  consequences that would come if they did nothing.  </p><p>So the instinct is well, let's just put it off a little while, while we  talk about it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, well, we've done that forever.  </p><p>BENNETT:  Let's not...</p><p>CAVUTO:  But Senator Nunn, to that point...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENNETT:  ...that's not a solution.  That's not a solution. </p><p>CAVUTO:  I agree with you.  </p><p>BENNETT:  That's not a solution. </p><p>CAVUTO:  But Senator Nunn, to that point, if we end up doing something like  that, are we reinforcing the credit ratings agencies' desire to downgrade  us, that that's the stuff of Banana Republic's and that (ph) now, there's  going to be hell to pay for doing it.  </p><p>NUNN:  Well, I think Bob is basically correct.  Yes, it's - it's an issue  of rating agency.  But the fundamental issue is a moral issue and a  generational issue.  And beyond the numbers, we can deal with the numbers - - all sorts of people on both sides that can work this thing out.  </p><p>But the real signal to the markets and to the world and our own country is  that this government cannot function.  That's a more dangerous signal than  even the numbers.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think, Senator Bennett, that if we don't make a move and  soon, the message to the markets will be, sell-off like crazy? </p><p>BENNETT:  The one thing that disturbs markets more than anything else is  uncertainty.  And Sam has just described the biggest uncertainty of all,  which is will the U.S. government be able to function?  There are...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, let me keep -- we're going to go a little longer if we...</p><p>BENNETT:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ... I want to hear what you're saying, that if we -- if we don't  act immediately, what you're saying, Senator Bennett, is that you can't  keep pulling this stunt, that -- that this time, there would be hell to pay  for that? </p><p>BENNETT:  Well, I think, GDP growth would continue to be sluggish, if  indeed, not tip over into another recession, just because, as has been  pointed out in previous versions of this, there are trillions of dollars  waiting on the sidelines for some sense of certainty...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>BENNETT:  ...to come into the economy and investment.  And if the federal  government can't get its act together...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  If they get -- if they get their act together and respond...</p><p>BENNETT:  Yes. </p><p>CAVUTO:  ...that...</p><p>BENNETT:  That money won't come in. </p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm sorry.  Senator Nunn, sorry, pressed for time here.  I just  want to make be clear on something.  And do you think then that there would  be a collapse or would these sequestration cuts just cuts off the growth of  spending in the military and all these others, over 10 years no less.  Are  they really that draconian, that there would be that kind of a hell to pay?</p><p>NUNN:  Well, to change all our previous habits but it's not draconian.  We  make modest changes now or everyday or month or a year.  We wait.  The  changes have to be more dramatic.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  No, I understand.  But these sequestration cuts that everyone all  but calls doomsday -- are they really that doomsday? </p><p>NUNN:  Well, it's a huge increase in taxes.  And it's a very large cut of  expenditures.  All at once, it's not...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All at once, yes. </p><p>NUNN:  All at once.  This is sudden and it's in a fragile economy.  So no  one knows precisely what's going to happen.  But you know, I think we're  right in the middle of Winston Churchill's prophecy where he said that  America will always do the right thing after its tried every other  alternative. </p><p>We don't know how long we're going to have to get through with the  alternatives and do the right thing.  No one can predict that. </p><p>The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable.  And it happens  as we've seen in Europe very rapidly. </p><p>CAVUTO:  A very good point.  The markets are comfortable until they're not  comfortable.  That is a very good point.  </p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both very, very much. </p><p>NUNN:  Thank you, Neil.  Thank you, Bob. </p><p>BENNETT:  You bet. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Progress is possible, folks.  More after this.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, now, it is going to get busy -- very, very busy.  The first  big debate in Denver, coming up on Wednesday night.  We're there.  A little  more than a week after that, the vice presidential debate, then we've got  yet another presidential debate wrapping things up with the final Obama- Romney clash.  </p><p>We're on each and every single one because it's your money.  It's your  life.  And we mean it when we say it.  We like to travel and we like to  look out for you.  Watch us. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome, everybody. I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And never mind, we haven't even gotten to the first debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some Democrats are already laying out their spending plans for a second Obama term's first day. Vermont Democratic Congressman Peter Welch wants to get back to an energy policy that acknowledges the climate change is real. For now, he is leaving out the price tag to address it, which Republicans predict will be unreal. California Democrat Mike Honda wants to refocus on health care to expand on increasingly cost days and state days insurance exchanges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arizona's Raul Grijalva favors a conservative push on immigration reform. Still, others interpret any Obama win as a referendum for more stimulus out of the middle-class, good or bad, depending on your political point of view. More taxes are on the rich to help pay for regardless of your point of view.</p><p/><p>So get ready for it. They are already licking their financial chops planning for it. Never mind, you haven't even cast your vote.</p><p/><p>It seems a lot of politicians are already grabbing for your wallet. Not much talk about getting this debt under control -- lots of talk, though, about, as we say, getting the very spending that helped get it out of debt and into debt out of control, an issue now that worries two former titans of the Senate, Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican Bob Bennett, thereby partisan red (ph) is coming up first to some worry post-election watchers right now.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Digital Political Editor, Chris Stirewalt and townhall.com's Katie Pavlich.</p><p/><p>Chris, what are we to make about sort of these plans for a second <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>-- might not come to pass, but they're getting their spending priorities in order.</p><p/><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, DIGITAL POLITICAL EDITOR, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS</nameText></person>: Well, look, Neil, the -- the thing that the president is very clearly doing in this reelection campaign is being very vague. And while Democrats accuse <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>of being vague, the president has intentionally talked only in general about the need for infrastructure and other stimulus kind of spending and the need for what he says will be a tax increase on top earners to pay for it.</p><p/><p>But when you get down to specifics, you don't need -- you don't hear very much about what it would be. Part of the reason for that is that the president knows that there are a lot of people with their hands out.</p><p/><p>There are a lot of people with ideas for how that money ought to be spent. And one concern that he has aside from frightening moderate voters with more spending is creating this line up at the trough for lawmakers from his own Party that would be looking for the second term to be even more lavish than the first.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So you think that will be the case, Katie?</p><p/><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM: I think it could be. But based on, you know, what these Democrats have already lined up in terms of what they want for a second Obama term, it does seem a little bit out of touch because as we know, more spending when you're spending outside of your means -- we have $16 trillion in debt -- just means the expansion of government.</p><p/><p>And poll after poll shows that the American people and American voters are concerned about how big the federal government has been getting. And I hear a lot of repeats in what they're asking for.</p><p/><p>President Obama may not be, you know, implementing an environmental policy that's directly geared toward climate change, but you look at the EPA's policies under President Obama. And they're geared towards addressing climate change in terms of regulations on coal mines.</p><p/><p>And in terms of immigration reform, we've seen President Obama work on the dream act. And we just saw his executive order that was very similar to that piece of legislation.</p><p/><p>So it's kind of a repeat of what we've already seen and I would say a little bit out of touch with what people are concerned about right now.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I wonder, Chris, if it's part of this -- the perceived victor's already claiming these polls. I suppose if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>were the runaway favorite right now and you're in the defense establishment, you are seizing on keeping open those facilities and military contracts or jobs that could be imperiled as a result of even automatic sequestration.</p><p/><p>So are we just seeing something we always see, just more obvious now or what?</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: Well, I certainly think there is truth in that. And on the Republican side, Neil, what you'd expect right now would be a lot of calls for Romney to move right and position himself so that there would be cuts and that there would be things like that.</p><p/><p>You might hear social issues crop up. But I think for the president, what this is -- we saw a poll today that was conducted for the Hill that said that 87 percent of Democrats are confident that the president's going to win.</p><p/><p>And certainly, it is not helpful to the president's chances of winning for Democrats to be talking about new spending now at a time when people are very concerned about debt and deficit. But as these folks continue to believe that their man is going to carry the day on November 6, they probably want to get in line first.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I'm just wondering, if there's always the risk when word lot (ph) of this leaks out, that they look like they're, you know, decorating the office before they're guaranteed they're going to have it, Katie. Now, if you're Barack Obama, you already have it.</p><p/><p>So what's to stop you from saying, I might look at that new rug or what have you. But you know what I mean. There does seem to be a sense that -- that, you know, that they are planning for a victory that might not happen.</p><p/><p>And if this gets out, then it could strike a lot of voters as, at the very least, arrogant.</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Well, I think, too, that they're forgetting that President Obama isn't the only piece of the puzzle. You still have a Republican House which Republicans look like they're going to hold onto the House.</p><p/><p>And if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>loses, well, let Paul Ryan is still going to be the budget chairman. And so Democrats can line up all these big spending initiatives if they want to.</p><p/><p>But the fact is that the House is still going to be majority Republicans. If Republicans don't take back the Senate, it's going to be the same situation that we've had for the past two years.</p><p/><p>And I would say, if they're going to go as far as trying to, as you say, decorate the office before they have it, well, we might see another turnaround election in the year 2014, like we did in 2010, if they continue to push this big spending, big government ideas going forward.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Wait a minute, you're not giving up on -- you're not giving up on 2012. It almost sounded like you were there.</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Well, I'm just simply saying, if they're going to go decorating the office, see (ph).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK. Guys, thank you both very, very much.</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Thank you.</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: You got it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And well, don't look now, but he is back. Remember Ross and his charts 20 years later, back with a vengeance, and now, a new warning -- so deep in debt. Ross Perot fears we're easy baked (ph) to be taken down.</p><p/><p>A former Clinton Press Secretary, Debate Commission Co-Chair, Mike McCurry on those warnings from a guy who two decades ago almost up-ended the presidential race.</p><p/><p>Michael, very good to have you.</p><p/><p>MICHAEL MCCURRY, FMR. CLINTON PRESS SECRETARY: Good to be with you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I remember Mikey and his charts -- I remember Bill Clinton responding to that, addressing that. And many will argue, it was your boss who did address some of those same debt issues that Perot claimed fame for.</p><p/><p>But Perot is back saying, both Parties have let him down. I think he goes on to say that he doesn't like other guy and that both Parties have essentially risked throwing the country down the drain. Is that resonating?</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: Well, I think that's classically Ross Perot. And I think, you know, that would be an attitude you expect him to have. But look, there is an opportunity with these debates on Wednesday night to get to some of the specifics that, you know, some of your commentators say are missing.</p><p/><p>We're hoping that the format we have for these debates will get back beyond some of these slogans and the traditional talking points we're hearing from some of the candidates and get into a more substantive discussion. We're designing it that way.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Are they allowed charts, Mike? They can't bring charts like Ross Perot, right? So they have to tell it.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: It's a good question. The two campaigns have been in discussions with each other. The commission kinds of take a hands-off view...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I see.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: ...of that. I don't know if they've got an agreement on that. But we've seen both Governor Romney and President Obama use charts from time to time.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: So we'll tune in and we'll see what happens.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, one of the things that I remember about the debates in '92 with Bill Clinton and others who have sort of mastered this as trying to get a complicated stuff across easily, particularly (ph), Ronald Reagan had this knack as well on the Republican side, to take complicated material and synthesize it for the people.</p><p/><p>I mean, in this case, it would be a lot more money going out than is coming in. So I think to your old boss's credit, he would say, we have to address both Republicans, he'd been saying, now just to address all that money that's going out, address spending.</p><p/><p>But how do you encapsulate that in a one-minute or 90-second rebuttal response to a point on spending?</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: Well, that's the point. You really can't. So that's why we have redesigned the format of these debates so that there will be 15-minute chunks. And the candidates have to address the topic.</p><p/><p>Now, Jim Lehrer, who will be moderating...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: ...the debate on Wednesday night has already said, the first three subjects will be the economy, the economy, the economy. And then the fourth subject will be health care -- obviously, Medicare, financing, and health care financing, a big issue. And then to what your panelists were just talking about, the fifth topic will be the role of government.</p><p/><p>And I think this goes, if you want to, you know, think about how to simplify the debate a little bit, one of my other old bosses, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said, look, the quintessential question for the American people is how much government do we really want?</p><p/><p>And how much are we really willing to pay for? That's a pretty simple set of questions. And that's really the heart of the debate they're going to have.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But I think you're right. I think that's what every election -- if you think about, it comes down -- unless you're in the middle of a crisis, but to that point, Mike, when you say, the 15 minutes, you address these in chunks, they are still timed on answers to each question.</p><p/><p>So can -- can they go at each other, you know, unencumbered by a moderator or, you know, something that gets in the way of them getting at each other?</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: Absolutely. I mean, the only ground rule is that there will be a question posed in each -- at the beginning of each segment to each candidate. And they get about two minutes to go, you know, to lay out what they have to say on an issue like the deficit, like infrastructure...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: ...like the economy. And then -- then they really are going to be asked by the moderator, I'm sure, to sort of let's flush this out a little bit. Let's talk about it.</p><p/><p>There is some -- we need some more specifics here. And we'll see how both candidates respond.</p><p/><p>Now, I have to make clear, it's not up to our commission to decide how that conversation...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: ...is structured. It'll really be up to the moderator, Jim Lehrer. But you know, knowing...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But would the moderator going to have to say you didn't answer that question or you didn't give me a specific answer or after one or two tries, does he say, well, this is going nowhere fast. I'm onto...</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: ...the next thing.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: I'll say this. If you just -- if you only walk into that debate with a lot of zingers or one-liners or sound bytes, you're not going to be able to fill up the, you know, the chunk of time that's going to be around that -- that debate. So I think it'll be -- I'm hoping it'll be an opportunity for both Governor Romney and President Obama to really have a textured conversation about this.</p><p/><p>And then more importantly, to get to those philosophical differences that clearly they have on what the role of government should be.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I'm looking forward to it. Mike, thank you very much. Good seeing you.</p><p/><p>MCCURRY: Nice seeing you. Good to be with you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, by the way, we will be out live, 8:00 p.m until midnight this Wednesday for that Denver opening debate. And we'll be covering back (ph) all the debates right here on Fox Business.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, get ready for the October surprise, only it might be a number, not a blunder. I'm going to explain. There is a difference. But it could be China that turns the election around by taking our economy down. And it would take only a few guys to do it. and the old-timer says Washington is running out of time. Former Senators Bob Bennett and Sam Nunn are having none of it.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's October 1st. Do you know where your election surprise is? To hear political pundits tell it, you can count on it -- the gap or crisis that will tip the selection one way or the other.</p><p/><p>But what if it's not a misstep that does it but just a boring old economic number that ultimately decides it? Todd Schoenberger and Sandra Smith on the data that could pull a doozy at the polls.</p><p/><p>Todd, it could be any host of data, right?</p><p/><p>TODD SCHOENBERGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LANDCOLT TRADING: That's right. I mean, we've just had the GDP -- the report card on the U.S. economy, came in very low. We have the upcoming jobs report.</p><p/><p>There are a couple of, clearly some time bombs there, that -- that can actually sway. It could be a game changer for the election. I personally think it's going to be higher oil prices.</p><p/><p>I think this Middle East uprising is going to boil over. And if that's the case, you're going to see higher prices at the pump.</p><p/><p>And as you know, Neil, voters vote with what's in their wallets. So if you take some cash out of those wallets, it could sway the election.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Sandra, I always tend to think that things are kind of baked (ph) to do a cake when it comes to the economic numbers, that unless they're so awful or even so great that their way out of what was expected, it's -- it's not going to move the needle much.</p><p/><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, but...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: What is the expectation for -- for something approaching that?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Well, the two big jobs reports that we have from -- between now and the election, I mean, we saw last month a dismal jobs growth of 96,000 jobs. And Neil, we have another jobs report on Friday.</p><p/><p>If we see anything above eight percent unemployment, which we're still there now, we've been hovering around that level -- if we see a jump in that unemployment, if we see another dismal jobs growth number, these markets are going to react.</p><p/><p>And let me tell you something, Neil, when you look at the stock market and people go home and look at their 401ks here as we enter into this...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ...last quarter of the year, Neil, if we see a 10, 15 percent drop in the stock market, yet voters will react. And traders on the floor are warning that investors have become so complacent. The VIX is down 63 percent over the past year.</p><p/><p>The stock market's up 15 percent this year. Between now and election day, we could see a significant sell-off in this market.</p><p/><p>Voters will indeed react to that.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But Todd, to Sandra's point, for now, a lot of them are looking at those statements and seeing that double-digit run-up depending on statement, depending on the 401(k), and they like what they see. And they might like what anecdotally they're getting out of sights at zillow.com and the rest that children (ph) at their homes are no longer at least imploding.</p><p/><p>They're not exactly soaring. But they stopped, you know, tumbling. And is that enough in this environment where we tend to expect so little to help the president?</p><p/><p>SCHOENBERGER: Well, let me tell you something, that's absolutely correct. Sandra's absolutely right. The next 30 to 45 days are absolutely critical. You had the average 401(k) balance in this country.</p><p/><p>It's about a hundred and 7,000. Yes, but S&amp;P -- it's up 14 percent plus year-to-date. If you see those gains evaporate, if they -- they go away because of poor macro headlines, higher oil prices, anything that's going to cut down on earnings, that would actually be the game-changer for voters because what they don't want to see is a brokerage statement and see these -- these numbers just start melting away.</p><p/><p>And if that's the case, they probably will start to change, using their wallets, come election day.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you know, Sandra, when you look at the data and the markets, and if the market's, our forward-looking mechanism and the markets, you know, it could be all over the map and the gyrations read (ph) today is notwithstanding, it is still the president's trend and friend.</p><p/><p>Would an October surprise or like a -- cause pause, in other words, that they would just say, well, wait a minute, but barring that -- that the President dodges a financial bullet?</p><p/><p>SMITH: But one could simply argue that the stock market is -- has been artificially propped up by the Fed's money printing measures...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ...and when the market looks forward, Neil, they look at earnings. And we're about to get the latest report on quarterly earnings.</p><p/><p>And UBS just put out a very dramatic note, saying that they believe that we are going to enter earnings recession, meaning two straight quarters of negative earnings growth. Those are the fundamentals that should be driving the stock market.</p><p/><p>We're still sort of in this euphoria period after quantitative easing...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ...three by the Fed, to stimulate the market. What happens when we get those negative earnings report so for the next month or so?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, real quickly, Todd, and then go over here a little bit, but I remember, 1980, there was a sounding (ph) point during that weekend before, when a lot of people just said, to hell with it. They had seen Ronald Reagan in the debate with Jimmy Carter, liked the idea that they could switch horses at that stage.</p><p/><p>Even though they weren't sure then, he seemed to comfort himself well. They were ready to do it. They just tired of everything and needed a reason to just say, we're done. This guy's out.</p><p/><p>Are we approaching anything like that now where -- where whatever...</p><p/><p>SCHOENBERGER: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: ...we're seeing it boil (ph) now, could reverse dramatically?</p><p/><p>SCHOENBERGER: Yes, because if you remember that time, American pride was even -- was down the tubes. I mean, the misery index was super high, as it is now, Neil. You know, we -- we actually get accustomed to seeing some of the -- you know, the new products from, say, in Apple.</p><p/><p>And we start thinking, oh, everything's great. And then you hear from the politicians and you hear everything's in recovery mode. But it's simply not the case.</p><p/><p>Main Street does not buy it. And if sentiment if poor, the jobs picture continues to be weak, then yes, then leading up to this election, you have 30-plus days left, Neil.</p><p/><p>If people are not feeling well going into the election poll, going into the polls, that Tuesday, it's going to be pretty for -- for the incumbent.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: We shall see. Guys, thank you very, very much.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, how is this for an October surprise -- a hack attack that could be a huge setback for the entire economy -- the guy who says that he's closer than you think?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: A red alert at the White House. We are learning that Chinese hackers breached a computer at the White House's military office. Now, the White House is saying no -- no harm was done.</p><p/><p>But this is just the latest hack attack -- cyber crooks just hitting several major U.S. banks. So Homeland Security Adviser, Michael who says this is a bigger economic threat than the military one it would obviously pose. Explain what you mean by that?</p><p/><p>MICHAEL BALBONI, FMR. HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: We, in a society, we do everything now digitally. And when you think about the -- the past, I mean, even companies like eHarmony, with those breaches, more and more what the attacks have been about is not only taking information but distorting it as well.</p><p/><p>And the recent attacks against the banks just point out that this is the evolution. You know, Congress has been wrestling with this for the last couple of years.</p><p/><p>And they cannot get out of their own way to say, how do we set a standard, how do we get information shared about these attacks? And how do we make American businesses and society more resilient and less vulnerable to these types of attacks?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But they keep happening, right? I figure, you know, it happens that, you know, a mid-sized company -- even one of these large companies, it worries whether it happens to a big tech company because then I'd say, well, you're tech if you can't figure it out then for god's sake, how can anyone else?</p><p/><p>BALBONI: Right. Very true, yes, absolutely. They can have the budgets from the I.T.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But now, what happens to a government computer, I mean, and it goes all the way to the White House and they say, well, you know, technically, this is just like a phishing expedition quite literally where they plant a virus-plagued mail and it disrupts the computer. Well, they planted a virus mail and it disrupted a computer. End of story.</p><p/><p>BALBONI: Well, the problem with any of the governmental structures that -- the I.T. structures is that it all relies on one component -- the same component. And that is a human element.</p><p/><p>And oftentimes, what happens, even though we assume that everybody from the folks in the White House on down to the Department of Defense, to any other of the governmental agencies, everybody knows what they're doing when it comes to e-mail and how to deal with the computer systems.</p><p/><p>What we're really finding out is they don't know as much as they should. And so every opportunity that the hackers can have to find somebody that they can infiltrate and get them to open up one of these e-mails and download a malicious payload is all you need to -- to prevent and to start an attack. And preventing it is really difficult.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But Michael, why are the Chinese so blatant about it? I mean, they're -- in a thousand U.S. corporation instances, to say nothing of repeated government attacks, it's as if they set up shop at a Starbucks and are doing it in broad daylight. And they're not even denying it.</p><p/><p>They say, oh, what do we do about that?</p><p/><p>BALBONI: Well, look, the Chinese government has been very open about the fact that they hire young students. They train them to do hacking. They train them to go into the computer systems and decide how the United States and the rest of the world does their cyber business, go in and get that information and take it for their own use...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, where do you see this going, Michael? How far does this go? What do you see happening?</p><p/><p>BALBONI: And actually -- and actually, the information I've received about some of the bank attacks -- the recent bank attacks is that there's a more disturbing evolution here. And that is that it's not just the attack where you go after a Web site, and you try to take down the Web site through a denial service attack.</p><p/><p>You basically wall it off, or you try to insert some malicious code there. But they're actually going after the domain names, in other words, the infrastructure of cyber security world.</p><p/><p>And what's so disturbing about that is that now, you can take the information. And yes, you could stop it. But you could also distort it.</p><p/><p>And that now, when you have a consumer-based cyber security or cyber network, where you do all your cyber business, what do you do if you say, you get onto your bank account and now, everything's gone. What happens if we lose confidence in our cyber system in this nation? That's an economic ruin.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, well-pointed out, Michael. Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, ignore all the polls. Focus instead on how many might be going to the polls.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Halftime, are Democrats the ones who are going to get throttled? Now, you don't see that certainly in most polls. But you do see it in the number of Democrats who, so far, aren't planning to go to those polls, because compared to this time in 2008, not a whole lot of jazzed Democrats in 2012, at least not nearly as many, in Ohio, 490,000 -- fewer folks registered compared to four years ago.</p><p/><p>And 44 percent of them in Cleveland and surrounding Cuyahoga County where Democrats are a two to one advantage over Republicans. Another survey -- this one by a left-leaning think tank, Third Way, shows similar Democrat voter registration declines in Florida, Iowa and New Hampshire.</p><p/><p>And that is not to say, the president still doesn't lead in polls in these states and might win big of these states -- just the Democrats' tepid get- out the vote campaign might not translate into victories in these states, not if their own troops don't even bother showing up.</p><p/><p>And if passion is a factor, is the president a possible loser in swing states where he, right now, looks like a winner? Hard to say, this much is not. If the key to victory is jazzing your base, the president is not.</p><p/><p>And that's not to say that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>has. But by comparison, the number of Republican registered voters is about the same, if not slightly hire than in 2008.</p><p/><p>Who knows what any of this means? And who knows whether all these registered voters surveys failed to appreciate the influence of just plain old independents who presently align themselves with neither Party.</p><p/><p>Let's just say, for the president and for Democrats, a sign they should hold off on that Party. So our question tonight is this -- if so many Democrats aren't coming back, who says <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really is that far back?</p><p/><p>GOP Strategist, Cheri -- Cheri, I think I know what you're going to say. But what do you say?</p><p/><p>CHERI JACOBUS, PRESIDENT, CAPITOL STRATEGIES: Well, I do think there are some problems with the polling. A lot of people are looking at the 2008 models, Neil. And that's not the way to go. Obama voters and Democrats were very energized in 2008. And they're not now. So a lot of people talk about registered voters, as if they're all going to the poll. And you have to look at likely voters.</p><p/><p>And even then, I think we have some problems. In 2010, pollsters were way off. They really could not have predicted that Republicans would have picked up a net of 63 House seats and six in the Senate. It was kind of a surprise. And we even saw this in '94. I don't think Newt Gingrich really expected to be speaker in '94. It was...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No, no, no, there is historic precedent to divide (ph) kind of getting it wrong. I don't know -- well, it's a Machiavelli in plan, I doubt that. But I will say this -- that in some states, and it's still early, as you remind me, it is beyond the margin for sampling error. By that, I mean...</p><p/><p>JACOBUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: ...if -- if Barack Obama is up eight to 10 points, even allowing for whatever statistical bias you see, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>should be worried, right?</p><p/><p>JACOBUS: Well, he should be worried. But again, it doesn't make sense. Nationally, you've got this race statistically tied, Romney just a couple of points down.</p><p/><p>And you see that in poll after poll. And now, you're looking at these battleground states where we're hearing, you know, Obama is so far ahead. It doesn't make sense, Neil, because those battleground states are probably about 25 or 20 percent of the entire votes.</p><p/><p>So there's something off right there. And I think that you have to look at maybe the 2010 models.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p/><p>JACOBUS: Again, it was an unexpected victory...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And if you did that, Cheri, if you did that -- by the way, the counter to that argument would be in core states that are safe, Republican states, Texas comes to mind, some southern state <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>enjoys significant leads.</p><p/><p>Is this typically the case where core states to each -- each candidate go their way? But having said that, do you think that there is room for a wide swing within those swing states? And if so, how significant would it be? Normally, the closer we get to the election, the less likely that is, although in 1980, it happened. But what do you see happening?</p><p/><p>JACOBUS: Yes, well, look, you've got a president who's only got a 47 percent approval rating. If you are under 50 percent, and you're the incumbent and it's October, you've got big, big problems. So the case has been made for this -- for that why this president should be hired. The problem now is Romney has to make the case why he should be hired. But he has picked up in the past week or so with independence. So that's very good news for the Romney campaign.</p><p/><p>So I think when you see these battleground states with the number so far -- with the margins so -- the distance between the two candidates so large, I -- I think that it's unlikely that it can be that stark in those states. So the numbers have to be off. It was seen that even in battleground states, even if there's some urban areas that tend to favor the Democrat, you have to look at likely voters -- the voters who are going to turn out.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>JACOBUS: And again, Neil, if I'm a campaign -- seems to be relying just on getting voters angry, almost to the point of hatred. And you've got to keep them riled until election day and still get them out on election day - - very different from 2008 when it was very positive -- all hope, all change are very uplifting.</p><p/><p>So that's a real challenge for the Democrats, for the Obama campaign to get those voters riled up again where they were almost euphoric in 2008. And now, they have to be so angry. That's -- that's a tough job.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes. You want them registered at least. You want them out there set to vote. Cheri, thank you very much. Cheri Jacobus...</p><p/><p>JACOBUS: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: ...in Washington.</p><p/><p>Well, Bill may sell the man. I want you to meet the Republican and the Democrat, who actually do the math.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CLINTON: Now, people ask me all the time, how we got four surplus budgets in a row. What new ideas did we bring to Washington? I always give a one- word answer -- arithmetic.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, we interrupt this political shouting for something that's exploding -- our debt. Ross Perot wasn't the only one coming back in a page one set in USA today, in fact, to say it's going to crush us. Two season of Washington veterans, Democrat and a Republican say, this keeps up.</p><p/><p>Ross is actually understating it. We all go down. Here to spell it out, and the options we still have before time is up, former Georgia Democratic Senator Sam Nunn, and former Utah Republican Senator, Bob Bennett.</p><p/><p>Welcome, gentleman, and an honor having both of you.</p><p/><p>Senator Nunn, do you first, of course, long ago, you were reminding people of the dangers of this accumulating debt. But it's still accumulating. And I'm wondering if in this election year, it's an issue they're even bothering to address. If you had your druthers in this upcoming debate, what would your words be to both candidates?</p><p/><p>SAM NUNN, FMR. SENATOR, (D) GEORGIA: Well, I would like for them to use common sense and honest arithmetic. And I'd like to see the candidates explain to the American people that we really do have a serious problem.</p><p/><p>And all parts of the budget have to come under scrutiny. We have to play with a whole deck of cards.</p><p/><p>But we particularly have to discuss, frankly, with the American people, that the entitlement programs simply cannot maintain the same trajectory. We're not going to cut people's Social Security or cut people's Medicare.</p><p/><p>But we have to bend the coastline downward. Otherwise, we will simply not be able to sustain the programs that we have, and our country, with a fragile economic recovery, and a global environment that's very fragile, will be in deep difficulty.</p><p/><p>No one can predict how long the bond markets will support American debt. But we're borrowing 40 cents, approximately out of every dollar that we spend today.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, it will keep doing so as long as Ben Bernanke keeps this thing going again.</p><p/><p>But Senator Bennett, I always think, and I know we've chatted about this before, sir, that -- that we live in an environment, where each party is captive to the extreme elements that don't want to budge and not even these varied -- either those extreme elements.</p><p/><p>Well, on the Democratic side, to Senator Nunn's point, that if you're trying to rein in the growth of entitlements, you're overthrowing grandma off the cliff on your side.</p><p/><p>And you experienced this first-hand, Senator, if you're trying to address, you know, closing loopholes and credits and allowances that allow some, to not pay the taxes at all, you're raising taxes so tea partiers hate you. So you can't move the ball forward, when that's how we're playing the game, can you?</p><p/><p>BOB BENNETT, FMR. SENATOR, (R) UTAH: Well, there needs to be some honesty here. And Sam Nunn has got it exactly right. The challenge with entitlements, frankly, is not because of anything that Republicans have done, not because of anything the Democrats have done.</p><p/><p>It's because of changing demographics in the country. And demographic trends are the most difficult trends to change. And they've been coming at us for years. And we've known this is coming for years. And we keep putting it off, saying, well, I'll just demagogue the issue in this election.</p><p/><p>And then, we'll deal with it later on. Well, you can't do that. The baby boomer started retiring, started swelling the ranks, demographically of the people drawing entitlements in just a year -- 2008. So just as we have the problem that hit with us with the financial collapse that occurred in September of 2008, we saw the increases demands going up simply because...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>BENNETT: ...we are an aging nation. Now...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But you know, you explain that very clearly. I mean, you could be left or right and understand that that's an escapable truth. We're getting older, a lot more of a big crush of people, such at the same time, getting older, too. The -- the dynamics don't support what we've got right now.</p><p/><p>But Senator Nunn, I'll address this in a Democratic perspective than a Republican perspective, the idea is you even try to slow that momentum in spending, and address that growth in population. You -- you are torpedoing benefits that are sacrosanct.</p><p/><p>How do you get people around the notion you're trying to save those benefits or they're gone?</p><p/><p>NUNN: Well, I don't think a torpedo should apply when you're treading a line that continues to grow up. You're just not making the trajectory as sharp.</p><p/><p>We have to tell younger people, frankly, you're going to have to save more money because by the time you retire, the age of retirement may go up somewhat. That happens over a long period of time. And we may have to say on cost to living type adjustments over a long period of time...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Easy solutions, never offered -- never ever offered...</p><p/><p>NUNN: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: ...never accepted by enough to get that ball moving forward.</p><p/><p>NUNN: Well, they've been offered -- they've been offered on the floor of the Senate, even when I was there, several times a week...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're actually right about that.</p><p/><p>NUNN: We never had a majority vote for them. You're right about that.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Senators...</p><p/><p>BENNETT: I wrote -- I wrote a bill...</p><p/><p>NUNN: People never understood the problem. People have to understand it. When they do, the American people, I'm confident, will support...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Oh, no, I think you're right. I think you're right. But Senator Bennett, it's getting past that hurdle, right, to get the word out to them.</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Yes, well, I -- I wrote a bill that was -- that did exactly the things that Senator Nunn is talking about. And it was scored by the administrators, the board of trustees, if that's the proper term of the Social Security administration, as a 100 percent fix of Social Security that would -- would make Social Security safe in perpetuity.</p><p/><p>And I took it to the Republican leader and said, this is what we ought to be doing. And he said, Bob, that'll be the Republican position. And we'll get behind it as soon as you get your first Democratic cosponsor. And so I walked across the aisle and sat down with some of my Democratic friends and laid it out. And they said, you know, this is great. This is -- this will solve the problem.</p><p/><p>And we'll get behind it. We'll join you right after the election.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Well, you know, there we were. One point I really want to make, that Washington's the only place I know where, when you give somebody more this year than you gave them last year, that's called a cut.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That's a very good point. And it's a point I want to pick up on.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Because you're giving them less than they were promised.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Less than what they were expecting. I'm going to swirl (ph) it a little bit because that is something that we get wrong in the media, this idea of cuts, when you're actually talking about slowing the growth of something, to Senator Nunn's point, about making sure that line doesn't go up as much as it presently is.</p><p/><p>The debate over -- the very words we use in this debate after this.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Fair and balanced -- we've got former Senator Bob Bennett, former Senator Sam Nunn, debating what we do now on -- on the debt. And you're quite right, gentlemen. Normally, this stuff comes up in detail in bravery (ph) after an election.</p><p/><p>But Senator Nunn, do you -- if Barack Obama is reelected, the argument is, right now, we're hearing a lot of Democrats -- not all are already planning spending initiatives of their own. In other words, to keep the spigots spigotting, nothing changes.</p><p/><p>Republicans, conversely if <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>were to win, are planning a lot of more military and the like spending. How do we disavow each side of its knee-jerk inclination to spend on industry's favored to its Party?</p><p/><p>Senator Nunn, to you first.</p><p/><p>NUNN: Well, I thought, hope that the debate will produce some more honest dialogue. And then right after the election, whoever is elected, whether it's President Obama or <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>we face the fiscal cliff in January. And almost all economists left or right or center, say that that would cause a high-risk of another recession, a deep recession.</p><p/><p>So what I would like to see instead of the fiscal cliff that we face, and instead of kicking that can down the road six months, why don't we change cans? Why don't we use Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin or some legislative combination of those, substitute it for the cliff and say, OK, you've got six months.</p><p/><p>You can overturn it. You may not like it. But it's a lot better than what we face right now. So why not substitute a logical and sane default position for what we have facing us now.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Senator Bennett, what in your gut, do you think, they will do? I mean, regardless who wins in November, the prevailing wisdom is they either delay these cuts, try to screw around with sequestration so that the cuts are put off a little bit or all the Bush rates don't expire immediately -- a glorified way of kicking the can down the road. What do you think will happen?</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Well, I think the suggestion that Senator Nunn has just made is exactly the right thing we ought to do -- we ought to see them do. I do not see sequestration, a fiscal cliff.</p><p/><p>I see Congress blinking very big time and saying, well, let's delay this.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: We've got a lame duck session that decides that?</p><p/><p>BENNETT: No, no, I think...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p/><p>BENNETT: ...maybe they'll do it in the lame duck. They come back on the third of January, do it quickly well or just put it off a little while while we talk about it because no one wants to be responsible for their consequences that would come if they did nothing.</p><p/><p>So the instinct is well, let's just put it off a little while, while we talk about it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes, well, we've done that forever.</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Let's not...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But Senator Nunn, to that point...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BENNETT: ...that's not a solution. That's not a solution.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I agree with you.</p><p/><p>BENNETT: That's not a solution.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But Senator Nunn, to that point, if we end up doing something like that, are we reinforcing the credit ratings agencies' desire to downgrade us, that that's the stuff of Banana Republic's and that (ph) now, there's going to be hell to pay for doing it.</p><p/><p>NUNN: Well, I think Bob is basically correct. Yes, it's - it's an issue of rating agency. But the fundamental issue is a moral issue and a generational issue. And beyond the numbers, we can deal with the numbers - - all sorts of people on both sides that can work this thing out.</p><p/><p>But the real signal to the markets and to the world and our own country is that this government cannot function. That's a more dangerous signal than even the numbers.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you think, Senator Bennett, that if we don't make a move and soon, the message to the markets will be, sell-off like crazy?</p><p/><p>BENNETT: The one thing that disturbs markets more than anything else is uncertainty. And Sam has just described the biggest uncertainty of all, which is will the U.S. government be able to function? There are...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, let me keep -- we're going to go a little longer if we...</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: ... I want to hear what you're saying, that if we -- if we don't act immediately, what you're saying, Senator Bennett, is that you can't keep pulling this stunt, that -- that this time, there would be hell to pay for that?</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Well, I think, GDP growth would continue to be sluggish, if indeed, not tip over into another recession, just because, as has been pointed out in previous versions of this, there are trillions of dollars waiting on the sidelines for some sense of certainty...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p/><p>BENNETT: ...to come into the economy and investment. And if the federal government can't get its act together...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: If they get -- if they get their act together and respond...</p><p/><p>BENNETT: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: ...that...</p><p/><p>BENNETT: That money won't come in.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I'm sorry. Senator Nunn, sorry, pressed for time here. I just want to make be clear on something. And do you think then that there would be a collapse or would these sequestration cuts just cuts off the growth of spending in the military and all these others, over 10 years no less. Are they really that draconian, that there would be that kind of a hell to pay?</p><p/><p>NUNN: Well, to change all our previous habits but it's not draconian. We make modest changes now or everyday or month or a year. We wait. The changes have to be more dramatic.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No, I understand. But these sequestration cuts that everyone all but calls doomsday -- are they really that doomsday?</p><p/><p>NUNN: Well, it's a huge increase in taxes. And it's a very large cut of expenditures. All at once, it's not...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All at once, yes.</p><p/><p>NUNN: All at once. This is sudden and it's in a fragile economy. So no one knows precisely what's going to happen. But you know, I think we're right in the middle of Winston Churchill's prophecy where he said that America will always do the right thing after its tried every other alternative.</p><p/><p>We don't know how long we're going to have to get through with the alternatives and do the right thing. No one can predict that.</p><p/><p>The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable. And it happens as we've seen in Europe very rapidly.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: A very good point. The markets are comfortable until they're not comfortable. That is a very good point.</p><p/><p>Gentlemen, thank you both very, very much.</p><p/><p>NUNN: Thank you, Neil. Thank you, Bob.</p><p/><p>BENNETT: You bet.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Progress is possible, folks. More after this.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, now, it is going to get busy -- very, very busy. The first big debate in Denver, coming up on Wednesday night. We're there. A little more than a week after that, the vice presidential debate, then we've got yet another presidential debate wrapping things up with the final Obama- Romney clash.</p><p/><p>We're on each and every single one because it's your money. It's your life. And we mean it when we say it. We like to travel and we like to look out for you.

Welcome, everybody. I am <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And add a possible war with Syria to Congress to do less. When it gets back from vacation, as if a budget deadline and a debt limit deadline and defund Obamacare or don't defund Obamacare deadline, and than immigration reform deadline, and so many other deadlines. As if all of these deadlines were not enough, now this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why I do not - I want to move beyond this fixation with Syria. Do you really think this is just about Syria and do you really think this is about a president who suddenly cares about not going over the head of Congress after years of pushing through executive orders and regulations that (inaudible) that routinely defied Congress. And just as telling last week, when the president was saying when it came to Syria, he really did not need the approval of the Congress.</p><p>Now, this is about confusing Congress, maybe even embarrassing Congress and all of the nine days it will be in session this month, once again, ridiculing Congress and getting Americans to focus, maybe not so much on the president punting, but on Congress, once again, not governing. Now, he could come out smelling like a rose, even though he has given Congress nothing but thorns. But on whom he will pile, probably, all the blame. And is at this point, that the president steps back and says, well, I tried their way. Now the president isn't saying that yet, but it's pretty clear, his confidant informer campaign manager David Axelrod is thinking that right now tweeting that Congress suddenly is the dog that caught the car. I guess that means that Congress was chasing down to Syria in (inaudible) car? And now that it's caught, it has no idea what the hell to do with it or about it?</p><p>Well, me - I have had enough of it, because the only thing I liken to a dog and all of its pile on his, you know, pile of you know what, it's leading in its way, spending bills that never get done, budget reform that never gets touched, a tax makeover that never gets started. You smell what I smell? You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to smell it. It's the same smell. One we both smell before, long before Syria and I suspect, long after Syria. And even if Congress does want to make things right, Washington watcher Chris Stirewalt says they better boogie (ph) fast, because they don't have time to do much. If anything at all.</p><p>Chris, realistically, nine days, this month what can they do?</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, they can fight, they can posture, they can shove, they can yell, I think in the end they will have to be here more than those nine days. As you enumerated, aside from the odors that you talked about, there is work to be done. As you said, the continuing resolution funding the government expires at the end of September. You also have, as you said, the rollout of the free stuff (inaudible), the president's help while people can sign up for Obamacare on the first of October. You've got that. And then you have Jack Lew dropped the flag on the debt Derby, that ceiling has to go up in the middle of October - by the middle of October, he says. So, it's all running. Something has got to happen. Syria is related in this way, too. We have sequestration, spending levels that are in place. For the military and non-defense spending across the federal government. Democrats want to get non-defense spending up, if we're dropping billions of dollars worth of bombs on Syria. That's going to make it tougher, and - I suspect you'll hear hawkish Republicans like John McCain and others, saying well, if we're bombing Syria, we need to get rid of these caps on increased spending. We call it sequestration.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're going to be talking to a member who is advocating just that. You get my vote to just stop this military sequestration cuts. But having said that, that would be great harm, where there not, if we are going to go to war to be dealing with these annoying pesky financial issues that could bring the government down or shut it down or get it into a debt limit crisis? Wouldn't that play to the president's favor just to have this backdrop and not drop any of these other surprises?</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, I would say that David Axelrod is whistling past the graveyard a little bit on this. If the president of the United States is rebuffed by Congress on the fall to attack another country that is a pretty stinging defeat, and they can slap chop, they can divide (inaudible) however they want. But it will not be good if the president cannot get his way. And we should remember, he was forced to go to Congress. He wanted to do what he did with the attack on Libya, which was to say that it had been approved by an international buddy, in that case, the United Nations and the Arab League, unable to obtain - or not the United Nations, NATO, unable to obtain the cooperation of Great Britain, and without the initial help of the Arab League, the president had no choice, but to do what American presidents hate to do, which is go to Congress.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, flying in the face of what he had said. Really, just 48 hours earlier.</p><p>STIREWALT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Chris, thank you, my friend. Good having you again.</p><p>STIREWALT: You bet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, forget about all these issues piling up. Retired Army General Robert Scales has focused on the real damage of the president throwing his hands up, particularly on Syria, where he all but announced the terror threat around the world - or keep terrorizing the world. General, what do you think of this?</p><p>GEN. ROBERT SCALES, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, you know, Neil, anytime we have these conversations I invoke the wisdom of First Sergeant Braun (ph). I know in Vietnam when I had my dithering moments, Sergeant Braun would say captain, always remember rule 13. Rule 13? Yeah, rule 13 says when in charge, take charge. And rule 13 applies whether you are a captain in the Army or the commander-in-chief. Look, whether we shoot missiles or we don't shoot missiles. When this is all over, the rest of the world and the American people are going to look at this, and scratch their heads over the process, the witness, the dithering, the inner articulation of Wednesday (ph). This since of a loss of will. You know, there is an old - there's an old strategic concept that says military power is equal to capabilities times will. No one doubts our capabilities, but people throughout the world and inside this country, are beginning to question our will. Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, you also mentioned, you know, this view that some people ask. That we're not consistent, to put it mildly. And I was always telling people, what do you for, or against or getting involved in Syria, whatever it is, whatever you decided or whatever you want to do, telegraph it immediately and don't sort of dither about it, whether you are not going to be involved, Mr. President, make that very clear. You see, the reason and the story certainly don't draw a red line. You do draw a redline, act on that redline pronto, because any dithering, any waiting just to me kind of emboldens our enemies. But what is your sense of it?</p><p>SCALES: I absolutely agree. You know, there's an old (inaudible), that whenever a nation takes an e (ph), whenever a nation goes - or pauses in an operation, the advantage of the initiative and time shifts to the enemy. And if anybody thinks that Assad isn't going to take advantage of these nine days, or these 13 days to reposition his forces, to gain allegiances in the region, to strengthen his own power, and also to pound his own people with missiles and artillery is wrong. Nine days of inaction shifts the advantage to the enemy, and so we get involved what - two weeks from now? And we wind up basically bouncing sand.</p><p>CAVUTO: Amazing. General, thank you.</p><p>SCALES: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, media magnate Mort Zuckerman says it could be even worse than that. Forget about how the president is seen in the eyes of the bad guys, the way he's indecisive, this is playing out on the global media, is not exactly proving a ringing endorsement from - for the rest of the world. Guys. What is going on?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN, BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR: Well, what is going on is really an interesting question, because it is almost incomprehensible to witness what is going on. And to try and understand that given, a, the nature of the political system of the United States and B, what the president himself has said, so I'd like to read some of the things that he has said, so I get it right. When he first came into office, and we're now dealing with the much more serious issue, not just Syria but Iran and they're both connected because the credibility that we would have had, if we had done something in Syria, might have had a bigger effect on Iran. Now, the lack of credibility or the collapse of credibility will completely change that whole theater of the world.</p><p>So, Barack Obama shortly after his first election said to use all elements of American power, and I quote, \"to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions\" and he said last year that a nuclear Iran would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the stability of the global economy as well as risk triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty.</p><p>Now, what has happened in Syria have so undermined the international credibility of his entire policy, that the recent failure to respond to the chemical attacks by Syria will affect the credibility and viability of everything we have done so far, which is the core of America's programs and attitudes and credibility vis-a-vis Iran. Now, there is a suggestion we state to hear that the Arab Leagues did not support that. I'm going to read you from the resolutions of the Arab League. OK? Number one is the call upon the United Nations, this just came out - the call upon the United Nations and the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by taking firm and dissuasive means - measures against the perpetrators of this crime, for which the Syrian regime was responsible and to put an end to such violations and crimes of genocide that the Syrian regime has been committing for more than two years.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that the whole Arab League saying that, or is it just some of them?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: No, no, it's all the Arab League. No, no, no, it's virtually all, except two - and let me just - I can go on about this, OK? They strongly condemned and denounced this atrocious crime, this is virtually all of them, with the exception of two countries. To strongly condemn and denounce this atrocious crime, in which internationally prohibited chemical weapons were used in flagrant denial of ethical and humanitarian values as well as international laws and usages. I could go on about that, but ..</p><p>CAVUTO: But even they are saying that, now post this decision or non- decision ...</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: No, this meeting was just held in the last - yes, right after the ...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, could they be saying, they though attack would have been imminent, now that it's looking like it might not be imminent, they are getting worried?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh, no, they are very worried that he United States has basically abdicated the long-standing leadership role that we have played in the Middle East, and we have a lot of allies in that part of the world who are critical to us.</p><p>CAVUTO: What does Israel say?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, Israel of course is the one who's now faced with a huge problem of trying to deal, A, not only with Syria, but with Iran. Iran is a country that has been threatening Israel, and Israel of course on one level, it's going to do whatever it takes to defend themselves. They have a simply theory of life, because everybody knows that Iran is literally several months away at the very most of having a deliverable nuclear weapon.</p><p>CAVUTO: So they are interpreting that our lack of strong, immediate response in Syria telegraphs we will have the same posture with Iran?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: Without question, that whole part of the world.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you agree with it?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: What else can you think about, when you have the president who comes out and says what he says and then does what he does? How can you believe what he says?</p><p>CAVUTO: So it's vacillating more than any specific position is what has rattled folks, right?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: Of course, nobody -- the president of the United States has to be believed, he has to maintain his credibility. A lot of what we say, we hope, is going to prevent doing things that we don't want to do. We don't want to go to war. That is not what the United States is about. What we want to do is to protect the interests of ourselves and our allies, and there are a number of Arab countries who are our allies, and now they have lost faith in the United States, because they see that whatever he says is not necessarily what he does.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think, then, Mort, that the president regrets the famous red line remark, that it boxed him into a corner and he is scrambling to get out?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN: I don't know how to measure what he says or what he feels or what he believes at the time he says it, how he changes his mind. That is his job. But his job is also to make sure there is a consistency to what he says, because you cannot just say X on one day, and then say excuse me, I did not mean X, I mean Y. And then say, well, I didn't really mean Y. The president has to have that credibility and consistency, and if he does not have it, he cannot perform on behalf of the United States with our foreign policy and with the credibility it needs. We don't want to go to war every day to prove we are credible. You have to have somebody who, when he says something, everybody knows he means it.</p><p>The only time the Iranians held back on their nuclear weapons program was when the prime minister of Israel said if they got to a certain kind of a level of nuclear capability, the Israelis would act, so even though they could have crossed that line to date, the Iranians have held back, they understand who is to be believed. And now they will not come to the conclusion that this president is to be believed or to be feared.</p><p>CAVUTO: Mort, powerful stuff. Thank you, my friend, Mort Zuckerman.</p><p>Even Charlie is wrangling with the president on this one, because this decorated Korean War hero has a bone to pick with Barack Obama he says is not exactly acting heroic. Charlie unplugged, here and only here. But before we get back to Syria, Charlie later in the show, a look at the other drama that is being overshadowed by this Syria (inaudible). Remember those NSA spies? Lots more of them than you thought. Guess what? They are not working at the NSA. A whole bunch of them are just a point and click away. You use them every day even now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Here is what feeds conspiracy theories on Syria. It is all but overshadowing serious spying abuses right here in the U.S. of A. And even now, in fact, more than even right now, the latest reports that Facebook and Twitter and Google have snoops that put those NSA snoops to shame, not just invading our privacy, to hear Katrina Pierson tell it, trampling on it. What is really going on here, Katrina?</p><p>KATRINA PIERSON: Here we are again finding out more and more things about who is reading our emails and who aren't. There was an independent research study that came out that showed that not only are some of these big tech giants reading our emails, but they are also clicking on specific links, which means your attachments are probably also being opened. But then I guess they figure if our government is doing it, it must be legal.</p><p>CAVUTO: Katrina, are they doing it at the government's behest or on their own? And if so, why?</p><p>PIERSON: That is the thing. Initially, they said, well, the government tells us we have to release this information, but this particular study said absolutely not. They sent out emails, personal emails with protected particular links, and they found that six out of the 50 they sent this through, through the networks, actually clicked on the link, including Google and Facebook. So really, what is the responsibility going on, and where is accountability in Congress on our privacy being violated? We need to start up and get out there and let Congress know they have got to get these companies under control.</p><p>CAVUTO: It is one thing for them to do something at the strong behest if not court order of the NSA or another government agency, it is quite another to take that power into their own, and it's already come up with issues about how they market things, how they share information, but this goes deeper than that, doesn't it?</p><p>PIERSON: That's the thing. We have to wonder why Congress is allowing this to happen. We already know that big business and government have a sinister marriage going on, and when we look at Google and Facebook and the political donors that come out of these companies to these politicians, it makes you wonder why there is no political will to do anything about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: So now where is all of this going? We know the NSA sort of cracked down, has sort of cracked up in the middle of this focus on Syria. I am sure the guys at the NSA love it. I'm sure the president likes that distraction. Many cynics argue it is the reason why Syria has been dumped in Congress' lap. So where do you think it's going??</p><p>PIERSON: I am not sure, and I do think it is a distraction. You mentioned earlier about some of the other issues Congress is going to have to take on, for example funding Obamacare, immigration and all these other things. So I think there are a lot of shiny objects being dropped into the room to divert attention to things really pressing American citizens today.</p><p>CAVUTO: Katrina, thank you very much, Katrina Pierson. While this is going on as we speak, despite all the huffing and puffing.</p><p>Well this Syria thing is apparently like the deflecting gift that keeps giving. Not only getting our eye off the spying still going on here ball, but you would not believe this latest doozy on health care ball. Guess what will happen very soon? While all these guys are knee deep in Syria debating. I will give you a clue. It has something to do with unions. I want to give you another clue -- it has something to do with them getting a big present too.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, under the cover of war there, a kamikaze attack by unions right here? Because mark my words, I told you this, while we're all focused on this do we or don't we get involved in Syria thing, general Richard Trumka will pull off one of the greatest stealth victories in the sordid history, short as it is, of this health care law thing. Without anyone knowing, he will have secured the exemption for unions on some of the law's most costly provisions, including the higher fees for Cadillac plans that dominate many unions plans, and ways around employer switching to too many part-time workers that could kill union workers. Only you won't know much about it, because I suspect no one will really cover because the world is too busy focusing on Damascus than unions pulling a fast one in DC. Julie Roginsky I am sure agrees with that point of view, but we'll get to her in a second. Jedediah Bila, to you first on whether that is a real possibility?</p><p>JEDEDIAH BILA: I think they're going to cave to the unions, and I think it's because for Barack Obama to say we don't need union support in the midterm elections would be ridiculous. The unions came out in support of Obamacare, and I think there were a lot of backroom deals and a lot of meetings that went on where the unions acknowledged that there were some things about this law that they did not necessarily like from the start, but they let Barack Obama know, we are allies here, and if we come out and we say we don't like this, you're going to need to mend those things. You're going to need to really account, be accountable to us, because we are the ones who helped you get elected twice, and we are the ones who are going to help your friends get elected over and over. So I think there will be a lot of caving, particularly with respect to the Cadillac tax and with respect to the concern about this influx of full-time workers going to part-time and what that does to a 40-hour workweek for union members.</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't think they are that sinister. I think they are stupid. But I will say this with all respect to Jedediah, a lot of them if they had just read the bill, they would have realized it added up and we are screwed. But they did not do that. But now they, like any group that feels it's offended and gotten a delay or extension or exemption, they want in, too.</p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY: Yes, I will say something that will offend my friends in the union movement, but that is what collective bargaining is for. Don't send me hate mail, I get it. But you know--</p><p>CAVUTO: It's nice your hate mail is bipartisan.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA: -- civil \"Cavuto Clash.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: I could see under the darkness of all of this other stuff going on in Syria, some waivers that would be vague (ph), a new line in the bill that this applies to everyone but public union workers, it would not even be that blatant but it would be understood that they have gotten a pass.</p><p>ROGINSKY: It could happen. But as I said, it shouldn't.</p><p>CAVUTO: It will.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I don't know if it will happen. We will see.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: Want to place one dollar on this?</p><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA: I have $1, that's all about all I have, but I'll put a dollar on it.</p><p>ROGINSKY: I don't know if it will happen, but I sympathize with the unions, I get where they're coming from, but this is something to deal with the collective bargaining.</p><p>CAVUTO: (inaudible), who will be paying for it.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Well, as we've discussed--</p><p>CAVUTO: You and me.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Not you and I, because your health insurance is not going to change. I don't think they are going to get rid of health care insurance here at News Corp.</p><p>CAVUTO: You don't think my premiums have not gone up? Your premiums have not gone up?</p><p>ROGINSKY: My premiums went up well before Barack Obama came to office.</p><p>CAVUTO: You don't think it's accelerated? You don't think it will continue to accelerate?</p><p>ROGINSKY: Not once Obamacare kicks in.</p><p>BILA: Young people are going to help pay for it, who don't need insurance.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Sure they do.</p><p>BILA: But have been mandated--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: We don't know what is coming, but I do want to address at another time here--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Who says Secretary of State John Kerry is not every bit as good as his boss at it? One moment he is turning up the heat on Syria at the State Department, and the next he is talking about the heat via a video address to a climate conference in the Marshall Islands.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KERRY: Climate change is a global crisis, and it will require a global solution, one that includes shared resources, shared responsibility, and a shared sense of urgency above all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Don't get me wrong, I am all for worrying about sweating, but shouldn't our secretary of state right now be sweating more about Syria? That's just me, Jedediah.</p><p>BILA: He wants to talk about everything but the real, legitimate, scary, frightening problem at hand.</p><p>CAVUTO: He is talking about--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA: I love all this talk about climate change. We all agree climate change exists. That's not the argument, John Kerry. The argument is how much of it is man-made. And how much government involvement should we have? Should we have pro free market approaches to address this problem or should we expand big government via stimulus or however you want to argue it in order to address the problem? So stop painting folks on the right as those who don't care about climate change in order to make a political point right now. You want to talk politics? Right now talk Syria. That's what you need to be talking about.</p><p>CAVUTO: Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY: First of all, a Princeton University study came out a couple of days ago or weeks ago that actually said that climate change is linked to crisis, and that climate change is linked to more violence, so I think John Kerry is right to worry about this, because apparently according to the study, if global--</p><p>CAVUTO: It's making (inaudible).</p><p>ROGINSKY: Well--</p><p>CAVUTO: It makes despots more despot-like?</p><p>ROGINSKY: No, but it does make people more desperate when they have to fight over resources, and when they don't have resources to fight, when they have less, fewer resources to have, they are going to fight over that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: The point he is making is it is a global threat. It is a global threat to security, and if you look at the study, and I think the study is very telling, what it says essentially is that by 2050, if temperatures go up by 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which apparently they might, they will have a chance of doubling--</p><p>CAVUTO: And that is man-made? And (inaudible) needs us to pay for it?</p><p>ROGINSKY: First of all, you wanted a free market approach? How about the fact that we had a free market approach, cap and trade, something that the Republicans originally--</p><p>BILA: That's not a free market approach.</p><p>ROGINSKY: That is something the Republicans originally talked about--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: -- walk, talk and chew gum at the same time?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA: Right now is not the time. You turn on the news right now, you see massive coverage of Syria, everyone in this country, no matter where you stand on the issue, is focused on this. John Kerry should not be pivoting right now to talk about climate change.</p><p>CAVUTO: But by the same token, many on the right will argue as I argued in the outset, do not use Syria as an excuse not to do anything else, not to address budget, not to--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA: -- a great time to expand government influence over the issue of climate change as the entire country is focused on our potential catastrophic involvement in Syria? He thinks this is the key time right now, today, to talk about climate change?</p><p>ROGINSKY: Is there ever a good time? There is always something going on. If we don't address this right now.</p><p>BILA: There is not always Syria going on.</p><p>ROGINSKY: First, there was Libya, then there was Egypt. Now there is a Syria.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: We had Iraq for 10 years.</p><p>CAVUTO: But there is always time for golf.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Days after his announcement that he's given to Congress, just hours after, he is golfing.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Are we really going to start comparing presidential vacations?</p><p>CAVUTO: Not at all. I just find it interesting.</p><p>BILA: The optics are not good. No matter how you slice it, the optics of him talking about climate change -- you could argue climate change is an important issue, just politically speaking the optics are not good for this right now.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Except for the fact that the majority of Americans agree that something needs to be done about climate change.</p><p>BILA: I agree, but I still think optically there is a problem.</p><p>ROGINSKY: There is always something going on. If we don't tackle this today, if we don't do this today, people are going to die tomorrow, and that is something we have to acknowledge, and that's something people, climate change deniers don't want to believe it, but it is happening. It is already happening if you look at the studies and it will continue to exacerbate.</p><p>CAVUTO: I could talk about global cycle patterns of weather and generational shifts and you could attach a very expensive solution to what you call a man-made problem, we can differ until the cows come home, but I find the timing odd.</p><p>ROGINSKY: (inaudible) timing is odd, I think you guys will never think there's good timing to do that.</p><p>BILA: I think there's good timing, plenty of good timing, and I think it is an important debate to have over government involvement versus how we address this, and it is a global challenge.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: -- don't use it as a (inaudible) distraction on the things we don't like. And conversely, liberals have to (inaudible) that we can't just force companies to pay for every environmental ill you attach to man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY: We could spend more time repealing Obamacare for the 41st time. Or we could focus on things we actually might--</p><p>CAVUTO: I would like to repeal you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't mean it.</p><p>ROGINSKY: You just told me you're my last friend, now you dumped me. You dumped me too.</p><p>BILA: At least you have me.</p><p>ROGINSKY: Thank you, Jedediah.</p><p>CAVUTO: Between you and Colmes.</p><p>All right, when we come back, the president asked for when he put the Syria in Congress' hand. Congress demands the president dropped all those military secrets cuts or using getting his vote.</p><p>CAVUTO: The talk to Republicans in the House say they will now support the president on Syria so John Boehner and Eric Cantor are in. As for the rest of the troops on the right, let's not say all in and my guest says drop the military sequester cuts, Mr. President, or you can drop my support for those Syria strikes.</p><p>That Republican congressman is Michael Turner's offer on Damascus. Congressman, have you gotten any response from the White House?</p><p>REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R), OHIO: No, and just as we have not seen any leadership from the president with respect to his sequestration, his proposed sequestration, which I have opposed that is having devastating effects on our military. Now he wants to draw us into an additional conflict with Syria without addressing the issue that's affecting our men and women in uniform and certainly affecting the performance of our military.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm sure you don't want to negotiate deals, is but if possible salvo back from the Democrats, all right, let's drop all sequestration cuts including the ones for defense, what do you say then?</p><p>TURNER: Well, in order to set the sequestration cuts aside, there have to be meaningful cuts elsewhere. The president embraced that himself when he proposed it and he put together the \"Super Committee\" that was supposed to propose those cut. With his withdrawal their failure resulted in the White House having the responsibility to come forward with those proposals.</p><p>The House passed two bills that would have set aside the sequestration by finding those cuts responsibly elsewhere. The Senate has passed none and the president still today has no response. Meanwhile, our military, we're hearing from the secretary is continuing to pay the price.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Speaker John Boehner has said he is confident that Republicans will share his view about the urgency of this. That you will go along and support fugitive strikes against Syria. It sounds to me that unless you get this you won't.</p><p>TURNER: Well, it depends. The president has not really made that case not to the American public or to the international community and certainly not to Congress. He does not appear to have any strategy here. We certainly don't know who we are for and also he has an unexplainable policy of this imaginary red line where the administration --</p><p>CAVUTO: I am not sure what that means. But the case that he has stated and you're right, it has been all over the map, but he has said he is not interested in regime change. So in other words, Assad stays in power, but he would very crippled, very weak and thereby I guess, getting the White House's argument setting the stage for him to be overthrown is not good enough for you?</p><p>TURNER: Well, I think certainly the president has indicated that he would like regime change in Syria, but the issue is that he declared this imaginary red line for the use of chemical weapons then redefined it to large-scale use of chemical weapons and now acknowledging that they were used previously. He clearly has not made the case internationally or to the American public or to Congress as to what our national interest? What are the risks and really who are we for?</p><p>The president had months, while hundreds of thousands of people had died in Syria, to address this issue and now at this crisis point trying to draw us into this crisis and a conflict with Syria without addressing what is happening currently in the Department of Defense as a result of his sequestration.</p><p>CAVUTO: But he has drawn in the House speaker. He has drawn in John McCain. He has drawn in a number of prominent Republican leaders maybe not you -- your speaker was not. So I guess what I'm asking you if your speaker came to you and said, Congressman, I really need you on this to support this. It sounds to me at this point, you would tell him no?</p><p>TURNER: Absolutely. At this point, the president is going to have to make the case that he has not made. He doesn't have a strategy. He has unexplainable policy and unless he does his homework done. I mean, the president has the responsibility to do his homework to get the international community together, to get Congress and the American public behind it. He has not done this. He has managed this as a crisis mode and I do not think that is a manner in which we should be heading into a conflict.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Congressman Turner, thank you very much.</p><p>TURNER: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, switching gears a little bit, are you ready for Samsung's smart watch? You know, it is beating Apple to the punch, but could I ask you something, do you really give a damn?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, now I know why Rolex sales have not been hurting. Apparently all this talk of a super cool smart watch from Samsung no one is biting or for that matter even buzzing. Tomorrow we'll know for sure when Samsung details its latest Dick Tracy wanna-be. But the company's only claim to fame here may be that it beat Apple to the punch offering this.</p><p>Tech analyst Lee Munson says what sounds cool, is it necessarily cool especially in a world where a lot of people express their status in life by the pricey stuff they put on their wrist. So if isn't Swiss, is the smart watch a miss, what do you think?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO LLC CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: Well, I mean, here's the thing. If you are going to look for tomorrow's big announcement from Samsung that they are going to say we have the best new, the iPad, the smartphone of the future and the solution to Syria and the affordable care act, you're not going to get it. And that is what investors want tomorrow.</p><p>They want to know that some company has the new great driver of earnings to pummel Apple or be a big competitor, you're not. What you do have is something very much like back in 1996 when the first Palm Pilot came out. This smartphone you're going to see tomorrow, it's going to have a limited appeal for a limited market.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with that, but again if you have the wrong context or the attachment to what you think is going to happen tomorrow, you are going to be very disappointed and I think that is what going to happen to a lot of investors and viewers out there unless we set them straight today.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so for a smart watch, Dick Tracy watch, it's been talked about for decades, right? I mean, is it really that much demand for it. Now I'm hardly any -- but to me this sounds stupid. I think if you look at the watch, you look at the time or the date, but for the other stuff what becomes of all the other devices that you do depend on?</p><p>MUNSON: You know, I don't think it is clear what people are really going to use it for. For instance, all the leaks that we are getting and all the blogs is that what we're going to see tomorrow really is about people like myself who were into going to the gym all the time. So they are talking about, you know, it takes pictures of the food you eat and maybe the sophisticated heart rate monitor.</p><p>CAVUTO: But they have those types of devices. They have those types of devices. Now maybe they combine some of those features to give you the time and the day and the temperature and what they're eating in Bolivia but, come on, right?</p><p>MUNSON: Listen, I am not disagreeing with you, but I think that we do have to have -- there is a context. You are going to be disappointed as anybody who thinks this is going to be more than a cool little toy. I grant you. I do think that if you what status, you are going to buy an actual wrist watch that will never goes on or off line.</p><p>I mean, that's just cool to have something that you don't have to turn off when you're on an airplane, but I think the more important thing is investors, your viewers. Don't get confused tomorrow with whatever people like us end up saying about it because Samsung is a massive vertically integrated conglomerate. What that means is they have tons of products and billions in sales.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know that, but if they beat Apple to the punch on this and let's say we don't really need this then for Apple wouldn't be better to be never than late?</p><p>MUNSON: Well, I don't think so. You know, the thing is that we don't know -- we didn't know in 1996 what a Palm Pilot was going to be used for. My wife got one shortly after. I didn't know what to use it for, for years and years because it had a very small segment. There are going to be people tomorrow. They are going to want to buy this because it's shiny and new electronic.</p><p>Sales figures I am with you. I don't think it's going to be a mindblower, but I also think that the iPod was not the first MP3 player. What they did is they perfected the MP3 player. Samsung do the R&amp;D and let the Apple do the real R&amp;D, which I like to refer to as rip-off and duplicate only better so I think time will tell.</p><p>I think Apple has to have some sort of risk product, but I think they are going to let everybody else spend the money to figure out the market and Apple usually comes in there and perfects it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, that was the old Apple. I don't know about the new Apple. Lee Munson, thank you very much.</p><p>MUNSON: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, it sounds like the president wrangled GOP leaders John Boehner and Eric Cantor, but it is a top Democrat Charlie Rangel out? When Democrats defect on Syria, is the situation for the White House getting serious?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, one thing about this Syria crisis is it's turning everything upside down. Republicans, you would think would automatically say no to the president are now increasingly saying yes and Democratic supporters like Charlie Rangel are sounding very doubtful as if he will ever say yes.</p><p>The New York congressman is on the phone with us now. Another thing you might not know about the congressman, he is a Korean war hero so he is no daisy in this race. But I want to talk to you about that part of your experience, Congressman.</p><p>The argument the White House has made that this is important to avoid wider conflicts down the road and that we have to do this to send a message. But in delaying the message and leading it in Congress, isn't he compounding that?</p><p>REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK (via telephone): First of all, we are talking about war. Whatever lines the president has drawn. Whatever commitment he may have made to international people, this is putting people in harm's way. They talk about limited war. There is no such thing as a limited war. Iraq was limited war.</p><p>We lost 6,500 American lives over the so-called limited war for a 10-year period. This is an international problem that demands an international solution, but to go into this alone with the idea to bypass the Security Council, and the United Nations, and the Arab League, the European Union, Great Britain, they tell us these people are on the line.</p><p>But this whole idea that every evil person requires such as the president of United States, that requires our troops in there, it does not make sense.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think though that throwing this in Congress is cover for the president because let's say Congress votes against this. I don't know what the read in the House. You may have a better idea than I do then the president could say I tried?</p><p>RANGEL: It's not throwing it in Congress' lap. The fact that the president has drawn a red line it does not constitute them right of the need to say we will go to war you have to come to Congress.</p><p>CAVUTO: He did it with NATO during the Bosnia situation --</p><p>RANGEL: So did Roosevelt and it's wrong. It is unconstitutional and the Congress goes along with it and you know why because they don't have their constituents for the most part that are making the sacrifice, the people from rural areas and in the cities to volunteer.</p><p>But if they go for one minute every time we went to war was in Kosovo or Panama or Iraq then the Congress will take this. We'll let the president to this. Sullivan told this morning it was about bombing and how could rethink of the loss of American lives or we have to do it because what people will think about us? We're not playing some war games. We're talking about people's lives.</p><p>CAVUTO: It sounds to me, Congressman, like you are saying that you would be against this as its defense now with the very least to lack of foreign support. So you would vote no on that basis alone?</p><p>RANGEL: You got that right. But this is international. There is no military solution to this problem. Anyone plays the case with every thread to society we have to put our military up that does not make any sense at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: Charlie Rangel, thank you very much.</p><p>RANGEL: Thank you, buddy.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the faded drums of war or much louder drums of deal? Something is perking Wall Street's interest and I suspect it's not missiles more like mergers.</p><p>CAVUTO: Big deals, big risks and big dreams, Scott Martin and Kimberly blitz to see if you buy. First up, folks, those big deals are back with a vengeance whether it's Microsoft in more than a $7 billion transaction or Verizon paying Vodafone a staggering $130 billion to go away. Signs of mergers and acquisitions are just getting going this day? Would that be a good sign, Kimberly?</p><p>KIMBERLY FOSS, EMPYRION WEALTH MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Yes, I think this is a great opportunity for the telecom industry for rise in $130 million. It's the third biggest corporate fill in history. It's going to take, Vodafone giving to Verizon. You have the 6.4 percent dividend on Vodafone and 4 percent dividend on Verizon. It's going to propel this thing to no end. It is a big buy for me.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Scott, obviously the temptation for Verizon was the possible interest rates were as low as they were so if this thinking you get $130 million monkey of its back in the name of Vodafone, you can argue the price, maybe other companies are seizing on the same rate position right now to do something like it?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO: Well, they better hurry, Neil, because we all rates are going up at a pretty alarming rate here. It's kind of interesting though, I don't know if I totally agree with Kim though because I don't really like the space, Neil. It's becoming more competitive and margins are coming in. Meaning profits are dropping.</p><p>So that to me is not a great business to be in and plus these companies especially the tech companies are using cash that's parked overseas because they don't want to repatriate it and pay U.S. taxes. So that money is limited in some degree because instead of it going back to the United States, they are buying other countries. So yes, it's great if you're the acquirer like Nokia, but I am not sure if that helps the companies like Microsoft.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys, I want to switch gears here to address this second issue, three words that don't register with me, retro hunting gear. I am told it is the rage and retailer H&amp;M is all in. Who knew camouflage meant so much cash? Nothing attracts men like military fatigue. So it must be a bulletproof fashion statement? Scott, what do you think?</p><p>MARTIN: Well, I am pretty cool, Neil. So I was ahead of this one and I've already got some orders in on this stuff. I think it's interesting. It's definitely a risk, but I think they are calculated one for H&amp;M because look at what's happened in retail, Neil. Even over the last couple of years, not just this summer where a lot of the retailers have been smashed because it is the same old same old. So I like the fact that this company is going out there and doing something different making a push perhaps into a different section just to roll some heads and see if it actually works.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think, Kim?</p><p>FOSS: Yes, I agree. I mean, no consumer should be denied and should be ignored especially the male consumer. I got to tell you they're doing the great job with the underwear and let me just tell you who knows? Maybe boxers is the next rage? I wouldn't mind if I came home and saw my husband in some chemo gear.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is a family show that maybe I am out of touch and you guys are clearly in touch. Now we know why Jeff Basos flanked down $250 million for the \"Washington Post.\" He was high as the kite or drank out of his mind or both. What else could explain his reason for going big time on \"Washington Post\" reading? Apparently, he was to usher in a new golden age for newspapers lickety-split.</p><p>But Scott, is Jeff on to something because the golden age for newspapers and I love them dearly, but I read them online, the conventional product is gone.</p><p>MARTIN: Me as well, Neil, also that was decades ago. I think regarding whenever he resigned he was lucky he came off and bought it today not four years ago because I guess they're going to get four or five times what it did today, which goes to show you, again, it's kind of like the telecom business. You know, it's not a great business to be in. Yes people go there for their news, but it is online. It's digital. So unless he has some amazing revamping that he's planned here, Neil. I don't think it is a great deal for them as far as the Amazon or other newspapers possibly up for sale.</p><p>CAVUTO: He is good at marketing stuff and if you were to do something for prime readership customers that could be the start of something. So we have the makings of making this work, but he is up again strong ties?</p><p>FOSS: I think the digital era is here to have something very innovative for a certain segment of the market, but those that don't have the physical paper. Unfortunately, they are aging and they are not buying that paper as much anymore even read online when they magnify it. So I agree with Scott. I think this is not a win-win for Jeff or for the consumer. It is going to be a hard road, but maybe we'll wait and see what happens. He is pretty innovative guy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Indeed, if he can convince people to pay for that online product then maybe it would work. He would seem to have the best shot of doing that, but it is a very tough battle. Scott and Kim, thank you both very much. That will do it. We will continue monitor the debate with Syria and how it falls out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Welcome, everybody.  I am Neil Cavuto.  And add a possible war with Syria  to Congress to do less.  When it gets back from vacation, as if a budget  deadline and a debt limit deadline and defund Obamacare or don't defund  Obamacare deadline, and than immigration reform deadline, and so many other  deadlines.  As if all of these deadlines were not enough, now this.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That's why I do not - I want to move beyond this fixation with Syria.  Do  you really think this is just about Syria and do you really think this is  about a president who suddenly cares about not going over the head of  Congress after years of pushing through executive orders and regulations  that (inaudible) that routinely defied Congress.  And just as telling last  week, when the president was saying when it came to Syria, he really did  not need the approval of the Congress.</p><p> Now, this is about confusing Congress, maybe even embarrassing Congress and  all of the nine days it will be in session this month, once again,  ridiculing Congress and getting Americans to focus, maybe not so much on  the president punting, but on Congress, once again, not governing.  Now, he  could come out smelling like a rose, even though he has given Congress  nothing but thorns.  But on whom he will pile, probably, all the blame.   And is at this point, that the president steps back and says, well, I tried  their way.  Now the president isn't saying that yet, but it's pretty clear,  his confidant informer campaign manager David Axelrod is thinking that  right now tweeting that Congress suddenly is the dog that caught the car.   I guess that means that Congress was chasing down to Syria in (inaudible)  car?  And now that it's caught, it has no idea what the hell to do with it  or about it?</p><p> Well, me - I have had enough of it, because the only thing I liken to a dog  and all of its pile on his, you know, pile of you know what, it's leading  in its way, spending bills that never get done, budget reform that never  gets touched, a tax makeover that never gets started.  You smell what I  smell?  You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to smell it.  It's  the same smell.  One we both smell before, long before Syria and I suspect,  long after Syria.  And even if Congress does want to make things right,  Washington watcher Chris Stirewalt says they better boogie (ph) fast,  because they don't have time to do much.  If anything at all.</p><p> Chris, realistically, nine days, this month what can they do?</p><p> CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Well, they can fight,  they can posture, they can shove, they can yell, I think in the end they  will have to be here more than those nine days.  As you enumerated, aside  from the odors that you talked about, there is work to be done.  As you  said, the continuing resolution funding the government expires at the end  of September.  You also have, as you said, the rollout of the free stuff  (inaudible), the president's help while people can sign up for Obamacare on  the first of October.  You've got that.  And then you have Jack Lew dropped  the flag on the debt Derby, that ceiling has to go up in the middle of  October - by the middle of October, he says.  So, it's all running.   Something has got to happen.  Syria is related in this way, too.  We have  sequestration, spending levels that are in place.  For the military and  non-defense spending across the federal government.  Democrats want to get  non-defense spending up, if we're dropping billions of dollars worth of  bombs on Syria.  That's going to make it tougher, and - I suspect you'll  hear hawkish Republicans like John McCain and others, saying well, if we're  bombing Syria, we need to get rid of these caps on increased spending.  We  call it sequestration.</p><p> CAVUTO:  We're going to be talking to a member who is advocating just that.   You get my vote to just stop this military sequestration cuts.  But having  said that, that would be great harm, where there not, if we are going to go  to war to be dealing with these annoying pesky financial issues that could  bring the government down or shut it down or get it into a debt limit  crisis?  Wouldn't that play to the president's favor just to have this  backdrop and not drop any of these other surprises? </p><p> STIREWALT:  Well, I would say that David Axelrod is whistling past the  graveyard a little bit on this.  If the president of the United States is  rebuffed by Congress on the fall to attack another country that is a pretty  stinging defeat, and they can slap chop, they can divide (inaudible)  however they want.  But it will not be good if the president cannot get his  way.  And we should remember, he was forced to go to Congress.  He wanted  to do what he did with the attack on Libya, which was to say that it had  been approved by an international buddy, in that case, the United Nations  and the Arab League, unable to obtain - or not the United Nations, NATO,  unable to obtain the cooperation of Great Britain, and without the initial  help of the Arab League, the president had no choice, but to do what  American presidents hate to do, which is go to Congress.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yeah, flying in the face of what he had said.  Really, just 48  hours earlier.</p><p> STIREWALT:  Yes.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Chris, thank you, my friend.  Good having you again.</p><p> STIREWALT:  You bet.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, forget about all these issues piling up.  Retired Army  General Robert Scales has focused on the real damage of the president  throwing his hands up, particularly on Syria, where he all but announced  the terror threat around the world - or keep terrorizing the world.   General, what do you think of this?</p><p> GEN. ROBERT SCALES, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Well, you know, Neil, anytime we  have these conversations I invoke the wisdom of First Sergeant Braun (ph).   I know in Vietnam when I had my dithering moments, Sergeant Braun would say  captain, always remember rule 13.  Rule 13?  Yeah, rule 13 says when in  charge, take charge.  And rule 13 applies whether you are a captain in the  Army or the commander-in-chief.  Look, whether we shoot missiles or we  don't shoot missiles.  When this is all over, the rest of the world and the  American people are going to look at this, and scratch their heads over the  process, the witness, the dithering, the inner articulation of Wednesday  (ph).  This since of a loss of will.  You know, there is an old - there's  an old strategic concept that says military power is equal to capabilities  times will.  No one doubts our capabilities, but people throughout the  world and inside this country, are beginning to question our will.  Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, you also mentioned, you know, this view that some people ask.   That we're not consistent, to put it mildly.  And I was always telling  people, what do you for, or against or getting involved in Syria, whatever  it is, whatever you decided or whatever you want to do, telegraph it  immediately and don't sort of dither about it, whether you are not going to  be involved, Mr. President, make that very clear.  You see, the reason and  the story certainly don't draw a red line.  You do draw a redline, act on  that redline pronto, because any dithering, any waiting just to me kind of  emboldens our enemies.  But what is your sense of it?</p><p> SCALES:  I absolutely agree.  You know, there's an old (inaudible), that  whenever a nation takes an e (ph), whenever a nation goes - or pauses in an  operation, the advantage of the initiative and time shifts to the enemy.   And if anybody thinks that Assad isn't going to take advantage of these  nine days, or these 13 days to reposition his forces, to gain allegiances  in the region, to strengthen his own power, and also to pound his own  people with missiles and artillery is wrong.  Nine days of inaction shifts  the advantage to the enemy, and so we get involved what - two weeks from  now?  And we wind  up basically bouncing sand.</p><p> CAVUTO: Amazing.  General, thank you.</p><p> SCALES:  Thanks, Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, media magnate Mort Zuckerman says it could be even worse  than that.  Forget about how the president is seen in the eyes of the bad  guys, the way he's indecisive, this is playing out on the global media, is  not exactly proving a ringing endorsement from - for the rest of the world.   Guys.  What is going on? </p><p> MORT ZUCKERMAN, BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR:  Well, what is going on is really an  interesting question, because it is almost incomprehensible to witness what  is going on.  And to try and understand that given, a, the nature of the  political system of the United States and B, what the president himself has  said, so I'd like to read some of the things that he has said, so I get it  right.  When he first came into office, and we're now dealing with the much  more serious issue, not just Syria but Iran and they're both connected  because the credibility that we would have had, if we had done something in  Syria, might have had a bigger effect on Iran.  Now, the lack of  credibility or the collapse of credibility will completely change that  whole theater of the world.  </p><p> So, Barack Obama shortly after his first election said to use all elements  of American power, and I quote, \"to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions\" and he  said last year that a nuclear Iran would threaten the elimination of  Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the stability of the global  economy as well as risk triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and  the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty.  </p><p> Now, what has happened in Syria have so undermined the international  credibility of his entire policy, that the recent failure to respond to the  chemical attacks by Syria will affect the credibility and viability of  everything we have done so far, which is the core of America's programs and  attitudes and credibility vis-.-vis Iran.  Now, there is a suggestion we  state to hear that the Arab Leagues did not support that.  I'm going to  read you from the resolutions of the Arab League.  OK?  Number one is the  call upon the United Nations, this just came out - the call upon the United  Nations and the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by  taking firm and dissuasive means - measures against the perpetrators of  this crime, for which the Syrian regime was responsible and to put an end  to such violations and crimes of genocide that the Syrian regime has been  committing for more than two years.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is that the whole Arab League saying that, or is it just some of  them? </p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  No, no, it's all the Arab League.  No, no, no, it's virtually  all, except two  - and let me just - I can go on about this, OK?  They  strongly condemned and denounced this atrocious crime, this is virtually  all of them, with the exception of two countries.  To strongly condemn and  denounce this atrocious crime, in which internationally prohibited chemical  weapons were used in flagrant denial of ethical and humanitarian values as  well as international laws and usages.  I could go on about that, but ..</p><p> CAVUTO:  But even they are saying that, now post this decision or non- decision ...</p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  No, this meeting was just held in the last - yes, right after  the ...</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, could they be saying, they though attack would have been  imminent, now that it's looking like it might not be imminent, they are  getting worried? </p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  Oh, no, they are very worried that he United States has  basically abdicated the long-standing leadership role that we have played  in the Middle East, and we have a lot of allies in that part of the world  who are critical to us.   </p><p> CAVUTO:  What does Israel say?</p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  Well, Israel of course is the one who's now faced with a huge  problem of trying to deal, A, not only with Syria, but with Iran.  Iran is  a country that has been threatening Israel, and Israel of course on one  level, it's going to do whatever it takes to defend themselves.  They have  a simply theory of life, because everybody knows that Iran is literally  several months away at the very most of having a deliverable nuclear  weapon.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So they are interpreting that our lack of strong, immediate  response in Syria telegraphs we will have the same posture with Iran?  </p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  Without question, that whole part of the world.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you agree with it?</p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  What else can you think about, when you have the president who  comes out and says what he says and then does what he does?  How can you  believe what he says?  </p><p> CAVUTO:  So it's vacillating more than any specific position is what has  rattled folks, right?  </p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  Of course, nobody -- the president of the United States has to  be believed, he has to maintain his credibility.  A lot of what we say, we  hope, is going to prevent doing things that we don't want to do.  We don't  want to go to war.  That is not what the United States is about.  What we  want to do is to protect the interests of ourselves and our allies, and  there are a number of Arab countries who are our allies, and now they have  lost faith in the United States, because they see that whatever he says is  not necessarily what he does.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you think, then, Mort, that the president regrets the famous  red line remark, that it boxed him into a corner and he is scrambling to  get out?  </p><p> ZUCKERMAN:  I don't know how to measure what he says or what he feels or  what he believes at the time he says it, how he changes his mind.  That is  his job.  But his job is also to make sure there is a consistency to what  he says, because you cannot just say X on one day, and then say excuse me,  I did not mean X, I mean Y.  And then say, well, I didn't really mean Y.   The president has to have that credibility and consistency, and if he does  not have it, he cannot perform on behalf of the United States with our  foreign policy and with the credibility it needs.  We don't want to go to  war every day to prove we are credible.  You have to have somebody who,  when he says something, everybody knows he means it.</p><p> The only time the Iranians held back on their nuclear weapons program was  when the prime minister of Israel said if they got to a certain kind of a  level of nuclear capability, the Israelis would act, so even though they  could have crossed that line to date, the Iranians have held back, they  understand who is to be believed.  And now they will not come to the  conclusion that this president is to be believed or to be feared.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Mort, powerful stuff.  Thank you, my friend, Mort Zuckerman.  </p><p> Even Charlie is wrangling with the president on this one, because this  decorated Korean War hero has a bone to pick with Barack Obama he says is  not exactly acting heroic.  Charlie unplugged, here and only here.  But  before we get back to Syria, Charlie later in the show, a look at the other  drama that is being overshadowed by this Syria (inaudible).  Remember those  NSA spies?  Lots more of them than you thought.  Guess what?  They are not  working at the NSA.  A whole bunch of them are just a point and click away.   You use them every day even now.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Here is what feeds conspiracy theories on Syria.  It is all but  overshadowing serious spying abuses right here in the U.S. of A.  And even  now, in fact, more than even right now, the latest reports that Facebook  and Twitter and Google have snoops that put those NSA snoops to shame, not  just invading our privacy, to hear Katrina Pierson tell it, trampling on  it.  What is really going on here, Katrina?  </p><p> KATRINA PIERSON:  Here we are again finding out more and more things about  who is reading our emails and who aren't.  There was an independent  research study that came out that showed that not only are some of these  big tech giants reading our emails, but they are also clicking on specific  links, which means your attachments are probably also being opened.  But  then I guess they figure if our government is doing it, it must be legal.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katrina, are they doing it at the government's behest or on their  own?  And if so, why?  </p><p> PIERSON:  That is the thing.  Initially, they said, well, the government  tells us we have to release this information, but this particular study  said absolutely not.  They sent out emails, personal emails with protected  particular links, and they found that six out of the 50 they sent this  through, through the networks, actually clicked on the link, including  Google and Facebook.  So really, what is the responsibility going on, and  where is accountability in Congress on our privacy being violated?  We need  to start up and get out there and let Congress know they have got to get  these companies under control.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  It is one thing for them to do something at the strong behest if  not court order of the NSA or another government agency, it is quite  another to take that power into their own, and it's already come up with  issues about how they market things, how they share information, but this  goes deeper than that, doesn't it? </p><p> PIERSON:  That's the thing.  We have to wonder why Congress is allowing  this to happen.  We already know that big business and government have a  sinister marriage going on, and when we look at Google and Facebook and the  political donors that come out of these companies to these politicians, it  makes you wonder why there is no political will to do anything about it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  So now where is all of this going?  We know the NSA sort of  cracked down, has sort of cracked up in the middle of this focus on Syria.   I am sure the guys at the NSA love it.  I'm sure the president likes that  distraction.  Many cynics argue it is the reason why Syria has been dumped  in Congress' lap.  So where do you think it's going??  </p><p> PIERSON:  I am not sure, and I do think it is a distraction.  You mentioned  earlier about some of the other issues Congress is going to have to take  on, for example funding Obamacare, immigration and all these other things.   So I think there are a lot of shiny objects being dropped into the room to  divert attention to things really pressing American citizens today.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Katrina, thank you very much, Katrina Pierson.  While this is  going on as we speak, despite all the huffing and puffing.  </p><p> Well this Syria thing is apparently like the deflecting gift that keeps  giving.  Not only getting our eye off the spying still going on here ball,  but you would not believe this latest doozy on health care ball.  Guess  what will happen very soon?  While all these guys are knee deep in Syria  debating.  I will give you a clue.  It has something to do with unions.  I  want to give you another clue -- it has something to do with them getting a  big present too.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, under the cover of war there, a kamikaze attack by unions  right here?  Because mark my words, I told you this, while we're all  focused on this do we or don't we get involved in Syria thing, general  Richard Trumka will pull off one of the greatest stealth victories in the  sordid history, short as it is, of this health care law thing.  Without  anyone knowing, he will have secured the exemption for unions on some of  the law's most costly provisions, including the higher fees for Cadillac  plans that dominate many unions plans, and ways around employer switching  to too many part-time workers that could kill union workers.  Only you  won't know much about it, because I suspect no one will really cover  because the world is too busy focusing on Damascus than unions pulling a  fast one in DC.  Julie Roginsky I am sure agrees with that point of view,  but we'll get to her in a second.  Jedediah Bila, to you first on whether  that is a real possibility?  </p><p> JEDEDIAH BILA:  I think they're going to cave to the unions, and I think  it's because for Barack Obama to say we don't need union support in the  midterm elections would be ridiculous.  The unions came out in support of  Obamacare, and I think there were a lot of backroom deals and a lot of  meetings that went on where the unions acknowledged that there were some  things about this law that they did not necessarily like from the start,  but they let Barack Obama know, we are allies here, and if we come out and  we say we don't like this, you're going to need to mend those things.   You're going to need to really account, be accountable to us, because we  are the ones who helped you get elected twice, and we are the ones who are  going to help your friends get elected over and over.  So I think there  will be a lot of caving, particularly with respect to the Cadillac tax and  with respect to the concern about this influx of full-time workers going to  part-time and what that does to a 40-hour workweek for union members.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I don't think they are that sinister.  I think they are stupid.   But I will say this with all respect to Jedediah, a lot of them if they had  just read the bill, they would have realized it added up and we are  screwed.  But they did not do that.  But now they, like any group that  feels it's offended and gotten a delay or extension or exemption, they want  in, too.   </p><p> JULIE ROGINSKY:  Yes, I will say something that will offend my friends in  the union movement, but that is what collective bargaining is for.  Don't  send me hate mail, I get it.  But you know--</p><p> CAVUTO:  It's nice your hate mail is bipartisan.  </p><p> [LAUGHTER] </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BILA:  -- civil \"Cavuto Clash.\"</p><p> CAVUTO:  I could see under the darkness of all of this other stuff going on  in Syria, some waivers that would be vague (ph), a new line in the bill  that this applies to everyone but public union workers, it would not even  be that blatant but it would be understood that they have gotten a pass. </p><p> ROGINSKY:  It could happen.  But as I said, it shouldn't.</p><p> CAVUTO:  It will.  </p><p> ROGINSKY:  I don't know if it will happen.  We will see. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROGINSKY:  Want to place one dollar on this?</p><p> CAVUTO:  No.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BILA:  I have $1, that's all about all I have, but I'll put a dollar on it.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  I don't know if it will happen, but I sympathize with the  unions, I get where they're coming from, but this is something to deal with  the collective bargaining.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  (inaudible), who will be paying for it.  </p><p> ROGINSKY:  Well, as we've discussed--</p><p> CAVUTO:  You and me.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  Not you and I, because your health insurance is not going to  change.  I don't think they are going to get rid of health care insurance  here at News Corp.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You don't think my premiums have not gone up?  Your premiums have  not gone up?</p><p> ROGINSKY:  My premiums went up well before Barack Obama came to office.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You don't think it's accelerated?  You don't think it will  continue to accelerate?  </p><p> ROGINSKY:  Not once Obamacare kicks in.</p><p> BILA:  Young people are going to help pay for it, who don't need insurance.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  Sure they do.</p><p> BILA:  But have been mandated--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  We don't know what is coming, but I do want to address at another  time here--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Who says Secretary of State John Kerry is not every bit as good as  his boss at it?  One moment he is turning up the heat on Syria at the State  Department, and the next he is talking about the heat via a video address  to a climate conference in the Marshall Islands.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KERRY:  Climate change is a global crisis, and it will require a global  solution, one that includes shared resources, shared responsibility, and a  shared sense of urgency above all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Don't get me wrong, I am all for worrying about sweating, but  shouldn't our secretary of state right now be sweating more about Syria?   That's just me, Jedediah.  </p><p> BILA:  He wants to talk about everything but the real, legitimate, scary,  frightening problem at hand.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  He is talking about--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BILA:  I love all this talk about climate change.  We all agree climate  change exists.  That's not the argument, John Kerry.  The argument is how  much of it is man-made.  And how much government involvement should we  have?  Should we have pro free market approaches to address this problem or  should we expand big government via stimulus or however you want to argue  it in order to address the problem?  So stop painting folks on the right as  those who don't care about climate change in order to make a political  point right now.  You want to talk politics?  Right now talk Syria.  That's  what you need to be talking about.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Julie.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  First of all, a Princeton University study came out a couple of  days ago or weeks ago that actually said that climate change is linked to  crisis, and that climate change is linked to more violence, so I think John  Kerry is right to worry about this, because apparently according to the  study, if global-- </p><p> CAVUTO:  It's making (inaudible).</p><p> ROGINSKY:  Well--</p><p> CAVUTO:  It makes despots more despot-like?  </p><p> ROGINSKY:  No, but it does make people more desperate when they have to  fight over resources, and when they don't have resources to fight, when  they have less, fewer resources to have, they are going to fight over that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROGINSKY:  The point he is making is it is a global threat.  It is a global  threat to security, and if you look at the study, and I think the study is  very telling, what it says essentially is that by 2050, if temperatures go  up by 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which apparently they might, they will have a  chance of doubling-- </p><p> CAVUTO:  And that is man-made? And (inaudible) needs us to pay for it? </p><p> ROGINSKY:  First of all, you wanted a free market approach?  How about the  fact that we had a free market approach, cap and trade, something that the  Republicans originally--  </p><p> BILA:  That's not a free market approach.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  That is something the Republicans originally talked about--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  -- walk, talk and chew gum at the same time?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BILA:  Right now is not the time.  You turn on the news right now, you see  massive coverage of Syria, everyone in this country, no matter where you  stand on the issue, is focused on this.  John Kerry should not be pivoting  right now to talk about climate change.   </p><p> CAVUTO:  But by the same token, many on the right will argue as I argued in  the outset, do not use Syria as an excuse not to do anything else, not to  address budget, not to-- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BILA:  -- a great time to expand government influence over the issue of  climate change as the entire country is focused on our potential  catastrophic involvement in Syria?  He thinks this is the key time right  now, today, to talk about climate change?   </p><p> ROGINSKY:  Is there ever a good time?  There is always something going on.   If we don't address this right now. </p><p> BILA:  There is not always Syria going on.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  First, there was Libya, then there was Egypt.  Now there is a  Syria.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROGINSKY:  We had Iraq for 10 years.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But there is always time for golf. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Days after his announcement that he's given to Congress, just  hours after, he is golfing.  </p><p> ROGINSKY:  Are we really going to start comparing presidential vacations?  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Not at all.  I just find it interesting.</p><p> BILA:  The optics are not good.  No matter how you slice it, the optics of  him talking about climate change -- you could argue climate change is an  important issue, just politically speaking the optics are not good for this  right now.   </p><p> ROGINSKY:  Except for the fact that the majority of Americans agree that  something needs to be done about climate change. </p><p> BILA:  I agree, but I still think optically there is a problem.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  There is always something going on.  If we don't tackle this  today, if we don't do this today, people are going to die tomorrow, and  that is something we have to acknowledge, and that's something people,  climate change deniers don't want to believe it, but it is happening.  It  is already happening if you look at the studies and it will continue to  exacerbate.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I could talk about global cycle patterns of weather and  generational shifts and you could attach a very expensive solution to what  you call a man-made problem, we can differ until the cows come home, but I  find the timing odd. </p><p> ROGINSKY:  (inaudible) timing is odd, I think you guys will never think  there's good timing to do that.</p><p> BILA:  I think there's good timing, plenty of good timing, and I think it  is an important debate to have over government involvement versus how we  address this, and it is a global challenge.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> CAVUTO:  -- don't use it as a (inaudible) distraction on the things we  don't like.  And conversely, liberals have to (inaudible) that we can't  just force companies to pay for every environmental ill you attach to man.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROGINSKY:  We could spend more time repealing Obamacare for the 41st time.   Or we could focus on things we actually might--</p><p> CAVUTO:  I would like to repeal you.   </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  I don't mean it.  </p><p> ROGINSKY:  You just told me you're my last friend, now you dumped me.  You  dumped me too.</p><p> BILA:  At least you have me.</p><p> ROGINSKY:  Thank you, Jedediah.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Between you and Colmes.  </p><p> All right, when we come back, the president asked for when he put the Syria  in Congress' hand.  Congress demands the president dropped all those  military secrets cuts or using getting his vote.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The talk to Republicans in the House say they will now support the  president on Syria so John Boehner and Eric Cantor are in.  As for the rest  of the troops on the right, let's not say all in and my guest says drop the  military sequester cuts, Mr. President, or you can drop my support for  those Syria strikes.  </p><p> That Republican congressman is Michael Turner's offer on Damascus.   Congressman, have you gotten any response from the White House?</p><p> REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R), OHIO:  No, and just as we have not seen any  leadership from the president with respect to his sequestration, his  proposed sequestration, which I have opposed that is having devastating  effects on our military.  Now he wants to draw us into an additional  conflict with Syria without addressing the issue that's affecting our men  and women in uniform and certainly affecting the performance of our  military.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm sure you don't want to negotiate deals, is but if possible  salvo back from the Democrats, all right, let's drop all sequestration cuts  including the ones for defense, what do you say then?</p><p> TURNER:  Well, in order to set the sequestration cuts aside, there have to  be meaningful cuts elsewhere.  The president embraced that himself when he  proposed it and he put together the \"Super Committee\" that was supposed to  propose those cut.  With his withdrawal their failure resulted in the White  House having the responsibility to come forward with those proposals.</p><p> The House passed two bills that would have set aside the sequestration by  finding those cuts responsibly elsewhere.  The Senate has passed none and  the president still today has no response.  Meanwhile, our military, we're  hearing from the secretary is continuing to pay the price.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, Speaker John Boehner has said he is confident that  Republicans will share his view about the urgency of this.  That you will  go along and support fugitive strikes against Syria.  It sounds to me that  unless you get this you won't.</p><p> TURNER:  Well, it depends.  The president has not really made that case not  to the American public or to the international community and certainly not  to Congress.  He does not appear to have any strategy here.  We certainly  don't know who we are for and also he has an unexplainable policy of this  imaginary red line where the administration -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  I am not sure what that means.  But the case that he has stated  and you're right, it has been all over the map, but he has said he is not  interested in regime change.  So in other words, Assad stays in power, but  he would very crippled, very weak and thereby I guess, getting the White  House's argument setting the stage for him to be overthrown is not good  enough for you?</p><p> TURNER:  Well, I think certainly the president has indicated that he would  like regime change in Syria, but the issue is that he declared this  imaginary red line for the use of chemical weapons then redefined it to  large-scale use of chemical weapons and now acknowledging that they were  used previously.  He clearly has not made the case internationally or to  the American public or to Congress as to what our national interest?  What  are the risks and really who are we for?</p><p> The president had months, while hundreds of thousands of people had died in  Syria, to address this issue and now at this crisis point trying to draw us  into this crisis and a conflict with Syria without addressing what is  happening currently in the Department of Defense as a result of his  sequestration.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But he has drawn in the House speaker.  He has drawn in John  McCain.  He has drawn in a number of prominent Republican leaders maybe not  you -- your speaker was not.  So I guess what I'm asking you if your  speaker came to you and said, Congressman, I really need you on this to  support this.  It sounds to me at this point, you would tell him no?</p><p> TURNER:  Absolutely.  At this point, the president is going to have to make  the case that he has not made.  He doesn't have a strategy.  He has  unexplainable policy and unless he does his homework done.  I mean, the  president has the responsibility to do his homework to get the  international community together, to get Congress and the American public  behind it.  He has not done this.  He has managed this as a crisis mode and  I do not think that is a manner in which we should be heading into a  conflict.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Congressman Turner, thank you very much.</p><p> TURNER:  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, switching gears a little bit, are you ready for Samsung's  smart watch?  You know, it is beating Apple to the punch, but could I ask  you something, do you really give a damn?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, now I know why Rolex sales have not been hurting.   Apparently all this talk of a super cool smart watch from Samsung no one is  biting or for that matter even buzzing.  Tomorrow we'll know for sure when  Samsung details its latest Dick Tracy wanna-be.  But the company's only  claim to fame here may be that it beat Apple to the punch offering this.</p><p> Tech analyst Lee Munson says what sounds cool, is it necessarily cool  especially in a world where a lot of people express their status in life by  the pricey stuff they put on their wrist.  So if isn't Swiss, is the smart  watch a miss, what do you think?</p><p> LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO LLC CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Well, I mean, here's  the thing.  If you are going to look for tomorrow's big announcement from  Samsung that they are going to say we have the best new, the iPad, the  smartphone of the future and the solution to Syria and the affordable care  act, you're not going to get it.  And that is what investors want tomorrow.</p><p> They want to know that some company has the new great driver of earnings to  pummel Apple or be a big competitor, you're not.  What you do have is  something very much like back in 1996 when the first Palm Pilot came out.   This smartphone you're going to see tomorrow, it's going to have a limited  appeal for a limited market.</p><p> There is nothing wrong with that, but again if you have the wrong context  or the attachment to what you think is going to happen tomorrow, you are  going to be very disappointed and I think that is what going to happen to a  lot of investors and viewers out there unless we set them straight today.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, so for a smart watch, Dick Tracy watch, it's been  talked about for decades, right?  I mean, is it really that much demand for  it.  Now I'm hardly any -- but to me this sounds stupid.  I think if you  look at the watch, you look at the time or the date, but for the other  stuff what becomes of all the other devices that you do depend on?</p><p> MUNSON:  You know, I don't think it is clear what people are really going  to use it for.  For instance, all the leaks that we are getting and all the  blogs is that what we're going to see tomorrow really is about people like  myself who were into going to the gym all the time.  So they are talking  about, you know, it takes pictures of the food you eat and maybe the  sophisticated heart rate monitor.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But they have those types of devices.  They have those types of  devices.  Now maybe they combine some of those features to give you the  time and the day and the temperature and what they're eating in Bolivia  but, come on, right?</p><p> MUNSON:  Listen, I am not disagreeing with you, but I think that we do have  to have -- there is a context.  You are going to be disappointed as anybody  who thinks this is going to be more than a cool little toy.  I grant you.   I do think that if you what status, you are going to buy an actual wrist  watch that will never goes on or off line.</p><p> I mean, that's just cool to have something that you don't have to turn off  when you're on an airplane, but I think the more important thing is  investors, your viewers.  Don't get confused tomorrow with whatever people  like us end up saying about it because Samsung is a massive vertically  integrated conglomerate.  What that means is they have tons of products and  billions in sales.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I know that, but if they beat Apple to the punch on this and let's  say we don't really need this then for Apple wouldn't be better to be never  than late?</p><p> MUNSON:  Well, I don't think so.  You know, the thing is that we don't know  -- we didn't know in 1996 what a Palm Pilot was going to be used for.  My  wife got one shortly after.  I didn't know what to use it for, for years  and years because it had a very small segment.  There are going to be  people tomorrow.  They are going to want to buy this because it's shiny and  new electronic.</p><p> Sales figures I am with you.  I don't think it's going to be a mindblower,  but I also think that the iPod was not the first MP3 player.  What they did  is they perfected the MP3 player.  Samsung do the R&amp;D and let the Apple do  the real R&amp;D, which I like to refer to as rip-off and duplicate only better  so I think time will tell.</p><p> I think Apple has to have some sort of risk product, but I think they are  going to let everybody else spend the money to figure out the market and  Apple usually comes in there and perfects it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, that was the old Apple.  I don't know about the new  Apple.  Lee Munson, thank you very much.</p><p> MUNSON:  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  In the meantime, it sounds like the president wrangled GOP leaders  John Boehner and Eric Cantor, but it is a top Democrat Charlie Rangel out?   When Democrats defect on Syria, is the situation for the White House  getting serious?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, one thing about this Syria crisis is it's turning everything  upside down.  Republicans, you would think would automatically say no to  the president are now increasingly saying yes and Democratic supporters  like Charlie Rangel are sounding very doubtful as if he will ever say yes.</p><p> The New York congressman is on the phone with us now.  Another thing you  might not know about the congressman, he is a Korean war hero so he is no  daisy in this race.  But I want to talk to you about that part of your  experience, Congressman.</p><p> The argument the White House has made that this is important to avoid wider  conflicts down the road and that we have to do this to send a message.  But  in delaying the message and leading it in Congress, isn't he compounding  that?</p><p> REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK (via telephone):  First of all, we are  talking about war.  Whatever lines the president has drawn.  Whatever  commitment he may have made to international people, this is putting people  in harm's way.  They talk about limited war.  There is no such thing as a  limited war.  Iraq was limited war. </p><p> We lost 6,500 American lives over the so-called limited war for a 10-year  period.  This is an international problem that demands an international  solution, but to go into this alone with the idea to bypass the Security  Council, and the United Nations, and the Arab League, the European Union,  Great Britain, they tell us these people are on the line.</p><p> But this whole idea that every evil person requires such as the president  of United States, that requires our troops in there, it does not make  sense.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you think though that throwing this in Congress is cover for  the president because let's say Congress votes against this.  I don't know  what the read in the House.  You may have a better idea than I do then the  president could say I tried?</p><p> RANGEL:  It's not throwing it in Congress' lap.  The fact that the  president has drawn a red line it does not constitute them right of the  need to say we will go to war you have to come to Congress.</p><p> CAVUTO:  He did it with NATO during the Bosnia situation -- </p><p> RANGEL:  So did Roosevelt and it's wrong.  It is unconstitutional and the  Congress goes along with it and you know why because they don't have their  constituents for the most part that are making the sacrifice, the people  from rural areas and in the cities to volunteer.</p><p> But if they go for one minute every time we went to war was in Kosovo or  Panama or Iraq then the Congress will take this.  We'll let the president  to this.  Sullivan told this morning it was about bombing and how could  rethink of the loss of American lives or we have to do it because what  people will think about us?  We're not playing some war games.  We're  talking about people's lives.</p><p> CAVUTO:  It sounds to me, Congressman, like you are saying that you would  be against this as its defense now with the very least to lack of foreign  support.  So you would vote no on that basis alone?</p><p> RANGEL:  You got that right.  But this is international.  There is no  military solution to this problem.  Anyone plays the case with every thread  to society we have to put our military up that does not make any sense at  all.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Charlie Rangel, thank you very much.</p><p> RANGEL:  Thank you, buddy.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, the faded drums of war or much louder drums of deal?   Something is perking Wall Street's interest and I suspect it's not missiles  more like mergers.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Big deals, big risks and big dreams, Scott Martin and Kimberly  blitz to see if you buy.  First up, folks, those big deals are back with a  vengeance whether it's Microsoft in more than a $7 billion transaction or  Verizon paying Vodafone a staggering $130 billion to go away.  Signs of  mergers and acquisitions are just getting going this day?  Would that be a  good sign, Kimberly?</p><p> KIMBERLY FOSS, EMPYRION WEALTH MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think this is  a great opportunity for the telecom industry for rise in $130 million.   It's the third biggest corporate fill in history.  It's going to take,  Vodafone giving to Verizon.  You have the 6.4 percent dividend on Vodafone  and 4 percent dividend on Verizon.  It's going to propel this thing to no  end.  It is a big buy for me.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, Scott, obviously the temptation for Verizon was the  possible interest rates were as low as they were so if this thinking you  get $130 million monkey of its back in the name of Vodafone, you can argue  the price, maybe other companies are seizing on the same rate position  right now to do something like it?</p><p> SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO:  Well, they better hurry, Neil,  because we all rates are going up at a pretty alarming rate here.  It's  kind of interesting though, I don't know if I totally agree with Kim though  because I don't really like the space, Neil.  It's becoming more  competitive and margins are coming in.  Meaning profits are dropping.</p><p> So that to me is not a great business to be in and plus these companies  especially the tech companies are using cash that's parked overseas because  they don't want to repatriate it and pay U.S. taxes.  So that money is  limited in some degree because instead of it going back to the United  States, they are buying other countries.  So yes, it's great if you're the  acquirer like Nokia, but I am not sure if that helps the companies like  Microsoft.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to switch gears here to address this  second issue, three words that don't register with me, retro hunting gear.   I am told it is the rage and retailer H&amp;M is all in.  Who knew camouflage  meant so much cash?  Nothing attracts men like military fatigue.  So it  must be a bulletproof fashion statement?  Scott, what do you think?</p><p> MARTIN:  Well, I am pretty cool, Neil.  So I was ahead of this one and I've  already got some orders in on this stuff.  I think it's interesting.  It's  definitely a risk, but I think they are calculated one for H&amp;M because look  at what's happened in retail, Neil.  Even over the last couple of years,  not just this summer where a lot of the retailers have been smashed because  it is the same old same old.  So I like the fact that this company is going  out there and doing something different making a push perhaps into a  different section just to roll some heads and see if it actually works.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you think, Kim?</p><p> FOSS:  Yes, I agree.  I mean, no consumer should be denied and should be  ignored especially the male consumer.  I got to tell you they're doing the  great job with the underwear and let me just tell you who knows?  Maybe  boxers is the next rage?  I wouldn't mind if I came home and saw my husband  in some chemo gear.</p><p> CAVUTO:  This is a family show that maybe I am out of touch and you guys  are clearly in touch.  Now we know why Jeff Basos flanked down $250 million  for the \"Washington Post.\"  He was high as the kite or drank out of his  mind or both.  What else could explain his reason for going big time on  \"Washington Post\" reading?  Apparently, he was to usher in a new golden age  for newspapers lickety-split.</p><p> But Scott, is Jeff on to something because the golden age for newspapers  and I love them dearly, but I read them online, the conventional product is  gone.</p><p> MARTIN:  Me as well, Neil, also that was decades ago.  I think regarding  whenever he resigned he was lucky he came off and bought it today not four  years ago because I guess they're going to get four or five times what it  did today, which goes to show you, again, it's kind of like the telecom  business.  You know, it's not a great business to be in.  Yes people go  there for their news, but it is online.  It's digital.  So unless he has  some amazing revamping that he's planned here, Neil.  I don't think it is a  great deal for them as far as the Amazon or other newspapers possibly up  for sale.</p><p> CAVUTO:  He is good at marketing stuff and if you were to do something for  prime readership customers that could be the start of something.  So we  have the makings of making this work, but he is up again strong ties?</p><p> FOSS:  I think the digital era is here to have something very innovative  for a certain segment of the market, but those that don't have the physical  paper.  Unfortunately, they are aging and they are not buying that paper as  much anymore even read online when they magnify it.  So I agree with Scott.   I think this is not a win-win for Jeff or for the consumer.  It is going to  be a hard road, but maybe we'll wait and see what happens.  He is pretty  innovative guy.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Indeed, if he can convince people to pay for that online product  then maybe it would work.  He would seem to have the best shot of doing  that, but it is a very tough battle.  Scott and Kim, thank you both very  much.  That will do it.  We will continue monitor the debate with Syria and  how it falls out.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

When it gets back from vacation, as if a budget deadline and a debt limit deadline and defund Obamacare or don't defund Obamacare deadline, and than immigration reform deadline, and so many other deadlines. As if all of these deadlines were not enough, now this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why I do not - I want to move beyond this fixation with Syria. Do you really think this is just about Syria and do you really think this is about a president who suddenly cares about not going over the head of Congress after years of pushing through executive orders and regulations that (inaudible) that routinely defied Congress. And just as telling last week, when the president was saying when it came to Syria, he really did not need the approval of the Congress.</p><p/><p>Now, this is about confusing Congress, maybe even embarrassing Congress and all of the nine days it will be in session this month, once again, ridiculing Congress and getting Americans to focus, maybe not so much on the president punting, but on Congress, once again, not governing. Now, he could come out smelling like a rose, even though he has given Congress nothing but thorns. But on whom he will pile, probably, all the blame. And is at this point, that the president steps back and says, well, I tried their way. Now the president isn't saying that yet, but it's pretty clear, his confidant informer campaign manager David Axelrod is thinking that right now tweeting that Congress suddenly is the dog that caught the car. I guess that means that Congress was chasing down to Syria in (inaudible) car? And now that it's caught, it has no idea what the hell to do with it or about it?</p><p/><p>Well, me - I have had enough of it, because the only thing I liken to a dog and all of its pile on his, you know, pile of you know what, it's leading in its way, spending bills that never get done, budget reform that never gets touched, a tax makeover that never gets started. You smell what I smell? You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to smell it. It's the same smell. One we both smell before, long before Syria and I suspect, long after Syria. And even if Congress does want to make things right, Washington watcher Chris Stirewalt says they better boogie (ph) fast, because they don't have time to do much. If anything at all.</p><p/><p>Chris, realistically, nine days, this month what can they do?</p><p/><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, they can fight, they can posture, they can shove, they can yell, I think in the end they will have to be here more than those nine days. As you enumerated, aside from the odors that you talked about, there is work to be done. As you said, the continuing resolution funding the government expires at the end of September. You also have, as you said, the rollout of the free stuff (inaudible), the president's help while people can sign up for Obamacare on the first of October. You've got that. And then you have Jack Lew dropped the flag on the debt Derby, that ceiling has to go up in the middle of October - by the middle of October, he says. So, it's all running. Something has got to happen. Syria is related in this way, too. We have sequestration, spending levels that are in place. For the military and non-defense spending across the federal government. Democrats want to get non-defense spending up, if we're dropping billions of dollars worth of bombs on Syria. That's going to make it tougher, and - I suspect you'll hear hawkish Republicans like John McCain and others, saying well, if we're bombing Syria, we need to get rid of these caps on increased spending. We call it sequestration.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: We're going to be talking to a member who is advocating just that. You get my vote to just stop this military sequestration cuts. But having said that, that would be great harm, where there not, if we are going to go to war to be dealing with these annoying pesky financial issues that could bring the government down or shut it down or get it into a debt limit crisis? Wouldn't that play to the president's favor just to have this backdrop and not drop any of these other surprises?</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: Well, I would say that David Axelrod is whistling past the graveyard a little bit on this. If the president of the United States is rebuffed by Congress on the fall to attack another country that is a pretty stinging defeat, and they can slap chop, they can divide (inaudible) however they want. But it will not be good if the president cannot get his way. And we should remember, he was forced to go to Congress. He wanted to do what he did with the attack on Libya, which was to say that it had been approved by an international buddy, in that case, the United Nations and the Arab League, unable to obtain - or not the United Nations, NATO, unable to obtain the cooperation of Great Britain, and without the initial help of the Arab League, the president had no choice, but to do what American presidents hate to do, which is go to Congress.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, flying in the face of what he had said. Really, just 48 hours earlier.</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Chris, thank you, my friend. Good having you again.</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: You bet.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, forget about all these issues piling up. Retired Army General Robert Scales has focused on the real damage of the president throwing his hands up, particularly on Syria, where he all but announced the terror threat around the world - or keep terrorizing the world. General, what do you think of this?</p><p/><p>GEN. ROBERT SCALES, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, you know, Neil, anytime we have these conversations I invoke the wisdom of First Sergeant Braun (ph). I know in Vietnam when I had my dithering moments, Sergeant Braun would say captain, always remember rule 13. Rule 13? Yeah, rule 13 says when in charge, take charge. And rule 13 applies whether you are a captain in the Army or the commander-in-chief. Look, whether we shoot missiles or we don't shoot missiles. When this is all over, the rest of the world and the American people are going to look at this, and scratch their heads over the process, the witness, the dithering, the inner articulation of Wednesday (ph). This since of a loss of will. You know, there is an old - there's an old strategic concept that says military power is equal to capabilities times will. No one doubts our capabilities, but people throughout the world and inside this country, are beginning to question our will. Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Now, you also mentioned, you know, this view that some people ask. That we're not consistent, to put it mildly. And I was always telling people, what do you for, or against or getting involved in Syria, whatever it is, whatever you decided or whatever you want to do, telegraph it immediately and don't sort of dither about it, whether you are not going to be involved, Mr. President, make that very clear. You see, the reason and the story certainly don't draw a red line. You do draw a redline, act on that redline pronto, because any dithering, any waiting just to me kind of emboldens our enemies. But what is your sense of it?</p><p/><p>SCALES: I absolutely agree. You know, there's an old (inaudible), that whenever a nation takes an e (ph), whenever a nation goes - or pauses in an operation, the advantage of the initiative and time shifts to the enemy. And if anybody thinks that Assad isn't going to take advantage of these nine days, or these 13 days to reposition his forces, to gain allegiances in the region, to strengthen his own power, and also to pound his own people with missiles and artillery is wrong. Nine days of inaction shifts the advantage to the enemy, and so we get involved what - two weeks from now? And we wind up basically bouncing sand.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Amazing. General, thank you.</p><p/><p>SCALES: Thanks, Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, media magnate Mort Zuckerman says it could be even worse than that. Forget about how the president is seen in the eyes of the bad guys, the way he's indecisive, this is playing out on the global media, is not exactly proving a ringing endorsement from - for the rest of the world. Guys. What is going on?</p><p/><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN, BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR: Well, what is going on is really an interesting question, because it is almost incomprehensible to witness what is going on. And to try and understand that given, a, the nature of the political system of the United States and B, what the president himself has said, so I'd like to read some of the things that he has said, so I get it right. When he first came into office, and we're now dealing with the much more serious issue, not just Syria but Iran and they're both connected because the credibility that we would have had, if we had done something in Syria, might have had a bigger effect on Iran. Now, the lack of credibility or the collapse of credibility will completely change that whole theater of the world.</p><p/><p>So, Barack Obama shortly after his first election said to use all elements of American power, and I quote, \"to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions\" and he said last year that a nuclear Iran would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the stability of the global economy as well as risk triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty.</p><p/><p>Now, what has happened in Syria have so undermined the international credibility of his entire policy, that the recent failure to respond to the chemical attacks by Syria will affect the credibility and viability of everything we have done so far, which is the core of America's programs and attitudes and credibility vis-.-vis Iran. Now, there is a suggestion we state to hear that the Arab Leagues did not support that. I'm going to read you from the resolutions of the Arab League. OK? Number one is the call upon the United Nations, this just came out - the call upon the United Nations and the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by taking firm and dissuasive means - measures against the perpetrators of this crime, for which the Syrian regime was responsible and to put an end to such violations and crimes of genocide that the Syrian regime has been committing for more than two years.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Is that the whole Arab League saying that, or is it just some of them?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: No, no, it's all the Arab League. No, no, no, it's virtually all, except two - and let me just - I can go on about this, OK? They strongly condemned and denounced this atrocious crime, this is virtually all of them, with the exception of two countries. To strongly condemn and denounce this atrocious crime, in which internationally prohibited chemical weapons were used in flagrant denial of ethical and humanitarian values as well as international laws and usages. I could go on about that, but ..</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But even they are saying that, now post this decision or non- decision ...</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: No, this meeting was just held in the last - yes, right after the ...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So, could they be saying, they though attack would have been imminent, now that it's looking like it might not be imminent, they are getting worried?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh, no, they are very worried that he United States has basically abdicated the long-standing leadership role that we have played in the Middle East, and we have a lot of allies in that part of the world who are critical to us.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: What does Israel say?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, Israel of course is the one who's now faced with a huge problem of trying to deal, A, not only with Syria, but with Iran. Iran is a country that has been threatening Israel, and Israel of course on one level, it's going to do whatever it takes to defend themselves. They have a simply theory of life, because everybody knows that Iran is literally several months away at the very most of having a deliverable nuclear weapon.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So they are interpreting that our lack of strong, immediate response in Syria telegraphs we will have the same posture with Iran?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Without question, that whole part of the world.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you agree with it?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: What else can you think about, when you have the president who comes out and says what he says and then does what he does? How can you believe what he says?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So it's vacillating more than any specific position is what has rattled folks, right?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Of course, nobody -- the president of the United States has to be believed, he has to maintain his credibility. A lot of what we say, we hope, is going to prevent doing things that we don't want to do. We don't want to go to war. That is not what the United States is about. What we want to do is to protect the interests of ourselves and our allies, and there are a number of Arab countries who are our allies, and now they have lost faith in the United States, because they see that whatever he says is not necessarily what he does.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you think, then, Mort, that the president regrets the famous red line remark, that it boxed him into a corner and he is scrambling to get out?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: I don't know how to measure what he says or what he feels or what he believes at the time he says it, how he changes his mind. That is his job. But his job is also to make sure there is a consistency to what he says, because you cannot just say X on one day, and then say excuse me, I did not mean X, I mean Y. And then say, well, I didn't really mean Y. The president has to have that credibility and consistency, and if he does not have it, he cannot perform on behalf of the United States with our foreign policy and with the credibility it needs. We don't want to go to war every day to prove we are credible. You have to have somebody who, when he says something, everybody knows he means it.</p><p/><p>The only time the Iranians held back on their nuclear weapons program was when the prime minister of Israel said if they got to a certain kind of a level of nuclear capability, the Israelis would act, so even though they could have crossed that line to date, the Iranians have held back, they understand who is to be believed. And now they will not come to the conclusion that this president is to be believed or to be feared.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Mort, powerful stuff. Thank you, my friend, Mort Zuckerman.</p><p/><p>Even Charlie is wrangling with the president on this one, because this decorated Korean War hero has a bone to pick with Barack Obama he says is not exactly acting heroic. Charlie unplugged, here and only here. But before we get back to Syria, Charlie later in the show, a look at the other drama that is being overshadowed by this Syria (inaudible). Remember those NSA spies? Lots more of them than you thought. Guess what? They are not working at the NSA. A whole bunch of them are just a point and click away. You use them every day even now.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Here is what feeds conspiracy theories on Syria. It is all but overshadowing serious spying abuses right here in the U.S. of A. And even now, in fact, more than even right now, the latest reports that Facebook and Twitter and Google have snoops that put those NSA snoops to shame, not just invading our privacy, to hear Katrina Pierson tell it, trampling on it. What is really going on here, Katrina?</p><p/><p>KATRINA PIERSON: Here we are again finding out more and more things about who is reading our emails and who aren't. There was an independent research study that came out that showed that not only are some of these big tech giants reading our emails, but they are also clicking on specific links, which means your attachments are probably also being opened. But then I guess they figure if our government is doing it, it must be legal.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Katrina, are they doing it at the government's behest or on their own? And if so, why?</p><p/><p>PIERSON: That is the thing. Initially, they said, well, the government tells us we have to release this information, but this particular study said absolutely not. They sent out emails, personal emails with protected particular links, and they found that six out of the 50 they sent this through, through the networks, actually clicked on the link, including Google and Facebook. So really, what is the responsibility going on, and where is accountability in Congress on our privacy being violated? We need to start up and get out there and let Congress know they have got to get these companies under control.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It is one thing for them to do something at the strong behest if not court order of the NSA or another government agency, it is quite another to take that power into their own, and it's already come up with issues about how they market things, how they share information, but this goes deeper than that, doesn't it?</p><p/><p>PIERSON: That's the thing. We have to wonder why Congress is allowing this to happen. We already know that big business and government have a sinister marriage going on, and when we look at Google and Facebook and the political donors that come out of these companies to these politicians, it makes you wonder why there is no political will to do anything about it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So now where is all of this going? We know the NSA sort of cracked down, has sort of cracked up in the middle of this focus on Syria. I am sure the guys at the NSA love it. I'm sure the president likes that distraction. Many cynics argue it is the reason why Syria has been dumped in Congress' lap. So where do you think it's going??</p><p/><p>PIERSON: I am not sure, and I do think it is a distraction. You mentioned earlier about some of the other issues Congress is going to have to take on, for example funding Obamacare, immigration and all these other things. So I think there are a lot of shiny objects being dropped into the room to divert attention to things really pressing American citizens today.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Katrina, thank you very much, Katrina Pierson. While this is going on as we speak, despite all the huffing and puffing.</p><p/><p>Well this Syria thing is apparently like the deflecting gift that keeps giving. Not only getting our eye off the spying still going on here ball, but you would not believe this latest doozy on health care ball. Guess what will happen very soon? While all these guys are knee deep in Syria debating. I will give you a clue. It has something to do with unions. I want to give you another clue -- it has something to do with them getting a big present too.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, under the cover of war there, a kamikaze attack by unions right here? Because mark my words, I told you this, while we're all focused on this do we or don't we get involved in Syria thing, general Richard Trumka will pull off one of the greatest stealth victories in the sordid history, short as it is, of this health care law thing. Without anyone knowing, he will have secured the exemption for unions on some of the law's most costly provisions, including the higher fees for Cadillac plans that dominate many unions plans, and ways around employer switching to too many part-time workers that could kill union workers. Only you won't know much about it, because I suspect no one will really cover because the world is too busy focusing on Damascus than unions pulling a fast one in DC. Julie Roginsky I am sure agrees with that point of view, but we'll get to her in a second. Jedediah Bila, to you first on whether that is a real possibility?</p><p/><p>JEDEDIAH BILA: I think they're going to cave to the unions, and I think it's because for Barack Obama to say we don't need union support in the midterm elections would be ridiculous. The unions came out in support of Obamacare, and I think there were a lot of backroom deals and a lot of meetings that went on where the unions acknowledged that there were some things about this law that they did not necessarily like from the start, but they let Barack Obama know, we are allies here, and if we come out and we say we don't like this, you're going to need to mend those things. You're going to need to really account, be accountable to us, because we are the ones who helped you get elected twice, and we are the ones who are going to help your friends get elected over and over. So I think there will be a lot of caving, particularly with respect to the Cadillac tax and with respect to the concern about this influx of full-time workers going to part-time and what that does to a 40-hour workweek for union members.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I don't think they are that sinister. I think they are stupid. But I will say this with all respect to Jedediah, a lot of them if they had just read the bill, they would have realized it added up and we are screwed. But they did not do that. But now they, like any group that feels it's offended and gotten a delay or extension or exemption, they want in, too.</p><p/><p>JULIE ROGINSKY: Yes, I will say something that will offend my friends in the union movement, but that is what collective bargaining is for. Don't send me hate mail, I get it. But you know--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's nice your hate mail is bipartisan.</p><p/><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: -- civil \"Cavuto Clash.\"</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I could see under the darkness of all of this other stuff going on in Syria, some waivers that would be vague (ph), a new line in the bill that this applies to everyone but public union workers, it would not even be that blatant but it would be understood that they have gotten a pass.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: It could happen. But as I said, it shouldn't.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It will.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: I don't know if it will happen. We will see.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Want to place one dollar on this?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: I have $1, that's all about all I have, but I'll put a dollar on it.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: I don't know if it will happen, but I sympathize with the unions, I get where they're coming from, but this is something to deal with the collective bargaining.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: (inaudible), who will be paying for it.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Well, as we've discussed--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You and me.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Not you and I, because your health insurance is not going to change. I don't think they are going to get rid of health care insurance here at News Corp.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You don't think my premiums have not gone up? Your premiums have not gone up?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: My premiums went up well before Barack Obama came to office.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You don't think it's accelerated? You don't think it will continue to accelerate?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Not once Obamacare kicks in.</p><p/><p>BILA: Young people are going to help pay for it, who don't need insurance.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Sure they do.</p><p/><p>BILA: But have been mandated--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: We don't know what is coming, but I do want to address at another time here--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Who says Secretary of State John Kerry is not every bit as good as his boss at it? One moment he is turning up the heat on Syria at the State Department, and the next he is talking about the heat via a video address to a climate conference in the Marshall Islands.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>KERRY: Climate change is a global crisis, and it will require a global solution, one that includes shared resources, shared responsibility, and a shared sense of urgency above all.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Don't get me wrong, I am all for worrying about sweating, but shouldn't our secretary of state right now be sweating more about Syria? That's just me, Jedediah.</p><p/><p>BILA: He wants to talk about everything but the real, legitimate, scary, frightening problem at hand.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He is talking about--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: I love all this talk about climate change. We all agree climate change exists. That's not the argument, John Kerry. The argument is how much of it is man-made. And how much government involvement should we have? Should we have pro free market approaches to address this problem or should we expand big government via stimulus or however you want to argue it in order to address the problem? So stop painting folks on the right as those who don't care about climate change in order to make a political point right now. You want to talk politics? Right now talk Syria. That's what you need to be talking about.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Julie.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: First of all, a Princeton University study came out a couple of days ago or weeks ago that actually said that climate change is linked to crisis, and that climate change is linked to more violence, so I think John Kerry is right to worry about this, because apparently according to the study, if global--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's making (inaudible).</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Well--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It makes despots more despot-like?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: No, but it does make people more desperate when they have to fight over resources, and when they don't have resources to fight, when they have less, fewer resources to have, they are going to fight over that.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: The point he is making is it is a global threat. It is a global threat to security, and if you look at the study, and I think the study is very telling, what it says essentially is that by 2050, if temperatures go up by 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which apparently they might, they will have a chance of doubling--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And that is man-made? And (inaudible) needs us to pay for it?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: First of all, you wanted a free market approach? How about the fact that we had a free market approach, cap and trade, something that the Republicans originally--</p><p/><p>BILA: That's not a free market approach.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: That is something the Republicans originally talked about--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: -- walk, talk and chew gum at the same time?</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: Right now is not the time. You turn on the news right now, you see massive coverage of Syria, everyone in this country, no matter where you stand on the issue, is focused on this. John Kerry should not be pivoting right now to talk about climate change.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But by the same token, many on the right will argue as I argued in the outset, do not use Syria as an excuse not to do anything else, not to address budget, not to--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: -- a great time to expand government influence over the issue of climate change as the entire country is focused on our potential catastrophic involvement in Syria? He thinks this is the key time right now, today, to talk about climate change?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Is there ever a good time? There is always something going on. If we don't address this right now.</p><p/><p>BILA: There is not always Syria going on.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: First, there was Libya, then there was Egypt. Now there is a Syria.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: We had Iraq for 10 years.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But there is always time for golf.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Days after his announcement that he's given to Congress, just hours after, he is golfing.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Are we really going to start comparing presidential vacations?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Not at all. I just find it interesting.</p><p/><p>BILA: The optics are not good. No matter how you slice it, the optics of him talking about climate change -- you could argue climate change is an important issue, just politically speaking the optics are not good for this right now.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Except for the fact that the majority of Americans agree that something needs to be done about climate change.</p><p/><p>BILA: I agree, but I still think optically there is a problem.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: There is always something going on. If we don't tackle this today, if we don't do this today, people are going to die tomorrow, and that is something we have to acknowledge, and that's something people, climate change deniers don't want to believe it, but it is happening. It is already happening if you look at the studies and it will continue to exacerbate.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I could talk about global cycle patterns of weather and generational shifts and you could attach a very expensive solution to what you call a man-made problem, we can differ until the cows come home, but I find the timing odd.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: (inaudible) timing is odd, I think you guys will never think there's good timing to do that.</p><p/><p>BILA: I think there's good timing, plenty of good timing, and I think it is an important debate to have over government involvement versus how we address this, and it is a global challenge.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: -- don't use it as a (inaudible) distraction on the things we don't like. And conversely, liberals have to (inaudible) that we can't just force companies to pay for every environmental ill you attach to man.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: We could spend more time repealing Obamacare for the 41st time. Or we could focus on things we actually might--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I would like to repeal you.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I don't mean it.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: You just told me you're my last friend, now you dumped me. You dumped me too.</p><p/><p>BILA: At least you have me.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Thank you, Jedediah.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Between you and Colmes.</p><p/><p>All right, when we come back, the president asked for when he put the Syria in Congress' hand. Congress demands the president dropped all those military secrets cuts or using getting his vote.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: The talk to Republicans in the House say they will now support the president on Syria so John Boehner and Eric Cantor are in. As for the rest of the troops on the right, let's not say all in and my guest says drop the military sequester cuts, Mr. President, or you can drop my support for those Syria strikes.</p><p/><p>That Republican congressman is Michael Turner's offer on Damascus. Congressman, have you gotten any response from the White House?</p><p/><p>REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R), OHIO: No, and just as we have not seen any leadership from the president with respect to his sequestration, his proposed sequestration, which I have opposed that is having devastating effects on our military. Now he wants to draw us into an additional conflict with Syria without addressing the issue that's affecting our men and women in uniform and certainly affecting the performance of our military.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I'm sure you don't want to negotiate deals, is but if possible salvo back from the Democrats, all right, let's drop all sequestration cuts including the ones for defense, what do you say then?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, in order to set the sequestration cuts aside, there have to be meaningful cuts elsewhere. The president embraced that himself when he proposed it and he put together the \"Super Committee\" that was supposed to propose those cut. With his withdrawal their failure resulted in the White House having the responsibility to come forward with those proposals.</p><p/><p>The House passed two bills that would have set aside the sequestration by finding those cuts responsibly elsewhere. The Senate has passed none and the president still today has no response. Meanwhile, our military, we're hearing from the secretary is continuing to pay the price.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, Speaker John Boehner has said he is confident that Republicans will share his view about the urgency of this. That you will go along and support fugitive strikes against Syria. It sounds to me that unless you get this you won't.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, it depends. The president has not really made that case not to the American public or to the international community and certainly not to Congress. He does not appear to have any strategy here. We certainly don't know who we are for and also he has an unexplainable policy of this imaginary red line where the administration --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I am not sure what that means. But the case that he has stated and you're right, it has been all over the map, but he has said he is not interested in regime change. So in other words, Assad stays in power, but he would very crippled, very weak and thereby I guess, getting the White House's argument setting the stage for him to be overthrown is not good enough for you?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, I think certainly the president has indicated that he would like regime change in Syria, but the issue is that he declared this imaginary red line for the use of chemical weapons then redefined it to large-scale use of chemical weapons and now acknowledging that they were used previously. He clearly has not made the case internationally or to the American public or to Congress as to what our national interest? What are the risks and really who are we for?</p><p/><p>The president had months, while hundreds of thousands of people had died in Syria, to address this issue and now at this crisis point trying to draw us into this crisis and a conflict with Syria without addressing what is happening currently in the Department of Defense as a result of his sequestration.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But he has drawn in the House speaker. He has drawn in John McCain. He has drawn in a number of prominent Republican leaders maybe not you -- your speaker was not. So I guess what I'm asking you if your speaker came to you and said, Congressman, I really need you on this to support this. It sounds to me at this point, you would tell him no?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Absolutely. At this point, the president is going to have to make the case that he has not made. He doesn't have a strategy. He has unexplainable policy and unless he does his homework done. I mean, the president has the responsibility to do his homework to get the international community together, to get Congress and the American public behind it. He has not done this. He has managed this as a crisis mode and I do not think that is a manner in which we should be heading into a conflict.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, Congressman Turner, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, switching gears a little bit, are you ready for Samsung's smart watch? You know, it is beating Apple to the punch, but could I ask you something, do you really give a damn?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, now I know why Rolex sales have not been hurting. Apparently all this talk of a super cool smart watch from Samsung no one is biting or for that matter even buzzing. Tomorrow we'll know for sure when Samsung details its latest Dick Tracy wanna-be. But the company's only claim to fame here may be that it beat Apple to the punch offering this.</p><p/><p>Tech analyst Lee Munson says what sounds cool, is it necessarily cool especially in a world where a lot of people express their status in life by the pricey stuff they put on their wrist. So if isn't Swiss, is the smart watch a miss, what do you think?</p><p/><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO LLC CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: Well, I mean, here's the thing. If you are going to look for tomorrow's big announcement from Samsung that they are going to say we have the best new, the iPad, the smartphone of the future and the solution to Syria and the affordable care act, you're not going to get it. And that is what investors want tomorrow.</p><p/><p>They want to know that some company has the new great driver of earnings to pummel Apple or be a big competitor, you're not. What you do have is something very much like back in 1996 when the first Palm Pilot came out. This smartphone you're going to see tomorrow, it's going to have a limited appeal for a limited market.</p><p/><p>There is nothing wrong with that, but again if you have the wrong context or the attachment to what you think is going to happen tomorrow, you are going to be very disappointed and I think that is what going to happen to a lot of investors and viewers out there unless we set them straight today.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, so for a smart watch, Dick Tracy watch, it's been talked about for decades, right? I mean, is it really that much demand for it. Now I'm hardly any -- but to me this sounds stupid. I think if you look at the watch, you look at the time or the date, but for the other stuff what becomes of all the other devices that you do depend on?</p><p/><p>MUNSON: You know, I don't think it is clear what people are really going to use it for. For instance, all the leaks that we are getting and all the blogs is that what we're going to see tomorrow really is about people like myself who were into going to the gym all the time. So they are talking about, you know, it takes pictures of the food you eat and maybe the sophisticated heart rate monitor.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But they have those types of devices. They have those types of devices. Now maybe they combine some of those features to give you the time and the day and the temperature and what they're eating in Bolivia but, come on, right?</p><p/><p>MUNSON: Listen, I am not disagreeing with you, but I think that we do have to have -- there is a context. You are going to be disappointed as anybody who thinks this is going to be more than a cool little toy. I grant you. I do think that if you what status, you are going to buy an actual wrist watch that will never goes on or off line.</p><p/><p>I mean, that's just cool to have something that you don't have to turn off when you're on an airplane, but I think the more important thing is investors, your viewers. Don't get confused tomorrow with whatever people like us end up saying about it because Samsung is a massive vertically integrated conglomerate. What that means is they have tons of products and billions in sales.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I know that, but if they beat Apple to the punch on this and let's say we don't really need this then for Apple wouldn't be better to be never than late?</p><p/><p>MUNSON: Well, I don't think so. You know, the thing is that we don't know -- we didn't know in 1996 what a Palm Pilot was going to be used for. My wife got one shortly after. I didn't know what to use it for, for years and years because it had a very small segment. There are going to be people tomorrow. They are going to want to buy this because it's shiny and new electronic.</p><p/><p>Sales figures I am with you. I don't think it's going to be a mindblower, but I also think that the iPod was not the first MP3 player. What they did is they perfected the MP3 player. Samsung do the R&amp;D and let the Apple do the real R&amp;D, which I like to refer to as rip-off and duplicate only better so I think time will tell.</p><p/><p>I think Apple has to have some sort of risk product, but I think they are going to let everybody else spend the money to figure out the market and Apple usually comes in there and perfects it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, that was the old Apple. I don't know about the new Apple. Lee Munson, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>MUNSON: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, it sounds like the president wrangled GOP leaders John Boehner and Eric Cantor, but it is a top Democrat Charlie Rangel out? When Democrats defect on Syria, is the situation for the White House getting serious?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, one thing about this Syria crisis is it's turning everything upside down. Republicans, you would think would automatically say no to the president are now increasingly saying yes and Democratic supporters like Charlie Rangel are sounding very doubtful as if he will ever say yes.</p><p/><p>The New York congressman is on the phone with us now. Another thing you might not know about the congressman, he is a Korean war hero so he is no daisy in this race. But I want to talk to you about that part of your experience, Congressman.</p><p/><p>The argument the White House has made that this is important to avoid wider conflicts down the road and that we have to do this to send a message. But in delaying the message and leading it in Congress, isn't he compounding that?</p><p/><p>REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK (via telephone): First of all, we are talking about war. Whatever lines the president has drawn. Whatever commitment he may have made to international people, this is putting people in harm's way. They talk about limited war. There is no such thing as a limited war. Iraq was limited war.</p><p/><p>We lost 6,500 American lives over the so-called limited war for a 10-year period. This is an international problem that demands an international solution, but to go into this alone with the idea to bypass the Security Council, and the United Nations, and the Arab League, the European Union, Great Britain, they tell us these people are on the line.</p><p/><p>But this whole idea that every evil person requires such as the president of United States, that requires our troops in there, it does not make sense.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you think though that throwing this in Congress is cover for the president because let's say Congress votes against this. I don't know what the read in the House. You may have a better idea than I do then the president could say I tried?</p><p/><p>RANGEL: It's not throwing it in Congress' lap. The fact that the president has drawn a red line it does not constitute them right of the need to say we will go to war you have to come to Congress.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He did it with NATO during the Bosnia situation --</p><p/><p>RANGEL: So did Roosevelt and it's wrong. It is unconstitutional and the Congress goes along with it and you know why because they don't have their constituents for the most part that are making the sacrifice, the people from rural areas and in the cities to volunteer.</p><p/><p>But if they go for one minute every time we went to war was in Kosovo or Panama or Iraq then the Congress will take this. We'll let the president to this. Sullivan told this morning it was about bombing and how could rethink of the loss of American lives or we have to do it because what people will think about us? We're not playing some war games. We're talking about people's lives.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It sounds to me, Congressman, like you are saying that you would be against this as its defense now with the very least to lack of foreign support. So you would vote no on that basis alone?</p><p/><p>RANGEL: You got that right. But this is international. There is no military solution to this problem. Anyone plays the case with every thread to society we have to put our military up that does not make any sense at all.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Charlie Rangel, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>RANGEL: Thank you, buddy.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, the faded drums of war or much louder drums of deal? Something is perking Wall Street's interest and I suspect it's not missiles more like mergers.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Big deals, big risks and big dreams, Scott Martin and Kimberly blitz to see if you buy. First up, folks, those big deals are back with a vengeance whether it's Microsoft in more than a $7 billion transaction or Verizon paying Vodafone a staggering $130 billion to go away. Signs of mergers and acquisitions are just getting going this day? Would that be a good sign, Kimberly?</p><p/><p>KIMBERLY FOSS, EMPYRION WEALTH MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Yes, I think this is a great opportunity for the telecom industry for rise in $130 million. It's the third biggest corporate fill in history. It's going to take, Vodafone giving to Verizon. You have the 6.4 percent dividend on Vodafone and 4 percent dividend on Verizon. It's going to propel this thing to no end. It is a big buy for me.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, Scott, obviously the temptation for Verizon was the possible interest rates were as low as they were so if this thinking you get $130 million monkey of its back in the name of Vodafone, you can argue the price, maybe other companies are seizing on the same rate position right now to do something like it?</p><p/><p>SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO: Well, they better hurry, Neil, because we all rates are going up at a pretty alarming rate here. It's kind of interesting though, I don't know if I totally agree with Kim though because I don't really like the space, Neil. It's becoming more competitive and margins are coming in. Meaning profits are dropping.</p><p/><p>So that to me is not a great business to be in and plus these companies especially the tech companies are using cash that's parked overseas because they don't want to repatriate it and pay U.S. taxes. So that money is limited in some degree because instead of it going back to the United States, they are buying other countries. So yes, it's great if you're the acquirer like Nokia, but I am not sure if that helps the companies like Microsoft.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys, I want to switch gears here to address this second issue, three words that don't register with me, retro hunting gear. I am told it is the rage and retailer H&amp;M is all in. Who knew camouflage meant so much cash? Nothing attracts men like military fatigue. So it must be a bulletproof fashion statement? Scott, what do you think?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: Well, I am pretty cool, Neil. So I was ahead of this one and I've already got some orders in on this stuff. I think it's interesting. It's definitely a risk, but I think they are calculated one for H&amp;M because look at what's happened in retail, Neil. Even over the last couple of years, not just this summer where a lot of the retailers have been smashed because it is the same old same old. So I like the fact that this company is going out there and doing something different making a push perhaps into a different section just to roll some heads and see if it actually works.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: What do you think, Kim?</p><p/><p>FOSS: Yes, I agree. I mean, no consumer should be denied and should be ignored especially the male consumer. I got to tell you they're doing the great job with the underwear and let me just tell you who knows? Maybe boxers is the next rage? I wouldn't mind if I came home and saw my husband in some chemo gear.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: This is a family show that maybe I am out of touch and you guys are clearly in touch. Now we know why Jeff Basos flanked down $250 million for the \"Washington Post.\" He was high as the kite or drank out of his mind or both. What else could explain his reason for going big time on \"Washington Post\" reading? Apparently, he was to usher in a new golden age for newspapers lickety-split.</p><p/><p>But Scott, is Jeff on to something because the golden age for newspapers and I love them dearly, but I read them online, the conventional product is gone.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: Me as well, Neil, also that was decades ago. I think regarding whenever he resigned he was lucky he came off and bought it today not four years ago because I guess they're going to get four or five times what it did today, which goes to show you, again, it's kind of like the telecom business. You know, it's not a great business to be in. Yes people go there for their news, but it is online. It's digital. So unless he has some amazing revamping that he's planned here, Neil. I don't think it is a great deal for them as far as the Amazon or other newspapers possibly up for sale.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He is good at marketing stuff and if you were to do something for prime readership customers that could be the start of something. So we have the makings of making this work, but he is up again strong ties?</p><p/><p>FOSS: I think the digital era is here to have something very innovative for a certain segment of the market, but those that don't have the physical paper. Unfortunately, they are aging and they are not buying that paper as much anymore even read online when they magnify it. So I agree with Scott. I think this is not a win-win for Jeff or for the consumer. It is going to be a hard road, but maybe we'll wait and see what happens. He is pretty innovative guy.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Indeed, if he can convince people to pay for that online product then maybe it would work. He would seem to have the best shot of doing that, but it is a very tough battle. Scott and Kim, thank you both very much. That will do it. We will continue monitor the debate with Syria and how it falls out.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When it gets back from vacation, as if a budget deadline and a debt limit deadline and defund Obamacare or don't defund Obamacare deadline, and than immigration reform deadline, and so many other deadlines. As if all of these deadlines were not enough, now this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why I do not - I want to move beyond this fixation with Syria. Do you really think this is just about Syria and do you really think this is about a president who suddenly cares about not going over the head of Congress after years of pushing through executive orders and regulations that (inaudible) that routinely defied Congress. And just as telling last week, when the president was saying when it came to Syria, he really did not need the approval of the Congress.</p><p/><p>Now, this is about confusing Congress, maybe even embarrassing Congress and all of the nine days it will be in session this month, once again, ridiculing Congress and getting Americans to focus, maybe not so much on the president punting, but on Congress, once again, not governing. Now, he could come out smelling like a rose, even though he has given Congress nothing but thorns. But on whom he will pile, probably, all the blame. And is at this point, that the president steps back and says, well, I tried their way. Now the president isn't saying that yet, but it's pretty clear, his confidant informer campaign manager David Axelrod is thinking that right now tweeting that Congress suddenly is the dog that caught the car. I guess that means that Congress was chasing down to Syria in (inaudible) car? And now that it's caught, it has no idea what the hell to do with it or about it?</p><p/><p>Well, me - I have had enough of it, because the only thing I liken to a dog and all of its pile on his, you know, pile of you know what, it's leading in its way, spending bills that never get done, budget reform that never gets touched, a tax makeover that never gets started. You smell what I smell? You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to smell it. It's the same smell. One we both smell before, long before Syria and I suspect, long after Syria. And even if Congress does want to make things right, Washington watcher Chris Stirewalt says they better boogie (ph) fast, because they don't have time to do much. If anything at all.</p><p/><p>Chris, realistically, nine days, this month what can they do?</p><p/><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, they can fight, they can posture, they can shove, they can yell, I think in the end they will have to be here more than those nine days. As you enumerated, aside from the odors that you talked about, there is work to be done. As you said, the continuing resolution funding the government expires at the end of September. You also have, as you said, the rollout of the free stuff (inaudible), the president's help while people can sign up for Obamacare on the first of October. You've got that. And then you have Jack Lew dropped the flag on the debt Derby, that ceiling has to go up in the middle of October - by the middle of October, he says. So, it's all running. Something has got to happen. Syria is related in this way, too. We have sequestration, spending levels that are in place. For the military and non-defense spending across the federal government. Democrats want to get non-defense spending up, if we're dropping billions of dollars worth of bombs on Syria. That's going to make it tougher, and - I suspect you'll hear hawkish Republicans like John McCain and others, saying well, if we're bombing Syria, we need to get rid of these caps on increased spending. We call it sequestration.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: We're going to be talking to a member who is advocating just that. You get my vote to just stop this military sequestration cuts. But having said that, that would be great harm, where there not, if we are going to go to war to be dealing with these annoying pesky financial issues that could bring the government down or shut it down or get it into a debt limit crisis? Wouldn't that play to the president's favor just to have this backdrop and not drop any of these other surprises?</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: Well, I would say that David Axelrod is whistling past the graveyard a little bit on this. If the president of the United States is rebuffed by Congress on the fall to attack another country that is a pretty stinging defeat, and they can slap chop, they can divide (inaudible) however they want. But it will not be good if the president cannot get his way. And we should remember, he was forced to go to Congress. He wanted to do what he did with the attack on Libya, which was to say that it had been approved by an international buddy, in that case, the United Nations and the Arab League, unable to obtain - or not the United Nations, NATO, unable to obtain the cooperation of Great Britain, and without the initial help of the Arab League, the president had no choice, but to do what American presidents hate to do, which is go to Congress.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, flying in the face of what he had said. Really, just 48 hours earlier.</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Chris, thank you, my friend. Good having you again.</p><p/><p>STIREWALT: You bet.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, forget about all these issues piling up. Retired Army General Robert Scales has focused on the real damage of the president throwing his hands up, particularly on Syria, where he all but announced the terror threat around the world - or keep terrorizing the world. General, what do you think of this?</p><p/><p>GEN. ROBERT SCALES, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, you know, Neil, anytime we have these conversations I invoke the wisdom of First Sergeant Braun (ph). I know in Vietnam when I had my dithering moments, Sergeant Braun would say captain, always remember rule 13. Rule 13? Yeah, rule 13 says when in charge, take charge. And rule 13 applies whether you are a captain in the Army or the commander-in-chief. Look, whether we shoot missiles or we don't shoot missiles. When this is all over, the rest of the world and the American people are going to look at this, and scratch their heads over the process, the witness, the dithering, the inner articulation of Wednesday (ph). This since of a loss of will. You know, there is an old - there's an old strategic concept that says military power is equal to capabilities times will. No one doubts our capabilities, but people throughout the world and inside this country, are beginning to question our will. Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Now, you also mentioned, you know, this view that some people ask. That we're not consistent, to put it mildly. And I was always telling people, what do you for, or against or getting involved in Syria, whatever it is, whatever you decided or whatever you want to do, telegraph it immediately and don't sort of dither about it, whether you are not going to be involved, Mr. President, make that very clear. You see, the reason and the story certainly don't draw a red line. You do draw a redline, act on that redline pronto, because any dithering, any waiting just to me kind of emboldens our enemies. But what is your sense of it?</p><p/><p>SCALES: I absolutely agree. You know, there's an old (inaudible), that whenever a nation takes an e (ph), whenever a nation goes - or pauses in an operation, the advantage of the initiative and time shifts to the enemy. And if anybody thinks that Assad isn't going to take advantage of these nine days, or these 13 days to reposition his forces, to gain allegiances in the region, to strengthen his own power, and also to pound his own people with missiles and artillery is wrong. Nine days of inaction shifts the advantage to the enemy, and so we get involved what - two weeks from now? And we wind up basically bouncing sand.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Amazing. General, thank you.</p><p/><p>SCALES: Thanks, Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, media magnate Mort Zuckerman says it could be even worse than that. Forget about how the president is seen in the eyes of the bad guys, the way he's indecisive, this is playing out on the global media, is not exactly proving a ringing endorsement from - for the rest of the world. Guys. What is going on?</p><p/><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN, BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR: Well, what is going on is really an interesting question, because it is almost incomprehensible to witness what is going on. And to try and understand that given, a, the nature of the political system of the United States and B, what the president himself has said, so I'd like to read some of the things that he has said, so I get it right. When he first came into office, and we're now dealing with the much more serious issue, not just Syria but Iran and they're both connected because the credibility that we would have had, if we had done something in Syria, might have had a bigger effect on Iran. Now, the lack of credibility or the collapse of credibility will completely change that whole theater of the world.</p><p/><p>So, Barack Obama shortly after his first election said to use all elements of American power, and I quote, \"to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions\" and he said last year that a nuclear Iran would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the stability of the global economy as well as risk triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty.</p><p/><p>Now, what has happened in Syria have so undermined the international credibility of his entire policy, that the recent failure to respond to the chemical attacks by Syria will affect the credibility and viability of everything we have done so far, which is the core of America's programs and attitudes and credibility vis-.-vis Iran. Now, there is a suggestion we state to hear that the Arab Leagues did not support that. I'm going to read you from the resolutions of the Arab League. OK? Number one is the call upon the United Nations, this just came out - the call upon the United Nations and the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by taking firm and dissuasive means - measures against the perpetrators of this crime, for which the Syrian regime was responsible and to put an end to such violations and crimes of genocide that the Syrian regime has been committing for more than two years.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Is that the whole Arab League saying that, or is it just some of them?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: No, no, it's all the Arab League. No, no, no, it's virtually all, except two - and let me just - I can go on about this, OK? They strongly condemned and denounced this atrocious crime, this is virtually all of them, with the exception of two countries. To strongly condemn and denounce this atrocious crime, in which internationally prohibited chemical weapons were used in flagrant denial of ethical and humanitarian values as well as international laws and usages. I could go on about that, but ..</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But even they are saying that, now post this decision or non- decision ...</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: No, this meeting was just held in the last - yes, right after the ...</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So, could they be saying, they though attack would have been imminent, now that it's looking like it might not be imminent, they are getting worried?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Oh, no, they are very worried that he United States has basically abdicated the long-standing leadership role that we have played in the Middle East, and we have a lot of allies in that part of the world who are critical to us.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: What does Israel say?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Well, Israel of course is the one who's now faced with a huge problem of trying to deal, A, not only with Syria, but with Iran. Iran is a country that has been threatening Israel, and Israel of course on one level, it's going to do whatever it takes to defend themselves. They have a simply theory of life, because everybody knows that Iran is literally several months away at the very most of having a deliverable nuclear weapon.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So they are interpreting that our lack of strong, immediate response in Syria telegraphs we will have the same posture with Iran?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Without question, that whole part of the world.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you agree with it?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: What else can you think about, when you have the president who comes out and says what he says and then does what he does? How can you believe what he says?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So it's vacillating more than any specific position is what has rattled folks, right?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: Of course, nobody -- the president of the United States has to be believed, he has to maintain his credibility. A lot of what we say, we hope, is going to prevent doing things that we don't want to do. We don't want to go to war. That is not what the United States is about. What we want to do is to protect the interests of ourselves and our allies, and there are a number of Arab countries who are our allies, and now they have lost faith in the United States, because they see that whatever he says is not necessarily what he does.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you think, then, Mort, that the president regrets the famous red line remark, that it boxed him into a corner and he is scrambling to get out?</p><p/><p>ZUCKERMAN: I don't know how to measure what he says or what he feels or what he believes at the time he says it, how he changes his mind. That is his job. But his job is also to make sure there is a consistency to what he says, because you cannot just say X on one day, and then say excuse me, I did not mean X, I mean Y. And then say, well, I didn't really mean Y. The president has to have that credibility and consistency, and if he does not have it, he cannot perform on behalf of the United States with our foreign policy and with the credibility it needs. We don't want to go to war every day to prove we are credible. You have to have somebody who, when he says something, everybody knows he means it.</p><p/><p>The only time the Iranians held back on their nuclear weapons program was when the prime minister of Israel said if they got to a certain kind of a level of nuclear capability, the Israelis would act, so even though they could have crossed that line to date, the Iranians have held back, they understand who is to be believed. And now they will not come to the conclusion that this president is to be believed or to be feared.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Mort, powerful stuff. Thank you, my friend, Mort Zuckerman.</p><p/><p>Even Charlie is wrangling with the president on this one, because this decorated Korean War hero has a bone to pick with Barack Obama he says is not exactly acting heroic. Charlie unplugged, here and only here. But before we get back to Syria, Charlie later in the show, a look at the other drama that is being overshadowed by this Syria (inaudible). Remember those NSA spies? Lots more of them than you thought. Guess what? They are not working at the NSA. A whole bunch of them are just a point and click away. You use them every day even now.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Here is what feeds conspiracy theories on Syria. It is all but overshadowing serious spying abuses right here in the U.S. of A. And even now, in fact, more than even right now, the latest reports that Facebook and Twitter and Google have snoops that put those NSA snoops to shame, not just invading our privacy, to hear Katrina Pierson tell it, trampling on it. What is really going on here, Katrina?</p><p/><p>KATRINA PIERSON: Here we are again finding out more and more things about who is reading our emails and who aren't. There was an independent research study that came out that showed that not only are some of these big tech giants reading our emails, but they are also clicking on specific links, which means your attachments are probably also being opened. But then I guess they figure if our government is doing it, it must be legal.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Katrina, are they doing it at the government's behest or on their own? And if so, why?</p><p/><p>PIERSON: That is the thing. Initially, they said, well, the government tells us we have to release this information, but this particular study said absolutely not. They sent out emails, personal emails with protected particular links, and they found that six out of the 50 they sent this through, through the networks, actually clicked on the link, including Google and Facebook. So really, what is the responsibility going on, and where is accountability in Congress on our privacy being violated? We need to start up and get out there and let Congress know they have got to get these companies under control.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It is one thing for them to do something at the strong behest if not court order of the NSA or another government agency, it is quite another to take that power into their own, and it's already come up with issues about how they market things, how they share information, but this goes deeper than that, doesn't it?</p><p/><p>PIERSON: That's the thing. We have to wonder why Congress is allowing this to happen. We already know that big business and government have a sinister marriage going on, and when we look at Google and Facebook and the political donors that come out of these companies to these politicians, it makes you wonder why there is no political will to do anything about it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So now where is all of this going? We know the NSA sort of cracked down, has sort of cracked up in the middle of this focus on Syria. I am sure the guys at the NSA love it. I'm sure the president likes that distraction. Many cynics argue it is the reason why Syria has been dumped in Congress' lap. So where do you think it's going??</p><p/><p>PIERSON: I am not sure, and I do think it is a distraction. You mentioned earlier about some of the other issues Congress is going to have to take on, for example funding Obamacare, immigration and all these other things. So I think there are a lot of shiny objects being dropped into the room to divert attention to things really pressing American citizens today.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Katrina, thank you very much, Katrina Pierson. While this is going on as we speak, despite all the huffing and puffing.</p><p/><p>Well this Syria thing is apparently like the deflecting gift that keeps giving. Not only getting our eye off the spying still going on here ball, but you would not believe this latest doozy on health care ball. Guess what will happen very soon? While all these guys are knee deep in Syria debating. I will give you a clue. It has something to do with unions. I want to give you another clue -- it has something to do with them getting a big present too.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, under the cover of war there, a kamikaze attack by unions right here? Because mark my words, I told you this, while we're all focused on this do we or don't we get involved in Syria thing, general Richard Trumka will pull off one of the greatest stealth victories in the sordid history, short as it is, of this health care law thing. Without anyone knowing, he will have secured the exemption for unions on some of the law's most costly provisions, including the higher fees for Cadillac plans that dominate many unions plans, and ways around employer switching to too many part-time workers that could kill union workers. Only you won't know much about it, because I suspect no one will really cover because the world is too busy focusing on Damascus than unions pulling a fast one in DC. Julie Roginsky I am sure agrees with that point of view, but we'll get to her in a second. Jedediah Bila, to you first on whether that is a real possibility?</p><p/><p>JEDEDIAH BILA: I think they're going to cave to the unions, and I think it's because for Barack Obama to say we don't need union support in the midterm elections would be ridiculous. The unions came out in support of Obamacare, and I think there were a lot of backroom deals and a lot of meetings that went on where the unions acknowledged that there were some things about this law that they did not necessarily like from the start, but they let Barack Obama know, we are allies here, and if we come out and we say we don't like this, you're going to need to mend those things. You're going to need to really account, be accountable to us, because we are the ones who helped you get elected twice, and we are the ones who are going to help your friends get elected over and over. So I think there will be a lot of caving, particularly with respect to the Cadillac tax and with respect to the concern about this influx of full-time workers going to part-time and what that does to a 40-hour workweek for union members.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I don't think they are that sinister. I think they are stupid. But I will say this with all respect to Jedediah, a lot of them if they had just read the bill, they would have realized it added up and we are screwed. But they did not do that. But now they, like any group that feels it's offended and gotten a delay or extension or exemption, they want in, too.</p><p/><p>JULIE ROGINSKY: Yes, I will say something that will offend my friends in the union movement, but that is what collective bargaining is for. Don't send me hate mail, I get it. But you know--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's nice your hate mail is bipartisan.</p><p/><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: -- civil \"Cavuto Clash.\"</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I could see under the darkness of all of this other stuff going on in Syria, some waivers that would be vague (ph), a new line in the bill that this applies to everyone but public union workers, it would not even be that blatant but it would be understood that they have gotten a pass.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: It could happen. But as I said, it shouldn't.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It will.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: I don't know if it will happen. We will see.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Want to place one dollar on this?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: I have $1, that's all about all I have, but I'll put a dollar on it.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: I don't know if it will happen, but I sympathize with the unions, I get where they're coming from, but this is something to deal with the collective bargaining.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: (inaudible), who will be paying for it.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Well, as we've discussed--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You and me.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Not you and I, because your health insurance is not going to change. I don't think they are going to get rid of health care insurance here at News Corp.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You don't think my premiums have not gone up? Your premiums have not gone up?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: My premiums went up well before Barack Obama came to office.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You don't think it's accelerated? You don't think it will continue to accelerate?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Not once Obamacare kicks in.</p><p/><p>BILA: Young people are going to help pay for it, who don't need insurance.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Sure they do.</p><p/><p>BILA: But have been mandated--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: We don't know what is coming, but I do want to address at another time here--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Who says Secretary of State John Kerry is not every bit as good as his boss at it? One moment he is turning up the heat on Syria at the State Department, and the next he is talking about the heat via a video address to a climate conference in the Marshall Islands.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>KERRY: Climate change is a global crisis, and it will require a global solution, one that includes shared resources, shared responsibility, and a shared sense of urgency above all.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Don't get me wrong, I am all for worrying about sweating, but shouldn't our secretary of state right now be sweating more about Syria? That's just me, Jedediah.</p><p/><p>BILA: He wants to talk about everything but the real, legitimate, scary, frightening problem at hand.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He is talking about--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: I love all this talk about climate change. We all agree climate change exists. That's not the argument, John Kerry. The argument is how much of it is man-made. And how much government involvement should we have? Should we have pro free market approaches to address this problem or should we expand big government via stimulus or however you want to argue it in order to address the problem? So stop painting folks on the right as those who don't care about climate change in order to make a political point right now. You want to talk politics? Right now talk Syria. That's what you need to be talking about.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Julie.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: First of all, a Princeton University study came out a couple of days ago or weeks ago that actually said that climate change is linked to crisis, and that climate change is linked to more violence, so I think John Kerry is right to worry about this, because apparently according to the study, if global--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's making (inaudible).</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Well--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It makes despots more despot-like?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: No, but it does make people more desperate when they have to fight over resources, and when they don't have resources to fight, when they have less, fewer resources to have, they are going to fight over that.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: The point he is making is it is a global threat. It is a global threat to security, and if you look at the study, and I think the study is very telling, what it says essentially is that by 2050, if temperatures go up by 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which apparently they might, they will have a chance of doubling--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And that is man-made? And (inaudible) needs us to pay for it?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: First of all, you wanted a free market approach? How about the fact that we had a free market approach, cap and trade, something that the Republicans originally--</p><p/><p>BILA: That's not a free market approach.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: That is something the Republicans originally talked about--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: -- walk, talk and chew gum at the same time?</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: Right now is not the time. You turn on the news right now, you see massive coverage of Syria, everyone in this country, no matter where you stand on the issue, is focused on this. John Kerry should not be pivoting right now to talk about climate change.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But by the same token, many on the right will argue as I argued in the outset, do not use Syria as an excuse not to do anything else, not to address budget, not to--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BILA: -- a great time to expand government influence over the issue of climate change as the entire country is focused on our potential catastrophic involvement in Syria? He thinks this is the key time right now, today, to talk about climate change?</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Is there ever a good time? There is always something going on. If we don't address this right now.</p><p/><p>BILA: There is not always Syria going on.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: First, there was Libya, then there was Egypt. Now there is a Syria.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: We had Iraq for 10 years.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But there is always time for golf.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Days after his announcement that he's given to Congress, just hours after, he is golfing.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Are we really going to start comparing presidential vacations?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Not at all. I just find it interesting.</p><p/><p>BILA: The optics are not good. No matter how you slice it, the optics of him talking about climate change -- you could argue climate change is an important issue, just politically speaking the optics are not good for this right now.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Except for the fact that the majority of Americans agree that something needs to be done about climate change.</p><p/><p>BILA: I agree, but I still think optically there is a problem.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: There is always something going on. If we don't tackle this today, if we don't do this today, people are going to die tomorrow, and that is something we have to acknowledge, and that's something people, climate change deniers don't want to believe it, but it is happening. It is already happening if you look at the studies and it will continue to exacerbate.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I could talk about global cycle patterns of weather and generational shifts and you could attach a very expensive solution to what you call a man-made problem, we can differ until the cows come home, but I find the timing odd.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: (inaudible) timing is odd, I think you guys will never think there's good timing to do that.</p><p/><p>BILA: I think there's good timing, plenty of good timing, and I think it is an important debate to have over government involvement versus how we address this, and it is a global challenge.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: -- don't use it as a (inaudible) distraction on the things we don't like. And conversely, liberals have to (inaudible) that we can't just force companies to pay for every environmental ill you attach to man.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: We could spend more time repealing Obamacare for the 41st time. Or we could focus on things we actually might--</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I would like to repeal you.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I don't mean it.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: You just told me you're my last friend, now you dumped me. You dumped me too.</p><p/><p>BILA: At least you have me.</p><p/><p>ROGINSKY: Thank you, Jedediah.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Between you and Colmes.</p><p/><p>All right, when we come back, the president asked for when he put the Syria in Congress' hand. Congress demands the president dropped all those military secrets cuts or using getting his vote.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: The talk to Republicans in the House say they will now support the president on Syria so John Boehner and Eric Cantor are in. As for the rest of the troops on the right, let's not say all in and my guest says drop the military sequester cuts, Mr. President, or you can drop my support for those Syria strikes.</p><p/><p>That Republican congressman is Michael Turner's offer on Damascus. Congressman, have you gotten any response from the White House?</p><p/><p>REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R), OHIO: No, and just as we have not seen any leadership from the president with respect to his sequestration, his proposed sequestration, which I have opposed that is having devastating effects on our military. Now he wants to draw us into an additional conflict with Syria without addressing the issue that's affecting our men and women in uniform and certainly affecting the performance of our military.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I'm sure you don't want to negotiate deals, is but if possible salvo back from the Democrats, all right, let's drop all sequestration cuts including the ones for defense, what do you say then?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, in order to set the sequestration cuts aside, there have to be meaningful cuts elsewhere. The president embraced that himself when he proposed it and he put together the \"Super Committee\" that was supposed to propose those cut. With his withdrawal their failure resulted in the White House having the responsibility to come forward with those proposals.</p><p/><p>The House passed two bills that would have set aside the sequestration by finding those cuts responsibly elsewhere. The Senate has passed none and the president still today has no response. Meanwhile, our military, we're hearing from the secretary is continuing to pay the price.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, Speaker John Boehner has said he is confident that Republicans will share his view about the urgency of this. That you will go along and support fugitive strikes against Syria. It sounds to me that unless you get this you won't.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, it depends. The president has not really made that case not to the American public or to the international community and certainly not to Congress. He does not appear to have any strategy here. We certainly don't know who we are for and also he has an unexplainable policy of this imaginary red line where the administration --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I am not sure what that means. But the case that he has stated and you're right, it has been all over the map, but he has said he is not interested in regime change. So in other words, Assad stays in power, but he would very crippled, very weak and thereby I guess, getting the White House's argument setting the stage for him to be overthrown is not good enough for you?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, I think certainly the president has indicated that he would like regime change in Syria, but the issue is that he declared this imaginary red line for the use of chemical weapons then redefined it to large-scale use of chemical weapons and now acknowledging that they were used previously. He clearly has not made the case internationally or to the American public or to Congress as to what our national interest? What are the risks and really who are we for?</p><p/><p>The president had months, while hundreds of thousands of people had died in Syria, to address this issue and now at this crisis point trying to draw us into this crisis and a conflict with Syria without addressing what is happening currently in the Department of Defense as a result of his sequestration.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But he has drawn in the House speaker. He has drawn in John McCain. He has drawn in a number of prominent Republican leaders maybe not you -- your speaker was not. So I guess what I'm asking you if your speaker came to you and said, Congressman, I really need you on this to support this. It sounds to me at this point, you would tell him no?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Absolutely. At this point, the president is going to have to make the case that he has not made. He doesn't have a strategy. He has unexplainable policy and unless he does his homework done. I mean, the president has the responsibility to do his homework to get the international community together, to get Congress and the American public behind it. He has not done this. He has managed this as a crisis mode and I do not think that is a manner in which we should be heading into a conflict.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, Congressman Turner, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, switching gears a little bit, are you ready for Samsung's smart watch? You know, it is beating Apple to the punch, but could I ask you something, do you really give a damn?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, now I know why Rolex sales have not been hurting. Apparently all this talk of a super cool smart watch from Samsung no one is biting or for that matter even buzzing. Tomorrow we'll know for sure when Samsung details its latest Dick Tracy wanna-be. But the company's only claim to fame here may be that it beat Apple to the punch offering this.</p><p/><p>Tech analyst Lee Munson says what sounds cool, is it necessarily cool especially in a world where a lot of people express their status in life by the pricey stuff they put on their wrist. So if isn't Swiss, is the smart watch a miss, what do you think?</p><p/><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO LLC CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: Well, I mean, here's the thing. If you are going to look for tomorrow's big announcement from Samsung that they are going to say we have the best new, the iPad, the smartphone of the future and the solution to Syria and the affordable care act, you're not going to get it. And that is what investors want tomorrow.</p><p/><p>They want to know that some company has the new great driver of earnings to pummel Apple or be a big competitor, you're not. What you do have is something very much like back in 1996 when the first Palm Pilot came out. This smartphone you're going to see tomorrow, it's going to have a limited appeal for a limited market.</p><p/><p>There is nothing wrong with that, but again if you have the wrong context or the attachment to what you think is going to happen tomorrow, you are going to be very disappointed and I think that is what going to happen to a lot of investors and viewers out there unless we set them straight today.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, so for a smart watch, Dick Tracy watch, it's been talked about for decades, right? I mean, is it really that much demand for it. Now I'm hardly any -- but to me this sounds stupid. I think if you look at the watch, you look at the time or the date, but for the other stuff what becomes of all the other devices that you do depend on?</p><p/><p>MUNSON: You know, I don't think it is clear what people are really going to use it for. For instance, all the leaks that we are getting and all the blogs is that what we're going to see tomorrow really is about people like myself who were into going to the gym all the time. So they are talking about, you know, it takes pictures of the food you eat and maybe the sophisticated heart rate monitor.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But they have those types of devices. They have those types of devices. Now maybe they combine some of those features to give you the time and the day and the temperature and what they're eating in Bolivia but, come on, right?</p><p/><p>MUNSON: Listen, I am not disagreeing with you, but I think that we do have to have -- there is a context. You are going to be disappointed as anybody who thinks this is going to be more than a cool little toy. I grant you. I do think that if you what status, you are going to buy an actual wrist watch that will never goes on or off line.</p><p/><p>I mean, that's just cool to have something that you don't have to turn off when you're on an airplane, but I think the more important thing is investors, your viewers. Don't get confused tomorrow with whatever people like us end up saying about it because Samsung is a massive vertically integrated conglomerate. What that means is they have tons of products and billions in sales.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I know that, but if they beat Apple to the punch on this and let's say we don't really need this then for Apple wouldn't be better to be never than late?</p><p/><p>MUNSON: Well, I don't think so. You know, the thing is that we don't know -- we didn't know in 1996 what a Palm Pilot was going to be used for. My wife got one shortly after. I didn't know what to use it for, for years and years because it had a very small segment. There are going to be people tomorrow. They are going to want to buy this because it's shiny and new electronic.</p><p/><p>Sales figures I am with you. I don't think it's going to be a mindblower, but I also think that the iPod was not the first MP3 player. What they did is they perfected the MP3 player. Samsung do the R&amp;D and let the Apple do the real R&amp;D, which I like to refer to as rip-off and duplicate only better so I think time will tell.</p><p/><p>I think Apple has to have some sort of risk product, but I think they are going to let everybody else spend the money to figure out the market and Apple usually comes in there and perfects it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, that was the old Apple. I don't know about the new Apple. Lee Munson, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>MUNSON: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, it sounds like the president wrangled GOP leaders John Boehner and Eric Cantor, but it is a top Democrat Charlie Rangel out? When Democrats defect on Syria, is the situation for the White House getting serious?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, one thing about this Syria crisis is it's turning everything upside down. Republicans, you would think would automatically say no to the president are now increasingly saying yes and Democratic supporters like Charlie Rangel are sounding very doubtful as if he will ever say yes.</p><p/><p>The New York congressman is on the phone with us now. Another thing you might not know about the congressman, he is a Korean war hero so he is no daisy in this race. But I want to talk to you about that part of your experience, Congressman.</p><p/><p>The argument the White House has made that this is important to avoid wider conflicts down the road and that we have to do this to send a message. But in delaying the message and leading it in Congress, isn't he compounding that?</p><p/><p>REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK (via telephone): First of all, we are talking about war. Whatever lines the president has drawn. Whatever commitment he may have made to international people, this is putting people in harm's way. They talk about limited war. There is no such thing as a limited war. Iraq was limited war.</p><p/><p>We lost 6,500 American lives over the so-called limited war for a 10-year period. This is an international problem that demands an international solution, but to go into this alone with the idea to bypass the Security Council, and the United Nations, and the Arab League, the European Union, Great Britain, they tell us these people are on the line.</p><p/><p>But this whole idea that every evil person requires such as the president of United States, that requires our troops in there, it does not make sense.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Do you think though that throwing this in Congress is cover for the president because let's say Congress votes against this. I don't know what the read in the House. You may have a better idea than I do then the president could say I tried?</p><p/><p>RANGEL: It's not throwing it in Congress' lap. The fact that the president has drawn a red line it does not constitute them right of the need to say we will go to war you have to come to Congress.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He did it with NATO during the Bosnia situation --</p><p/><p>RANGEL: So did Roosevelt and it's wrong. It is unconstitutional and the Congress goes along with it and you know why because they don't have their constituents for the most part that are making the sacrifice, the people from rural areas and in the cities to volunteer.</p><p/><p>But if they go for one minute every time we went to war was in Kosovo or Panama or Iraq then the Congress will take this. We'll let the president to this. Sullivan told this morning it was about bombing and how could rethink of the loss of American lives or we have to do it because what people will think about us? We're not playing some war games. We're talking about people's lives.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It sounds to me, Congressman, like you are saying that you would be against this as its defense now with the very least to lack of foreign support. So you would vote no on that basis alone?</p><p/><p>RANGEL: You got that right. But this is international. There is no military solution to this problem. Anyone plays the case with every thread to society we have to put our military up that does not make any sense at all.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Charlie Rangel, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>RANGEL: Thank you, buddy.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, the faded drums of war or much louder drums of deal? Something is perking Wall Street's interest and I suspect it's not missiles more like mergers.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Big deals, big risks and big dreams, Scott Martin and Kimberly blitz to see if you buy. First up, folks, those big deals are back with a vengeance whether it's Microsoft in more than a $7 billion transaction or Verizon paying Vodafone a staggering $130 billion to go away. Signs of mergers and acquisitions are just getting going this day? Would that be a good sign, Kimberly?</p><p/><p>KIMBERLY FOSS, EMPYRION WEALTH MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Yes, I think this is a great opportunity for the telecom industry for rise in $130 million. It's the third biggest corporate fill in history. It's going to take, Vodafone giving to Verizon. You have the 6.4 percent dividend on Vodafone and 4 percent dividend on Verizon. It's going to propel this thing to no end. It is a big buy for me.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, Scott, obviously the temptation for Verizon was the possible interest rates were as low as they were so if this thinking you get $130 million monkey of its back in the name of Vodafone, you can argue the price, maybe other companies are seizing on the same rate position right now to do something like it?</p><p/><p>SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO: Well, they better hurry, Neil, because we all rates are going up at a pretty alarming rate here. It's kind of interesting though, I don't know if I totally agree with Kim though because I don't really like the space, Neil. It's becoming more competitive and margins are coming in. Meaning profits are dropping.</p><p/><p>So that to me is not a great business to be in and plus these companies especially the tech companies are using cash that's parked overseas because they don't want to repatriate it and pay U.S. taxes. So that money is limited in some degree because instead of it going back to the United States, they are buying other countries. So yes, it's great if you're the acquirer like Nokia, but I am not sure if that helps the companies like Microsoft.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys, I want to switch gears here to address this second issue, three words that don't register with me, retro hunting gear. I am told it is the rage and retailer H&amp;M is all in. Who knew camouflage meant so much cash? Nothing attracts men like military fatigue. So it must be a bulletproof fashion statement? Scott, what do you think?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: Well, I am pretty cool, Neil. So I was ahead of this one and I've already got some orders in on this stuff. I think it's interesting. It's definitely a risk, but I think they are calculated one for H&amp;M because look at what's happened in retail, Neil. Even over the last couple of years, not just this summer where a lot of the retailers have been smashed because it is the same old same old. So I like the fact that this company is going out there and doing something different making a push perhaps into a different section just to roll some heads and see if it actually works.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: What do you think, Kim?</p><p/><p>FOSS: Yes, I agree. I mean, no consumer should be denied and should be ignored especially the male consumer. I got to tell you they're doing the great job with the underwear and let me just tell you who knows? Maybe boxers is the next rage? I wouldn't mind if I came home and saw my husband in some chemo gear.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: This is a family show that maybe I am out of touch and you guys are clearly in touch. Now we know why Jeff Basos flanked down $250 million for the \"Washington Post.\" He was high as the kite or drank out of his mind or both. What else could explain his reason for going big time on \"Washington Post\" reading? Apparently, he was to usher in a new golden age for newspapers lickety-split.</p><p/><p>But Scott, is Jeff on to something because the golden age for newspapers and I love them dearly, but I read them online, the conventional product is gone.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: Me as well, Neil, also that was decades ago. I think regarding whenever he resigned he was lucky he came off and bought it today not four years ago because I guess they're going to get four or five times what it did today, which goes to show you, again, it's kind of like the telecom business. You know, it's not a great business to be in. Yes people go there for their news, but it is online. It's digital. So unless he has some amazing revamping that he's planned here, Neil. I don't think it is a great deal for them as far as the Amazon or other newspapers possibly up for sale.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He is good at marketing stuff and if you were to do something for prime readership customers that could be the start of something. So we have the makings of making this work, but he is up again strong ties?</p><p/><p>FOSS: I think the digital era is here to have something very innovative for a certain segment of the market, but those that don't have the physical paper. Unfortunately, they are aging and they are not buying that paper as much anymore even read online when they magnify it. So I agree with Scott. I think this is not a win-win for Jeff or for the consumer. It is going to be a hard road, but maybe we'll wait and see what happens. He is pretty innovative guy.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Indeed, if he can convince people to pay for that online product then maybe it would work. He would seem to have the best shot of doing that, but it is a very tough battle. Scott and Kim, thank you both very much. That will do it. We will continue monitor the debate with Syria and how it falls out.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Welcome, everybody.  I am Neil Cavuto.  And add a possible war with Syria  to Congress to do less.  When it gets back from vacation, as if a budget  deadline and a debt limit deadline and defund Obamacare or don't defund  Obamacare deadline, and than immigration reform deadline, and so many other  deadlines.  As if all of these deadlines were not enough, now this.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why I do not - I want to move beyond this fixation with Syria.  Do  you really think this is just about Syria and do you really think this is  about a president who suddenly cares about not going over the head of  Congress after years of pushing through executive orders and regulations  that (inaudible) that routinely defied Congress.  And just as telling last  week, when the president was saying when it came to Syria, he really did  not need the approval of the Congress.</p><p>Now, this is about confusing Congress, maybe even embarrassing Congress and  all of the nine days it will be in session this month, once again,  ridiculing Congress and getting Americans to focus, maybe not so much on  the president punting, but on Congress, once again, not governing.  Now, he  could come out smelling like a rose, even though he has given Congress  nothing but thorns.  But on whom he will pile, probably, all the blame.   And is at this point, that the president steps back and says, well, I tried  their way.  Now the president isn't saying that yet, but it's pretty clear,  his confidant informer campaign manager David Axelrod is thinking that  right now tweeting that Congress suddenly is the dog that caught the car.   I guess that means that Congress was chasing down to Syria in (inaudible)  car?  And now that it's caught, it has no idea what the hell to do with it  or about it?</p><p>Well, me - I have had enough of it, because the only thing I liken to a dog  and all of its pile on his, you know, pile of you know what, it's leading  in its way, spending bills that never get done, budget reform that never  gets touched, a tax makeover that never gets started.  You smell what I  smell?  You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to smell it.  It's  the same smell.  One we both smell before, long before Syria and I suspect,  long after Syria.  And even if Congress does want to make things right,  Washington watcher Chris Stirewalt says they better boogie (ph) fast,  because they don't have time to do much.  If anything at all.</p><p>Chris, realistically, nine days, this month what can they do?</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR:  Well, they can fight,  they can posture, they can shove, they can yell, I think in the end they  will have to be here more than those nine days.  As you enumerated, aside  from the odors that you talked about, there is work to be done.  As you  said, the continuing resolution funding the government expires at the end  of September.  You also have, as you said, the rollout of the free stuff  (inaudible), the president's help while people can sign up for Obamacare on  the first of October.  You've got that.  And then you have Jack Lew dropped  the flag on the debt Derby, that ceiling has to go up in the middle of  October - by the middle of October, he says.  So, it's all running.   Something has got to happen.  Syria is related in this way, too.  We have  sequestration, spending levels that are in place.  For the military and  non-defense spending across the federal government.  Democrats want to get  non-defense spending up, if we're dropping billions of dollars worth of  bombs on Syria.  That's going to make it tougher, and - I suspect you'll  hear hawkish Republicans like John McCain and others, saying well, if we're  bombing Syria, we need to get rid of these caps on increased spending.  We  call it sequestration.</p><p>CAVUTO:  We're going to be talking to a member who is advocating just that.   You get my vote to just stop this military sequestration cuts.  But having  said that, that would be great harm, where there not, if we are going to go  to war to be dealing with these annoying pesky financial issues that could  bring the government down or shut it down or get it into a debt limit  crisis?  Wouldn't that play to the president's favor just to have this  backdrop and not drop any of these other surprises? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, I would say that David Axelrod is whistling past the  graveyard a little bit on this.  If the president of the United States is  rebuffed by Congress on the fall to attack another country that is a pretty  stinging defeat, and they can slap chop, they can divide (inaudible)  however they want.  But it will not be good if the president cannot get his  way.  And we should remember, he was forced to go to Congress.  He wanted  to do what he did with the attack on Libya, which was to say that it had  been approved by an international buddy, in that case, the United Nations  and the Arab League, unable to obtain - or not the United Nations, NATO,  unable to obtain the cooperation of Great Britain, and without the initial  help of the Arab League, the president had no choice, but to do what  American presidents hate to do, which is go to Congress.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yeah, flying in the face of what he had said.  Really, just 48  hours earlier.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Chris, thank you, my friend.  Good having you again.</p><p>STIREWALT:  You bet.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, forget about all these issues piling up.  Retired Army  General Robert Scales has focused on the real damage of the president  throwing his hands up, particularly on Syria, where he all but announced  the terror threat around the world - or keep terrorizing the world.   General, what do you think of this?</p><p>GEN. ROBERT SCALES, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Well, you know, Neil, anytime we  have these conversations I invoke the wisdom of First Sergeant Braun (ph).   I know in Vietnam when I had my dithering moments, Sergeant Braun would say  captain, always remember rule 13.  Rule 13?  Yeah, rule 13 says when in  charge, take charge.  And rule 13 applies whether you are a captain in the  Army or the commander-in-chief.  Look, whether we shoot missiles or we  don't shoot missiles.  When this is all over, the rest of the world and the  American people are going to look at this, and scratch their heads over the  process, the witness, the dithering, the inner articulation of Wednesday  (ph).  This since of a loss of will.  You know, there is an old - there's  an old strategic concept that says military power is equal to capabilities  times will.  No one doubts our capabilities, but people throughout the  world and inside this country, are beginning to question our will.  Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, you also mentioned, you know, this view that some people ask.   That we're not consistent, to put it mildly.  And I was always telling  people, what do you for, or against or getting involved in Syria, whatever  it is, whatever you decided or whatever you want to do, telegraph it  immediately and don't sort of dither about it, whether you are not going to  be involved, Mr. President, make that very clear.  You see, the reason and  the story certainly don't draw a red line.  You do draw a redline, act on  that redline pronto, because any dithering, any waiting just to me kind of  emboldens our enemies.  But what is your sense of it?</p><p>SCALES:  I absolutely agree.  You know, there's an old (inaudible), that  whenever a nation takes an e (ph), whenever a nation goes - or pauses in an  operation, the advantage of the initiative and time shifts to the enemy.   And if anybody thinks that Assad isn't going to take advantage of these  nine days, or these 13 days to reposition his forces, to gain allegiances  in the region, to strengthen his own power, and also to pound his own  people with missiles and artillery is wrong.  Nine days of inaction shifts  the advantage to the enemy, and so we get involved what - two weeks from  now?  And we wind  up basically bouncing sand.</p><p>CAVUTO: Amazing.  General, thank you.</p><p>SCALES:  Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, media magnate Mort Zuckerman says it could be even worse  than that.  Forget about how the president is seen in the eyes of the bad  guys, the way he's indecisive, this is playing out on the global media, is  not exactly proving a ringing endorsement from - for the rest of the world.   Guys.  What is going on? </p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN, BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR:  Well, what is going on is really an  interesting question, because it is almost incomprehensible to witness what  is going on.  And to try and understand that given, a, the nature of the  political system of the United States and B, what the president himself has  said, so I'd like to read some of the things that he has said, so I get it  right.  When he first came into office, and we're now dealing with the much  more serious issue, not just Syria but Iran and they're both connected  because the credibility that we would have had, if we had done something in  Syria, might have had a bigger effect on Iran.  Now, the lack of  credibility or the collapse of credibility will completely change that  whole theater of the world.  </p><p>So, Barack Obama shortly after his first election said to use all elements  of American power, and I quote, \"to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions\" and he  said last year that a nuclear Iran would threaten the elimination of  Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the stability of the global  economy as well as risk triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and  the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty.  </p><p>Now, what has happened in Syria have so undermined the international  credibility of his entire policy, that the recent failure to respond to the  chemical attacks by Syria will affect the credibility and viability of  everything we have done so far, which is the core of America's programs and  attitudes and credibility vis-.-vis Iran.  Now, there is a suggestion we  state to hear that the Arab Leagues did not support that.  I'm going to  read you from the resolutions of the Arab League.  OK?  Number one is the  call upon the United Nations, this just came out - the call upon the United  Nations and the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by  taking firm and dissuasive means - measures against the perpetrators of  this crime, for which the Syrian regime was responsible and to put an end  to such violations and crimes of genocide that the Syrian regime has been  committing for more than two years.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is that the whole Arab League saying that, or is it just some of  them? </p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  No, no, it's all the Arab League.  No, no, no, it's virtually  all, except two  - and let me just - I can go on about this, OK?  They  strongly condemned and denounced this atrocious crime, this is virtually  all of them, with the exception of two countries.  To strongly condemn and  denounce this atrocious crime, in which internationally prohibited chemical  weapons were used in flagrant denial of ethical and humanitarian values as  well as international laws and usages.  I could go on about that, but ..</p><p>CAVUTO:  But even they are saying that, now post this decision or non- decision ...</p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  No, this meeting was just held in the last - yes, right after  the ...</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, could they be saying, they though attack would have been  imminent, now that it's looking like it might not be imminent, they are  getting worried? </p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  Oh, no, they are very worried that he United States has  basically abdicated the long-standing leadership role that we have played  in the Middle East, and we have a lot of allies in that part of the world  who are critical to us.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  What does Israel say?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  Well, Israel of course is the one who's now faced with a huge  problem of trying to deal, A, not only with Syria, but with Iran.  Iran is  a country that has been threatening Israel, and Israel of course on one  level, it's going to do whatever it takes to defend themselves.  They have  a simply theory of life, because everybody knows that Iran is literally  several months away at the very most of having a deliverable nuclear  weapon.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So they are interpreting that our lack of strong, immediate  response in Syria telegraphs we will have the same posture with Iran?  </p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  Without question, that whole part of the world.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you agree with it?</p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  What else can you think about, when you have the president who  comes out and says what he says and then does what he does?  How can you  believe what he says?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So it's vacillating more than any specific position is what has  rattled folks, right?  </p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  Of course, nobody -- the president of the United States has to  be believed, he has to maintain his credibility.  A lot of what we say, we  hope, is going to prevent doing things that we don't want to do.  We don't  want to go to war.  That is not what the United States is about.  What we  want to do is to protect the interests of ourselves and our allies, and  there are a number of Arab countries who are our allies, and now they have  lost faith in the United States, because they see that whatever he says is  not necessarily what he does.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think, then, Mort, that the president regrets the famous  red line remark, that it boxed him into a corner and he is scrambling to  get out?  </p><p>ZUCKERMAN:  I don't know how to measure what he says or what he feels or  what he believes at the time he says it, how he changes his mind.  That is  his job.  But his job is also to make sure there is a consistency to what  he says, because you cannot just say X on one day, and then say excuse me,  I did not mean X, I mean Y.  And then say, well, I didn't really mean Y.   The president has to have that credibility and consistency, and if he does  not have it, he cannot perform on behalf of the United States with our  foreign policy and with the credibility it needs.  We don't want to go to  war every day to prove we are credible.  You have to have somebody who,  when he says something, everybody knows he means it.</p><p>The only time the Iranians held back on their nuclear weapons program was  when the prime minister of Israel said if they got to a certain kind of a  level of nuclear capability, the Israelis would act, so even though they  could have crossed that line to date, the Iranians have held back, they  understand who is to be believed.  And now they will not come to the  conclusion that this president is to be believed or to be feared.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mort, powerful stuff.  Thank you, my friend, Mort Zuckerman.  </p><p>Even Charlie is wrangling with the president on this one, because this  decorated Korean War hero has a bone to pick with Barack Obama he says is  not exactly acting heroic.  Charlie unplugged, here and only here.  But  before we get back to Syria, Charlie later in the show, a look at the other  drama that is being overshadowed by this Syria (inaudible).  Remember those  NSA spies?  Lots more of them than you thought.  Guess what?  They are not  working at the NSA.  A whole bunch of them are just a point and click away.   You use them every day even now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Here is what feeds conspiracy theories on Syria.  It is all but  overshadowing serious spying abuses right here in the U.S. of A.  And even  now, in fact, more than even right now, the latest reports that Facebook  and Twitter and Google have snoops that put those NSA snoops to shame, not  just invading our privacy, to hear Katrina Pierson tell it, trampling on  it.  What is really going on here, Katrina?  </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON:  Here we are again finding out more and more things about  who is reading our emails and who aren't.  There was an independent  research study that came out that showed that not only are some of these  big tech giants reading our emails, but they are also clicking on specific  links, which means your attachments are probably also being opened.  But  then I guess they figure if our government is doing it, it must be legal.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Katrina, are they doing it at the government's behest or on their  own?  And if so, why?  </p><p>PIERSON:  That is the thing.  Initially, they said, well, the government  tells us we have to release this information, but this particular study  said absolutely not.  They sent out emails, personal emails with protected  particular links, and they found that six out of the 50 they sent this  through, through the networks, actually clicked on the link, including  Google and Facebook.  So really, what is the responsibility going on, and  where is accountability in Congress on our privacy being violated?  We need  to start up and get out there and let Congress know they have got to get  these companies under control.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is one thing for them to do something at the strong behest if  not court order of the NSA or another government agency, it is quite  another to take that power into their own, and it's already come up with  issues about how they market things, how they share information, but this  goes deeper than that, doesn't it? </p><p>PIERSON:  That's the thing.  We have to wonder why Congress is allowing  this to happen.  We already know that big business and government have a  sinister marriage going on, and when we look at Google and Facebook and the  political donors that come out of these companies to these politicians, it  makes you wonder why there is no political will to do anything about it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So now where is all of this going?  We know the NSA sort of  cracked down, has sort of cracked up in the middle of this focus on Syria.   I am sure the guys at the NSA love it.  I'm sure the president likes that  distraction.  Many cynics argue it is the reason why Syria has been dumped  in Congress' lap.  So where do you think it's going??  </p><p>PIERSON:  I am not sure, and I do think it is a distraction.  You mentioned  earlier about some of the other issues Congress is going to have to take  on, for example funding Obamacare, immigration and all these other things.   So I think there are a lot of shiny objects being dropped into the room to  divert attention to things really pressing American citizens today.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Katrina, thank you very much, Katrina Pierson.  While this is  going on as we speak, despite all the huffing and puffing.  </p><p>Well this Syria thing is apparently like the deflecting gift that keeps  giving.  Not only getting our eye off the spying still going on here ball,  but you would not believe this latest doozy on health care ball.  Guess  what will happen very soon?  While all these guys are knee deep in Syria  debating.  I will give you a clue.  It has something to do with unions.  I  want to give you another clue -- it has something to do with them getting a  big present too.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, under the cover of war there, a kamikaze attack by unions  right here?  Because mark my words, I told you this, while we're all  focused on this do we or don't we get involved in Syria thing, general  Richard Trumka will pull off one of the greatest stealth victories in the  sordid history, short as it is, of this health care law thing.  Without  anyone knowing, he will have secured the exemption for unions on some of  the law's most costly provisions, including the higher fees for Cadillac  plans that dominate many unions plans, and ways around employer switching  to too many part-time workers that could kill union workers.  Only you  won't know much about it, because I suspect no one will really cover  because the world is too busy focusing on Damascus than unions pulling a  fast one in DC.  Julie Roginsky I am sure agrees with that point of view,  but we'll get to her in a second.  Jedediah Bila, to you first on whether  that is a real possibility?  </p><p>JEDEDIAH BILA:  I think they're going to cave to the unions, and I think  it's because for Barack Obama to say we don't need union support in the  midterm elections would be ridiculous.  The unions came out in support of  Obamacare, and I think there were a lot of backroom deals and a lot of  meetings that went on where the unions acknowledged that there were some  things about this law that they did not necessarily like from the start,  but they let Barack Obama know, we are allies here, and if we come out and  we say we don't like this, you're going to need to mend those things.   You're going to need to really account, be accountable to us, because we  are the ones who helped you get elected twice, and we are the ones who are  going to help your friends get elected over and over.  So I think there  will be a lot of caving, particularly with respect to the Cadillac tax and  with respect to the concern about this influx of full-time workers going to  part-time and what that does to a 40-hour workweek for union members.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't think they are that sinister.  I think they are stupid.   But I will say this with all respect to Jedediah, a lot of them if they had  just read the bill, they would have realized it added up and we are  screwed.  But they did not do that.  But now they, like any group that  feels it's offended and gotten a delay or extension or exemption, they want  in, too.   </p><p>JULIE ROGINSKY:  Yes, I will say something that will offend my friends in  the union movement, but that is what collective bargaining is for.  Don't  send me hate mail, I get it.  But you know--</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's nice your hate mail is bipartisan.  </p><p>[LAUGHTER] </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA:  -- civil \"Cavuto Clash.\"</p><p>CAVUTO:  I could see under the darkness of all of this other stuff going on  in Syria, some waivers that would be vague (ph), a new line in the bill  that this applies to everyone but public union workers, it would not even  be that blatant but it would be understood that they have gotten a pass. </p><p>ROGINSKY:  It could happen.  But as I said, it shouldn't.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It will.  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  I don't know if it will happen.  We will see. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Want to place one dollar on this?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA:  I have $1, that's all about all I have, but I'll put a dollar on it.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  I don't know if it will happen, but I sympathize with the  unions, I get where they're coming from, but this is something to deal with  the collective bargaining.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  (inaudible), who will be paying for it.  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  Well, as we've discussed--</p><p>CAVUTO:  You and me.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Not you and I, because your health insurance is not going to  change.  I don't think they are going to get rid of health care insurance  here at News Corp.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You don't think my premiums have not gone up?  Your premiums have  not gone up?</p><p>ROGINSKY:  My premiums went up well before Barack Obama came to office.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You don't think it's accelerated?  You don't think it will  continue to accelerate?  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  Not once Obamacare kicks in.</p><p>BILA:  Young people are going to help pay for it, who don't need insurance.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Sure they do.</p><p>BILA:  But have been mandated--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  We don't know what is coming, but I do want to address at another  time here--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who says Secretary of State John Kerry is not every bit as good as  his boss at it?  One moment he is turning up the heat on Syria at the State  Department, and the next he is talking about the heat via a video address  to a climate conference in the Marshall Islands.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KERRY:  Climate change is a global crisis, and it will require a global  solution, one that includes shared resources, shared responsibility, and a  shared sense of urgency above all.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Don't get me wrong, I am all for worrying about sweating, but  shouldn't our secretary of state right now be sweating more about Syria?   That's just me, Jedediah.  </p><p>BILA:  He wants to talk about everything but the real, legitimate, scary,  frightening problem at hand.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  He is talking about--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BILA:  I love all this talk about climate change.  We all agree climate  change exists.  That's not the argument, John Kerry.  The argument is how  much of it is man-made.  And how much government involvement should we  have?  Should we have pro free market approaches to address this problem or  should we expand big government via stimulus or however you want to argue  it in order to address the problem?  So stop painting folks on the right as  those who don't care about climate change in order to make a political  point right now.  You want to talk politics?  Right now talk Syria.  That's  what you need to be talking about.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Julie.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  First of all, a Princeton University study came out a couple of  days ago or weeks ago that actually said that climate change is linked to  crisis, and that climate change is linked to more violence, so I think John  Kerry is right to worry about this, because apparently according to the  study, if global-- </p><p>CAVUTO:  It's making (inaudible).</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Well--</p><p>CAVUTO:  It makes despots more despot-like?  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  No, but it does make people more desperate when they have to  fight over resources, and when they don't have resources to fight, when  they have less, fewer resources to have, they are going to fight over that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY:  The point he is making is it is a global threat.  It is a global  threat to security, and if you look at the study, and I think the study is  very telling, what it says essentially is that by 2050, if temperatures go  up by 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which apparently they might, they will have a  chance of doubling-- </p><p>CAVUTO:  And that is man-made? And (inaudible) needs us to pay for it? </p><p>ROGINSKY:  First of all, you wanted a free market approach?  How about the  fact that we had a free market approach, cap and trade, something that the  Republicans originally--  </p><p>BILA:  That's not a free market approach.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  That is something the Republicans originally talked about--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  -- walk, talk and chew gum at the same time?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA:  Right now is not the time.  You turn on the news right now, you see  massive coverage of Syria, everyone in this country, no matter where you  stand on the issue, is focused on this.  John Kerry should not be pivoting  right now to talk about climate change.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  But by the same token, many on the right will argue as I argued in  the outset, do not use Syria as an excuse not to do anything else, not to  address budget, not to-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BILA:  -- a great time to expand government influence over the issue of  climate change as the entire country is focused on our potential  catastrophic involvement in Syria?  He thinks this is the key time right  now, today, to talk about climate change?   </p><p>ROGINSKY:  Is there ever a good time?  There is always something going on.   If we don't address this right now. </p><p>BILA:  There is not always Syria going on.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  First, there was Libya, then there was Egypt.  Now there is a  Syria.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY:  We had Iraq for 10 years.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But there is always time for golf. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Days after his announcement that he's given to Congress, just  hours after, he is golfing.  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  Are we really going to start comparing presidential vacations?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Not at all.  I just find it interesting.</p><p>BILA:  The optics are not good.  No matter how you slice it, the optics of  him talking about climate change -- you could argue climate change is an  important issue, just politically speaking the optics are not good for this  right now.   </p><p>ROGINSKY:  Except for the fact that the majority of Americans agree that  something needs to be done about climate change. </p><p>BILA:  I agree, but I still think optically there is a problem.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  There is always something going on.  If we don't tackle this  today, if we don't do this today, people are going to die tomorrow, and  that is something we have to acknowledge, and that's something people,  climate change deniers don't want to believe it, but it is happening.  It  is already happening if you look at the studies and it will continue to  exacerbate.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I could talk about global cycle patterns of weather and  generational shifts and you could attach a very expensive solution to what  you call a man-made problem, we can differ until the cows come home, but I  find the timing odd. </p><p>ROGINSKY:  (inaudible) timing is odd, I think you guys will never think  there's good timing to do that.</p><p>BILA:  I think there's good timing, plenty of good timing, and I think it  is an important debate to have over government involvement versus how we  address this, and it is a global challenge.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>CAVUTO:  -- don't use it as a (inaudible) distraction on the things we  don't like.  And conversely, liberals have to (inaudible) that we can't  just force companies to pay for every environmental ill you attach to man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGINSKY:  We could spend more time repealing Obamacare for the 41st time.   Or we could focus on things we actually might--</p><p>CAVUTO:  I would like to repeal you.   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't mean it.  </p><p>ROGINSKY:  You just told me you're my last friend, now you dumped me.  You  dumped me too.</p><p>BILA:  At least you have me.</p><p>ROGINSKY:  Thank you, Jedediah.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Between you and Colmes.  </p><p>All right, when we come back, the president asked for when he put the Syria  in Congress' hand.  Congress demands the president dropped all those  military secrets cuts or using getting his vote.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The talk to Republicans in the House say they will now support the  president on Syria so John Boehner and Eric Cantor are in.  As for the rest  of the troops on the right, let's not say all in and my guest says drop the  military sequester cuts, Mr. President, or you can drop my support for  those Syria strikes.  </p><p>That Republican congressman is Michael Turner's offer on Damascus.   Congressman, have you gotten any response from the White House?</p><p>REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R), OHIO:  No, and just as we have not seen any  leadership from the president with respect to his sequestration, his  proposed sequestration, which I have opposed that is having devastating  effects on our military.  Now he wants to draw us into an additional  conflict with Syria without addressing the issue that's affecting our men  and women in uniform and certainly affecting the performance of our  military.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm sure you don't want to negotiate deals, is but if possible  salvo back from the Democrats, all right, let's drop all sequestration cuts  including the ones for defense, what do you say then?</p><p>TURNER:  Well, in order to set the sequestration cuts aside, there have to  be meaningful cuts elsewhere.  The president embraced that himself when he  proposed it and he put together the \"Super Committee\" that was supposed to  propose those cut.  With his withdrawal their failure resulted in the White  House having the responsibility to come forward with those proposals.</p><p>The House passed two bills that would have set aside the sequestration by  finding those cuts responsibly elsewhere.  The Senate has passed none and  the president still today has no response.  Meanwhile, our military, we're  hearing from the secretary is continuing to pay the price.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, Speaker John Boehner has said he is confident that  Republicans will share his view about the urgency of this.  That you will  go along and support fugitive strikes against Syria.  It sounds to me that  unless you get this you won't.</p><p>TURNER:  Well, it depends.  The president has not really made that case not  to the American public or to the international community and certainly not  to Congress.  He does not appear to have any strategy here.  We certainly  don't know who we are for and also he has an unexplainable policy of this  imaginary red line where the administration -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I am not sure what that means.  But the case that he has stated  and you're right, it has been all over the map, but he has said he is not  interested in regime change.  So in other words, Assad stays in power, but  he would very crippled, very weak and thereby I guess, getting the White  House's argument setting the stage for him to be overthrown is not good  enough for you?</p><p>TURNER:  Well, I think certainly the president has indicated that he would  like regime change in Syria, but the issue is that he declared this  imaginary red line for the use of chemical weapons then redefined it to  large-scale use of chemical weapons and now acknowledging that they were  used previously.  He clearly has not made the case internationally or to  the American public or to Congress as to what our national interest?  What  are the risks and really who are we for?</p><p>The president had months, while hundreds of thousands of people had died in  Syria, to address this issue and now at this crisis point trying to draw us  into this crisis and a conflict with Syria without addressing what is  happening currently in the Department of Defense as a result of his  sequestration.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But he has drawn in the House speaker.  He has drawn in John  McCain.  He has drawn in a number of prominent Republican leaders maybe not  you -- your speaker was not.  So I guess what I'm asking you if your  speaker came to you and said, Congressman, I really need you on this to  support this.  It sounds to me at this point, you would tell him no?</p><p>TURNER:  Absolutely.  At this point, the president is going to have to make  the case that he has not made.  He doesn't have a strategy.  He has  unexplainable policy and unless he does his homework done.  I mean, the  president has the responsibility to do his homework to get the  international community together, to get Congress and the American public  behind it.  He has not done this.  He has managed this as a crisis mode and  I do not think that is a manner in which we should be heading into a  conflict.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Congressman Turner, thank you very much.</p><p>TURNER:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, switching gears a little bit, are you ready for Samsung's  smart watch?  You know, it is beating Apple to the punch, but could I ask  you something, do you really give a damn?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, now I know why Rolex sales have not been hurting.   Apparently all this talk of a super cool smart watch from Samsung no one is  biting or for that matter even buzzing.  Tomorrow we'll know for sure when  Samsung details its latest Dick Tracy wanna-be.  But the company's only  claim to fame here may be that it beat Apple to the punch offering this.</p><p>Tech analyst Lee Munson says what sounds cool, is it necessarily cool  especially in a world where a lot of people express their status in life by  the pricey stuff they put on their wrist.  So if isn't Swiss, is the smart  watch a miss, what do you think?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO LLC CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Well, I mean, here's  the thing.  If you are going to look for tomorrow's big announcement from  Samsung that they are going to say we have the best new, the iPad, the  smartphone of the future and the solution to Syria and the affordable care  act, you're not going to get it.  And that is what investors want tomorrow.</p><p>They want to know that some company has the new great driver of earnings to  pummel Apple or be a big competitor, you're not.  What you do have is  something very much like back in 1996 when the first Palm Pilot came out.   This smartphone you're going to see tomorrow, it's going to have a limited  appeal for a limited market.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with that, but again if you have the wrong context  or the attachment to what you think is going to happen tomorrow, you are  going to be very disappointed and I think that is what going to happen to a  lot of investors and viewers out there unless we set them straight today.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, so for a smart watch, Dick Tracy watch, it's been  talked about for decades, right?  I mean, is it really that much demand for  it.  Now I'm hardly any -- but to me this sounds stupid.  I think if you  look at the watch, you look at the time or the date, but for the other  stuff what becomes of all the other devices that you do depend on?</p><p>MUNSON:  You know, I don't think it is clear what people are really going  to use it for.  For instance, all the leaks that we are getting and all the  blogs is that what we're going to see tomorrow really is about people like  myself who were into going to the gym all the time.  So they are talking  about, you know, it takes pictures of the food you eat and maybe the  sophisticated heart rate monitor.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they have those types of devices.  They have those types of  devices.  Now maybe they combine some of those features to give you the  time and the day and the temperature and what they're eating in Bolivia  but, come on, right?</p><p>MUNSON:  Listen, I am not disagreeing with you, but I think that we do have  to have -- there is a context.  You are going to be disappointed as anybody  who thinks this is going to be more than a cool little toy.  I grant you.   I do think that if you what status, you are going to buy an actual wrist  watch that will never goes on or off line.</p><p>I mean, that's just cool to have something that you don't have to turn off  when you're on an airplane, but I think the more important thing is  investors, your viewers.  Don't get confused tomorrow with whatever people  like us end up saying about it because Samsung is a massive vertically  integrated conglomerate.  What that means is they have tons of products and  billions in sales.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know that, but if they beat Apple to the punch on this and let's  say we don't really need this then for Apple wouldn't be better to be never  than late?</p><p>MUNSON:  Well, I don't think so.  You know, the thing is that we don't know  -- we didn't know in 1996 what a Palm Pilot was going to be used for.  My  wife got one shortly after.  I didn't know what to use it for, for years  and years because it had a very small segment.  There are going to be  people tomorrow.  They are going to want to buy this because it's shiny and  new electronic.</p><p>Sales figures I am with you.  I don't think it's going to be a mindblower,  but I also think that the iPod was not the first MP3 player.  What they did  is they perfected the MP3 player.  Samsung do the R&amp;D and let the Apple do  the real R&amp;D, which I like to refer to as rip-off and duplicate only better  so I think time will tell.</p><p>I think Apple has to have some sort of risk product, but I think they are  going to let everybody else spend the money to figure out the market and  Apple usually comes in there and perfects it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, that was the old Apple.  I don't know about the new  Apple.  Lee Munson, thank you very much.</p><p>MUNSON:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  In the meantime, it sounds like the president wrangled GOP leaders  John Boehner and Eric Cantor, but it is a top Democrat Charlie Rangel out?   When Democrats defect on Syria, is the situation for the White House  getting serious?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, one thing about this Syria crisis is it's turning everything  upside down.  Republicans, you would think would automatically say no to  the president are now increasingly saying yes and Democratic supporters  like Charlie Rangel are sounding very doubtful as if he will ever say yes.</p><p>The New York congressman is on the phone with us now.  Another thing you  might not know about the congressman, he is a Korean war hero so he is no  daisy in this race.  But I want to talk to you about that part of your  experience, Congressman.</p><p>The argument the White House has made that this is important to avoid wider  conflicts down the road and that we have to do this to send a message.  But  in delaying the message and leading it in Congress, isn't he compounding  that?</p><p>REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK (via telephone):  First of all, we are  talking about war.  Whatever lines the president has drawn.  Whatever  commitment he may have made to international people, this is putting people  in harm's way.  They talk about limited war.  There is no such thing as a  limited war.  Iraq was limited war. </p><p>We lost 6,500 American lives over the so-called limited war for a 10-year  period.  This is an international problem that demands an international  solution, but to go into this alone with the idea to bypass the Security  Council, and the United Nations, and the Arab League, the European Union,  Great Britain, they tell us these people are on the line.</p><p>But this whole idea that every evil person requires such as the president  of United States, that requires our troops in there, it does not make  sense.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think though that throwing this in Congress is cover for  the president because let's say Congress votes against this.  I don't know  what the read in the House.  You may have a better idea than I do then the  president could say I tried?</p><p>RANGEL:  It's not throwing it in Congress' lap.  The fact that the  president has drawn a red line it does not constitute them right of the  need to say we will go to war you have to come to Congress.</p><p>CAVUTO:  He did it with NATO during the Bosnia situation -- </p><p>RANGEL:  So did Roosevelt and it's wrong.  It is unconstitutional and the  Congress goes along with it and you know why because they don't have their  constituents for the most part that are making the sacrifice, the people  from rural areas and in the cities to volunteer.</p><p>But if they go for one minute every time we went to war was in Kosovo or  Panama or Iraq then the Congress will take this.  We'll let the president  to this.  Sullivan told this morning it was about bombing and how could  rethink of the loss of American lives or we have to do it because what  people will think about us?  We're not playing some war games.  We're  talking about people's lives.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It sounds to me, Congressman, like you are saying that you would  be against this as its defense now with the very least to lack of foreign  support.  So you would vote no on that basis alone?</p><p>RANGEL:  You got that right.  But this is international.  There is no  military solution to this problem.  Anyone plays the case with every thread  to society we have to put our military up that does not make any sense at  all.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Charlie Rangel, thank you very much.</p><p>RANGEL:  Thank you, buddy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the faded drums of war or much louder drums of deal?   Something is perking Wall Street's interest and I suspect it's not missiles  more like mergers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Big deals, big risks and big dreams, Scott Martin and Kimberly  blitz to see if you buy.  First up, folks, those big deals are back with a  vengeance whether it's Microsoft in more than a $7 billion transaction or  Verizon paying Vodafone a staggering $130 billion to go away.  Signs of  mergers and acquisitions are just getting going this day?  Would that be a  good sign, Kimberly?</p><p>KIMBERLY FOSS, EMPYRION WEALTH MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think this is  a great opportunity for the telecom industry for rise in $130 million.   It's the third biggest corporate fill in history.  It's going to take,  Vodafone giving to Verizon.  You have the 6.4 percent dividend on Vodafone  and 4 percent dividend on Verizon.  It's going to propel this thing to no  end.  It is a big buy for me.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, Scott, obviously the temptation for Verizon was the  possible interest rates were as low as they were so if this thinking you  get $130 million monkey of its back in the name of Vodafone, you can argue  the price, maybe other companies are seizing on the same rate position  right now to do something like it?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO:  Well, they better hurry, Neil,  because we all rates are going up at a pretty alarming rate here.  It's  kind of interesting though, I don't know if I totally agree with Kim though  because I don't really like the space, Neil.  It's becoming more  competitive and margins are coming in.  Meaning profits are dropping.</p><p>So that to me is not a great business to be in and plus these companies  especially the tech companies are using cash that's parked overseas because  they don't want to repatriate it and pay U.S. taxes.  So that money is  limited in some degree because instead of it going back to the United  States, they are buying other countries.  So yes, it's great if you're the  acquirer like Nokia, but I am not sure if that helps the companies like  Microsoft.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to switch gears here to address this  second issue, three words that don't register with me, retro hunting gear.   I am told it is the rage and retailer H&amp;M is all in.  Who knew camouflage  meant so much cash?  Nothing attracts men like military fatigue.  So it  must be a bulletproof fashion statement?  Scott, what do you think?</p><p>MARTIN:  Well, I am pretty cool, Neil.  So I was ahead of this one and I've  already got some orders in on this stuff.  I think it's interesting.  It's  definitely a risk, but I think they are calculated one for H&amp;M because look  at what's happened in retail, Neil.  Even over the last couple of years,  not just this summer where a lot of the retailers have been smashed because  it is the same old same old.  So I like the fact that this company is going  out there and doing something different making a push perhaps into a  different section just to roll some heads and see if it actually works.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you think, Kim?</p><p>FOSS:  Yes, I agree.  I mean, no consumer should be denied and should be  ignored especially the male consumer.  I got to tell you they're doing the  great job with the underwear and let me just tell you who knows?  Maybe  boxers is the next rage?  I wouldn't mind if I came home and saw my husband  in some chemo gear.</p><p>CAVUTO:  This is a family show that maybe I am out of touch and you guys  are clearly in touch.  Now we know why Jeff Basos flanked down $250 million  for the \"Washington Post.\"  He was high as the kite or drank out of his  mind or both.  What else could explain his reason for going big time on  \"Washington Post\" reading?  Apparently, he was to usher in a new golden age  for newspapers lickety-split.</p><p>But Scott, is Jeff on to something because the golden age for newspapers  and I love them dearly, but I read them online, the conventional product is  gone.</p><p>MARTIN:  Me as well, Neil, also that was decades ago.  I think regarding  whenever he resigned he was lucky he came off and bought it today not four  years ago because I guess they're going to get four or five times what it  did today, which goes to show you, again, it's kind of like the telecom  business.  You know, it's not a great business to be in.  Yes people go  there for their news, but it is online.  It's digital.  So unless he has  some amazing revamping that he's planned here, Neil.  I don't think it is a  great deal for them as far as the Amazon or other newspapers possibly up  for sale.</p><p>CAVUTO:  He is good at marketing stuff and if you were to do something for  prime readership customers that could be the start of something.  So we  have the makings of making this work, but he is up again strong ties?</p><p>FOSS:  I think the digital era is here to have something very innovative  for a certain segment of the market, but those that don't have the physical  paper.  Unfortunately, they are aging and they are not buying that paper as  much anymore even read online when they magnify it.  So I agree with Scott.   I think this is not a win-win for Jeff or for the consumer.  It is going to  be a hard road, but maybe we'll wait and see what happens.  He is pretty  innovative guy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Indeed, if he can convince people to pay for that online product  then maybe it would work.  He would seem to have the best shot of doing  that, but it is a very tough battle.  Scott and Kim, thank you both very  much.  That will do it.  We will continue monitor the debate with Syria and  how it falls out.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

But for those who haven't, a report published today by research firm CB Insights[3] nicely sums up the state of the sector. CB Insight's latest AI in Healthcare dispatch packs more than a few juicy nuggets to sink your teeth into, including this headliner: AI startups have raised $4.3 billion across 576 fundingrounds since 2013, topping all other industries. Another shocker?</p><p> In the first half of 2018, China leapfrogged the U.K. to become the second-most active country for health care deals. 'AI in healthcare is geared towards improving patient outcomes, aligning the interests of various stakeholders, and reducing costs,' analysts for CB Insights wrote. 'Chinese big tech companies are now entering into healthcare AI with strong backing from the government and are bringing products from other countries to mainland China through partnerships.' Pharmaceutical companies are taking an interest in AI, the report noted, particularly in startups that aim to expedite drug discovery. In May 2018, Pfizer entered into a strategic partnership with XtalPi, a company developing 'computation-based rational drug design.' Movers and shakers including Novartis, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKlein, Amgen, and Merck have followed suit with similar arrangements. Fortunately for them, the Federal Food and Drug Administration has fast-tracked certain categories of AI services, opening 'commercial pathways' for the more than 70 AI imaging and diagnostics companies that have raised equity since 2013. 'The [agency] is focused on clearly defining and regulating 'software-as-a-medical-device,' especially in light of recent rapid advances in AI,' according to the report. Despite AI's recent encroachments, though, CB Insights predicts it won't replace clinicians anytime soon. Machine learning algorithms learn from annotated datasets; Google's DeepMind, for example, trained an eye disease-screening model on 14,884 labeled scans. And humans \u2014 not machines \u2014 are doing the bulk of the labeling. 'The samples needed to be annotated by specialists, because if a sample doesn't have any annotation we don't know if this is a healthy person or if it's a sample from a sick person This was a pretty important step,' Dr. Min Wanli, an Alibaba Cloud executive, told CB Insights. That said, you can look forward to a future with fewer doctor visits. Self-diagnostic apps like Dip.io, which uses a urinalysis dipstick and computer vision algorithms to analyze test strips via a smartphone, and Biofourmis, which pulls data from wearablesto predict health outcomes, have been given the green light by regulators in the U.S. The analysts concluded: 'Artificial intelligence is turning the smartphone and consumer wearables into powerful at-home diagnostic tools.'

To address this issue and hear what senior regulators, policymakers and industry leaders think, the Central Bank of Kuwait organized the International Banking Conference on Shaping the Future yesterday.</p><p><br/>In his keynote speech, Central Bank of Kuwait Governor Dr Mohammad Al-Hashel addressed the challenges facing the global banking sector today. \"Three challenges are particularly worth highlighting: The state of the global economy; the revolution in financial technology; and the rapidly evolving needs and expectations of customers,\" Hashel explained.<br/>He noted that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) twice lowered its global growth projections for 2019 to 3.2 percent, with developed economies expected to grow at a much slower rate of 1.9 percent. A key driver of this slowdown is economic uncertainty brought about by rising trade tensions and protectionist policies. \"If trade tensions continue, the IMF may further revise down its economic growth projections,\" he said.<br/>The Central Bank chief also explained that \"global debt over the past 20 years has grown on average by 6 percent annually, compared to 3.5 percent for global GDP. If these rates continue, we could see global debt over the next 20 years reaching $780 trillion, or 500 percent of GDP. This is clearly unsustainable, and requires urgent action by both governments and financial institutions.\"</p><p><br/>The threat from Big Tech is also a looming concern for regulators and the banking industry. \"What would happen when the likes of Facebook, Amazon, WhatsApp and Alibaba start competing with banks to provide financial services? These technology giants come with large and captive user bases, low online acquisition costs, and a better understanding of their customers through their utilization of big data. Moreover, they don't face the same regulations and associated costs that banks do,\" Hashel pointed out.</p><p><br/>Meeting the evolving needs of customer expectations in the fast-paced global environment further adds to the weight of the need for change, and all of this is further exacerbated by heightened geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. To meet these challenges, Hashel laid out a strategy of attack that focuses on five key areas \u2013 customer loyalty, value, efficiency, resilience and talent. He also called for greater proactivity on the part of regulators and the banking industry.</p><p><br/>\"We the regulators must also consider how we should operate in the future. We need to take a proactive and dynamic approach to promote innovation, and act as a catalyst for the industry. We need to promote collaboration and share our experiences with each other to develop frameworks that will fit the needs of our societies. And we need to focus on capacity building to ensure that our staff can meet the future challenges of the industry,\" he said.</p><p><br/>Held under the patronage of HH the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and attended by Acting Prime Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Nasser Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the conference brought together central bank chiefs from around the region, banking executives, chief economists and leaders in the industry to discuss what the future holds for banking, the impact of fintech and how banks can better collaborate, cooperate and shape a sustainable future for all.</p><p>kuwaittimes</p><p>CNPHUB - All Rights Reserved  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OMANBL-154764500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OMANBL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X46-31X1-F11P-X2DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437730</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CNPHUB Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

I'm Margaret Brennan, and this is FACE THE NATION.   </p><p>      A white supremacist kills 50 in a terror attack at two mosques in New Zealand. Does President Trump see white nationalism as a rising threat around the world?   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</emphasis>:  I don't really. I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess, if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And the president issues his first veto, after being rebuked by 12 Republican senators on a bill that would reject his declaration of a national emergency at the border.   </p><p>      We will talk with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and hear from Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine about why he thinks the administration is withholding crucial information from Congress before a vote to override that veto.   </p><p>      And, as more candidates jump into the race, all eyes are on one who just might have dropped a hint last night.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOSEPH BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</emphasis>:  I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.   </p><p>      (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (R)MD-IN-- (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  We will have analysis on all the news, plus former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, and a special look at Capitol Hill's unusual spring interns with CBS News special correspondent James Brown.   </p><p>      That's all ahead on FACE THE NATION.   </p><p>      Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Happy St. Patrick's day.   </p><p>      We begin with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.  </p><p>      And happy St. Patrick's day to you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF</emphasis>:  And to you, Ms. Brennan.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  I want to get right to it, in the wake of this horrific terror attack in New Zealand.   </p><p>      You know, there's a lot of parsing of the president's own language in referring to what happened here.   </p><p>      Broadly speaking, the number of attacks and support for white supremacy is up, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. And even a Trump-appointed attorney in the state of Virginia, Thomas Cullen, was recently quoted as saying:  \"White supremacy and far right extremism are among the greatest domestic security threats facing the United States.\"   </p><p>      Has the president been briefed on this?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Well, I don't know who that gentleman is. Certainly, the president's briefed on all of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  You know who the Southern Poverty Law Center is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  I do. I do.   </p><p>      The president's absolutely briefed on all of the threats, both domestic and international. But I want to push back against this idea that every time something bad happens everywhere around the world, folks who don't like Donald Trump seem to blame it on Donald Trump.   </p><p>      I'm hoping we can get...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  I'm not blaming it on the president. I was asking about...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  I didn't say -- didn't say...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  ... his characterization.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  I didn't say you. I'm saying that that's clearly what some folks want -- want to do. I have heard other members of -- of the Democrat Party trying to do it, folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center here trying to do it.   </p><p>      This is a tragic thing that happened in New Zealand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  They're just saying the number of white nationalist groups has surged by 50 percent.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Since Trump has become -- office, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Well, in the past year.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  There you go. So, he -- here's the point. Why can't we...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  So, do you disagree that it's a rising threat?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  I -- I -- I -- I disagree that there's a causal link between Donald Trump being president and something like this happening in New Zealand.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  But that's not the argument or the suggestion there...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  OK, good.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  ... by the judge or by that statistic. Is the president aware that this is a rising threat?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Again, a rising threat.   </p><p>      I think the president you saw -- you saw him asked the other day, does he think it's a rising threat? And he says no. I think there's information that would back that up.   </p><p>      The issue is, how do you stop these crazy people? Whether or not there's one of them or four of them doesn't make a difference, if they're willing to go on live TV and stream the murder of people. So I think that's where the time is better spent.   </p><p>      Instead of worrying about, well, who's to -- who's to blame, how do we stop from doing this? Donald Trump is no more to blame for what happened in New Zealand than Mark Zuckerberg is because he invented Facebook. There are some terrible people in the world. We need to work with our partners, of which New Zealand is one of, and to try and figure a way to find them, expose them and bring them to justice.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Well, President Trump, and certainly during the campaign talked quite a lot about the need to be specific, to name a threat in order to counter it.   </p><p>      So why minimize it? Why not directly address white supremacy, and specifically Islamophobia?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Yes, I get a lot of questions about...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Because a number of world leaders did. And the president didn't.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  I get a lot of questions from people saying, why -- you need to tell the president to do X, you need to tell the president to go and give it an Oval Office address on this or on that.   </p><p>      That's not how the system works. The president communicates in his way. Different presidents have communicated in their way. I don't think anybody can -- can claim that Donald Trump hasn't done exactly what we would want him to do in this circumstance.   </p><p>      We've immediately reached out to our allies. We've expressed the absolute disgust at the tragic -- at the tragic events. We're doing what presidents are supposed to do.   </p><p>      That doesn't mean it's going to make everybody happy because of the hyper partisan times we live in. But, again, I really -- it frustrates me, just as a citizen, that everything -- something -- every time something goes wrong around the world now, not just in our country, somehow, the president of the United States must be responsible.   </p><p>      And that's just -- that's absurd, and it doesn't help contribute to the dialogue that's necessary to fix these problems.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Point taken, but the president of the United States carries a megaphone louder than anyone in the world, and arguably this president likes to use his.   </p><p>      So, because you're frustrated, why not remove any shadow of a doubt? I mean during the campaign, as you know, as a candidate, the president called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. He said Islam hates us.   </p><p>      This kind of language in the past leads to these questions of, why isn't the president now directly using that megaphone to condemn it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Well then -- take -- take -- take -- take the words and put them in one category, and take the actions and put them in another.   </p><p>      Something the president doesn't get hardly any credit for or any attention to is the work he's done in defense of religious minorities all around the world, up to and including Muslims in the Middle East. Some of the religious minorities that are the worst oppressed to the Middle East are some of the ones that this administration has been doing -- going to great lengths to protect.   </p><p>      So I hear what folks says, oh, Donald Trump said this during the campaign. Look at what we've done while we've been here. I don't think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Well, the president's tweeting now about a TV host who was suspended for anti-Muslim rhetoric.   </p><p>      So, it's -- it's, I think, a fair question to ask you about this.  </p><p>      But I want to move on to one of the fights that is going on in Congress and questions from a number of senators about exactly what programs are going to lose funding...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  ... in order to put together funding for the border wall.   </p><p>      When will the White House give this detailed list, specifically on military projects, to Congress?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  It could be a while, and here's why. Here's -- here's what's happening, is that we've already told Congress this, which is that none of the programs that were scheduled to be started or what we call obligated in 2019, so between now and the end of September, will be impacted at all.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  The service chiefs have told Congress they have that list, but the White House is not...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  ... handing that list over.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  No, no, that that's absolutely -- I know of no list. And if anybody should know, it would be me.   </p><p>      There's no list of projects that are absolutely going to not be funded so that the wall can be. What it is, is a list of programs that fit the criteria that I have just laid out for you, which is that they are meant to be funded beyond the end of this fiscal year.   </p><p>      Why is that important? Because if we -- if it's going to be a project that would have been funded, say, in 2021, OK, it gives us another couple of years to what we call backfill. Congress will pass another appropriation this year, next year, so that ultimately none of the programs would be impacted.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Senator Tim Kaine, who sits on Armed Services, is going to be on the show later in the program.   </p><p>      But when we spoke with him, he specifically said that he thinks the White House is withholding these details until after this upcoming vote on the veto override occurs. In other words, you're trying to keep Republicans on board, and if you fully inform them about what you're going to do to their district, then you might lose their vote.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  I -- I don't -- I will watch the show. And, in fact, if I catch Tim in the green room, I will ask him what the basis is for that.   </p><p>      Does he just think it because he wants it to be true or someone told him there was actually a list? Because, again, I'm chief of staff. I'm also still technically over at the Office of Management and Budget.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And you still don't know what's getting cut?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  And I know of no list that specifically...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And you don't know what's getting cut?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  That's correct.   </p><p>      I know of the universe of things that might be delayed or reduced or cut in a very extreme circumstance that could be funded -- used to fund the wall, but a list of a decision that's already been made, saying, this money is going to be cut and spent over there, that's not been made yet.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  So, remove any doubt. You say, no matter what these details are, you still have the votes to override...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Oh, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  ... this veto?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  To block any kind of override?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Yes, no, we fully expect the veto override to fail in the House.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  All right, thank you, Mick Mulvaney, for joining us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULVANEY</emphasis>:  Thanks, Margaret.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Just to clarify, that host is FOX News' Jeanine Pirro.   </p><p>      The network has condemned her commentary, and her broadcast did not air last night.   </p><p>      We spoke yesterday with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. He had just returned from a visit to the Venezuelan border and spoke to us from Bogota, Colombia.   </p><p>      We asked Senator Kaine about President Trump saying that he did not think white nationalism was a rising threat around the world.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA</emphasis>:  Margaret, it is on the rise. And the president should call it out.  </p><p>      But, sadly, he's not doing that. We saw in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Charlottesville that he tried to say that the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates there were just, you know, good people.   </p><p>      But when you see church shootings in Charleston, a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, you see this hate-filled manifesto of the shooter in New Zealand who is murdering Muslims, we have to confront the fact that there is a rise in white supremacy, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes.   </p><p>      The president uses language often that's very similar to the language used by these bigots and racists. And if he's not going to call it out, then other leaders have to do more to call it out. And I certainly will.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Well, the president did say it was a horrible thing that happened,but he said that the white nationalism issue is just a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.   </p><p>      What do you attribute the rise to?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  Well, they have problems, but I think the president is using language that emboldens them.   </p><p>      He's not creating them. They're out there. But at the same time as he was tweeting out yesterday his support for the family members in New Zealand -- and that was appropriate -- he was vetoing the Senate's rejection of his emergency declaration from Thursday.   </p><p>      And he used the word invaders to characterize people coming to the nation's southern borders, which was exactly the same phrase that the shooter in New Zealand used to characterize the Muslims that he was attacking. That kind of language from the person who probably has the loudest microphone on the planet Earth is hurtful and dangerous, and it tends to incite violence.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  I want to ask you about an exchange you had this week that seemed quite tense. You were very clearly frustrated with the acting secretary of defense, Shanahan, because you were asking why a list of military projects had not been provided to Congress that would be directly impacted by funding cuts due to reallocation for the president's border wall.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  I'm on the Armed Services Committee. I represent Virginia.   </p><p>      I have a child in the military. So I sent a letter on February 15 to the secretary of defense and said, if you're going to ransack the Pentagon's budget, tell me what projects you're going to cut or delay or eliminate. They wouldn't provide an answer.   </p><p>      At the hearing on Thursday, we're now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration. And they still hadn't answered our question:  What projects are at stake?  </p><p>      At the hearing, he said, oh, I will send you the list later this afternoon.  </p><p>      And you're right. I kind of blew up at him. You're going to give us the list after we vote? This is highly relevant to the vote about the president's emergency declaration. What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget? Is it going to be military housing? Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects?   </p><p>      Is it going to be rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall? And they said they would give us the list after.   </p><p>      But, Margaret, to add insult to injury, they had to walk that back. They don't even want to give us the list now at all, because we're going to have to have an override vote. I don't think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Why do you think the White House is withholding this information you say is so relevant because of an upcoming vote?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  I think there's one reason.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  You're -- you're connecting. You think they're trying to influence the outcome of it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  Absolutely. This is not the secretary of defense, in my view. This is the White House wanting to hold the list back because they worry that, if senators and House members saw the potential projects that were going to be ransacked to pay for the president's wall, they would lose votes.   </p><p>      And I think they're going to try to hide the list until that veto override vote occurs in the House and then in the Senate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  You are, of course, in Colombia nearby what is a country that is really crippled in many ways economically right now, Venezuela.   </p><p>      There are about three million refugees who have fled. The energy and oil industry is collapsing, as is the economy there. What is it that you were going to the border to see? What did you learn?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  Well, Margaret, I wanted to see a couple of things, one, to support the Colombian government because their effort to provide assistance to these millions of Venezolanos has been really momentous, but, secondly, learn what more the United States can do.   </p><p>      We have worked together actually in an accord between the administration and Congress to provide significant amounts of humanitarian aid, to work together, to pull together a coalition of nations.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Nicolas Maduro still is in charge of that country, whether we like it or not. And these sanctions have not seemingly changed his calculus.   </p><p>      The visas, the diplomatic isolation, what is this actually accomplishing at this point?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  Well, it's -- it's giving hope to Venezuelans that there may finally be some change. The question isn't whether Maduro likes it or not. The question is what the Venezuelan people want.   </p><p>      And the National Assembly has determined that the election of President Maduro was illegitimate. There needs to be a new government.   </p><p>      So, what more can we do more?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  More humanitarian aid, more work together to pull more nations into our coalition. The sanctions are important. They're having an effect.   </p><p>      Sanctions are economic, but there are also visa restrictions on Maduro and his cronies as they try to travel abroad. We need to give hope to the Venezuelan people that we stand with them and support them. It's a massive humanitarian crisis driven by one person, Nicolas Maduro, and the Venezuelan people are speaking out, and they want something better.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Has the Trump administration, whose policy you seem to support right now, have they underestimated how strong he is?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  No, I don't know that they've underestimated it.   </p><p>      Look, this is -- this is not easy. It's a difficult situation. And I do generally support what the Trump administration has done, with one exception. I think loose talk about U.S. military action is a big mistake, one, because that's not for the president. It's for Congress.   </p><p>      But second, the right strategy here -- there's only one person using the military against Venezuelans. And it's Maduro.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Senator Kaine, thank you for joining us. Safe travels.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAINE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Margaret. Absolutely.   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  We will be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  We're back now with former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara.   </p><p>      He was, of course, fired by President Trump after he refused to sign as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.   </p><p>      And he has a new book out, \"Doing Justice:  A Prosecutor's Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law.\"  </p><p>      Preet, good to have you here.   </p><p>      PREET BHARARA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORK</emphasis>:  Thanks for having me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  I read the book.   </p><p>      I want to get to some of the news of the week, but first ask you actually how you ended this book, because I think it resonates this week, in the wake of the terror attack in New Zealand.   </p><p>      You recount a story and a case of a hate crime against someone who wanted to go out and kill Arabs after 9/11 and ended up killing some -- or -- and then injuring some South Asian individuals instead.   </p><p>      Is this just a continuation of Islamophobia, of white nationalism? Is there something here? Or, is -- as the president says, it's not really a broader issue at all?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHARARA</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, thanks for asking about the end of the book.   </p><p>      I think a lot of the world is mourning the loss of innocent lives, up to 50 now, in New Zealand. And, you know, from my old vantage point as a law enforcement officer, the chief law enforcement officer federally in Manhattan, law enforcement has certain tools, right?   </p><p>      You can do surveillance. You can infiltrate organizations that propound hate and try to engage in terrorist acts. You can also hold people accountable after the fact.   </p><p>      But one of the points I make in the book, \"Doing Justice,\" over and over again is, laws are not enough. Law can do some things, but, at the end of the day, if you want to quell people's hatred, you want to make people get along better, you want to have harmony, you have to have good people who are willing to step up to the plate and do, among other things, call out bad things when they happen.   </p><p>      And in the case that I was referring to that you mentioned in the -- in the end part of the book, it was a Bangladeshi immigrant after 9/11 who was shot in the face by someone, Mark Anthony Stroman, who decided that he wanted to take revenge on behalf of, I guess, his race for people who had perpetrated the act of 9/11, obviously, going and randomly shooting people where they worked.   </p><p>      And Rais Bhuiyan was not killed and decided in a way that I think is extraordinary to forgive the person who tried to kill him and tried to get him off death row and -- and spare him the death penalty. He wasn't ultimately successful.   </p><p>      But, to my mind, it's an -- it's an inspiring story of how some people go beyond what the law even requires, beyond what the law allows, to try to have forgiveness and -- and harmony go forward in the world. And I think we need a little bit more of that and a little bit less of the nasty rhetoric and a little bit less of, you know, people like the president not stepping up to the plate and calling out bad things when they're happening.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Important note there in this week.   </p><p>      But I want to turn to some of the other news that we've seen on the political and legal front. You know, we saw on Friday the special counsel again asked for the fifth time a delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates, who was a -- a Trump campaign deputy, because, it was said, he's cooperating.   </p><p>      How should people understand this? What does this mean?   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHARARA</emphasis>:  Well, not just cooperating, but cooperating in -- quote, unquote -- \"several investigations.\"  </p><p>      And so, you know, I'm an outsider now, and I don't still run the Southern District of New York, and I'm not aware of what's going with various investigations that sometimes, you know, intersect with the special counsel's investigation.   </p><p>      But I think people should view with some skepticism the notion that gets breathlessly reported every week that the Mueller investigation is coming to an end. It may be, because Andrew Weissmann, who is one of the top deputies -- in fact, the top deputy -- with Robert Mueller, announced that he was stepping down, which indicates maybe it's wrapping up.   </p><p>      But then, as you point out, you have this letter about Rick Gates, who's cooperating in multiple investigations, and they delay the sentencing, which seems to indicate that he is substantially cooperating and engaging in some success for the prosecuting team.   </p><p>      So, you might expect other indictments, other work going forward. So it doesn't seem to me, based on that, although I don't know, that the work of the special counsel is ending any time soon, unless it's the case -- the one caveat I have is, unless it's the case that the cases on which Rick Gates is cooperating are being parceled out -- parceled out to other U.S. attorney's office -- offices like the Southern District of New York or D.C. or somewhere else, so the special counsel team can step back and have its work be done.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Steve Bannon and a few other individuals have said that actually the biggest risk to the president is not from the special counsel, but actually the Southern District of New York, which you know well.   </p><p>      Do you agree with that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHARARA</emphasis>:  Well, I don't know if I -- I would frame it that way. It's a sort of a polemical way to frame it, but, yes, in the sense that the SDNY, which I led for 7.5 years, doesn't have the circumscription on its ambit in the same way the special counsel does.   </p><p>      The special counsel was appointed, you know, under a particular regulation, and was supposed to look at only things relating to interference in the election and potentially collusion -- quote, unquote -- \"collusion\" with -- with Russians in connection with the election, and anything arising from it.   </p><p>      And one of those things that -- that arose from it was obstruction. The Southern District of New York has a lot of people in it whose mission is only to find crime, be able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, if it's in the interests of justice to do it. And they're very aggressive and they're very fearless and they're very independent.   </p><p>      They don't care about politics. When I was there, we prosecuted Democrats and Republicans, and it didn't matter who they were, you know, affiliated with.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHARARA</emphasis>:  And -- and so when one of -- one of the things I try to say in the book is to explain the philosophy and the culture of the men and women of the Southern District of New York.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And, of course, state and federal charges and how a president's pardon could affect them are -- are different too.   </p><p>      I want to ask you as well about Paul Manafort. He was sentenced in D.C. this week. The sentence was added to, before that in Virginia, what some would characterize as a light sentence.  </p><p>      Do you think justice is done?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHARARA</emphasis>:  It's hard to say. You know, punishment is a very difficult thing to calibrate.   </p><p>      You know, whether a few months more, a few months less...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHARARA</emphasis>:  ... is in the interest of justice is hard to measure like -- like mathematics.   </p><p>      I agree with the people who said that the first sentence of Paul Manafort of 47 months was a bit low, given the guidelines and given the nature and seriousness of the crime and how long it went on. I think that, overall, the addition of 3.5 years from Judge Amy Berman Jackson makes it overall a 7.5-year sentence, which is closer to right.   </p><p>      I still think it's overall low, but it's hard to determine.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Preet Bharara, thank you for joining us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHARARA</emphasis>:  Thanks, Margaret.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  The book is \"Doing Justice.\"   </p><p>      We'll be back in a moment.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  There are two more candidates in the presidential race, but it's one who is not in the race, at least yet, who raised eyebrows when he accidentally made a slip in his speech last night.   </p><p>      Our Ed O'Keefe reports.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over)</emphasis>:  The man many Democrats are waiting for sure sounded like a presidential candidate Saturday night.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.   </p><p>      (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected the make it official next month.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</emphasis>:  That's why I'm running for president. And it's why I'm asking you for your support.   </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today became the 14th Democrat to officially launch a presidential bid, even though she's been officially campaigning for the job for eight weeks. Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her campaign next Sunday outside Trump Tower in New York.   </p><p>      Other candidates traveled to early primary states this weekend, hoping to build support.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</emphasis>:  We have common pain all over this country, but we have lost our sense of common purpose.   </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  And Beto O'Rourke wrapped up a three-day tour in Iowa that launched his campaign.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</emphasis>:  This is my first time to ever visit Iowa.   </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  O'Rourke narrowly lost the U.S. Senate bid in Texas last year, and presidential buzz has been building ever since.  </p><p>      His rollout was treated like a major media event. He told \"Vanity Fair\" magazine for a cover story, \"I'm just born to be in it.\"  </p><p>      And he sat for his first in-depth interview as a candidate with \"CBS THIS MORNING\" co-host Gayle King.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GAYLE KING, CO-HOST, 'CBS THIS MORNING'</emphasis>:  Do you consider yourself more moderate or more progressive?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yes. You know, if I think about a term like progressive, I want to make sure everybody has a chance, that our democracy fully reflects the genius of this country, that we make the investments in one another, and that's universal guaranteed high-quality health care. It's a living wage for everyone who works.  </p><p>      It's supporting those who are looking for jobs. So, if that is progressive, I'm a progressive.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  You're a progressive?   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KING</emphasis>:  All right. All right. So I don't even need to go into moderate then?   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  Meanwhile, former Florida Governor and 2016 candidate Jeb Bush said this weekend that Republicans ought to be given a choice, suggesting someone needs to launch a primary challenge to President Trump.   </p><p>      He named Maryland Governor Larry Hogan as a possible option. Hogan told us a few weeks ago he isn't ruling it out -- Margaret.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Ed, thank you.   </p><p>      More on 2020 when we come back.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  We will be back in a moment.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  </p><p>      Joining us for some more 2020 analysis are Jamal Simmons, Democratic strategist and host on Hill TV, Amy Walter of \"The Cook Political Report,\" and, of course, our own Ed O'Keefe.   </p><p>      Ed, you just laid out the crowded field. I was speaking to a Democratic strategist this week, or fundraiser I should say, who said this is like waiting for Gadot.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</emphasis>:  When we're waiting for Biden here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  When we're waiting for Biden.  </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And still not sure. Gadot never shows up.  </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Is Biden going to show up?   </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  I mean, if you believe the verbal slip-up last night at the Dover Downs, yes, he certainly made it seem like he is.   </p><p>      You know, I asked him earlier this week when he was at this firefighter's union even here in D.C., along the rope line, what's the hold-up? He says, there's no hold-up. He just looks at history, which suggests that people who have waited a little longer than this current crop that got in, you know, at the stroke of midnight essentially as the year began, and thinks that he has some time to -- to, you know, to spend because he's got the name --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  Clearly has some money ready and -- and ready to come, has locked up some staff. We don't know to what extent their -- the size of his operation will be. But all signs still point to early April sometime before Tax Day, April 15th.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JAMAL SIMMONS, HILL.TV</emphasis>:  You know, Ed mentions history. And with the vice president, it's -- it's -- I don't -- history is actually a pretty tough marker for him.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  What do you mean?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  Democrats, you know, he is very popular. People all over the country are hungering for him to get into the race. But Democrats have never elected a sitting or former vice president to the White House before. Democrats also, if you look at -- if you go back and look at some of the FiveThirtyEight polling, the person who was ahead in the national polls at this period a year out from election day did not ultimately win the White House. And there's only three times that person won the nomination, it was Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.   </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  We know that (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  Hillary is a tough marker. So the vice president really has to, I think, take on the fact that this -- that he's going up against these trends, and that means he has to do things differently. He needs a more diverse staff than he has had in the past, he's got to be willing to talk about progressive issues in a way that's more compelling than he has in the past. And I hope that's what they're planning.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Amy, do we need new blood, as former President Obama suggested? I mean he's not necessarily going to endorse --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMY WALTER, 'COOK POLITICAL REPORT'</emphasis>:  He's not the newest person in the -- in the mix for his years there on the Senate side.   </p><p>      It's really interesting watching Democrats grappling with their choices this time. They have all kinds of opportunities here, generationally, on race, and on -- and on gender.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  It seems --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  And on gender. And it seems that the issue really comes down to this. How safe of a choice do Democrats want to make? And by safe we have to -- we all are going to determine that. The Democrats are going to determine that, too, in very different ways. And the safe being really, who's the one who we know can beat Donald Trump. That's the -- that's the question a lot of Democrats are asking themselves, what does that mean? And -- versus the, who's the most disruptive in this field.   </p><p>      Waiting for Godot's a good description. I also think primaries are a lot like trying to figure out who you're going to marry. And do you go with the person who really races your heart or do you go with the person you want to bring home to your parents, right? And Democrats -- it -- it -- recently --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And you don't think the two can be the same thing?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  Sometimes -- (INAUDIBLE) -- sometimes they can be both. I think Barack Obama was both. I think in 2004, remember there was that infamous bumper stick their said, dated Dean, married Kerry, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  How did that work out?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  Dean was a lot of fun. And that's what the -- and if you're Democrats -- a lot of Democrats will say, exactly, when we made the safe choice, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, we lost. We've got to go with somebody who's going to be engaging in a very different way.   </p><p>      The other -- just one more quick thing about engaging and broadening, going away from safe. It's also about broadening the electoral map outside of the presidential race.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  Which is the Senate. There are a bunch of Democrats I talked to who say, we could win the White House, but if we don't win the Senate, then, guess what, not a lot of this is going to matter. We've got to go into places like Texas, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia. Those are the races that are going to determine control of the senate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  Arizona.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  And Arizona.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  It was such a rollout for Beto O'Rourke.   </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  I mean he -- people are asking like he is anointed? Is this going to backfire on him?   </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  Well -- and I think, to the -- to the charge that the media may have overdone it, we have to remember something. I made this point repeatedly in our reporting this past week. You talk to every other campaign that's involved in this right now, the one name that kept coming up in private conversations was always him. Is he going to do it? Do you think he can raise $80 million again? So this was them essentially goading us into saying, you know, they're scared of him. Very scared of him.   </p><p>      And this coffee shop counter-top campaign that he launched this week by jumping up on countertops repeatedly -- was it you that said, I hope he brought the Windex along.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  Yes, you need some -- you need some -- well, Clorox wipes. People are eating on those things.  </p><p>      O'KEEFE:  You know, it seems to have gone well for him. And he started very strategically in southeastern Iowa, a part of the state where Democrats used to dominate and have struggled in recent years, and repeatedly people said to me, you know, they don't usually come to this parted of the state until later in the primary, so we give him a lot of credit for doing it. And, we'll see.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Amy, there's been some attention to perhaps a double standard here, that Beto delayed making an announcement, he had this sort of soul-searching played out in the press, that a female candidate of the five or so we have so far, would have been punished for looking indecisive. Do you buy that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  I'm sure there's still -- there is still going -- and there will always be a double standard. When we look at whether they're candidates of color or women are going to be judged different standards than white men.   </p><p>      At the same time, I do think every one of these candidates gets their little boomlet (ph), gets their time to make their case. And this is why the debates are going to be so important because all of this is right now is sort of fluff. When they're all on the stage together, making the case that they have the best opportunity, I'm the best person here to go up against Donald Trump, that's when voters really get to see what a they're made of.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  You know, he's a little bit -- I would argue that Beto O'Rourke is the best natural candidate running for this area.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Natural.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  For this era, right? He understands social media. He's -- he's willing to engage in that fear in a way that Donald Trump has engaged in, And nobody else really kind of can do that.   </p><p>      What we don't know is, can he do all the other things that have to be done in a campaign. Can he build out an organization? Can he raise the money? Can he withstand all the hits that are going to come his way? Those are really big things.   </p><p>      But, you know, this week, there was a -- a kind of a little bit of an upset. A lot of women I talked to were really upset about the way he talked about his wife and raising their kids. That came up a lot. So I took it on myself to start calling around to some of the people and friends and family of --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Because he said his wife mainly raises the children.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  That's right. So I started calling women who don't live in Washington, who don't live in California, and asking them, Michigan, Georgia, Texas, Ohio, asking them what they thought. And what -- the most interesting response was a 70-year-old woman relative in Detroit who said to me, oh, yes, I saw that. I really liked that. So I think sometimes --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Because she thought she was giving -- she thought he was giving his wife credit?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  She thought he was giving his wife credit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  I got it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  So I think -- I think sometimes that -- that things sound differently to people who live in different places. And we just have to -- we have to wait and see how this all souses (ph) out from time --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  Right, which is why the process is so important. You haven't heard Democrats yet -- it's going to happen -- say, this process is too unwieldy. We're going to damage the ultimate nominee by having all of these debates and this, you know, lasting far too long. Right now I think it is the only way to determine which one of these candidates meets all of those different criteria that Jamal pointed out, of who's going to be able to raise the money, look like they can stand up to the president, be able to be inspiring, also have a pathway to the White House that looks to voters like a realistic path to the White House.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  All right. Well, we'll have the leave it there with the three of you. But more to come when we come back from this break with some analysis of the week that was.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  We turn now to our panel for some analysis on the other big news of the week. Jamal Simmons and Amy Walter are joined by Ramesh Ponnuru, who is a senior editor at \"National Review\" and a columnist for \"Bloomberg Opinion,\" and Mark Landler, who covers the White House and foreign policy for \"The New York Times.\"   </p><p>      Good to have you join us.   </p><p>      Ramesh, let me ask you, you know, Amy brought up in the last segment this point about it not just being about the 2020 presidential race. It's also about some of these congressional seats. Senators, some of them we saw with this vote on the rebuke to the president, the accusation that maybe they were a little worried about their seats in 2020 and that may have swayed some Republicans to stick with the president instead of rebuking him.   </p><p>      How big of a concern and a factor was that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RAMESH PONNURU, 'BLOOMBERG OPINION'</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's very striking that of the 12 Republican senators who did not vote with the president, who voted to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency, only one of them is running in 2020. There was a risk on both sides, right? There's the general election risk because the emergency is unpopular, and the wall is unpopular. But among Republicans, it's -- these things are very popular. And, obviously, I think a lot of Republicans showed that they were more concerned about winning their primaries than they were about the general election.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Who do you have in mind? Is it Thom Tillis of North Carolina who took a lot of heat for that eleventh hour switch of his vote?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PONNURU</emphasis>:  Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, all of them voted with the president and not with, you know, the -- the 12 Republicans, like Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, Mike Lee and others, who had these constitutional concerns about what the president is doing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Mark, Mick Mulvaney was on this program and said that he thinks the White House, you know, has nothing to worry about with this attempt to override the veto. But how was this received inside the White House? It was the president's first time to use the pen this this way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARK LANDLER, 'THE NEW YORK TIMES'</emphasis>:  And it was also first time the president was rebuffed this way by Republicans. Ramesh points out that several of them didn't go the whole way.   </p><p>      But the fact of the matter is, after two years in which the Republicans have been just an absolute reliable sort of bastion for the president in Congress, I thought this was still symbolically important. And I'm sure that President Trump's argument is, well, I didn't pitch as hard as I could have. If I'd really asked for the votes, I would have gotten them.  </p><p>      But, nevertheless, they must be looking at this and thinking, do we have Mitch McConnell as reliably as we thought we did? And facing the prospects of more unpopular potential policy decisions and debates down the road, is this the first in what will be a more independent Republican majority in the Senate, a majority that's going to make decisions not just blindly following the White House and President Trump?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Some might say that's wishful thinking?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LANDLER</emphasis>:  Indeed. Indeed. And I stimulate that we haven't seen it and we've had this same sort of discussion many, many times in the past. Well, this will be the moment that they show their independence and they continue not to do that.   </p><p>      But having said that, you know, this was a somewhat different set of circumstances. It didn't play out quite as well as I think the White House hoped it would. And so that's got to be at least somewhat concerning for them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Do you think this resonates with people at home or is it lost on them?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  I do think it -- it -- it doesn't really resonates unless the president wants it to resonate, in which case what he does very well is turns it back against Congress. I think he loves the idea that, look, I told you people in Washington didn't understand us or our vision for how we keep America safe. They're -- they're trapped in their old ways of thinking. I'm here to break us out of us. And so it actually works for him. Even when it's members of his own party, I think this is very beneficial to him.   </p><p>      And I -- I do agree that -- with the question of whether this signals more dissention or whether it's just -- this was a really easy vote. The veto -- they're never going to have to vote on this again. They're not going to have -- it's going to die in the House most likely. They won't have to vote on this again. And then it's in the courts where ultimately it means that none of the discussion that we're having right now may ever have to turn into reality.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Ramesh, one of the few areas where we did see some -- some public criticism of the president from Republicans was on the foreign policy front. And, again, going into 2020, I guess there are some questions about, well, what does the president say he delivered on when it comes to North Korea? What does he say he delivered on with the promise to pull all troops out of Afghanistan? And we have some upcoming decisions on both of those things.   </p><p>      How much of a political lens should we be putting on them?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PONNURU</emphasis>:  I tend to think that those sorts of foreign policy decisions are not all that politically significant in a presidential election, unless something has gone very, very wrong. And in that case, people start holding politicians accountable and asking why things that they themselves as voters weren't paying attention to weren't done.   </p><p>      So I -- I think the stakes politically are low, even if the stakes for our long-term national security are kind of high. Right now, I think the president can say that -- to his core voters, look, i have been trying to pull out of our commitments overseas, or at least downsize them in an intelligent way. And I think that that is going to be accepted as fine. I don't think that there are a ton of Republican voters who are saying to themselves, you know, we need to be more involved in Syria. We need to be more involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. And so I think that he's going to be fine on this front.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Mark, we had the president go to the Pentagon on Friday for a classified briefing. Do we know what threats he was actually getting briefed on?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LANDLER</emphasis>:  Well, we don't precisely know what threats he was getting briefed on. The assumption is clear he was probably being briefed on North Korea. He was probably being briefed on Syria, where, after all, he made this decision to leave some American troops behind after saying he was going to withdraw them. And probably also on Afghanistan. We are in the midst of this peace reconciliation process with the Taliban, and part of that process is setting a definite timeline for withdrawing the remaining troops there.   </p><p>      So I am -- I'm sure all -- some combination of those issues, plus Iran, were probably all on the table at that point.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And there are about 12,000 troops still in Afghanistan.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LANDLER</emphasis>:  That's right. And that -- that conversation has become very complicated in the last couple of weeks because the Afghan government feels that we, the United States, have cut them out of the process. We're dealing directly with the Taliban. The Afghans are -- don't have a seat at the table. And that's become very contentious just in the -- in the last week in Washington with a couple visiting Afghan officials raising some very serious criticisms of the administration.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Jamal, do you hear anything from this week with what's being described as sort of a blow symbolically to the president or the frustrations in trying to deliver on some of these foreign policy promises. Is there any rich territory for Democrats to message and mine?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  I mean think of the Democratic political establishment or the Democratic left, the voters. People are thinking more Russia and Russian influence than they are about some of the more fine points of foreign policy. They generally get the president is not really doing very well, and the candidates don't seem -- the Democratic candidates don't seem to be that -- that far apart on this.   </p><p>      I think what people on the -- on the Democratic side are trying to do is alter an -- offer an alternate vision about what's important. So the reason the president and immigration focuses importantly is for -- for his base is because it says to particularly white, disaffected voters, I'm the guy who's standing up against the brown people coming into the United States and trying to preserve the country for you.   </p><p>      I think what the Democrats are trying to say is, there's actually a bigger problem that happens. And so if you look at what happened with the cheating scandal with the schools, like there's this sort of mob of people who are at the top. They've got all the goodies. So this goodies mob, and I'm not talking about Sealo (ph), but there's like a goodies mob out there, right, that are dividing up all the opportunity among each other. And those are the people that we all have to be worried about. How do we tilt the scales back in favor of working people. And somebody like Elizabeth Warren, who talked about this idea of breaking up big tech companies, is somebody who's driving this agenda on the left that says, maybe we've got to change the rules about how we deal with our economy, and that's an alternate vision that I think Democrats are trying to establish and it might work.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALTER</emphasis>:  And yet that's also going back to the, who -- who's the safe choice. And for Democrats trying to balance these two very important segments of their electorate, the ones who do see that the system is rigged, they're attracted to the Bernie Sanders message, also who's going to turn out that Obama coalition that Hillary did not, younger voters, voters of color. But the newest coalition are those white suburban voters who came out, and guess who they voted for? They voted for Beto. That's how Beto came so close in Texas. It wasn't the rise or younger or Latino voters. I was white, suburban voters who came out and voted for Democrats in the House and for Beto. How do you keep those voters from either staying home or defecting back to -- to Donald Trump? If you put a candidate -- goes the theory -- someone like Elizabeth Warren, someone like Bernie Sanders, that's going to turn off those voters who were willing to vote for say Democrats in 2018.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And -- but, Jamal, Bernie Sanders is trying to woo black voters right now in South Carolina. He's trying to make up a difference, I guess. The lesson he learned.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMMONS</emphasis>:  He's trying. But, you know, there's a funny picture that was going around the Internet yesterday of him at an African-American church in South Carolina, but everybody in the room was white, right? And so he -- so what happened was, they -- they built a crowd, but it wasn't actually the crowd of the membership of that particular church. So he's got a -- he's got a little bit of a tougher road.   </p><p>      I think of the two of them, Elizabeth Warren probably is the more -- is the one people may buy into a little bit more. But here's my real guess, is that somebody, whoever the Democratic nominee is, will end up adopting a lot of the policy choices that Bernie and Elizabeth Warren put forward, because that seems to be where the passion of the left is.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  We will see.  </p><p>      Thanks to all of you.   </p><p>      And we will be back in a moment with a look at a unique new class of congressional interns.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  Politics and football meet head-on this spring with an unusual class of interns on Capitol Hill. CBS News special correspondent James Brown reports.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JAMES BROWN, CBS NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</emphasis>:  Michael Thomas, Austin Carr and Ryan Hunter are used to running, blocking, or catching for a living, but for the last couple of weeks, they have been running around the halls of Congress, tackling the big issues facing the country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN HUNTER, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS</emphasis>:  I've been fortunate to sit in on meeting with foreign policy administrators from the Middle East, whether it be constituents from the state of Missouri and the city of Kansas City, St. Louis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Ryan Hunter is an offensive lineman for the Kansas City Chiefs. He's interning for freshman Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI</emphasis>:  It's fun because we're both new together. So Ryan's new. I'm new. We're kind of learning the ropes together. I think it's phenomenal that NFL players like Ryan who are very busy guys and have a career that they're pursuing want to be involved in their communities, want to be involved in service.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Michael Thomas plays safety for the New York Giants. This is his second time working for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents his district in Houston, Texas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS</emphasis>:  What a place to be, not necessarily only in my office, but in many offices where they can be change agents and translate that leadership on the field into making a difference.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICHAEL THOMAS, NEW YORK GIANTS</emphasis>:  Yes, after interning last year, I was like, I got to come back, because I saw firsthand what she's doing and how much she's really on the ground, you know, like putting in the work. A lot of things that we were fighting for, for criminal justice reform, bail reform, education, you know, re-entry with juvenile detentions and stuff like that, she's already had bills written. You know, they're on the floor. She's proposing these things. So I'm like, OK, this is how we can take that next step. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN (on camera)</emphasis>:  And you are firmly convinced that Capitol Hill, this arena, this venue, if you will, can affect the kind of meaningful changes that you and others who have the same feelings can bring about?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMAS</emphasis>:  Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it's going to take -- you know, it's going to take time. You can't -- nothing happens overnight. I can see how other people can say, man, like, they're slow, we need -- we need something now. We need to do something now. And I get that passion. I feel it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN (voice over)</emphasis>:  Austin Carr is a wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints. He is pro-life and interested in some libertarian ideas, which is why he is interning for Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AUSTIN CARR, NEW ORLEANS SAINTS</emphasis>:  I'm seeing how hard they work, and in particular Senator Rand Paul, how often he's running to and fro to different meetings, different committee, meeting with constituents.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN (on camera)</emphasis>:  What have you seen in this young man, senator?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY</emphasis>:  We're -- we're glad to have him here. And I think it's good to see another side of our athletes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN (voice over)</emphasis>:  According to the NFLPA, the average NFL career lasts just under four years. In 2014, the union started an externship program to prepare players for life after the NFL. Since then, 183 players have had on-the-job training in a variety of fields.   </p><p>      Michael Thomas is a member of the union's executive board, and he sees this as an opportunity to speak for his community. Thomas was one of the players who protested police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMAS</emphasis>:  Me being here, being an inside intern, I see the steps that needs to be taken -- that need to be taken. I'm willing to put in the work. I'm willing to advocate for it. I'm willing to help out Congresswoman Jackson Lee any way I can using my voice and my platform, the same way I did it on the football field in taking a knee.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Austin Carr met with the attorney general of Louisiana to talk about the opioid crisis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  Nationwide, the U.S. consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Ryan Hunter learned more about brain injuries after meeting with the Society for Neuroscience.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNTER</emphasis>:  I'd rather be here than be in the Bahamas, because I'm learning so much for the future that this -- this experience on its own beats, you know, having an umbrella drink on the beach.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  These pro athletes came to Washington to learn from political leaders, but their mentors seem to learn from them, as well.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PAUL</emphasis>:  But, no, I'm glad to see that Austin, you know, believes strongly in his faith and that it sounds like he wants to be part of trying to make things better in the country, but also be an example for, you know, kids out there that look up to our -- our stars.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Having players say, I want to be involved, I want to serve, I want to see it from the inside, I want to do something about that, that's awesome. We need more of that. And I think Ryan's a great example.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACKSON LEE</emphasis>:  I hope he will be able to be here when we are seeing these bills pass out of the House and the Senate where we have changed the criminal justice system. Wouldn't that be great? That's my heart and passion. And I hope he will be part of it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THOMAS</emphasis>:  Absolutely.   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  And we'll be right back.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENNAN</emphasis>:  That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

I'm Margaret Brennan, and this is FACE THE NATION.  </p><p>A white supremacist kills 50 in a terror attack at two mosques in New Zealand.  Does President Trump see white nationalism as a rising threat around the world?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I don't really.  I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.  I guess, if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRENNAN:  And the president issues his first veto, after being rebuked by 12 Republican senators on a bill that would reject his declaration of a national emergency at the border.  </p><p>We will talk with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and hear from Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine about why he thinks the administration is withholding crucial information from Congress before a vote to override that veto.  </p><p>And, as more candidates jump into the race, all eyes are on one who just might have dropped a hint last night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.  </p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>\u00c2\u00aeMD-IN\u00c2\u00af</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRENNAN:  We will have analysis on all the news, plus former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, and a special look at Capitol Hill's unusual spring interns with CBS News special correspondent James Brown.  </p><p>That's all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  </p><p>Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION.  Happy St. Patrick's day.  </p><p>We begin with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.</p><p>And happy St. Patrick's day to you.  </p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  And to you, Ms.  Brennan.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  I want to get right to it, in the wake of this horrific terror attack in New Zealand.  </p><p>You know, there's a lot of parsing of the president's own language in referring to what happened here.  </p><p>Broadly speaking, the number of attacks and support for white supremacy is up, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.  And even a Trump-appointed attorney in the state of Virginia, Thomas Cullen, was recently quoted as saying: \"White supremacy and far right extremism are among the greatest domestic security threats facing the United States.\"  </p><p>Has the president been briefed on this? </p><p>MULVANEY:  Well, I don't know who that gentleman is.  Certainly, the president's briefed on all of...</p><p>BRENNAN:  You know who the Southern Poverty Law Center is.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I do.  I do.  </p><p>The president's absolutely briefed on all of the threats, both domestic and international.  But I want to push back against this idea that every time something bad happens everywhere around the world, folks who don't like Donald Trump seem to blame it on Donald Trump.  </p><p>I'm hoping we can get...</p><p>BRENNAN:  I'm not blaming it on the president.  I was asking about...</p><p>MULVANEY:  I didn't say -- didn't say...</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... his characterization. </p><p>MULVANEY:  I didn't say you.  I'm saying that that's clearly what some folks want -- want to do.  I have heard other members of -- of the Democrat Party trying to do it, folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center here trying to do it.  </p><p>This is a tragic thing that happened in New Zealand.</p><p>BRENNAN:  They're just saying the number of white nationalist groups has surged by 50 percent. </p><p>MULVANEY:  Since Trump has become -- office, right? </p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, in the past year. </p><p>MULVANEY:  There you go.  So, he -- here's the point.  Why can't we...</p><p>BRENNAN:  So, do you disagree that it's a rising threat? </p><p>MULVANEY:  I -- I -- I -- I disagree that there's a causal link between Donald Trump being president and something like this happening in New Zealand. </p><p>BRENNAN:  But that's not the argument or the suggestion there...</p><p>MULVANEY:  OK, good. </p><p>BRENNAN:  ... by the judge or by that statistic.  Is the president aware that this is a rising threat? </p><p>MULVANEY:  Again, a rising threat.  </p><p>I think the president you saw -- you saw him asked the other day, does he think it's a rising threat?  And he says no.  I think there's information that would back that up.  </p><p>The issue is, how do you stop these crazy people?  Whether or not there's one of them or four of them doesn't make a difference, if they're willing to go on live TV and stream the murder of people.  So I think that's where the time is better spent.  </p><p>Instead of worrying about, well, who's to -- who's to blame, how do we stop from doing this?  Donald Trump is no more to blame for what happened in New Zealand than Mark Zuckerberg is because he invented Facebook.  There are some terrible people in the world.  We need to work with our partners, of which New Zealand is one of, and to try and figure a way to find them, expose them and bring them to justice. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, President Trump, and certainly during the campaign talked quite a lot about the need to be specific, to name a threat in order to counter it.  </p><p>So why minimize it?  Why not directly address white supremacy, and specifically Islamophobia? </p><p>MULVANEY:  Yes, I get a lot of questions about...</p><p>BRENNAN:  Because a number of world leaders did.  And the president didn't. </p><p>MULVANEY:  I get a lot of questions from people saying, why -- you need to tell the president to do X, you need to tell the president to go and give it an Oval Office address on this or on that.  </p><p>That's not how the system works.  The president communicates in his way.  Different presidents have communicated in their way.  I don't think anybody can -- can claim that Donald Trump hasn't done exactly what we would want him to do in this circumstance.  </p><p>We've immediately reached out to our allies.  We've expressed the absolute disgust at the tragic -- at the tragic events.  We're doing what presidents are supposed to do.  </p><p>That doesn't mean it's going to make everybody happy because of the hyper partisan times we live in.  But, again, I really -- it frustrates me, just as a citizen, that everything -- something -- every time something goes wrong around the world now, not just in our country, somehow, the president of the United States must be responsible.  </p><p>And that's just -- that's absurd, and it doesn't help contribute to the dialogue that's necessary to fix these problems. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Point taken, but the president of the United States carries a megaphone louder than anyone in the world, and arguably this president likes to use his.  </p><p>So, because you're frustrated, why not remove any shadow of a doubt?  I mean during the campaign, as you know, as a candidate, the president called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.  He said Islam hates us.  </p><p>This kind of language in the past leads to these questions of, why isn't the president now directly using that megaphone to condemn it? </p><p>MULVANEY:  Well then -- take -- take -- take -- take the words and put them in one category, and take the actions and put them in another.  </p><p>Something the president doesn't get hardly any credit for or any attention to is the work he's done in defense of religious minorities all around the world, up to and including Muslims in the Middle East.  Some of the religious minorities that are the worst oppressed to the Middle East are some of the ones that this administration has been doing -- going to great lengths to protect.  </p><p>So I hear what folks says, oh, Donald Trump said this during the campaign. Look at what we've done while we've been here.  I don't think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, the president's tweeting now about a TV host who was suspended for anti-Muslim rhetoric.  </p><p>So, it's -- it's, I think, a fair question to ask you about this.</p><p>But I want to move on to one of the fights that is going on in Congress and questions from a number of senators about exactly what programs are going to lose funding...</p><p>MULVANEY:  Sure. </p><p>BRENNAN:  ... in order to put together funding for the border wall.  </p><p>When will the White House give this detailed list, specifically on military projects, to Congress? </p><p>MULVANEY:  It could be a while, and here's why.  Here's -- here's what's happening, is that we've already told Congress this, which is that none of the programs that were scheduled to be started or what we call obligated in 2019, so between now and the end of September, will be impacted at all. </p><p>BRENNAN:  The service chiefs have told Congress they have that list, but the White House is not...</p><p>MULVANEY:  No.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... handing that list over. </p><p>MULVANEY:  No, no, that that's absolutely -- I know of no list.  And if anybody should know, it would be me.  </p><p>There's no list of projects that are absolutely going to not be funded so that the wall can be.  What it is, is a list of programs that fit the criteria that I have just laid out for you, which is that they are meant to be funded beyond the end of this fiscal year.  </p><p>Why is that important?  Because if we -- if it's going to be a project that would have been funded, say, in 2021, OK, it gives us another couple of years to what we call backfill.  Congress will pass another appropriation this year, next year, so that ultimately none of the programs would be impacted. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Senator Tim Kaine, who sits on Armed Services, is going to be on the show later in the program.  </p><p>But when we spoke with him, he specifically said that he thinks the White House is withholding these details until after this upcoming vote on the veto override occurs.  In other words, you're trying to keep Republicans on board, and if you fully inform them about what you're going to do to their district, then you might lose their vote. </p><p>MULVANEY:  I -- I don't -- I will watch the show.  And, in fact, if I catch Tim in the green room, I will ask him what the basis is for that.  </p><p>Does he just think it because he wants it to be true or someone told him there was actually a list?  Because, again, I'm chief of staff.  I'm also still technically over at the Office of Management and Budget. </p><p>BRENNAN:  And you still don't know what's getting cut? </p><p>MULVANEY:  And I know of no list that specifically...</p><p>BRENNAN:  And you don't know what's getting cut? </p><p>MULVANEY:  That's correct.  </p><p>I know of the universe of things that might be delayed or reduced or cut in a very extreme circumstance that could be funded -- used to fund the wall, but a list of a decision that's already been made, saying, this money is going to be cut and spent over there, that's not been made yet. </p><p>BRENNAN:  So, remove any doubt.  You say, no matter what these details are, you still have the votes to override...</p><p>MULVANEY:  Oh, yes. </p><p>BRENNAN:  ... this veto?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Absolutely. </p><p>BRENNAN:  To block any kind of override?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Yes, no, we fully expect the veto override to fail in the House. </p><p>BRENNAN:  All right, thank you, Mick Mulvaney, for joining us. </p><p>MULVANEY:  Thanks, Margaret. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Just to clarify, that host is FOX News' Jeanine Pirro.  </p><p>The network has condemned her commentary, and her broadcast did not air last night.  </p><p>We spoke yesterday with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.  He had just returned from a visit to the Venezuelan border and spoke to us from Bogota, Colombia.  </p><p>We asked Senator Kaine about President Trump saying that he did not think white nationalism was a rising threat around the world.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA:  Margaret, it is on the rise.  And the president should call it out.</p><p>But, sadly, he's not doing that.  We saw in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Charlottesville that he tried to say that the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates there were just, you know, good people.  </p><p>But when you see church shootings in Charleston, a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, you see this hate-filled manifesto of the shooter in New Zealand who is murdering Muslims, we have to confront the fact that there is a rise in white supremacy, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes.  </p><p>The president uses language often that's very similar to the language used by these bigots and racists.  And if he's not going to call it out, then other leaders have to do more to call it out.  And I certainly will. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, the president did say it was a horrible thing that happened,but he said that the white nationalism issue is just a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.  </p><p>What do you attribute the rise to? </p><p>KAINE:  Well, they have problems, but I think the president is using language that emboldens them.  </p><p>He's not creating them.  They're out there.  But at the same time as he was tweeting out yesterday his support for the family members in New Zealand -- and that was appropriate -- he was vetoing the Senate's rejection of his emergency declaration from Thursday.  </p><p>And he used the word invaders to characterize people coming to the nation's southern borders, which was exactly the same phrase that the shooter in New Zealand used to characterize the Muslims that he was attacking.  That kind of language from the person who probably has the loudest microphone on the planet Earth is hurtful and dangerous, and it tends to incite violence. </p><p>BRENNAN:  I want to ask you about an exchange you had this week that seemed quite tense.  You were very clearly frustrated with the acting secretary of defense, Shanahan, because you were asking why a list of military projects had not been provided to Congress that would be directly impacted by funding cuts due to reallocation for the president's border wall.  </p><p>KAINE:  I'm on the Armed Services Committee.  I represent Virginia.  </p><p>I have a child in the military.  So I sent a letter on February 15 to the secretary of defense and said, if you're going to ransack the Pentagon's budget, tell me what projects you're going to cut or delay or eliminate.  They wouldn't provide an answer.  </p><p>At the hearing on Thursday, we're now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration.  And they still hadn't answered our question:  What projects are at stake?</p><p>At the hearing, he said, oh, I will send you the list later this afternoon.</p><p>And you're right.  I kind of blew up at him.  You're going to give us the list after we vote?  This is highly relevant to the vote about the president's emergency declaration.  What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget?  Is it going to be military housing?  Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects?  </p><p>Is it going to be rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall?  And they said they would give us the list after.  </p><p>But, Margaret, to add insult to injury, they had to walk that back.  They don't even want to give us the list now at all, because we're going to have to have an override vote.  I don't think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Why do you think the White House is withholding this information you say is so relevant because of an upcoming vote? </p><p>KAINE:  I think there's one reason. </p><p>BRENNAN:  You're -- you're connecting.  You think they're trying to influence the outcome of it?</p><p>KAINE:  Absolutely.  This is not the secretary of defense, in my view.  This is the White House wanting to hold the list back because they worry that, if senators and House members saw the potential projects that were going to be ransacked to pay for the president's wall, they would lose votes.  </p><p>And I think they're going to try to hide the list until that veto override vote occurs in the House and then in the Senate.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  You are, of course, in Colombia nearby what is a country that is really crippled in many ways economically right now, Venezuela.  </p><p>There are about three million refugees who have fled.  The energy and oil industry is collapsing, as is the economy there.  What is it that you were going to the border to see?  What did you learn? </p><p>KAINE:  Well, Margaret, I wanted to see a couple of things, one, to support the Colombian government because their effort to provide assistance to these millions of Venezolanos has been really momentous, but, secondly, learn what more the United States can do.  </p><p>We have worked together actually in an accord between the administration and Congress to provide significant amounts of humanitarian aid, to work together, to pull together a coalition of nations. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Nicolas Maduro still is in charge of that country, whether we like it or not.  And these sanctions have not seemingly changed his calculus.  </p><p>The visas, the diplomatic isolation, what is this actually accomplishing at this point? </p><p>KAINE:  Well, it's -- it's giving hope to Venezuelans that there may finally be some change.  The question isn't whether Maduro likes it or not.  The question is what the Venezuelan people want.  </p><p>And the National Assembly has determined that the election of President Maduro was illegitimate.  There needs to be a new government.  </p><p>So, what more can we do more? </p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.    </p><p>KAINE:  More humanitarian aid, more work together to pull more nations into our coalition.  The sanctions are important.  They're having an effect.  </p><p>Sanctions are economic, but there are also visa restrictions on Maduro and his cronies as they try to travel abroad.  We need to give hope to the Venezuelan people that we stand with them and support them.  It's a massive humanitarian crisis driven by one person, Nicolas Maduro, and the Venezuelan people are speaking out, and they want something better. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Has the Trump administration, whose policy you seem to support right now, have they underestimated how strong he is? </p><p>KAINE:  No, I don't know that they've underestimated it.  </p><p>Look, this is -- this is not easy.  It's a difficult situation.  And I do generally support what the Trump administration has done, with one exception.  I think loose talk about U.S. military action is a big mistake, one, because that's not for the president.  It's for Congress.  </p><p>But second, the right strategy here -- there's only one person using the military against Venezuelans.  And it's Maduro.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Senator Kaine, thank you for joining us.  Safe travels. </p><p>KAINE:  Thank you, Margaret.  Absolutely. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN:  We will be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BRENNAN:  We're back now with former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara.  </p><p>He was, of course, fired by President Trump after he refused to sign as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.  </p><p>And he has a new book out, \"Doing Justice: A Prosecutor's Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law.\"</p><p>Preet, good to have you here.  </p><p>PREET BHARARA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  I read the book.  </p><p>I want to get to some of the news of the week, but first ask you actually how you ended this book, because I think it resonates this week, in the wake of the terror attack in New Zealand.  </p><p>You recount a story and a case of a hate crime against someone who wanted to go out and kill Arabs after 9/11 and ended up killing some -- or -- and then injuring some South Asian individuals instead.  </p><p>Is this just a continuation of Islamophobia, of white nationalism?  Is there something here?  Or, is -- as the president says, it's not really a broader issue at all? </p><p>BHARARA:  Yes.  Well, thanks for asking about the end of the book.  </p><p>I think a lot of the world is mourning the loss of innocent lives, up to 50 now, in New Zealand.  And, you know, from my old vantage point as a law enforcement officer, the chief law enforcement officer federally in Manhattan, law enforcement has certain tools, right?  </p><p>You can do surveillance.  You can infiltrate organizations that propound hate and try to engage in terrorist acts.  You can also hold people accountable after the fact.  </p><p>But one of the points I make in the book, \"Doing Justice,\" over and over again is, laws are not enough.  Law can do some things, but, at the end of the day, if you want to quell people's hatred, you want to make people get along better, you want to have harmony, you have to have good people who are willing to step up to the plate and do, among other things, call out bad things when they happen. </p><p>And in the case that I was referring to that you mentioned in the -- in the end part of the book, it was a Bangladeshi immigrant after 9/11 who was shot in the face by someone, Mark Anthony Stroman, who decided that he wanted to take revenge on behalf of, I guess, his race for people who had perpetrated the act of 9/11, obviously, going and randomly shooting people where they worked.  </p><p>And Rais Bhuiyan was not killed and decided in a way that I think is extraordinary to forgive the person who tried to kill him and tried to get him off death row and -- and spare him the death penalty.  He wasn't ultimately successful.  </p><p>But, to my mind, it's an -- it's an inspiring story of how some people go beyond what the law even requires, beyond what the law allows, to try to have forgiveness and -- and harmony go forward in the world.  And I think we need a little bit more of that and a little bit less of the nasty rhetoric and a little bit less of, you know, people like the president not stepping up to the plate and calling out bad things when they're happening. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Important note there in this week.  </p><p>But I want to turn to some of the other news that we've seen on the political and legal front.  You know, we saw on Friday the special counsel again asked for the fifth time a delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates, who was a -- a Trump campaign deputy, because, it was said, he's cooperating.  </p><p>How should people understand this?  What does this mean? </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BHARARA:  Well, not just cooperating, but cooperating in -- quote, unquote -- \"several investigations.\"</p><p>And so, you know, I'm an outsider now, and I don't still run the Southern District of New York, and I'm not aware of what's going with various investigations that sometimes, you know, intersect with the special counsel's investigation.  </p><p>But I think people should view with some skepticism the notion that gets breathlessly reported every week that the Mueller investigation is coming to an end.  It may be, because Andrew Weissmann, who is one of the top deputies -- in fact, the top deputy -- with Robert Mueller, announced that he was stepping down, which indicates maybe it's wrapping up.  </p><p>But then, as you point out, you have this letter about Rick Gates, who's cooperating in multiple investigations, and they delay the sentencing, which seems to indicate that he is substantially cooperating and engaging in some success for the prosecuting team.  </p><p>So, you might expect other indictments, other work going forward.  So it doesn't seem to me, based on that, although I don't know, that the work of the special counsel is ending any time soon, unless it's the case -- the one caveat I have is, unless it's the case that the cases on which Rick Gates is cooperating are being parceled out -- parceled out to other U.S. attorney's office -- offices like the Southern District of New York or D.C. or somewhere else, so the special counsel team can step back and have its work be done. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Steve Bannon and a few other individuals have said that actually the biggest risk to the president is not from the special counsel, but actually the Southern District of New York, which you know well.  </p><p>Do you agree with that? </p><p>BHARARA:  Well, I don't know if I -- I would frame it that way.  It's a sort of a polemical way to frame it, but, yes, in the sense that the SDNY, which I led for 7.5 years, doesn't have the circumscription on its ambit in the same way the special counsel does.  </p><p>The special counsel was appointed, you know, under a particular regulation, and was supposed to look at only things relating to interference in the election and potentially collusion -- quote, unquote -- \"collusion\" with -- with Russians in connection with the election, and anything arising from it.  </p><p>And one of those things that -- that arose from it was obstruction.  The Southern District of New York has a lot of people in it whose mission is only to find crime, be able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, if it's in the interests of justice to do it.  And they're very aggressive and they're very fearless and they're very independent.  </p><p>They don't care about politics.  When I was there, we prosecuted Democrats and Republicans, and it didn't matter who they were, you know, affiliated with. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.   </p><p>BHARARA:  And -- and so when one of -- one of the things I try to say in the book is to explain the philosophy and the culture of the men and women of the Southern District of New York. </p><p>BRENNAN:  And, of course, state and federal charges and how a president's pardon could affect them are -- are different too.  </p><p>I want to ask you as well about Paul Manafort.  He was sentenced in D.C. this week.  The sentence was added to, before that in Virginia, what some would characterize as a light sentence.</p><p>Do you think justice is done? </p><p>BHARARA:  It's hard to say.  You know, punishment is a very difficult thing to calibrate.  </p><p>You know, whether a few months more, a few months less...</p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.   </p><p>BHARARA:  ... is in the interest of justice is hard to measure like -- like mathematics.  </p><p>I agree with the people who said that the first sentence of Paul Manafort of 47 months was a bit low, given the guidelines and given the nature and seriousness of the crime and how long it went on.  I think that, overall, the addition of 3.5 years from Judge Amy Berman Jackson makes it overall a 7.5-year sentence, which is closer to right.  </p><p>I still think it's overall low, but it's hard to determine. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Preet Bharara, thank you for joining us. </p><p>BHARARA:  Thanks, Margaret. </p><p>BRENNAN:  The book is \"Doing Justice.\"  </p><p>We'll be back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BRENNAN:  There are two more candidates in the presidential race, but it's one who is not in the race, at least yet, who raised eyebrows when he accidentally made a slip in his speech last night.  </p><p>Our Ed O'Keefe reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The man many Democrats are waiting for sure sounded like a presidential candidate Saturday night.  </p><p>BIDEN:  I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.  </p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected the make it official next month.  </p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  That's why I'm running for president.  And it's why I'm asking you for your support.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today became the 14th Democrat to officially launch a presidential bid, even though she's been officially campaigning for the job for eight weeks.  Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her campaign next Sunday outside Trump Tower in New York.  </p><p>Other candidates traveled to early primary states this weekend, hoping to build support.  </p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have common pain all over this country, but we have lost our sense of common purpose.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  And Beto O'Rourke wrapped up a three-day tour in Iowa that launched his campaign.  </p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is my first time to ever visit Iowa.  </p><p>O'KEEFE:  O'Rourke narrowly lost the U.S. Senate bid in Texas last year, and presidential buzz has been building ever since.</p><p>His rollout was treated like a major media event.  He told \"Vanity Fair\" magazine for a cover story, \"I'm just born to be in it.\"</p><p>And he sat for his first in-depth interview as a candidate with \"CBS THIS MORNING\" co-host Gayle King.  </p><p>GAYLE KING, CO-HOST, \"CBS THIS MORNING\":  Do you consider yourself more moderate or more progressive?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Yes.  You know, if I think about a term like progressive, I want to make sure everybody has a chance, that our democracy fully reflects the genius of this country, that we make the investments in one another, and that's universal guaranteed high-quality health care.  It's a living wage for everyone who works.</p><p>It's supporting those who are looking for jobs.  So, if that is progressive, I'm a progressive.  </p><p>KING:  You're a progressive?  </p><p>O'ROURKE:  Yes.  </p><p>KING:  All right.  All right.  So I don't even need to go into moderate then?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Meanwhile, former Florida Governor and 2016 candidate Jeb Bush said this weekend that Republicans ought to be given a choice, suggesting someone needs to launch a primary challenge to President Trump.  </p><p>He named Maryland Governor Larry Hogan as a possible option.  Hogan told us a few weeks ago he isn't ruling it out -- Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Ed, thank you.  </p><p>More on 2020 when we come back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BRENNAN:  We will be back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.</p><p>Joining us for some more 2020 analysis are Jamal Simmons, Democratic strategist and host on Hill TV, Amy Walter of \"The Cook Political Report,\" and, of course, our own Ed O'Keefe. </p><p>Ed, you just laid out the crowded field. I was speaking to a Democratic strategist this week, or fundraiser I should say, who said this is like waiting for Gadot. </p><p>ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: When we're waiting for Biden here?</p><p>BRENNAN: When we're waiting for Biden.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Absolutely.</p><p>BRENNAN: And still not sure. Gadot never shows up.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Right.</p><p>BRENNAN: Is Biden going to show up? </p><p>O'KEEFE: I mean, if you believe the verbal slip-up last night at the Dover Downs, yes, he certainly made it seem like he is. </p><p>You know, I asked him earlier this week when he was at this firefighter's union even here in D.C., along the rope line, what's the hold-up? He says, there's no hold-up. He just looks at history, which suggests that people who have waited a little longer than this current crop that got in, you know, at the stroke of midnight essentially as the year began, and thinks that he has some time to -- to, you know, to spend because he's got the name --</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Clearly has some money ready and -- and ready to come, has locked up some staff. We don't know to what extent their -- the size of his operation will be. But all signs still point to early April sometime before Tax Day, April 15th. </p><p>JAMAL SIMMONS, HILL.TV: You know, Ed mentions history. And with the vice president, it's -- it's -- I don't -- history is actually a pretty tough marker for him. </p><p>BRENNAN: What do you mean? </p><p>SIMMONS: Democrats, you know, he is very popular. People all over the country are hungering for him to get into the race. But Democrats have never elected a sitting or former vice president to the White House before. Democrats also, if you look at -- if you go back and look at some of the FiveThirtyEight polling, the person who was ahead in the national polls at this period a year out from election day did not ultimately win the White House. And there's only three times that person won the nomination, it was Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. </p><p>O'KEEFE: We know that (ph).</p><p>SIMMONS: Hillary is a tough marker. So the vice president really has to, I think, take on the fact that this -- that he's going up against these trends, and that means he has to do things differently. He needs a more diverse staff than he has had in the past, he's got to be willing to talk about progressive issues in a way that's more compelling than he has in the past. And I hope that's what they're planning. </p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, do we need new blood, as former President Obama suggested? I mean he's not necessarily going to endorse -- </p><p>AMY WALTER, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": He's not the newest person in the -- in the mix for his years there on the Senate side. </p><p>It's really interesting watching Democrats grappling with their choices this time. They have all kinds of opportunities here, generationally, on race, and on -- and on gender. </p><p>BRENNAN: It seems --</p><p>WALTER: And on gender. And it seems that the issue really comes down to this. How safe of a choice do Democrats want to make? And by safe we have to -- we all are going to determine that. The Democrats are going to determine that, too, in very different ways. And the safe being really, who's the one who we know can beat Donald Trump. That's the -- that's the question a lot of Democrats are asking themselves, what does that mean? And -- versus the, who's the most disruptive in this field. </p><p>Waiting for Godot's a good description. I also think primaries are a lot like trying to figure out who you're going to marry. And do you go with the person who really races your heart or do you go with the person you want to bring home to your parents, right? And Democrats -- it -- it -- recently --</p><p>BRENNAN: And you don't think the two can be the same thing? </p><p>WALTER: Sometimes -- (INAUDIBLE) -- sometimes they can be both. I think Barack Obama was both. I think in 2004, remember there was that infamous bumper stick their said, dated Dean, married Kerry, right?</p><p>SIMMONS: How did that work out? </p><p>WALTER: Dean was a lot of fun. And that's what the -- and if you're Democrats -- a lot of Democrats will say, exactly, when we made the safe choice, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, we lost. We've got to go with somebody who's going to be engaging in a very different way. </p><p>The other -- just one more quick thing about engaging and broadening, going away from safe. It's also about broadening the electoral map outside of the presidential race.</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>WALTER: Which is the Senate. There are a bunch of Democrats I talked to who say, we could win the White House, but if we don't win the Senate, then, guess what, not a lot of this is going to matter. We've got to go into places like Texas, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia. Those are the races that are going to determine control of the senate. </p><p>SIMMONS: Arizona.</p><p>WALTER: And Arizona.</p><p>BRENNAN: It was such a rollout for Beto O'Rourke. </p><p>O'KEEFE: Right.</p><p>BRENNAN: I mean he -- people are asking like he is anointed? Is this going to backfire on him? </p><p>O'KEEFE: Well -- and I think, to the -- to the charge that the media may have overdone it, we have to remember something. I made this point repeatedly in our reporting this past week. You talk to every other campaign that's involved in this right now, the one name that kept coming up in private conversations was always him. Is he going to do it? Do you think he can raise $80 million again? So this was them essentially goading us into saying, you know, they're scared of him. Very scared of him. </p><p>And this coffee shop counter-top campaign that he launched this week by jumping up on countertops repeatedly -- was it you that said, I hope he brought the Windex along. </p><p>WALTER: Yes, you need some -- you need some -- well, Clorox wipes. People are eating on those things.</p><p>O'KEEFE: You know, it seems to have gone well for him. And he started very strategically in southeastern Iowa, a part of the state where Democrats used to dominate and have struggled in recent years, and repeatedly people said to me, you know, they don't usually come to this parted of the state until later in the primary, so we give him a lot of credit for doing it. And, we'll see. </p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, there's been some attention to perhaps a double standard here, that Beto delayed making an announcement, he had this sort of soul-searching played out in the press, that a female candidate of the five or so we have so far, would have been punished for looking indecisive. Do you buy that?</p><p>WALTER: I'm sure there's still -- there is still going -- and there will always be a double standard. When we look at whether they're candidates of color or women are going to be judged different standards than white men. </p><p>At the same time, I do think every one of these candidates gets their little boomlet (ph), gets their time to make their case. And this is why the debates are going to be so important because all of this is right now is sort of fluff. When they're all on the stage together, making the case that they have the best opportunity, I'm the best person here to go up against Donald Trump, that's when voters really get to see what a they're made of. </p><p>SIMMONS: You know, he's a little bit -- I would argue that Beto O'Rourke is the best natural candidate running for this area. </p><p>BRENNAN: Natural.</p><p>SIMMONS: For this era, right? He understands social media. He's -- he's willing to engage in that fear in a way that Donald Trump has engaged in, And nobody else really kind of can do that. </p><p>What we don't know is, can he do all the other things that have to be done in a campaign. Can he build out an organization? Can he raise the money? Can he withstand all the hits that are going to come his way? Those are really big things. </p><p>But, you know, this week, there was a -- a kind of a little bit of an upset. A lot of women I talked to were really upset about the way he talked about his wife and raising their kids. That came up a lot. So I took it on myself to start calling around to some of the people and friends and family of -- </p><p>BRENNAN: Because he said his wife mainly raises the children. </p><p>SIMMONS: That's right. So I started calling women who don't live in Washington, who don't live in California, and asking them, Michigan, Georgia, Texas, Ohio, asking them what they thought. And what -- the most interesting response was a 70-year-old woman relative in Detroit who said to me, oh, yes, I saw that. I really liked that. So I think sometimes --</p><p>BRENNAN: Because she thought she was giving -- she thought he was giving his wife credit? </p><p>SIMMONS: She thought he was giving his wife credit. </p><p>BRENNAN: I got it.</p><p>SIMMONS: So I think -- I think sometimes that -- that things sound differently to people who live in different places. And we just have to -- we have to wait and see how this all souses (ph) out from time --</p><p>WALTER: Right, which is why the process is so important. You haven't heard Democrats yet -- it's going to happen -- say, this process is too unwieldy. We're going to damage the ultimate nominee by having all of these debates and this, you know, lasting far too long. Right now I think it is the only way to determine which one of these candidates meets all of those different criteria that Jamal pointed out, of who's going to be able to raise the money, look like they can stand up to the president, be able to be inspiring, also have a pathway to the White House that looks to voters like a realistic path to the White House. </p><p>BRENNAN: All right. Well, we'll have the leave it there with the three of you. But more to come when we come back from this break with some analysis of the week that was. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: We turn now to our panel for some analysis on the other big news of the week. Jamal Simmons and Amy Walter are joined by Ramesh Ponnuru, who is a senior editor at \"National Review\" and a columnist for \"Bloomberg Opinion,\" and Mark Landler, who covers the White House and foreign policy for \"The New York Times.\" </p><p>Good to have you join us. </p><p>Ramesh, let me ask you, you know, Amy brought up in the last segment this point about it not just being about the 2020 presidential race. It's also about some of these congressional seats. Senators, some of them we saw with this vote on the rebuke to the president, the accusation that maybe they were a little worried about their seats in 2020 and that may have swayed some Republicans to stick with the president instead of rebuking him. </p><p>How big of a concern and a factor was that? </p><p>RAMESH PONNURU, \"BLOOMBERG OPINION\": Well, I think it's very striking that of the 12 Republican senators who did not vote with the president, who voted to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency, only one of them is running in 2020. There was a risk on both sides, right? There's the general election risk because the emergency is unpopular, and the wall is unpopular. But among Republicans, it's -- these things are very popular. And, obviously, I think a lot of Republicans showed that they were more concerned about winning their primaries than they were about the general election. </p><p>BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind? Is it Thom Tillis of North Carolina who took a lot of heat for that eleventh hour switch of his vote? </p><p>PONNURU: Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, all of them voted with the president and not with, you know, the -- the 12 Republicans, like Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, Mike Lee and others, who had these constitutional concerns about what the president is doing.</p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, Mick Mulvaney was on this program and said that he thinks the White House, you know, has nothing to worry about with this attempt to override the veto. But how was this received inside the White House? It was the president's first time to use the pen this this way.</p><p>MARK LANDLER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": And it was also first time the president was rebuffed this way by Republicans. Ramesh points out that several of them didn't go the whole way. </p><p>But the fact of the matter is, after two years in which the Republicans have been just an absolute reliable sort of bastion for the president in Congress, I thought this was still symbolically important. And I'm sure that President Trump's argument is, well, I didn't pitch as hard as I could have. If I'd really asked for the votes, I would have gotten them.</p><p>But, nevertheless, they must be looking at this and thinking, do we have Mitch McConnell as reliably as we thought we did? And facing the prospects of more unpopular potential policy decisions and debates down the road, is this the first in what will be a more independent Republican majority in the Senate, a majority that's going to make decisions not just blindly following the White House and President Trump? </p><p>BRENNAN: Some might say that's wishful thinking? </p><p>WALTER: Yes.</p><p>LANDLER: Indeed. Indeed. And I stimulate that we haven't seen it and we've had this same sort of discussion many, many times in the past. Well, this will be the moment that they show their independence and they continue not to do that. </p><p>But having said that, you know, this was a somewhat different set of circumstances. It didn't play out quite as well as I think the White House hoped it would. And so that's got to be at least somewhat concerning for them. </p><p>BRENNAN: Do you think this resonates with people at home or is it lost on them? </p><p>WALTER: I do think it -- it -- it doesn't really resonates unless the president wants it to resonate, in which case what he does very well is turns it back against Congress. I think he loves the idea that, look, I told you people in Washington didn't understand us or our vision for how we keep America safe. They're -- they're trapped in their old ways of thinking. I'm here to break us out of us. And so it actually works for him. Even when it's members of his own party, I think this is very beneficial to him. </p><p>And I -- I do agree that -- with the question of whether this signals more dissention or whether it's just -- this was a really easy vote. The veto -- they're never going to have to vote on this again. They're not going to have -- it's going to die in the House most likely. They won't have to vote on this again. And then it's in the courts where ultimately it means that none of the discussion that we're having right now may ever have to turn into reality.</p><p>BRENNAN: Ramesh, one of the few areas where we did see some -- some public criticism of the president from Republicans was on the foreign policy front. And, again, going into 2020, I guess there are some questions about, well, what does the president say he delivered on when it comes to North Korea? What does he say he delivered on with the promise to pull all troops out of Afghanistan? And we have some upcoming decisions on both of those things. </p><p>How much of a political lens should we be putting on them? </p><p>PONNURU: I tend to think that those sorts of foreign policy decisions are not all that politically significant in a presidential election, unless something has gone very, very wrong. And in that case, people start holding politicians accountable and asking why things that they themselves as voters weren't paying attention to weren't done. </p><p>So I -- I think the stakes politically are low, even if the stakes for our long-term national security are kind of high. Right now, I think the president can say that -- to his core voters, look, i have been trying to pull out of our commitments overseas, or at least downsize them in an intelligent way. And I think that that is going to be accepted as fine. I don't think that there are a ton of Republican voters who are saying to themselves, you know, we need to be more involved in Syria. We need to be more involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. And so I think that he's going to be fine on this front. </p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, we had the president go to the Pentagon on Friday for a classified briefing. Do we know what threats he was actually getting briefed on? </p><p>LANDLER: Well, we don't precisely know what threats he was getting briefed on. The assumption is clear he was probably being briefed on North Korea. He was probably being briefed on Syria, where, after all, he made this decision to leave some American troops behind after saying he was going to withdraw them. And probably also on Afghanistan. We are in the midst of this peace reconciliation process with the Taliban, and part of that process is setting a definite timeline for withdrawing the remaining troops there. </p><p>So I am -- I'm sure all -- some combination of those issues, plus Iran, were probably all on the table at that point. </p><p>BRENNAN: And there are about 12,000 troops still in Afghanistan. </p><p>LANDLER: That's right. And that -- that conversation has become very complicated in the last couple of weeks because the Afghan government feels that we, the United States, have cut them out of the process. We're dealing directly with the Taliban. The Afghans are -- don't have a seat at the table. And that's become very contentious just in the -- in the last week in Washington with a couple visiting Afghan officials raising some very serious criticisms of the administration. </p><p>BRENNAN: Jamal, do you hear anything from this week with what's being described as sort of a blow symbolically to the president or the frustrations in trying to deliver on some of these foreign policy promises. Is there any rich territory for Democrats to message and mine?</p><p>SIMMONS: I mean think of the Democratic political establishment or the Democratic left, the voters. People are thinking more Russia and Russian influence than they are about some of the more fine points of foreign policy. They generally get the president is not really doing very well, and the candidates don't seem -- the Democratic candidates don't seem to be that -- that far apart on this. </p><p>I think what people on the -- on the Democratic side are trying to do is alter an -- offer an alternate vision about what's important. So the reason the president and immigration focuses importantly is for -- for his base is because it says to particularly white, disaffected voters, I'm the guy who's standing up against the brown people coming into the United States and trying to preserve the country for you. </p><p>I think what the Democrats are trying to say is, there's actually a bigger problem that happens. And so if you look at what happened with the cheating scandal with the schools, like there's this sort of mob of people who are at the top. They've got all the goodies. So this goodies mob, and I'm not talking about Sealo (ph), but there's like a goodies mob out there, right, that are dividing up all the opportunity among each other. And those are the people that we all have to be worried about. How do we tilt the scales back in favor of working people. And somebody like Elizabeth Warren, who talked about this idea of breaking up big tech companies, is somebody who's driving this agenda on the left that says, maybe we've got to change the rules about how we deal with our economy, and that's an alternate vision that I think Democrats are trying to establish and it might work. </p><p>WALTER: And yet that's also going back to the, who -- who's the safe choice. And for Democrats trying to balance these two very important segments of their electorate, the ones who do see that the system is rigged, they're attracted to the Bernie Sanders message, also who's going to turn out that Obama coalition that Hillary did not, younger voters, voters of color. But the newest coalition are those white suburban voters who came out, and guess who they voted for? They voted for Beto. That's how Beto came so close in Texas. It wasn't the rise or younger or Latino voters. I was white, suburban voters who came out and voted for Democrats in the House and for Beto. How do you keep those voters from either staying home or defecting back to -- to Donald Trump? If you put a candidate -- goes the theory -- someone like Elizabeth Warren, someone like Bernie Sanders, that's going to turn off those voters who were willing to vote for say Democrats in 2018. </p><p>BRENNAN: And -- but, Jamal, Bernie Sanders is trying to woo black voters right now in South Carolina. He's trying to make up a difference, I guess. The lesson he learned.</p><p>SIMMONS: He's trying. But, you know, there's a funny picture that was going around the Internet yesterday of him at an African-American church in South Carolina, but everybody in the room was white, right? And so he -- so what happened was, they -- they built a crowd, but it wasn't actually the crowd of the membership of that particular church. So he's got a -- he's got a little bit of a tougher road. </p><p>I think of the two of them, Elizabeth Warren probably is the more -- is the one people may buy into a little bit more. But here's my real guess, is that somebody, whoever the Democratic nominee is, will end up adopting a lot of the policy choices that Bernie and Elizabeth Warren put forward, because that seems to be where the passion of the left is. </p><p>BRENNAN: We will see.</p><p>Thanks to all of you. </p><p>And we will be back in a moment with a look at a unique new class of congressional interns. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: Politics and football meet head-on this spring with an unusual class of interns on Capitol Hill. CBS News special correspondent James Brown reports. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMES BROWN, CBS NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Michael Thomas, Austin Carr and Ryan Hunter are used to running, blocking, or catching for a living, but for the last couple of weeks, they have been running around the halls of Congress, tackling the big issues facing the country. </p><p>RYAN HUNTER, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS: I've been fortunate to sit in on meeting with foreign policy administrators from the Middle East, whether it be constituents from the state of Missouri and the city of Kansas City, St. Louis. </p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter is an offensive lineman for the Kansas City Chiefs. He's interning for freshman Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. </p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI: It's fun because we're both new together. So Ryan's new. I'm new. We're kind of learning the ropes together. I think it's phenomenal that NFL players like Ryan who are very busy guys and have a career that they're pursuing want to be involved in their communities, want to be involved in service. </p><p>BROWN: Michael Thomas plays safety for the New York Giants. This is his second time working for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents his district in Houston, Texas.</p><p>REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS: What a place to be, not necessarily only in my office, but in many offices where they can be change agents and translate that leadership on the field into making a difference. </p><p>MICHAEL THOMAS, NEW YORK GIANTS: Yes, after interning last year, I was like, I got to come back, because I saw firsthand what she's doing and how much she's really on the ground, you know, like putting in the work. A lot of things that we were fighting for, for criminal justice reform, bail reform, education, you know, re-entry with juvenile detentions and stuff like that, she's already had bills written. You know, they're on the floor. She's proposing these things. So I'm like, OK, this is how we can take that next step.</p><p>BROWN (on camera): And you are firmly convinced that Capitol Hill, this arena, this venue, if you will, can affect the kind of meaningful changes that you and others who have the same feelings can bring about? </p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it's going to take -- you know, it's going to take time. You can't -- nothing happens overnight. I can see how other people can say, man, like, they're slow, we need -- we need something now. We need to do something now. And I get that passion. I feel it. </p><p>BROWN (voice over): Austin Carr is a wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints. He is pro-life and interested in some libertarian ideas, which is why he is interning for Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. </p><p>AUSTIN CARR, NEW ORLEANS SAINTS: I'm seeing how hard they work, and in particular Senator Rand Paul, how often he's running to and fro to different meetings, different committee, meeting with constituents. </p><p>BROWN (on camera): What have you seen in this young man, senator? </p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: We're -- we're glad to have him here. And I think it's good to see another side of our athletes. </p><p>BROWN (voice over): According to the NFLPA, the average NFL career lasts just under four years. In 2014, the union started an externship program to prepare players for life after the NFL. Since then, 183 players have had on-the-job training in a variety of fields. </p><p>Michael Thomas is a member of the union's executive board, and he sees this as an opportunity to speak for his community. Thomas was one of the players who protested police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem. </p><p>THOMAS: Me being here, being an inside intern, I see the steps that needs to be taken -- that need to be taken. I'm willing to put in the work. I'm willing to advocate for it. I'm willing to help out Congresswoman Jackson Lee any way I can using my voice and my platform, the same way I did it on the football field in taking a knee. </p><p>BROWN: Austin Carr met with the attorney general of Louisiana to talk about the opioid crisis. </p><p>CARR: Nationwide, the U.S. consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, right? </p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter learned more about brain injuries after meeting with the Society for Neuroscience. </p><p>HUNTER: I'd rather be here than be in the Bahamas, because I'm learning so much for the future that this -- this experience on its own beats, you know, having an umbrella drink on the beach. </p><p>BROWN: These pro athletes came to Washington to learn from political leaders, but their mentors seem to learn from them, as well. </p><p>PAUL: But, no, I'm glad to see that Austin, you know, believes strongly in his faith and that it sounds like he wants to be part of trying to make things better in the country, but also be an example for, you know, kids out there that look up to our -- our stars. </p><p>HAWLEY: Having players say, I want to be involved, I want to serve, I want to see it from the inside, I want to do something about that, that's awesome. We need more of that. And I think Ryan's a great example. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: I hope he will be able to be here when we are seeing these bills pass out of the House and the Senate where we have changed the criminal justice system. Wouldn't that be great? That's my heart and passion. And I hope he will be part of it. </p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: And we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. </p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-584130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNK-HFG1-DY7X-Y3NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9323\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal News Service, Inc.

I'm Brian Stelter and welcome to RELIABLE SOURCES, our weekly look at the story behind the story, of how the media really works, how the news gets made, and how all of us can help make it better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Ronan Farrow, Irin Carmon and Rachel Abrams are all here taking us inside the halls of sexual misconduct in the halls of CBS and another major media companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, a big question for newsrooms. As we all gear up for 2020, have we learned from 2016's mistakes? I'll have a blunt conversation about that with Kathleen Hall Jamieson.</p><p>And later, looking forward to 2019, oh, yes we are. Some of the most powerful editors in the country are here with their New Year's resolutions.</p><p>But let's begin with media shake ups, takedowns, and a year that seems like it lasted a decade. As the ball was dropping back on January 1st, I bet you had not heard of Stormy Daniels yet or Christine Blasey Ford or Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. You might not have known the name Jamal Khashoggi, either. Or the name of the newspaper in Annapolis, the \"Capital Gazette.\"</p><p>So, now, at the end of a year of so much news and frankly so much bad news, you might have news fatigue. If you do, you're not alone. Yes, news fatigue. Most Americans feel worn out by the sheer amount of news these days, which means they need trusted newsrooms as guides, as curators.</p><p>So have we helped? Have journalists done enough to cut through the confusion and lies and propaganda and actually put facts first? You know, right now, our country feels consumed by politics. That's how it feels in America.</p><p>From \"Fire and Fury\", the very first start of the year, a best seller straight through Bob Woodward's \"Fear\", the theme of the political coverage was an aberrant, possibly even dangerous presidency. President Trump kept attacking reporters and reporters kept reporting. Even after one of them, CNN's Jim Acosta, was blacklisted from the White House grounds. Of course, that didn't last long. The courts proved to be an essential check and balance in that case. It was a defeat for Trump and his new comms chief, Bill Shine, a Fox News veteran. Yes, nowadays, it's sometimes now hard to tell where Fox ends and the White House begins.</p><p>Trump's live tweeting of Fox continued in 2018, keeping fact checkers working overtime. And by the way, the one book that I still want to read, it's that diary. Let's have a diary from that anonymous Trump senior official, whoever it is, who wrote that \"New York Times\" op-ed. It was the world's most-read op-ed of the year.</p><p>While big papers like \"The Times\" are thriving, local papers continue to close up shop. And some digital start-ups are flailing, too. The media business is in a state of revolution. And that's partly because tech giants like Facebook and Google control so much of the media environment right now.</p><p>It's also partly because you are choosing to consume news in new ways. That makes it an incredible and stressful time for my panelists.</p><p>Joining me now, Kathleen Carroll, she's the board chair at the Committee to Protect Journalists. Matt Murray, the editor in chief of the \"Wall Street Journal,\" and Sally Buzbee, the executive editor of \"The Associated Press\".</p><p>Thanks, everybody, for being here.</p><p>MATT MURRAY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Thanks for having us.</p><p>STELTER: Sally, as the editor of the world's biggest news organization, what changed this year? What was different about 2018?</p><p>SALLY BUZBEE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think there has been a lot of focus this year on the safety and security of journalists. Some of that has been very naval gazing, but a lot of it is very, very relevant.</p><p>In terms of reporting inside the United States, I think it was a escalation of some of the trends we saw in the first year of Trump's presidency.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>BUZBEE: The fatigue that a lot of our audiences feel about the rush of news coming at them. A lot of us have to sort of also make sure that our journalists are able to handle that pace, too. And that we're keeping up our standards and that we're paying attention to that, you know, just very thoughtful process of not going too fast and really, really, really doing the best jobs that we can do.</p><p>STELTER: It's a really interesting point. I mean, Matt, you're dealing with this firsthand. You became the top editor at the journal this year, congratulations.</p><p>MURRAY: Thank you.</p><p>STELTER: What's that been like, to take over \"The Wall Street Journal\"?</p><p>MURRAY: Well, it's like getting on a tiger and you ride. And as Harry Truman said about being the president, you better ride or you're going to get eaten.</p><p>It's been intense from the moment it started and that's the world we're living in today. So, I would add to what Sally said, from my perspective, for what it's worth, I think the media business got much more realistic about the world in certain ways for us. There's no more illusion that technology is going to come along and save us. That the social platforms are somehow going to be a miracle cure.</p><p>[11:05:00] And in fact, there's a lot more understanding of the real relationship we have with them. There's an understanding of the value of sort of real trust in journalism versus sort of the less responsible journalism. And both the opportunity we have, but also the challenge to get that out there. And I think there was a new realism about the conditions we're facing that's actually in some ways daunting, but in some ways healthy for all of us in journalism.</p><p>STELTER: There's so many websites following your lead. The website has had a pay wall for many years where you have to pay to read the news. Go figure.</p><p>All of these websites are now launching subscription models. And we're seeing that in entertainment as well, right? CNN's parent company, now AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T took over earlier this year. Now, AT&amp;T is putting up a big streaming service, launching in 2019. Disney's doing that.</p><p>So in both news and entertainment, we're seeing more and more of this model, relying less on advertising, and more on subscription.</p><p>MURRAY: I think people almost feel embarrassed when they think back 10 years ago, and we said, all content wants to be free and free makes sense, and this is going to liberate us. It seems highly naive in retrospect. I think in the industry, but also, I have to say, I think for the readers, which explains part of the success we and others are having with subscriptions, they recognize, quality is something you have to pay for. And it's worth paying for.</p><p>And we realize we've got to earn that every day. So I think the industry in that sense is maturing a little bit.</p><p>STELTER: Interesting.</p><p>KATHLEEN CARROLL, BOARD CHAIR, COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS: I think part of what Matt is talking about, that relationship includes being paid for your work. But also, explaining more about what you do and how you do it. It's easier to demonize and a profession when you don't understand how it works. If you just think that reporting is putting on a brightly colored dress and sitting on a panel like this. And reporting is a lot harder. And it's not very glamorous and not always very interesting, but explaining how you know what you know is really, really important. And people will be loyal to the organizations that they feel that they have a relationship with.</p><p>And I think the news organizations that are doing well are those that are cultivating relationships with their audiences.</p><p>STELTER: What have been the most important stories for your y'all's reporters to be focusing on?</p><p>Kathleen, first to you. I know the rise of autocracy was something on your mind this year.</p><p>CARROLL: Right, and it's not just this year. This has been a several year trend and it will continue. And the demonization of anybody who's considered an other.</p><p>I mean, we look at history, if you read history, this is a very troubling trend for the world. And to look at some work that, for example, my old news organization, the \"A.P.\" has done, counting the number of refugees who have died. And without that kind of work, no one notices, no one cares.</p><p>STELTER: Because no one else is doing it, right? Nobody else is doing that.</p><p>CARROLL: But it's bad for people, that people are considered disposable in that way. And I think that's an important thing for journalism to stand for. It's not -- we're not doing journalism for the elite group or the people in power. Journalism exists for all citizens. And the best news organizations are fighting for those citizens, because they deserve knowledge. So they can make decisions.</p><p>STELTER: And. Sally, we have managed to go a few minutes without talking about the president. But all roads do lead back to Trump, don't they, even in your new newsroom?</p><p>BUZBEE: Absolutely. There's no question that the presidency of Donald Trump and the Mueller investigation, as it has expanded, was a huge story that had global interests this year. And a lot of resources, obviously, of news organizations were spent on that. The story has accelerated and become more serious, toward the end of the year.</p><p>STELTER: You mean, because the investigations have?</p><p>BUZBEE: Absolutely. I think that the investigation has become more serious. The investigation has become wider and more expansive and, you know, closer to the bone in some ways, I think, is the way to say it.</p><p>And one of the things that I think many of us worry about is there has been -- this investigation has gone on so long, that it is difficult to be able to assess what in this investigation is truly very serious and what is not as serious. That's one thing that journalists struggle with a little bit.</p><p>I think the other big stories this year, obviously, you know, we survey editors and they all pointed to the Parkland shooting as a very important thing that happened this year, that seems a little bit in the past to us now, but the Parkland and Pittsburgh shootings really did have an enormous impact on the country. I think, overseas, obviously, the Khashoggi killing, but also the focus that that put on the war in Yemen, which is really one of the world's sort of unbelievable humanitarian crisis.</p><p>That sort of focused some attention toward the second half of the year on that long-running war. A war that was getting essentially -- I mean, journalists were covering it, we've been covering it quite extensively and so have others, but it was basically getting no attention until the killing of Khashoggi and then the focus went to that.</p><p>STELTER: Is it fair to say that the threats have magnified or multiplied, meaning that there are more journalists being killed or and being imprisoned than there were a decade ago?</p><p>CARROLL: Yes, absolutely. And in fact, the journalists that are being killed now are being murdered, so they're deliberately targeted and it's a retaliatory killing. A decade ago, journalists were being killed, but a lot of them were being killed in accidents of war or in warfare, or covering a conflict of some kind.</p><p>[11:10:03] Now, two-thirds of the journalists who have been killed in 2018 are murdered. Somebody has targeted them because they are journalists, 34. It's an astonishing number. And it's up threefold from last year.</p><p>STELTER: Are there changes, Matt and Sally, that you have to make in your newsrooms to deal with the threat environment that exists?</p><p>MURRAY: I would say on one level, the awareness of everybody on the need to be aware of your surroundings and be security conscience has been much higher. Although, I think the journalist also want it much more, so they're responsive. Second place goes a little bit to what Kathleen was talking about, which is, I think the intensity of the -- in some cases, the direct relationship between reporters and sources or readers has really grown. And you're exposing yourself to a certain degree when you're on Twitter or when you're out there and people send you pretty direct things or target you.</p><p>You know, we had a journalist this year who wrote a story about sort of a hate speech figure on YouTube. And, she was actually fine, but over the weekend, she got subjected to a barrage of hundreds of hate e-mails. Somebody sent hear a scary photo. Then they turned to me as the editor, I can got about 200 people sending me nasty notes and e- mails. And the ability of people to organize and morph and then use bots to continue these things and just sort of that scary feeling atmosphere, that's a much different thing than we've had in the past.</p><p>So I don't know whether I can say that this constitutes a higher threat level, but it certainly puts an air of vulnerability around journalists. And it can potentially be very inhibiting.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, because we want to be available and accessible and interactive. Yet with that, comes these downsides.</p><p>MURRAY: Yes.</p><p>BUZBEE: I think the \"Capital Gazette\" shooting was a big shock to people. I mean, an organization like mine which has a bunch of journalists overseas has always had to worry about security, and we have had to worry about targeting and conflict zones. To start thinking about, we want our journalists to be out in the community, but how do we protect them while they're doing that was a sort of painful moment for many people this year. And I think a lot of them are grappling with how to do that.</p><p>We're worried about many things. We're about the campaign trail. We're about, you know, our journalists overseas.</p><p>One thing that sort of has surprised me, but is, I think, very distressing and Matt sort of alluded to that, which is that people who work in types of journalism that don't seem like they would be getting threats. Let's say, women who work in sports journalism are actually getting some pretty nasty and very directed sorts of both harassment and outright threats at this point. And I think a lot of news organizations are struggling with trying to decide how serious is this, how do we protect our people, where is that dividing line between really aggressive harassment and someone when might actually do something.</p><p>And, you know, a lot of the stuff, unfortunately, is very gender focused, too.</p><p>STELTER: It's a really important point. And newsroom diversity, lack thereof, continues to be a problem.</p><p>BUZBEE: Continues to be a problem.</p><p>STELTER: We say it every year and it's still true every year.</p><p>BUZBEE: Exactly.</p><p>STELTER: All right. To our panel, please stand by. Much more ahead this hour.</p><p>We're going to talk about media winners and losers after the break. David Zurawik has some surprising picks, that's coming up.</p><p>[11:16:25] STELTER: Welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>Let's try to pick some of the biggest winners and losers of 2018. I think some of the big winners are those old-fashioned newspapers, \"The New York Times,\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" we were just talking about, scoop after scoop from these papers are showing they're more relevant than ever. Another winner this year is CNN's Chris Cuomo. You know, he moved to 9:00 p.m. It was a really risky move, but \"CUOMO PRIME TIME\" is now the network's highest-rated show here. And cable news in general continues to be a winner. We're seeing high ratings and high interest in all things politics.</p><p>Another winner, Marc Benioff. He's the latest tech CEO to go out and buy a news outlet. In this case, he's bought \"TIME\" magazine. So maybe that means time is the winner? Fingers crossed, they both win in that situation.</p><p>Now, what about the losers? I would say David Pecker and the \"National Enquirer\" is a loser this year. Of course, the catch-and- skill scheme has been exposed. Now, he's been granted immunity from prosecution.</p><p>Sinclair, another loser this year. There's been expose after expose of bias at Sinclair through their conservative-leaning commentaries, and Sinclair's deal to buy Tribune fell through.</p><p>And perhaps the biggest loser of the year, Facebook. This has been their worst year ever. The company under intense scrutiny for privacy concerns, for data concerns, and of course, the plague of misinformation on the platform.</p><p>But those are just a few of my winners and losers. Let's bring in David Zurawik with his list. He's with me here, the media critic for the \"Baltimore Sun\".</p><p>David, your biggest winner of the year. Who would you single out?</p><p>DAVID ZURAWIK, MEDIA CRITIC, THE BALTIMORE SUN: You know, Brian, I don't want to -- not that I'm agreeing with the host, but I really love the newspapers that you picked, because those are the publications that more than any have held to the high standards of legacy journalism. And they've done great work. They've done monumental work, I think, in -- I mean, it's a -- I don't want to go to golden age, but they've done some tremendous reporting.</p><p>At this moment, when democracy is imperiled, I think, out of the executive branch of our government right now, where journalism matters more -- I don't want to say more than ever, but journalism matters more than it did maybe since Watergate.</p><p>STELTER: And \"The Washington Post,\" of course, of Watergate fame, has really lived up to this moment. The other big papers, as well.</p><p>Other winners, I would say, the NFL, you know, always talked about a year ago NFL ratings going down. But they're back up this season. NFL is doing better.</p><p>Let's talk about the losers. What losers would you call out?</p><p>ZURAWIK: I think one, network television. It's really terrible. It's in the sense of, OK, they're going to say our ratings losses are, you know, it's -- you can't get away from it. We're going to have losses every year. How much can we slow them down?</p><p>STELTER: Yes, they're managing decline.</p><p>ZURAWIK: But I would say this, you name one show between \"This is Us\" that anybody cares about? One drama.</p><p>STELTER: I was thinking \"This is Us\" was going to be my pick.</p><p>ZURAWIK: That's a great show. That could be anywhere. That is an absolutely great show.</p><p>But here's why I have no sympathy for networks. In the '90s, when political conventions didn't draw very big audience, I remember doing story after story with network presidents and network news presidents, when they started cutting back and saying, we're not going to cover the conventions or put on live.</p><p>And, finally, they would say to me, hey, Zurawik, look, there are three cable channels, let them cover it. We're going to show re-runs in the summer of bad sitcoms. OK, they did that to make a couple of extra pennies off their sitcoms. And now cable news owns news. It owns news and it owns politics.</p><p>[11:20:01] Nobody says, oh, what did CBS say last week -- it's cable news.</p><p>You know, I'll tell you, you mentioned Sinclair. This goes beyond Sinclair. They were the final piece in what looked to me like a great Trump messaging machine. They were the -- going to be over 200 stations, and the messages, the messages from the White House were going to be wrapped or voiced by local anchors, local people who people knew in the community. That was a really powerful thing.</p><p>Trump lost that. You know, now he's stuck with Boris Epshteyn, their -- I call him a propaganda puppet for Trump, you know? Because I can't find anything he ever says negative. I read his news letter every day looking for it, I don't find it.</p><p>STELTER: Trump's also lost the \"National Enquirer.\" \"The Enquirer\" was supporting him, now not so much due to all of this Michael Cohen stuff.</p><p>ZURAWIK: That's the point. He may be the biggest loser in some ways. Look at \"The Enquirer\" on one end, you look at Sinclair on the other, and you look at the ways as to how he's sometimes had to kiss up to Fox or hold it. When Fox -- when CNN -- MSNBC, again, led the way, and said, we're not going to carry those rallies.</p><p>And Fox started to pull back a little bit. And then he said, I love Sean, I love Laura --</p><p>STELTER: Read off their names.</p><p>ZURAWIK: He was kissing up to them. And that's a weakened system. Look, last year, I was really worried about this right-wing messaging machine he was putting together. I'm not so worried anymore. STELTER: One other piece of it, Alex Jones at Infowars, a radical conspiracy theorist, he's been de-platformed. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube all banned him earlier this year. That was a big development.</p><p>I think there's understandable concern about the tech platforms having that much power, but Jones has almost vanished as a result. One more loser I almost forgot about, Roseanne Barr.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Oh, god, oh, god.</p><p>STELTER: Her show was the highest rated show of the year. For her to go off on that racist rant on Twitter meant the end of her show.</p><p>ZURAWIK: You know, I said that about Megyn Kelly, too, to not learn from her mistakes. Two people, abundant riches that they earned because people -- the popular audience liked them. They should have learned. They should have grown, they should have evolved. They should have not be saying these things at that point in their career.</p><p>Again. No sympathy for Roseanne, even though I loved having a blue collar sitcom on television, because there's historically so few, but not one with someone putting out those kinds of messages. And, by the way, we should praise ABC for the way it acted, because that could have been -- that was a big financial hit that they're going to take and they acted like that.</p><p>STELTER: And the show without her, \"The Connors\" still did okay.</p><p>ZURAWIK: So it's a winner.</p><p>STELTER: Call it a winner.</p><p>All right. David, thanks so much.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Thank you, Brian. OK.</p><p>STELTER: Great to see you. Happy New Year.</p><p>Right after this quick break, we're talking about year two of the #metoo movement. And what has changed this year. I'll be talking with three award winning reporters who have led the way in these stories. They're coming up right after the break.</p><p>[11:26:46] STELTER: Welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. I'm Brian Stelter.</p><p>This past year, major news outlets turned their attention to systems of harassment and discrimination and retaliation. Yes, there's been a lot of stores about individual perpetrators, but really, it's about the systems that are in place that have allowed this behavior to go on for so long at major media companies.</p><p>For much of the year, the eye was on CBS, the eye network. The network saw CEO Les Moonves accused of harassment and sexual assault by numerous women in a pair of stories in \"The New Yorker.\" In September, Moonves stepped down under pressure. CBS had two law firms come in and review what went wrong.</p><p>And earlier this month, based on that law firm review, the board said that Moonves would not receive his $120 million severance package. There may be more to come on this story, but this is about a lot more than Moonves and about a lot more than just CBS.</p><p>With me now are three of the award-winning reporters who have been leading the way in this coverage. Irin Carmon is a senior correspondent for \"New York Magazine\" and a CNN contributor, Ronan Farrow is an investigative reporter for the New Yorker, and Rachel Abrams is a business reporter for \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>You know, all three of you have been reporting on CBS for the past year. I wonder, as rivals, do you all feel like you're competitive or do you feel like what you do is complementary?</p><p>Irin, first for you. You wrote about Charlie Rose more than a year ago at this point.</p><p>IRIN CARMON, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: To me, my commitment to this story is seeing the truth come out. And we were just talking about how there's a real sense of camaraderie among the reporters. Of course, you've got to compete for scoops, you're accountable to your publication for breaking stories, to your editors.</p><p>But ultimately, this is about something bigger than an individual reporter getting the glory. It's about exposing what happened, bringing it to light in the most accurate, and balanced way possible.</p><p>STELTER: And, Ronan, you now have a reputation because of your Harvey Weinstein reporting, for doing this dogged work that takes months. There were rumors about your Les Moonves stories for months before your first work came out.</p><p>What is it like to be kind of in that spotlight?</p><p>RONAN FARROW, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, THE NEW YORKER: You know, it's a double-edged sword. Largely, it's a real advantage as a reporter, because more people talk to you. It is true also, some people immediately hang up on you because of that reputation. And you navigate those things.</p><p>And I would echo what Irin said, there's a real sense of all of us doing this tough investigative reporting that we're in this fight together. If you look at those early Les Moonves stories I did, they actually have a big shout-out to Irin's work and further attempts that she and a colleague made at \"The Post\" to get more information out, where they were forestalled by a lot of dirty tactics.</p><p>So, I think we have each other's backs in this, to an extent, even though we also are competitive.</p><p>STELTER: And, Rachel, why did you start looking into CBS? This was after the first Moonves story came out by Farrow and \"The New Yorker.\" Why were you curious about this?</p><p>RACHEL ABRAMS, BUSIENSS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Well, our editors were interested in how serious CBS was taking its own investigation to allegations of misconduct both by Les Moonves and broader cultural problems at the network. So, that really got the ball rolling on just finding out a lot more about what the investigators had uncovered, in large part prompted by the stories in \"The New Yorker\" and in \"The Washington Post\".</p><p>STELTER: So it's a sense of stories building on one another.</p><p>CARMON: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: And a sense of momentum as a result. It does seem like there's this rot inside CBS. Is that fair to say?</p><p>[11:30:00] RACHEL ABRAMS, BUSINESS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: New Yorker and in The Washington Post.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR: So it's a sense of stories building on one another and a sense of momentum as a result.</p><p>ABRAMS: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: It does seem like there's this rock inside CBS. Is that is that fair to say?</p><p>IRIN CARMON, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: Well, you know, when after Amy Brittain and I did the Charlie Rose story at the Washington Post about a year ago, we also wanted to follow up about CBS, what did people know. And that's when you find out that it's not just about the individual behavior of one person, right? It's about a system that enables that behavior, a star system that says that if this person is a rainmaker then they can behave in whatever way they want, that people look the other way, a series of mechanisms that keep people silent from speaking up.</p><p>And so I think it's not just -- there's a tendency I think, OK somebody really high-profile got fired we're going to move on. And that's why I think that the last year's reporting is so significant because rather than just say OK, you know, here's this big fish who's gone down in a very high-profile way, you're trying to understand what is the culture that leads us to happen.</p><p>And our reporting show that the culture at CBS did, in fact, lead to silence or in the words of one of the women that we spoke to for the second Washington Post story, she said I'd been there long enough to know that people did what they wanted to you and they said what they wanted to you. And that's why she said she didn't report Charlie Rose sexually harassing her because the vet culture.</p><p>RONAN FARROW, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, THE NEW YORKER: In the midst of the Harvey Weinstein story, it was always very clear to me that this wasn't about Harvey Weinstein, it wasn't even about Hollywood, this was about systems deployed by very powerful, very wealthy people to suppress these kinds of allegations against them. And therefore, when I looked at the array of potential leads to follow up on, what was distinctive about CBS and Moonves was that it was a story about corporate accountability and those vast systems as you say in forming a kind of rot in the eyes of dozens and dozens of sources we talked to.</p><p>Now, all of us faced a lot of pressure in these tough stories to carve off different elements and just focus on one guy because it is so hard just to do that. But it was really important in that reporting that I kept in that 60 minutes material that I paid tribute to the other reporters who had talked about a broader cultural problem there.</p><p>STELTER: So that's a challenge. What are the biggest challenges doing these stories, these stories about harassment, about retaliation? I would think a lot of sources do not want to talk to you.</p><p>ABRAMS: No. And I'm sure all three of us have experienced that in all of this reporting. And you know, I think that generally one of the things that I try to do is to find any kind of documentation that I can which can be -- which can be challenging but I think probably the hardest thing is getting people to trust you and to open up. And the hardest question for me to answer and I don't know if you guys have had this experience but when women that we talk to say I worked really hard to move past this. I don't -- I don't understand why I have to be the person to go on the record. I don't understand why you're calling me. I don't understand why I have to do any of this. It's not my problem. And coming up with an answer is specific to each situation and it's hard and I think it's probably been the most personally challenging part of this reporting for me.</p><p>FARROW: There is a deeply unfair aspect of this where the people who have sustained the most damage have been treated the worst are very often the ones on whom it's incumbent to fix this and their voices do have power. And I hope one of the lessons of the extraordinary work these two women have done and so many other reporters have done over the past year is you can speak. It can make a difference. Because once again I would point out this was a systemic problem at CBS, but this isn't about CBS. This is true at other networks and other media companies, at other companies in different industries, and it is only going to change if more of those sources do speak.</p><p>CARMON: You know, Ronan mentioned that it's not just CBS. And one of the questions that I think we're all trying to answer about the culture at large, now that we've had these moments of truth-telling where people talk about serious wrongs being perpetrated, how do you rebuild a culture that doesn't enable that? How do you say OK we had this kind of accountability but now how do we not repeat that? How do we make sure that people do feel empowered to speak up? And I think that those are -- those are questions that workplaces are still trying to grapple with and the question will be will there be a sweeping under the rug or will there be a sincere grappling with that in the first step, of course, is transparency in that respect.</p><p>STELTER: Absolutely. It's also notable the way that these issues have permeated the culture beyond reporting about CBS or any other company. When you think back a few months to the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings and how so much of what we're talking about was on the table during those confirmation hearings. You, of course, were doing reporting about this as well. Are there lessons to be learned from the Kavanaugh experience?</p><p>FARROW: Well, I would say that was a case where there were a number of women with very credible allegations and then there was a separate circus playing out in the media where there was an immense amount of partisan sniping happening. And all of this went into a cauldron of mistrust and entrenched enmities on the Hill and in the American public. And to me as a reporter who has a track record if you look at tough stories about Democrats and Republicans, that was immensely frustrating. Because the fact patterns themselves were compelling and were important and deserved to be heard.</p><p>And you know, obviously, there were the two on-the-record stories that we broke the first details of Christine Blasey-Ford and then Deborah Ramirez. Both of whom I think were very credible. But then there were other leads out there that were foreclosed because of that partisan race to confirm and because of the incredible rancor around it.</p><p>[11:35:25] STELTER: So you're saying there are women who had allegations against Kavanaugh who never came forward?</p><p>FARROW: I'm not going to talk in specific terms except to say that beyond what we reported more opportunities for reporting were foreclosed by the fact that there was this incredibly vicious partisan atmosphere around it. And that that is at odds with anyone seeking the facts.</p><p>CARMON: I think any reporter who's talking to a potential source who wants to talk about serious harm has to be honest about the fact that they can experience some version of what Christine Blasey-Ford experienced. I mean, it was reported that she has had to move several times, that she hasn't been home. And so I think you know, the transparency and ethics as a -- as a reporter involve acknowledging the fact that there are real risks to speaking up.</p><p>Yes, you are going to contribute to the truth but it is possible that your life will never be the same again and I think we should be honest about that.</p><p>STELTER: Troubling. And more to come in the year to come, is it true, Ronan, that you were able to get a Ph.D. amid all this reporting on all these stories this year?</p><p>FARROW: I think no one cares about my getting a Ph.D. except my mom --</p><p>STELTER: Oh, come on, I care.</p><p>FARROW: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: How do you find the time?</p><p>FARROW: It's a population of two. STELTER: Yes, but what's the secret.</p><p>FARROW: I haven't slept a lot in the last couple of years. I'm a little sick right now, I'm giving you all the plague right now, and I think it's totally worth it and I think we're probably all very tired of hearing this.</p><p>STELTER: All right, hey, well, congratulations.</p><p>FARROW: Thank you.</p><p>STELTER: And all three of you -- I mean, all three have been -- have been winning awards all year long as a -- as a result of this reporting, and I think there's a lot of viewers out there that are grateful for it. Thank you all for being here.</p><p>ABRAMS: Thanks for having us.</p><p>FARROW: Thank you. Good to be here.</p><p>STELTER: Coming up here on RELIABLE SOURCES, presidential lying, it's getting worse and worse, but what's the best way to describe Trump's deceptions? We'll have answers from a communications expert right after this.</p><p>[11:40:00] STELTER: If we're being honest, President Trump sometimes behaves like an internet troll spreading conspiracy theories and bogus Twitter memes and faulty narratives. In 2018, we saw year two of Trump turning reality upside down in that way, completely on its head and distorting and confusing a lot of people.</p><p>This makes journalists jobs much tougher but also thrilling because we have to constantly be on our toes and we have to constantly be fact- checking. In effect with all the President's anti-media messages, he is leading a hate movement against the media. It is that serious. He's whipping up hatred at his rallies and on his Twitter feed.</p><p>But here's the thing, he is not our customer, you are, viewers are. And despite his attacks, we need to make sure we keep serving you with straight talk about what's going on, what's going wrong and what's going right. For example, by calling a lie a lie. But Kathleen Hall Jamieson has a note of caution about that in a new name for fake news. She's the Director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STELTER: One of the things I noticed most in the news coverage in 2018 is an increased use of the word lie, an increased description of President Trump and others lying to the public. How do you feel as a professor about that the use of the word lie to describe behavior?</p><p>KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON, DIRECTOR, ANNENBERG PUBLIC POLICY CENTER: I don't like it because we don't know intention. It is possible under most circumstances to say someone might simply be misinformed, might be self-deluded, or worse might simply not be able to apprehend reality when it's right in front of the person. Now, it's problematic that things are deceptive, but knowing that someone intended to do it doesn't necessarily add additional information that it's deceptive. It means we need to figure out how to correct that so people aren't misinformed.</p><p>STELTER: But lying when the president says something 20 times on 20 different occasions and he keeps getting it wrong at some point don't we know he's lying?</p><p>JAMIESON: No we may simply know that he's convinced himself that that's the truth. The question is what difference does it make that he's making that statement. And one of the differences it makes is that we may be hearing him making promises he's not actually making or our allies may be hearing him signaling things he doesn't actually intend. When someone communicates different things in different kind of circumstances or worse comes out of a meeting with a foreign leader, and his account of what happened and the foreign leaders differs, you run the risk that you're missignaling to the United States markets wha the United States actually said what it's going to do.</p><p>STELTER: You've taught me of something that's called inconsistent signaling, that there at least different signals being sent. In some cases by Trump on the same day or in some cases members of his government on the same day or the same week. That is a communications crisis if there's inconsistent signals being sent all the time.</p><p>JAMIESON: And it's a real problem because if you're not sending consistent signals across time, people begin to discount the signaling at all which means that when you need to send a clear signal, as you do for example when the country moves into crisis, you might simply be ignored and you would have sacrificed that very important asset of the presidency. It also means that you confuse the heck out of our allies.</p><p>STELTER: Still on the subject of language, the President keeps using the term fake news. A lot of journalists are still using the term fake news, and you say that's a problem. We need -- we need to take that out of our vocabulary.</p><p>JAMIESON: We should consider fake news an oxymoron. If something is fake, it's not news. And one of the characteristics of news that is by news I mean journalism, is that when it makes a mistake and humans make mistakes, they make them all professions, that's the characteristic of humans, in journalism they correct. That's called journalism, that's called news. That can't be faked. They got something wrong, that doesn't make it fake. I'd use viral deception VD, venereal disease is the analog. I want people to say ooh, I don't want to catch it, I don't want to spread it. If it comes anywhere near me I want to quarantine it.</p><p>And notice the viral deception focuses on the deception. Now that's problematic, news isn't. News is indispensable to democracy. STELTER: Right. So there's no such thing as fake news. If it's fake, it's not news. It's viral deception and has the added benefit of saying V.D.</p><p>JAMIESON: It does.</p><p>STELTER: Your book cyberwar looks back at the 2016 election and the impact of Russian hackers and trolls. With two years distance now, how much of a factor was viral deception and these kinds of techniques in the election?</p><p>JAMIESON: Well, first, the viral deception is what the trolls engaged in cyberspace. The people pretending to be U.S. Nationals who trafficked in forms of bigotry, fear, anger, and played to the worst instincts of the body politic largely in the process amplifying themes that are already in the U.S. and ecosystem. And the press didn't have much to do with it because the press didn't know they were even there. The hackers, the second part of the Russian initiative came in and stole content from the Democrats and then dropped it back into our media ecosystem through WikiLeaks and the press made a series of mistakes.</p><p>[11:45:30] I argue in cyber wars that -- cyber war that the Russian intervention through the hacking was a necessary but not sufficient condition for influencing the outcome. Necessary because they hacked and they gave it to WikiLeaks. But the sufficient condition was our press' use of it. The press largely attributed to WikiLeaks, not to the Russians, they lost the source. They also didn't note that's Julian Assange who didn't like Hillary Clinton because she wanted him prosecuted.</p><p>And in the process, never explained why Putin didn't want to see Hillary Clinton elected, he didn't like her either, and for reasons, they go back to geopolitics. They also didn't stand up on air when they used the content and say we have not been able to independently confirm it.</p><p>Now, a good journalist to do that. Why did they assume the accuracy? Suppose there was disinformation there they treated it as if it's accurate all the way through. And then they didn't look carefully at the stories they trafficked into news. So go back now and read the stories based on a WikiLeaks content and asked which was stand the tests of newsworthiness. We need new criteria to determine whether or not we should have considered those things.</p><p>STELTER: Thinking about 2020, obviously the primary seasons base we already underway riding into a new year. What are newsrooms need differently the next time there's a -- there's a hacking attack and a bunch of stolen e-mails are out there?</p><p>JAMIESON: Well, first they need to learn the lessons from 2016. They need to ask what would we have done differently from what we did. Because different news organizations made different kinds of decisions and you want them to continue to do the things that they did right, right. Some of the major news organizations, for example, didn't pick up some of the stories that were largely irrelevant to governance, others did. They should examine their own consciousness. But they also ought to have some basic regulations employees about how they're going to treat that content if it appears, particularly, if it appears under pressured times and in large quantities because both of those played a role in journalistic lapses.</p><p>STELTER: Like leading right up to an election on the eve of a vote or something.</p><p>JAMIESON: Yes. And in France, when the hacked content was released two days before the election, there was a regulatory structure that came into play that of course, we don't have because we value our First Amendment protections. What that means is the press has to voluntarily protect us.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STELTER: Coming up here on RELIABLE SOURCES, will the war on truth escalate in 2019. My all-star panel returns with their predictions and New Year's resolutions right after this.</p><p>[11:50:00] STELTER: Welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. I'm Brian Stelter. We're looking ahead to 2019 and what the new year will bring for the news business. Let's get some predictions, maybe even some resolutions from our panel. Kathleen Carroll, Matt Murray, Sally Buzbee, who wants to go first with a New Year's resolution?</p><p>MATT MURRAY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Sally does it.</p><p>SALLY BUZBEE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Thanks, Matt. I think we should all resolve to spend less time or perhaps no time at all on horse race polls that project -- you know, project forward to the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>STELTER: A year ahead of Iowa.</p><p>BUZBEE: I can guarantee you that not a single one of them in retrospect will prove to be accurate or really that useful at all. I don't actually think that anyone is going to follow my prediction or my resolution but I think that we all should.</p><p>STELTER: I think it's a worthy one. My resolution is I'm hoping for some more White House briefings. You know, the daily briefing died in 2018 --</p><p>MURRAY: It's a sad resolution.</p><p>STELTER: I hope it makes a comeback. Hey, you know, I'm a nerd. What do you got, Matt?</p><p>MURRAY: I think we should all resolve to use social media intelligently and in a limited way and spend more time out of the field reporting, talking to people, getting stories, finding stuff out, and less time talking to each other on social media. I think -- I think that is what I try to tell our newsroom and I think reporting and facts are still the backbone of our business and still the thing that will carry us through.</p><p>STELTER: Hard to disagree with that. I mean, what can we do? The value that we can add is bring new information into the world. That's the value. Kathleen, what about predictions for the year ahead?</p><p>KATHLEEN CARROLL, BOARD CHAIR, COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALIST: Well, I have two challenges actually and one of them is for you, Brian. I think there's an awful lot of really excellent accountability and investigative journalism going on in communities and they don't get attention and airtime because of the Trump factor. And --</p><p>STELTER: Who? The what?</p><p>CARROLL: National news organizations and programs like yours to talk a lot about the President and his effect and that's a completely relevant topic. However, I challenge you to in the next year showcase some of the really great accountability reporting that connects communities and their news organizations and let's stop talking about how they're coming apart and start talking about what they're doing well.</p><p>STELTER: Right. And how can we help them?</p><p>CARROLL: Exactly.</p><p>STELTER: How can we make these outlets more vibrant?</p><p>CARROLL: I have an idea. I think anybody who plans to put on a future of journalism conference should scuttle that idea and instead give the money to their local news organization.</p><p>STELTER: Fewer conferences and more coverage.</p><p>CARROLL: Absolutely.</p><p>STELTER: More news coverage.</p><p>CARROLL: There you go. What about kind of in the months ahead -- in the months ahead, more scrutiny of big tech? Are you expecting that, Sally? More of these stories about Facebook and Google and the minuses that come along with the pluses of these sites?</p><p>BUZBEE: Yes, I mean, one of the most interesting things that happen in 2018 clearly is that -- I mean, if you think back ten years ago, everyone was like people should care about privacy. This should be a story and no actual people were actually paying attention to it that much. In 2018 what really happened was that people actually started to pay attention to this story. And I think that is because of the reporting. I think it is because there were actually sort of concretely laid out what is happening to your information, what is happening to your photos, what is happening to what you do online, what -- if you're being traced through a cell phone, what does that actually mean for you and that kind of thing.</p><p>STELTER: Right. BUZBEE: And I think it was -- I mean we should feel good about this. It was when we found concrete examples of how this was actually affecting people's lives that people started to pay attention to it. And I personally think that this is one of the most compelling stories in 2019. And I mean, we're spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to get ahead on that story, how to do a good job on that story. I think this is a global story.</p><p>MURRAY: I would add that with a Mueller report which is going to come out this year presumably, one hopes we'll get it behind us one day. But while we're thinking of it through the lens of the President or what it means and obviously that's very important, the Mueller report seems to be likely again to stoke questions about tech influence, how it works how pervasive it is, and we will continue to see more and more reports and information come out that put in pieces of that puzzle and fill it out for us to what's happened here. It's hard for me not to imagine that that doesn't lead somewhere whether it's into increased regulation, whether it's to big shakeups or changes at those companies, whether it's to changes in consumer behavior as people turn them off. I'm not sure what, but the effects are going to be playing out for a while I think</p><p>[11:55:23] STELTER: Sally, Matt, Kathleen, thank you so much for being here. After a quick break here on RELIABLE SOURCES, a look back at one of the storytellers that we lost this year.</p><p>STELTER: Before we go, a tribute to one of the storytellers that we lost this year. CNN will never be quite the same without Anthony Bourdain who passed away in June. It was a shock to us all. Bourdain taught us so much about storytelling, about travel, and how to appreciate life. You know, he wrote in one of his books, without experimentation, a willingness to ask questions and try new things, we shall surely become static, repetitive and moribund. And he's right. So let's do more of that in 2019. More questioning, more experimenting with new ways to tell stories, more trying new things, more exploring of parts known and unknown.</p><p>As this year ends, I'm grateful to John, and Shanta, and Justin, and Daniela, and Julia, and Katie, and all the members of the team here who bring this show alive. And I'm grateful to all of you for watching. So please send us your feedback and tell us what you want, more of -- less of what you want on this show and more of what you want. I'm @BrianStelter on Twitter and on Facebook and I'm always just an e-mail away bstelter@gmail. You feedback always make this program so much better.</p><p>Thanks for join us this year and stay tuned now. \"STATE OF THE UNION\" starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

One of many reasons why California's new data security legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), has generated a lot of buzz since its enactment in June 2018. What is The CCPA? The CCPA[2] is the broadest data privacy law in the United States and it provides consumers access and control over their personal information as well as allows them to have a say in how organizations collect, use, and disseminate this data. California passed the CCPA in response to the global trend of using data for almost every operational function in both the professional and personal spheres. </p><p>Unfortunately, the more data there is, the higher the risk that a hacker can access private consumer information and use it for malicious reasons. Many organizations (especially big tech companies) handle large amounts of data. Without regulatory oversight, these organizations have the power to collect and distribute private consumer information for essentially any purpose that the company chooses. As such, California lawmakers wanted to provide solid protections for consumer data that are similar to the Europe Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To name a few: Consumer Data Access Consumers will have direct access to their data and can request information about how and why organizations use their personal information. Deleting Consumer Data Consumers have the right to delete and modify their personal data. Organizations must comply with data deletion requests (unless an exception applies). Selling Consumer Data Consumers have the right to opt out of sales involving their personal information. Organizations are required to alert consumers when they intend to sell such data and a must have a 'Do Not Sell My Personal Information' link on their site. Collecting Consumer Data Organizations must notify consumers when they collect personal information and subsequently if a security breach has compromised that data. The Data Collection Compromise The CCPA will go into effect January 1, 2020. Both proponents and critics of the law opposed the original text due to unclear language and exemptions but notably, tech companies disfavor the law as a whole. Instead, they have lobbied for a federal privacy law that would limit consumer control and argue that consumer data drives their advertisements and overall revenue.In response to the criticism, lawmakers have been working vigorously to clean up the language and reach compromise on the disputed provisions before the law goes into effect. Some of the pending amendments to the CCPA are: Personal Information to Exclude Modifying the definition of personal information to exclude data collection from job applicants, employees, contractors, or agents (Assembly Bill 25) and only include data that is 'reasonably' capable of being associated with an individual (Assembly Bill 873). What is Publicly Available Data? Defining the 'publicly available' exception contained in the definition of personal information as lawful data from federal, state, or other local government records (Assembly Bill 874). Government Data Requests Adding exemptions to the law for information disclosure resulting from compliance[3] with government requests (Assembly Bill 1416). Selling Personal Data Adding exemptions to the law for selling information in order to detect security breaches or fraud (Assembly Bill 1416).All of these bills (and others) need to pass in the Senate by September 13, 2019. Then, the governor has until October 3, 2019 to sign these bills into law. Even though several bills have made it through the first step of review, lawmakers have already shot down some other proposed amendments. Most notably was Senate Bill 561, which aimed to provide consumers with a broad and unrestricted right to file private lawsuits for any CCPA violation. The bill would have also removed the requirement for the attorney general's office to issue compliance opinions when requested. If this bill had passed, California courts would have seen an incredibly high number of class action lawsuits that would have overwhelmed judges and businesses. CCPA Violation Enforcement Regardless of what happens, the battle surrounding the CCPA is far from over. Expect to see more proposed changes to the CCPA before and after it becomes enacted. An important aspect to watch will be how the primary enforcement mechanism, the attorney general's office, decides to handle enforcement. The office's compliance opinions, rules, and decisions regarding alleged violations will set the tone for how far the CCPA can go.Courts will have a limited role in the CCPA. Consumers only have a private right of action when an organization fails to have a comprehensive data security program in place that 'reasonably safeguards' certain specified data. When are these private lawsuits appropriate? What factors need to be present in order to meet the legal thresholds that comprises a 'comprehensive data security program' that 'reasonably safeguards' private consumer information? These are all questions that the courts and attorney general will need to answer. Conclusion It is likely that they will try to limit these disputes as much as possible to avoid opening litigation floodgates and keep enforcement primarily with the attorney general. The creation of a federal privacy law could also preempt the CCPA. However, enactment of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the next year or two is not currently looking promising. Stay tuned in the coming months for what is next.

However, both Google and Facebook is likely exempt from the CCPA, because they don't sell user data to third parties. Instead, both platforms gather data and use its own subscriber data to target advertising - which is not specifically prohibited under the CCPA. Facebook has made this specific argument recently.</p><p>\"CCPA was written by well-meaning and well-intending people who don't have a full understanding of technology, data, or advertising,\" added Nelson. \"The law that was created to challenge big tech surveillance further entrenches these legacy incumbents while harming small businesses and publishers. But, the law is now in affect and the industry must comply. It's estimated that companies will spend $55 billion in 2020 to comply, but\u00a0the law will create a better internet for consumers, and the friction and challenge of compliance will create new opportunities for businesses, as it forces a more transparent and balanced relationship with customers.\"</p><p>The gold-standard safe harbor for businesses is to adopt a 100% opt-in platform for gathering, using, and sharing consumer information that operates in an open and transparent manner, like BIGtoken and unlike the tech incumbents.

The sooner this matter reaches a resolution, the better the ability of the commission to take decisive steps to increase the agency's effectiveness in terms of devising salary structures for members and employees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSNTL-TNEWSINT2304202000123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSNTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRD-G7T1-JCH9-G2Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423892</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"505\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The News International All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News International</publicationName><volume>Vol. 30</volume><issueNumber>No. 27</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000268H</classCode><className>STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Islamabad</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

We're going to be talking -- they're talking about China, they're talking about Europe as well. Private equity, and private equity, that is a big, big topic for them, a big topic. Erik Schatzker is in Davos there with Roberto Quarta and David Novak, Partners at Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice. Erik.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Betty, thanks very much. You said it. They're with CD&amp;R, it's one of the oldest buy-out firms in the world, started in 1978. It's been doing private equity for a long time. Dave, Roberto, thank you very much. CD&amp;R has a reputation for avoiding the excesses of the buy-out business. I'd like to know what do you see as today's excesses, and how are you avoiding them?</p><p>ROBERTO QUARTA, PARTNER AND CHAIRMAN OF CD&amp;R EUROPE: Dave, do you want to take that or...?</p><p>DAVID NOVAK, MEMBER OF INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES, CD&amp;R: We think it's important to be focused on what you know versus what you don't know. Don't follow trends just because at a moment in time people think that's where you want to invest. For almost 40 years now we've only focused on businesses that we understand well, have operating partners in house who knew how to manage those businesses better, and we're going to keep sticking with that.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So what then runs the risk of being overly fashionable today?</p><p>QUARTA: Well, I don't know. I think it is changing, you know. And I think fashions come in and go out. And I think it's difficult to -- I mean we had the big tech...</p><p>SCHATZKER: Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUARTA: ...the big tech fashion, and you could (regulate) the luxury sector that was sort of changing. What we try to do is we're very focused in how we invest. And, and actually we're not a buy-out shop that needs to do lots of deals. We do three to five deals a year, and, and we do, we do it in such a way where we have experience and expertise. We do not invest in areas where we don't have that expertise, both on the financial side and on the operating side, which you know is very much the way we operate.</p><p>SCHATZKER: One of the things that is consistently fashionable in private equity is leverage. How much leverage do you feel comfortable putting on a transaction today? How many turns?</p><p>NOVAK: In truth it varies on the, on the transaction and the company. As you know, different companies and different industries have very different cash flow characteristics, different investment characteristics. So we've done deals in businesses in which we had a traditional highly-leveraged package, five, six times leverage.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Mm-hmm.</p><p>NOVAK: But there've been other businesses that we've invested which have been much lower, because the company and/or the deal didn't accommodate...</p><p>SCHATZKER: But is your inclination today to be more or less levered than you might have been in the past?</p><p>NOVAK: Without a doubt the inclination is slightly less lever today. But importantly it is the amount of leverage is one thing, but also the terms of that leverage.</p><p>SCHATZKER: How easy is it to get? We hear that, you know, we can see what's happening in the high-yield market. We hear that bank lending is beginning to freeze up, particularly on the leverage side. What do you see?</p><p>QUARTA: Well, that's only the case in the U.S. at the moment, and that mostly has to do with the sort of significant reduction in fund flows coming in because of oil and gas, revenues having come down significantly. Europe is still open and, David, I think you can comment on that.</p><p>NOVAK: Yes, we can still get some leverage in Europe, but it's a little tighter than it was.</p><p>SCHATZKER: I mean some firms, as you know, have had trouble.</p><p>QUARTA: Indeed.</p><p>SCHATZKER: (inaudible) they've had to sell finance of the credit side of the transaction.</p><p>QUARTA: But if you talk to some bankers, they will tell you that actually they've got some deals in the States that they can't, you know, offload and they're going to come over to Europe because they think there is a market for (certain)...</p><p>SCHATZKER: Well, there's appetite among European investors.</p><p>QUARTA: For certain types of deals. That's -- at least some of the bankers have been telling us.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Here's the thing. We live in a world of lower returns, right? So long as the benchmark lending rate is a quarter percentage point, and in Europe it's effectively negative. It's harder to generate returns over time. Does that make buying at the right price much more important?</p><p>QUARTA: I think we've learned that lesson over the years. You buy it right makes it a lot easier on exit. And if you over pay and at times, you know, people do stretch. You know, they think, well, this is strategic, this is really going to be something that makes an awful lot of sense, let's (pay) that bit more. But that bit more causes you to do an awful lot of work in order to get the sort of returns you're trying to get.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Well, you're still investing a fund you raised in 2013, and we haven't really seen a lot of public market leverage buyouts over the past couple of years. With the decline in stock prices and the reduction in valuations, is that going to get easier?</p><p>NOVAK: We definitely think that that's a trend that will grow. A lot of bankers are now are freshening up their analysis on what are the right premiums you need and what multiples. And, frankly, for us who are very industry-focused, we follow lots of companies in our specific industries, both public and private.</p><p>SCHATZKER: And what's attractive by industry right now? Where do you feel you want to commit capital?</p><p>NOVAK: In Europe we continue to like the European consumer. We think it's early days still in the European consumer recovery supported by low interest rates, low energy prices. They have more money in their pocket for example.</p><p>SCHATZKER: All right, gentlemen. I thank you very much.

We're going to be talking -- they're talking about China,  they're talking about Europe as well.  Private equity, and private equity,  that is a big, big topic for them, a big topic.  Erik Schatzker is in Davos  there with Roberto Quarta and David Novak, Partners at Clayton Dubilier &amp;  Rice.  Erik.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Betty, thanks very much.  You said it.  They're with CD&amp;R, it's  one of the oldest buy-out firms in the world, started in 1978.  It's been  doing private equity for a long time.  Dave, Roberto, thank you very much.   CD&amp;R has a reputation for avoiding the excesses of the buy-out business.  I'd like to know what do you see as today's excesses, and how are you  avoiding them?</p><p>ROBERTO QUARTA, PARTNER AND CHAIRMAN OF CD&amp;R EUROPE:  Dave, do you want to  take that or...?</p><p>DAVID NOVAK, MEMBER OF INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES, CD&amp;R:  We  think it's important to be focused on what you know versus what you don't  know.  Don't follow trends just because at a moment in time people think  that's where you want to invest.  For almost 40 years now we've only  focused on businesses that we understand well, have operating partners in  house who knew how to manage those businesses better, and we're going to  keep sticking with that.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  So what then runs the risk of being overly fashionable today?</p><p>QUARTA:  Well, I don't know.  I think it is changing, you know.  And I  think fashions come in and go out.  And I think it's difficult to -- I mean  we had the big tech...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUARTA:  ...the big tech fashion, and you could (regulate) the luxury  sector that was sort of changing.  What we try to do is we're very focused  in how we invest.  And, and actually we're not a buy-out shop that needs to  do lots of deals.  We do three to five deals a year, and, and we do, we do  it in such a way where we have experience and expertise.  We do not invest  in areas where we don't have that expertise, both on the financial side and  on the operating side, which you know is very much the way we operate.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  One of the things that is consistently fashionable in private  equity is leverage.  How much leverage do you feel comfortable putting on a  transaction today?  How many turns?</p><p>NOVAK:  In truth it varies on the, on the transaction and the company.  As  you know, different companies and different industries have very different  cash flow characteristics, different investment characteristics.  So we've  done deals in businesses in which we had a traditional highly-leveraged  package, five, six times leverage.  </p><p>SCHATZKER:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>NOVAK:  But there've been other businesses that we've invested which have  been much lower, because the company and/or the deal didn't accommodate...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  But is your inclination today to be more or less levered than  you might have been in the past?</p><p>NOVAK:  Without a doubt the inclination is slightly less lever today.  But  importantly it is the amount of leverage is one thing, but also the terms  of that leverage.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  How easy is it to get?  We hear that, you know, we can see  what's happening in the high-yield market.  We hear that bank lending is  beginning to freeze up, particularly on the leverage side.  What do you  see?</p><p>QUARTA:  Well, that's only the case in the U.S. at the moment, and that  mostly has to do with the sort of significant reduction in fund flows  coming in because of oil and gas, revenues having come down significantly.   Europe is still open and, David, I think you can comment on that.</p><p>NOVAK:  Yes, we can still get some leverage in Europe, but it's a little  tighter than it was.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  I mean some firms, as you know, have had trouble.</p><p>QUARTA:  Indeed.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  (inaudible) they've had to sell finance of the credit side of  the transaction.</p><p>QUARTA:  But if you talk to some bankers, they will tell you that actually  they've got some deals in the States that they can't, you know, offload and  they're going to come over to Europe because they think there is a market  for (certain)...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Well, there's appetite among European investors.</p><p>QUARTA:  For certain types of deals.  That's -- at least some of the  bankers have been telling us.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Here's the thing.  We live in a world of lower returns, right?   So long as the benchmark lending rate is a quarter percentage point, and in  Europe it's effectively negative.  It's harder to generate returns over  time.  Does that make buying at the right price much more important?</p><p>QUARTA:  I think we've learned that lesson over the years.  You buy it  right makes it a lot easier on exit.  And if you over pay and at times, you  know, people do stretch.  You know, they think, well, this is strategic,  this is really going to be something that makes an awful lot of sense,  let's (pay) that bit more.  But that bit more causes you to do an awful lot  of work in order to get the sort of returns you're trying to get.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Well, you're still investing a fund you raised in 2013, and we  haven't really seen a lot of public market leverage buyouts over the past  couple of years.  With the decline in stock prices and the reduction in  valuations, is that going to get easier?</p><p>NOVAK:  We definitely think that that's a trend that will grow.  A lot of  bankers are now are freshening up their analysis on what are the right  premiums you need and what multiples.  And, frankly, for us who are very  industry-focused, we follow lots of companies in our specific industries,  both public and private. </p><p>SCHATZKER:  And what's attractive by industry right now?  Where do you feel  you want to commit capital?</p><p>NOVAK:  In Europe we continue to like the European consumer.  We think it's  early days still in the European consumer recovery supported by low  interest rates, low energy prices.  They have more money in their pocket  for example.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  All right, gentlemen.  I thank you very much. Good to see you  here.</p><p>QUARTA:  Nice to see you. </p><p>SCHATZKER:  Betty, that is Roberto Quarta and David Novak of Clayton  Dubilier &amp; Rice, here at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Don't follow trends just because at a moment in time people think that's where you want to invest. For almost 40 years now we've only focused on businesses that we understand well, have operating partners in house who knew how to manage those businesses better, and we're going to keep sticking with that.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So what then runs the risk of being overly fashionable today?</p><p>QUARTA: Well, I don't know. I think it is changing, you know. And I think fashions come in and go out. And I think it's difficult to -- I mean we had the big tech...</p><p>SCHATZKER: Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUARTA: ...the big tech fashion, and you could (regulate) the luxury sector that was sort of changing. What we try to do is we're very focused in how we invest. And, and actually we're not a buy-out shop that needs to do lots of deals. We do three to five deals a year, and, and we do, we do it in such a way where we have experience and expertise. We do not invest in areas where we don't have that expertise, both on the financial side and on the operating side, which you know is very much the way we operate.</p><p>SCHATZKER: One of the things that is consistently fashionable in private equity is leverage. How much leverage do you feel comfortable putting on a transaction today? How many turns?</p><p>NOVAK: In truth it varies on the, on the transaction and the company. As you know, different companies and different industries have very different cash flow characteristics, different investment characteristics. So we've done deals in businesses in which we had a traditional highly-leveraged package, five, six times leverage.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Mm-hmm.</p><p>NOVAK: But there've been other businesses that we've invested which have been much lower, because the company and/or the deal didn't accommodate...</p><p>SCHATZKER: But is your inclination today to be more or less levered than you might have been in the past?</p><p>NOVAK: Without a doubt the inclination is slightly less lever today. But importantly it is the amount of leverage is one thing, but also the terms of that leverage.</p><p>SCHATZKER: How easy is it to get? We hear that, you know, we can see what's happening in the high-yield market. We hear that bank lending is beginning to freeze up, particularly on the leverage side. What do you see?</p><p>QUARTA: Well, that's only the case in the U.S. at the moment, and that mostly has to do with the sort of significant reduction in fund flows coming in because of oil and gas, revenues having come down significantly. Europe is still open and, David, I think you can comment on that.</p><p>NOVAK: Yes, we can still get some leverage in Europe, but it's a little tighter than it was.</p><p>SCHATZKER: I mean some firms, as you know, have had trouble.</p><p>QUARTA: Indeed.</p><p>SCHATZKER: (inaudible) they've had to sell finance of the credit side of the transaction.</p><p>QUARTA: But if you talk to some bankers, they will tell you that actually they've got some deals in the States that they can't, you know, offload and they're going to come over to Europe because they think there is a market for (certain)...</p><p>SCHATZKER: Well, there's appetite among European investors.</p><p>QUARTA: For certain types of deals. That's -- at least some of the bankers have been telling us.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Here's the thing. We live in a world of lower returns, right? So long as the benchmark lending rate is a quarter percentage point, and in Europe it's effectively negative. It's harder to generate returns over time. Does that make buying at the right price much more important?</p><p>QUARTA: I think we've learned that lesson over the years. You buy it right makes it a lot easier on exit. And if you over pay and at times, you know, people do stretch. You know, they think, well, this is strategic, this is really going to be something that makes an awful lot of sense, let's (pay) that bit more. But that bit more causes you to do an awful lot of work in order to get the sort of returns you're trying to get.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Well, you're still investing a fund you raised in 2013, and we haven't really seen a lot of public market leverage buyouts over the past couple of years. With the decline in stock prices and the reduction in valuations, is that going to get easier?</p><p>NOVAK: We definitely think that that's a trend that will grow. A lot of bankers are now are freshening up their analysis on what are the right premiums you need and what multiples. And, frankly, for us who are very industry-focused, we follow lots of companies in our specific industries, both public and private.</p><p>SCHATZKER: And what's attractive by industry right now? Where do you feel you want to commit capital?</p><p>NOVAK: In Europe we continue to like the European consumer. We think it's early days still in the European consumer recovery supported by low interest rates, low energy prices. They have more money in their pocket for example.</p><p>SCHATZKER: All right, gentlemen. I thank you very much. Good to see you here.</p><p>QUARTA: Nice to see you.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Betty, that is Roberto Quarta and David Novak of Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, here at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

We're going to be talking -- they're talking about China, they're talking about Europe as well. Private equity, and private equity, that is a big, big topic for them, a big topic. Erik Schatzker is in Davos there with Roberto Quarta and David Novak, Partners at Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice. Erik.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Betty, thanks very much. You said it. They're with CD&amp;R, it's one of the oldest buy-out firms in the world, started in 1978. It's been doing private equity for a long time. Dave, Roberto, thank you very much. CD&amp;R has a reputation for avoiding the excesses of the buy-out business.

We're going to be talking -- they're talking about China, they're talking about Europe as well. Private equity, and private equity, that is a big, big topic for them, a big topic. Erik Schatzker is in Davos there with Roberto Quarta and David Novak, Partners at Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice. Erik.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: Betty, thanks very much. You said it. They're with CD&amp;R, it's one of the oldest buy-out firms in the world, started in 1978. It's been doing private equity for a long time. Dave, Roberto, thank you very much. CD&amp;R has a reputation for avoiding the excesses of the buy-out business. I'd like to know what do you see as today's excesses, and how are you avoiding them?</p><p/><p>ROBERTO QUARTA, PARTNER AND CHAIRMAN OF CD&amp;R EUROPE: Dave, do you want to take that or...?</p><p/><p>DAVID NOVAK, MEMBER OF INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES, CD&amp;R: We think it's important to be focused on what you know versus what you don't know. Don't follow trends just because at a moment in time people think that's where you want to invest. For almost 40 years now we've only focused on businesses that we understand well, have operating partners in house who knew how to manage those businesses better, and we're going to keep sticking with that.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: So what then runs the risk of being overly fashionable today?</p><p/><p>QUARTA: Well, I don't know. I think it is changing, you know. And I think fashions come in and go out. And I think it's difficult to -- I mean we had the big tech...</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: Mm-hmm.</p><p/><p>QUARTA: ...the big tech fashion, and you could (regulate) the luxury sector that was sort of changing. What we try to do is we're very focused in how we invest. And, and actually we're not a buy-out shop that needs to do lots of deals. We do three to five deals a year, and, and we do, we do it in such a way where we have experience and expertise. We do not invest in areas where we don't have that expertise, both on the financial side and on the operating side, which you know is very much the way we operate.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: One of the things that is consistently fashionable in private equity is leverage. How much leverage do you feel comfortable putting on a transaction today? How many turns?</p><p/><p>NOVAK: In truth it varies on the, on the transaction and the company. As you know, different companies and different industries have very different cash flow characteristics, different investment characteristics. So we've done deals in businesses in which we had a traditional highly-leveraged package, five, six times leverage.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: Mm-hmm.</p><p/><p>NOVAK: But there've been other businesses that we've invested which have been much lower, because the company and/or the deal didn't accommodate...</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: But is your inclination today to be more or less levered than you might have been in the past?</p><p/><p>NOVAK: Without a doubt the inclination is slightly less lever today. But importantly it is the amount of leverage is one thing, but also the terms of that leverage.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: How easy is it to get? We hear that, you know, we can see what's happening in the high-yield market. We hear that bank lending is beginning to freeze up, particularly on the leverage side. What do you see?</p><p/><p>QUARTA: Well, that's only the case in the U.S. at the moment, and that mostly has to do with the sort of significant reduction in fund flows coming in because of oil and gas, revenues having come down significantly. Europe is still open and, David, I think you can comment on that.</p><p/><p>NOVAK: Yes, we can still get some leverage in Europe, but it's a little tighter than it was.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: I mean some firms, as you know, have had trouble.</p><p/><p>QUARTA: Indeed.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: (inaudible) they've had to sell finance of the credit side of the transaction.</p><p/><p>QUARTA: But if you talk to some bankers, they will tell you that actually they've got some deals in the States that they can't, you know, offload and they're going to come over to Europe because they think there is a market for (certain)...</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: Well, there's appetite among European investors.</p><p/><p>QUARTA: For certain types of deals. That's -- at least some of the bankers have been telling us.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: Here's the thing. We live in a world of lower returns, right? So long as the benchmark lending rate is a quarter percentage point, and in Europe it's effectively negative. It's harder to generate returns over time. Does that make buying at the right price much more important?</p><p/><p>QUARTA: I think we've learned that lesson over the years. You buy it right makes it a lot easier on exit. And if you over pay and at times, you know, people do stretch. You know, they think, well, this is strategic, this is really going to be something that makes an awful lot of sense, let's (pay) that bit more. But that bit more causes you to do an awful lot of work in order to get the sort of returns you're trying to get.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: Well, you're still investing a fund you raised in 2013, and we haven't really seen a lot of public market leverage buyouts over the past couple of years. With the decline in stock prices and the reduction in valuations, is that going to get easier?</p><p/><p>NOVAK: We definitely think that that's a trend that will grow. A lot of bankers are now are freshening up their analysis on what are the right premiums you need and what multiples. And, frankly, for us who are very industry-focused, we follow lots of companies in our specific industries, both public and private.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: And what's attractive by industry right now? Where do you feel you want to commit capital?</p><p/><p>NOVAK: In Europe we continue to like the European consumer. We think it's early days still in the European consumer recovery supported by low interest rates, low energy prices. They have more money in their pocket for example.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: All right, gentlemen. I thank you very much. Good to see you here.</p><p/><p>QUARTA: Nice to see you.</p><p/><p>SCHATZKER: Betty, that is Roberto Quarta and David Novak of Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, here at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p/><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p/><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

In the aftermath of the EO being issued I know some people wondered if it was actually worth suing over, since it actually did so little in practice. But, as I discussed in this week's podcast[3], it can still be used to create havoc. The basic argument in the lawsuit is that the executive order is clearly retaliatory against Twitter for its 1st Amendment protected speech in fact-checking the President, and thus violates the 1st Amendment:A private company engaged in constitutionally protected speech on its own online platform by including a label on President Trump's tweets on May 26, 2020, and linking to information regarding the subject matter of President Trump's tweet, thereby expressing its viewpoint and adding to the discourse on its platform regarding the subject matter of the President's tweets. Two days later and after a series of public attacks directly focused on the company's exercise of free speech, President Trump retaliated on May 28, 2020, by issuing the 'Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship,' expressly mentioning the company by name six times. </p><p>The company's constitutionally protected speech was the proximate or 'but for' cause of President Trump issuance of the Executive Order. President Trump also issued the Executive Order to pressure the company into removing its constitutionally protected speech from its online platform and to coerce other Internet intermediaries into refraining from similar constitutionally protected speech on their own platforms, and into prohibiting such speech by their users, in the future. President Trump's retaliatory acts would deter a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in First Amendment speech and activity. The Executive Order was intended to have, and is having or is likely to have, the effect of chilling the constitutionally protected speech of online content platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube that were explicitly named in the Executive Order.... The Executive Order seeks to curtail and chill the constitutionally protected speech of all online platforms and individuals\u2014by demonstrating the willingness to use government authority to retaliate against those who criticize the government.The complaint goes into great detail as to why this is obviously retaliatory, laying out the timeline:Twitter did not remove the President's tweets about mail-in voting. Those tweets remain available to the public. Instead, Twitter provided more information regarding the subject matter of the President's tweet. In response, on May 26, 2020, the President tweeted '@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post . . . .' 'Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!' [....] On May 27, 2020, the President tweeted at 7:11 a.m ., 'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that . . . happen again.' 'Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!' The President continued his targeted attacks by tweeting at 10:22 a.m., 'Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow!' At 9:36 p.m., he followed up by tweeting, 'Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!' On May 27, 2020, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, appearing on 'Fox &amp;#38; Friends,' spelled out the Twitter handle for Twitter's head of Site Integrity (a 'handle' is the means of identifying a specific individual via Twitter) and said, 'somebody in San Francisco will wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers. This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it.' The handle for Twitter's head of Site Integrity is '@[y*****].' At 10:47 p.m . on May 27, 2020, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey stated on Twitter that he personally took responsibility for the decision to add a label to Trump's tweets, adding, 'Please leave our employees out of this.' On May 28, 2020, the President retweeted Rep. Elise Stefanik's tweet: 'Thanks for the clarification @jack[.] This makes YOU accountable for allowing the Chinese Communist Party to abuse this site with mis-information &amp;#38; propaganda spread across the globe - all while the CCP bans and suppresses their own people from using Twitter!' Later that morning, at 8:37 a.m ., President Trump tweeted, 'This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!' At 12:44 p.m. he continued, 'So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid, there are examples, &amp;#38; cases, all over the place. Our election process will become badly tainted &amp;#38; a laughingstock all over the World. Tell that to your hater '@[y*****].'There's more in the complaint on Trump's retaliatory efforts, including examples of him retaliating against companies in the past as well. One question I was concerned about was whether or not CDT actually would have standing to bring this lawsuit, since it's not an interactive computer service, as targeted by the complaint. CDT argues that it has standing due to its efforts to fight for free speech online, which the order will likely impact:CDT is a nonprofit advocacy organization that works to ensure that the human rights people enjoy in the physical world, like freedom of speech, are realized online and that technology continues to serve as an empowering force for people worldwide. Integral to this work is CDT's representation of the public interest in the creation of an open, innovative, and decentralized Internet that promotes the constitutional and democratic values of free expression, privacy, and individual liberty. Critical to CDT's mission is advocating in favor of First Amendment protection for speech on the Internet. To that end, among other things, CDT has participated in a number of cases addressing First Amendment rights and the Internet, including as litigants in CDT v. Pappert, 337 F. Supp. 2d 606, 646, 649-63 (E.D . Pa. 2004) (striking down as unconstitutional a statute that imposed criminal liability on Internet service providers who failed to comply with requests issued by the Pennsylvania Attorney General to block access to websites containing child pornography); challenging, as part of a broad coalition, key portions of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) in Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997) (striking down portions of the CDA prohibiting transmission of obscene or indecent communications to persons under Age 18 as a content-based blanket restrictions on speech and facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment); and as amicus curiae in First Amendment challenges including Backpage.com, L.L.C., v. Dart, 807 F.3d 229 (7th Cir. 2016) (holding campaign by sheriff's office to pressure pressuring financial intermediaries to cease payment processing for online classified advertising website to be an unconstitutional prior restraint) (See ECF Nos. 29, 34, 35, and 37, No. 15-3047 (7th Cir.)).; CDT has been deeply engaged in law and policy advocacy regarding intermediary liability frameworks, free speech, and content moderation since the organization was founded in 1994. The organization devotes significant resources to advocating in favor of individuals' online free expression rights and the legal frameworks that support them, including evaluating proposals to amend the proposed laws on free speech online and challenging legislation that burdens individuals' fundamental rights, holding public events, and communicating with policy makers in the Executive and Legislative Branches. The Executive Order injures Plaintiff CDT by infringing on its interests, including its interests in enhancing freedom of expression, preserving the unique nature of the Internet, and limiting government surveillance, and by causing Plaintiff CDT to divert resources to safeguarding the principles underlying the First Amendment, 47 U.S.C.  230, and the free speech rights of online content platforms and individuals that the Executive Order places under attack. As a result of the Executive Order, CDT will be required to devote substantial resources to (a) participating in the planned FCC rulemaking proceeding; (b) monitoring federal agencies' reports regarding and any action by the Department of Justice; (c) tracking any FTC action with respect to online speech, and participating in any proceedings that the Commission institutes; (d) engaging with federal and state policymakers with respect to the development of proposed legislation\u2014as well as informing the public about all of these activities and the potential consequences for protection of free speech online. These activities will be time-consuming and resource-intensive, and will require CDT to reallocate resources that it planned to use for other activities furthering its mission.I don't know if this will be enough to convince the court, but I hope it is. CDT has been on the frontlines of so many lawsuits defending free speech on the internet, with many success stories behind it. Hopefully this is another one.

Pourquoi\u00a0?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nicolas Rieul.</emphasis> Nous avons choisi ce th\u00e8me car la d\u00e9mocratisation du mobile, aujourd'hui omnipr\u00e9sent, en fait un v\u00e9ritable levier de transformation des marques, qu'on parle de marketing ou de business. C'est le premier \u00e9cran en termes de temps pass\u00e9 comme d'investissements publicitaires sur le digital.\u00a0C'est vraiment le device qui disrupte l'exp\u00e9rience utilisateur aujourd'hui, en magasin comme sur le Web. On le voit chez les retailers qui ont pour enjeu de proposer une exp\u00e9rience sans couture entre les diff\u00e9rents points de contact avec le consommateur. Le mobile est toujours pr\u00e9sent d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre\u00a0: pour passer la commande, pour recevoir une notification de disponibilit\u00e9 produit ou pour venir r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ce dernier dans une d\u00e9marche de click and collect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comment allez-vous aborder ces enjeux de performance et d'exp\u00e9rience utilisateur\u00a0?</emphasis></p><p>Comme chaque ann\u00e9e, via des keynotes et des tables-rondes. Le sp\u00e9cialiste du marketing mobile Ogury viendra \u00e9voquer la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un marketing digital pilot\u00e9 par le choix de l'utilisateur dans le cadre d'une keynote. Deux tables-rondes, une premi\u00e8re consacr\u00e9e au d\u00e9fi de l'attribution et de la mesure de l'activit\u00e9 in-app, une autre consacr\u00e9e au r\u00e9engagement in-app, creuseront ce th\u00e8me. LeBoncoin, Google, Renault, la SNCF et Pierre et Vacances viendront, eux, \u00e9voquer l'importance de b\u00e2tir une exp\u00e9rience consommateur mobile first. On aura \u00e9galement une keynote du directeur marketing de Snap France qui expliquera comment la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e r\u00e9invente l'exp\u00e9rience publicitaire.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quoi de neuf cette ann\u00e9e\u00a0?</emphasis></p><p>La principale nouveaut\u00e9, c'est qu'on ne parle plus uniquement de business mais qu'on traite aussi les sujets r\u00e9glementaires. C'est un symbole de l'\u00e9volution de la Mobile Marketing Association France qui veut se positionner sur ce type de sujets strat\u00e9giques. Qu'il s'agisse de souligner la d\u00e9pendance de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me aux deux OS ultra dominants, IOS et Android, ou de nourrir les discussions sur le sujet de la privacy, en pr\u00e9vision de l'arriv\u00e9e du r\u00e8glement d\u00e9di\u00e9, dont l'adoption est pr\u00e9vue pour 2020. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous nous f\u00e9licitons de la pr\u00e9sence du patron de l'Arcep, S\u00e9bastien Soriano, qui viendra \u00e9voquer les r\u00e9gulations n\u00e9cessaires pour g\u00e9rer les Big Tech.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quelle place pour les annonceurs\u00a0?</emphasis></p><p>On esp\u00e8re que, comme chaque ann\u00e9e, ils ressortiront de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement avec une expertise marketing mobile plus pointue. On leur consacre d'ailleurs deux tables-rondes l'apr\u00e8s-midi. La premi\u00e8re traitera de l'\u00e9mergence du retail media, en compagnie d'iProspect et de relevanC. Des responsables m\u00e9dias de Danone et Seb \u00e9voqueront leurs enjeux e-commerce. La seconde s'attellera \u00e0 d\u00e9coder le drive to store, en pr\u00e9sence du DG France de S4M, Dominique Blanc, et de deux repr\u00e9sentants d'Intersport et Petit Bateau.</p><p>Pour s'inscrire au MMA Forum 2019</p><p>Nicolas Rieul est le pr\u00e9sident de la\u00a0Mobile Marketing Association France et directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Criteo France.

The tech newsletter comes to you this week from Washington, where I'm filling in for Kevin, who is allegedly off the grid and on vacation. (Hmmm. If that's true, why is there a ''K-Roo'' doing marathon sessions of Fortnite?) </p><p>  With so much focus on tech about regulation these days, we're dedicating this edition to the intersection of Silicon Valley and government. There is a lot of action on that front in Europe -- and, as Adam Satariano writes, the effects of Europe's aggressive stance toward tech are rippling across the globe.</p><p>  On Friday, Europe's strict new privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, went into effect. This is somewhat complicated stuff, so do yourself a favor and read this simple explainer on the new rules. Next, be smart and make sure to read the many notices you are getting from companies, as our tech columnist Brian X. Chen suggests. The emails say different things: Some explicitly ask for permission to keep collecting data, while others are more quietly saying they that if you keep using their app, consider your data collected. Natasha Singer and Prashant Rao show how hard it is for Americans to know what data is collected on them compared with British citizens.</p><p>  Also this past week, Facebook's chief executive, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>appeared before European lawmakers in Brussels. He managed again to avoid answering several tough questions, to the irritation of several government officials.</p><p>Facebook is now following a tight script in public, apologizing for past mistakes and promising to do better on privacy. But the most interesting part of Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>appearance was how European lawmakers were talking about the social media site. One German official called it a monopoly, and another official wondered if the company needed to be broken up.</p><p>  While many officials, especially in the United States, have focused on Facebook's privacy violations and foreign interference on the platform during the 2016 presidential election, there is a growing spotlight on antitrust. Consumer groups in the United States and lawmakers in Europe have called into question the company's power and size.</p><p>  There is another potential problem for the company, too. The critique that Facebook isn't a neutral platform and is looking more like a media company is not going away. If viewed as a media company, Facebook would be subject to a greater risk of liability.</p><p>  Here in the United States, there was interesting news on Wednesday in a case involving <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and his favorite communications platform, Twitter. A federal judge ruled that the president can no longer block Twitter users, saying that doing so violates the First Amendment.</p><p>  (Speaking of Twitter, here is a tip on people to follow: the new members of the Federal Trade Commission, including the chairman, Joseph J. Simons, who have set up accounts. The commission will decide on pivotal Silicon Valley's cases, including an investigation into Facebook's violation of privacy policies, and antitrust concerns about Google and other big tech companies. Just don't expect them to tweet-rant like Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and chief executive of Tesla, who had a 19-hour tear against the media.)</p><p>  Also in the United States, tech and media mergers are again in the spotlight, with Comcast making public its intention to buy Fox. This sets Comcast up for a battle royale against Disney, which is also trying to bulk up by merging with Fox. How this all turns out may well be influenced by a court decision on June 12 over the Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner. That merger looks, in many ways, like Comcast's bid for Fox -- a merger of a telecom giant with a media giant. My Los Angeles-based colleague, Brooks Barnes, explains how these things are all connected and the deeply fascinating and bloody battle ahead in Disney and Comcast's war over Fox.</p><p>  Here are two other news developments worth watching:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Tech companies and law enforcement are notoriously at odds over data, but Amazon doesn't appear to feel the friction. It has been offering its facial recognition software to police agencies, according to an article by Nick Wingfield. Privacy and civil liberties groups are angry.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 It appears that the police have been inflating their problem with getting into iPhones. According to The Washington Post, the F.B.I. had been telling Congress and other government officials that it was unable to get into about 7,800 encrypted iPhones that may have held evidence in criminal investigations. The real number appears to be fewer than 2,000 phones.</p><p>  Cecilia Kang is the Washington technology correspondent for The Times.

But the most interesting part of Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s appearance was how European lawmakers were talking about the social media site. One German official called it a monopoly, and another official wondered if the company needed to be broken up.</p><p>While many officials, especially in the United States, have focused on Facebook\u2019s privacy violations and foreign interference on the platform during the 2016 presidential election, there is a growing spotlight on antitrust.

This sets Comcast up for a battle royale against Disney, which is also trying to bulk up by merging with Fox. How this all turns out may well be influenced by a court decision on June 12 over the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&amp;T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner. That merger looks, in many ways, like Comcast\u2019s bid for Fox \u2014 a merger of a telecom giant with a media giant.

The real number appears to be fewer than 2,000 phones.</p><p>Cecilia Kang is the Washington technology correspondent for The Times.

His term will focus on the setting of global standards and the uptake of Artificial Intelligence.Succeeding in this role Dr Roland Feichtl, Dr Hans-Martin Schneeberger has been entrusted with the responsibility of leading the European Association that represents more than a third of the world machine tool (MT) production.In a highly competitive and uncertain global market, CECIMO and its members have to convey, to both the national and European institutions, the clear message that industry is vital for the future development of Europe. \u201cThe machine tool sector\u201d he said \u201ccan contribute to the health of the European industry by shaping the next EU regulatory initiatives and policies\u201d. Given that the world is evolving around three dimensions of sustainability (sustainability of economy, environment and society), CECIMO can play a crucial role in today\u2019s challenges like circular economy and digitalisation. We can help defining standards on new technologies based on our values and ethics, such is the case of Artificial Intelligence. \u201cEurope must lead the race on global standards at the international level, so that our regulations set the example for others to come\u201d.The new President made also clear that the European Institutions should value the role of industries like ours in drafting pivotal dossiers. On Artificial Intelligence, the EU representatives should broaden their view and value different perspectives, not only the one of big tech companies. \u201cIn many cases, these companies are suppliers to our Industry, while we are the customers and therefore users. So why should the European Commission discuss relevant issues exclusively with the suppliers if they can have a well-founded discussion with the users?\u201d. Under his presidency, CECIMO will be committed to be the voice of manufacturing in the definition of the digital single market.The priorities of Dr Schneeberger are in line with the project of the next European Commission. Among others, Europe wants to set the right environment for digital networks and services to thrive and strengthen itself as responsible global leader. CECIMO will follow closely all the dossiers on the table, such as cybersecurity, trade agreements and Intellectual Property Rights, where we can give a valuable input.Who is Dr Hans-Martin Schneeberger?Dr Hans-Martin Schneeberger is a Swiss citizen born on 14 May 1955.Dr Schneeberger has been serving as Chairman of the board of directors of Schneeberger Holding AG since 2003.
